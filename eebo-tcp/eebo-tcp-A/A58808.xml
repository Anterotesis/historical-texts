            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>1 JOHN V.3.</bibl>
               <q>For this is the love of God, that we keep his Commandments; and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the first Verse the <hi>Apostle</hi> asserts, that <hi>whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ,</hi> that is, so believes as to act suitable to his Belief, <hi>is born of God</hi>; he is become a Child of <hi>God</hi> by partaking of his Nature, and stamped with his Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and <hi>every one that loveth him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat,</hi> i. e. <hi>God</hi> his <hi>Heavenly</hi> Father, <hi>loveth him also that is begotten of him,</hi> hath a true hearty Kindness for all that are God's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And then in the second Verse, <hi>by this,</hi> saith he, <hi>we know that we love the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> and consequently that we are <hi>born of God, if we love God and keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>; that is, if we <hi>so</hi> love him as to keep his Commandments. And indeed, if we do not <hi>so</hi> love him, we do not love him at all, and consequently we do not love his Children, nor are we his Children our selves; of which he gives a full Proof in the Text; <hi>for this is the love of God, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59595:5"/>
we keep his Commandments; and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Words, you have First an Account of the Love of <hi>God,</hi> what it is; <hi>This is the love of God, that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> and Secondly, a Motive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us to the Practice of it, <hi>and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the first of these, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Love of <hi>God,</hi> what it is; <hi>This is the Love of God, that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> By the Love of <hi>God</hi> here we are not to understand God's Love to us, but our Love to <hi>God,</hi> as is plain by this, because 'tis placed in our keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. This is the Love of <hi>God,</hi> that is, this is the <hi>natural</hi> Effect and <hi>proper</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of the Love of <hi>God</hi>; for it is certain that keeping God's Commandments is not the Affection of Love to him, but the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it. So that the Meaning of the Words is this, this is the most <hi>genuine</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and <hi>inseparable</hi> Effect of our Love of <hi>God,</hi> that we obey his Laws. And hence our <hi>Saviour</hi> makes this the <hi>proper</hi> Tryal and Proof of our Love to him, <hi>If ye love me, keep my Commandments,</hi> John xiv.15. for this he tells us, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. is the <hi>necessary</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of our Love to him; <hi>If any man love me, he will keep my words,</hi> i. e. this will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59595:5"/>
most certainly be the Effect of his Love to me, that he will be obedient to my Will. And by this he plainly tells us he will judge of the Sincerity of our Friendship to him, <hi>John</hi> xv.14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I command you.</hi> From all which it is evident, that the most <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteristical</hi> Expression of our Love to <hi>God,</hi> is our keeping his Commandments. And indeed considering that <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> Lawgiver, there are no Actions by which we can so naturally express our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, as by those of Obedience and Submission to his Laws; and therefore we find in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that to <hi>love God,</hi> and obey his Laws, and to <hi>hate God</hi> and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them, are generally used promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously for one another, and that for very good reason; for here our Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of <hi>God</hi> are not considered as conversant about God as God (in which sense perhaps there is no Creature in the World can be said to hate him) but as conversant about him as <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the World; as he gives Laws to Mankind, whereby he commands them what to do, and forbids them what to avoid. And in this Sense, to love <hi>God</hi> is to love him as <hi>Governing</hi> and <hi>Commanding,</hi> and as such, we can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise express our Love to him, but by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59595:6"/>
keeping his Commandments. But for the farther clearing of this, I shall in Prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Argument do these two Things:
<list>
                  <item>I. Shew you that wheresoever the Love of <hi>God</hi> is, it will most certainly prove a <hi>Principle</hi> of Obedience to him.</item>
                  <item>II. That the Love of <hi>God</hi> is in it self the most <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>effectual</hi> Principle of Obedience.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That wheresoever the Love of <hi>God</hi> is, it will most certainly prove a <hi>Principle</hi> of Obedience to him. And this, I doubt not, will evidently appear, if we consider that all the <hi>natural</hi> Expressions of our Love, as it is terminated upon <hi>God,</hi> do of their own accord finally resolve themselves into Obedience to his Will. For Love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>sincere,</hi> always expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses it self in such <hi>Symptoms</hi> as these;</p>
            <p n="1">1. In industriously endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the <hi>Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In conforming the <hi>Will, Designs,</hi> and <hi>Intentions,</hi> to the Will, and Designs, and Intentions of the <hi>Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In a <hi>solicitous</hi> Care of avoiding those Things which may any ways displease or distaste the <hi>Beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In a <hi>chearful</hi> Readiness to undergo any thing, be it never so <hi>hard</hi> or <hi>difficult,</hi> for the sake of the <hi>Beloved.</hi> All which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59595:6"/>
Expressions of our Love, when it is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated upon <hi>God,</hi> do most naturally run into Obedience to his Will.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we love <hi>God,</hi> our Love will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it self in endeavouring to resemble him. For every Man esteems what he loves to be lovely, and we naturally wish that <hi>that</hi> were in our selves which we esteem to be lovely in <hi>another</hi>; that so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like him, we may appear as lovely in <hi>his</hi> Eyes as he doth in <hi>ours.</hi> And so if we love <hi>God,</hi> we must necessarily esteem him exceeding lovely and amiable, and that which we esteem and love as lovely in him, we cannot but wish for and desire in our selves out of a <hi>natural</hi> Affectation of Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness: And that he may have the same Reason to love us as we have to love him, we must needs desire to resemble him in all those <hi>amiable</hi> Things that do endear him to us. But now those Beauties in <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all of them only <hi>moral,</hi> which are the <hi>immediate</hi> Objects of our Love to him, are capable of being transcribed by Imitation, and made ours by <hi>copying</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> after them in our Actions; so that if we hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire to partake of them, our Desire will necessarily engage us to imitate them; for how can we be said heartily to desire that <hi>Good</hi> which we may have, but will
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59595:7"/>
take no Care to acquire? I confess, did we love him for his <hi>Eternity,</hi> or his <hi>Power,</hi> or his <hi>Immensity,</hi> we might wish to be like him, but all in vain; because in these Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections we are not capable of imitating him: But the Beauties for which we love him, are his <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and the like; all which being <hi>imitable</hi> by us, we may, if we please, derive into our selves, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe into <hi>our own</hi> Natures. So that if we love <hi>God,</hi> we must necessarily desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him in those Things for which we love him; and those things being all of an <hi>imitable</hi> nature, our Desire of resembling him will oblige and excite us to a <hi>careful</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> Imitation of him. But now to obey <hi>God,</hi> and to imitate him in those <hi>Moral Perfections</hi> for which we love him, are one and the same thing. Thus when I obey <hi>God</hi> in being universally <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> towards himself and all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I imitate him in that <hi>essential</hi> Justice and Equity of his Nature, which is the <hi>eternal</hi> Rule of all his Actions. When I obey him in <hi>doing good</hi> to all that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Reach of my Charity, I imitate him in the <hi>overflowing</hi> Bounty and <hi>unlimited</hi> Goodness of his Nature. In a word, when I obey him in forgiving those that injure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59595:7"/>
me, I imitate him in his <hi>boundless</hi> Mercy, and Readiness to forgive Offenders. And in fine, all our Obedience is comprehended in being <hi>pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy</hi>; in being <hi>good</hi> as he is <hi>good, just</hi> as he is <hi>just, merciful</hi> as he is <hi>merciful:</hi> For though the Acts and Expressions of these <hi>Moral Perfections</hi> in us are in many Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces different from what they are in <hi>God,</hi> by reason of that Difference of <hi>Natures, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> that there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and us; yet the Perfections in <hi>general</hi> are of the same kind in him and us, though the <hi>particular</hi> Expressions of them are various by reason of those <hi>accidental</hi> Differences. For though he doth not do all those <hi>particular</hi> Actions which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, and consequently we in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those Actions cannot be said to imitate the same Actions in <hi>God</hi>; yet we imitate <hi>God</hi> in the general, in doing those Actions which he himself would have done, had he had our Natures, and been in our Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Circumstances. Thus <hi>God</hi> doth not pray, because he hath none <hi>superior</hi> to him; nor humble himself, because he is infinitely <hi>great</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi>; nor practise <hi>Chastity</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> because he is a <hi>pure Spirit,</hi> and hath no Commerce with <hi>bodily</hi> Affections; and consequently we in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59595:8"/>
doing of these Actions cannot be said to imitate the same Actions in <hi>God,</hi> because he doth not the same. But he constantly doth whatsoever is <hi>reasonable</hi> for him to do as <hi>God,</hi> and as <hi>Governour</hi> of the World, and never varies in the <hi>least Punctilio</hi> from the <hi>eternal</hi> Rules of Equity and Goodness; by which he gives a <hi>glorious</hi> Example unto all his Reasonable Creatures, to excite both <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to do what is fit and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for them in their several States and Relations: And what is reasonable for us Men to do, he hath declared to us in his Laws; so that by obeying his Laws we imitate <hi>God</hi> in the general, by doing what is reasonable for us; though what is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for <hi>God</hi> and us, whose Natures and Relations are so different, be not the same in all <hi>particular</hi> Instances. So that in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral you see, to obey and imitate <hi>God</hi> is but the same Thing in other Words. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since the Love of <hi>God</hi> doth necessarily include a Desire of resembling him, and that Desire necessarily produces a <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Imitation of him, and that Imitation is all one with obeying him; it hence necessarily follows, that if our Love of him be sincere, it must finally resolve into Obedience. For how can I love <hi>God,</hi> and not think him lovely? How can I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59595:8"/>
think him lovely, and not desire to be <hi>like</hi> him? How can I desire to be <hi>like</hi> him, and not take Care to imitate him? And how else can I imitate him, but by obeying him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If we love <hi>God,</hi> our Love will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our <hi>Wills, Designs,</hi> and <hi>Intentions</hi> to the Will, Designs, and Intentions of <hi>God.</hi> For Love always unites the Will of the <hi>Lover</hi> to the Will of the <hi>Beloved</hi>; and if it be mutual, it twists them together into one Will, and confounds all their Discords into a <hi>perfect</hi> Harmony; because Love doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily conclude in it Benevolence, which consists in an <hi>unfeigned</hi> Will that all may go well with him whom we love; that he may enjoy every <hi>Good</hi> that he wills, and accomplish every <hi>Desire, Design,</hi> and <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> so far as it is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> for him. So that supposing that the <hi>Beloved</hi> be but his own Friend, that he wills and designs and pursues nothing but what is really <hi>good</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> to him; the <hi>Lover,</hi> as such, ought necessarily to conspire with him in the <hi>same</hi> Will, and Designs, and Pursuits. If therefore we heartily love <hi>God,</hi> we cannot but <hi>will</hi> what he <hi>wills,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and intend what he intends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs; every Motion of that <hi>first great</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will be an <hi>effectual</hi> Law to govern all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59595:9"/>
our Motions, and our Wills, and Desires, and Designs, and Intentions, like the <hi>lesser</hi> Wheels of an <hi>Automaton,</hi> will presently run at the first Impulse of that <hi>great</hi> Master-Wheel without the least Rub or Hesitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in despite of all the Contentions of a <hi>rebellious</hi> Flesh, and all the Counter-stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of a <hi>perverse ungovernable</hi> Heart, our Love will so captivate our Wills to God's, that between him and us there will be but one Will, and End, and Interest. And our Wills being thus subjected to him by the <hi>invincible</hi> Necessity of Love, all our <hi>inferior</hi> Powers, like smaller <hi>Garrisons</hi> when the <hi>Master-Fort</hi> is taken, will presently sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of their own accord. For no Man can be a Rebel to <hi>God</hi> whether he will or no; because the Will is the <hi>commanding</hi> Principle, and hath such an <hi>absolute</hi> Empire over all our Actions, that 'tis impossible for us to do what we will not. So that if we <hi>will</hi> and design what God <hi>wills</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, our Practice must necessarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to his Will, so far as we know and understand it; for as God's Will gives Law to ours, so our Will gives Law to our Actions, and so by consequence the Will of <hi>God</hi> must be the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Law whereby both are regulated and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. From hence therefore it is evident,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59595:9"/>
that if we sincerely love <hi>God,</hi> we shall <hi>will</hi> as he <hi>wills</hi>; and that if we <hi>will</hi> as he <hi>wills,</hi> we shall act as he would have us; and therefore for any Man to say that he loves <hi>God</hi> while he <hi>wills</hi> contrary to his Will, or that his Will is reconciled to God's while he acts contrary to his Commands, is <hi>gross</hi> Hypocrisy and <hi>deep</hi> Dissimulation: For as the Love of <hi>God</hi> resolves necessarily into an Union of Wills with him, so <hi>that</hi> Union of Wills resolves necessarily into Obedience to his Laws.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If we love <hi>God,</hi> that Love will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press it self in a <hi>solicitous</hi> Care of avoiding every Thing that may displease or distaste him. For the <hi>greatest</hi> Ambition of Love is to appear lovely and amiable in the Eyes of its <hi>Beloved</hi>; and that it may do so, it doth most studiously avoid whatsoever may be displeasing or distastful to it; and most industriously endeavours to adorn it self with all those <hi>obliging</hi> Graces that are apt to endear and recommend it. And so if we love <hi>God</hi> we cannot but desire to be lovely in his Eyes; and <hi>that</hi> Desire, if it be sincere and hearty, must necessarily engage us to an endeavour of acquiring whatsoever is <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>pleasing,</hi> and of avoiding whatsoever is <hi>hateful</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi> to him. But now <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>true Goodness</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59595:10"/>
are the only Beauties that do endear us to <hi>God,</hi> and render us lovely in his Eyes, and <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Wickedness</hi> the only Deformities for which he hates and abhors us: For his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> are not regulated like ours, by the <hi>unaccountable</hi> Impulses of a <hi>mutable</hi> Fancy, but by <hi>steady</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Rules; so that he can never love what he once hated, nor hate what he once loved. For the Immutability of God's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> consists not in this, that he always loves and hates the same Persons, but that he always loves and hates Persons for the same Reason and Motive. And indeed that <hi>Love</hi> is but a <hi>foolish</hi> Fondness, that <hi>Hatred</hi> but an <hi>unreasonable</hi> Antipathy, that, without any <hi>reasonable</hi> Motive, always determines on the same Person: And if God loves and hates our Persons upon <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Motives, his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> would be <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>mutable,</hi> if when those Motives cease his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. If he should continue to love us when the Reason is wholly ceased that first moved him thereunto, he must either love us for no Reason, which would be a <hi>foolish</hi> Fondness, or he must love us for <hi>contrary</hi> Reasons, which would be Fickle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Inconstancy: And therefore when God ceases to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hate</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Persons
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59595:10"/>
when the Reason of his loving and hating them ceases, it proceeds not from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy, but the Immutability of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi>; for though they may change their Objects, yet they can never change their Reasons. For the Reasons of God's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> are in the Objects whom he loves and hates; and therefore if he changes the Objects of his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred,</hi> and when they themselves are changed, if he love a Person whom he hated when that Person is changed from <hi>hateful</hi> to <hi>lovely</hi>; or hate a Person whom he loved when that Person is changed from <hi>lovely</hi> to <hi>hateful</hi>; it is not he that changes, but the Persons who are the Objects of his Love or his Hatred: For amidst all Changes of Objects, his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hatred</hi> are eternally the <hi>same,</hi> because they are eternally fixed and determined to the <hi>same</hi> Reasons. But now his Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing naturally founded in <hi>Likeness,</hi> what can we suppose should be the Reason of God's <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Hatred</hi> to us, but only our <hi>Likeness</hi> or <hi>Vnlikeness</hi> to himself? For if we resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in that <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Justice,</hi> which are <hi>essential</hi> to his Nature, he must needs love us for his own sake, because we partake of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are allied to him by a Similitude of Temper and Perfections. But then
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59595:11"/>
when we are not only unlike, but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to him; when we are <hi>impure, spightful,</hi> and <hi>malicious</hi>; when we are <hi>false, unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi>; he hath an <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> against us founded in his very Nature, and he can no more love us whilst we are so contrarily disposed to him, than he can hate himself. Wherefore since there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can render us lovely in God's Eyes but only our resembling him in <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> nothing can render us <hi>hateful, offensive,</hi> and <hi>distastful</hi> to him, but our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>impure,</hi> and <hi>wicked,</hi> and <hi>unlike</hi> him; it hence necessarily follows, that we can no otherwise render our selves <hi>amiable</hi> to him, no otherwise avoid offending and grieving him, but only by keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for therein all those <hi>Graces</hi> are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined wherein our Resemblance of him consists; and all those <hi>Vices</hi> are forbid that are contrary to him, and do deform us in his Eyes. So that by doing his Will, we imitate his Nature; and shall acquire such a <hi>god-like</hi> Temper of Mind, as will render us more <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi> in his Esteem, than if we were decked with Stars, or cloathed in a Robe of Sun-beams; whereas on the contrary, by disobeying his Will we contract such an <hi>Vnlikeness</hi> and <hi>Contrariety</hi> to him, as renders us more offensive to him
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59595:11"/>
than the most <hi>loathsome</hi> Deformities in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For in God's eyes there is nothing ugly but Sin, nothing amiable but Virtue and true Goodness. Wherefore since our Love of <hi>God</hi> necessarily includes an earnest Desire of rendring our selves lovely and amiable in his Esteem, and since we have no other way to accomplish this Desire but only by keeping his Commandments; it hence necessarily follows, that we cannot sincerely love him whilst we disobey him. For with what Confidence can we pretend to love him, when it is indifferent to us whether we render our selves <hi>lovely</hi> or <hi>loathsome</hi> to him; when by disobeying his Will we wilfully contract those Deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which we know he abhors, and which are more <hi>odious</hi> in his Eyes than any of the most <hi>loathsome</hi> Spectacles in Nature? Is it possible that <hi>true</hi> Love should consist with taking Pleasure in the only Things that can grieve and offend its Object? Or were there ever such <hi>Lovers</hi> heard of, that affected the Deformities that were most <hi>hateful</hi> to the <hi>Beloved?</hi> No, no; he that heartily loves, must desire to be beloved; and he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to be beloved, must desire to be love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Wherefore since nothing is lovely in God's Eyes but what is like <hi>God,</hi> and we cannot be like him, unless we keep his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:59595:12"/>
Commandments; what an Immodesty is it in us to pretend to love him while we chuse to disobey him?</p>
            <p n="4">4. And lastly, If we love <hi>God</hi> sincerely, we shall be ready chearfully to undergo any Thing for his sake, be it never so <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>difficult:</hi> For Love is a <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Passion, it makes <hi>weak</hi> Things strong, and turns <hi>Cowards</hi> into <hi>Heroes,</hi> and warms and animates the Heart with such a <hi>generous</hi> Fire, as disdains all Opposition, and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously <hi>out-braves</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> Dangers and Difficulties. For he that loves hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily would do any Thing for the sake of his <hi>Beloved</hi>; and then measuring his Strength by the Greatness of his Desires, he thinks himself able to do whatsoever he will. So strongly doth this Passion transport Nature beyond the Bounds of its Abilities, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with such Force and Vigour as that scarce any thing is able to withstand it. If therefore we love <hi>God</hi> sincerely and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, our Love must necessarily resolve into Obedience to his Will, be it never so <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>difficult:</hi> For our Love will so <hi>enliven</hi> and <hi>animate</hi> our Endeavours of serving him, and carry us with such Spirit and Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity through all the <hi>weary</hi> Stages of our Duty, that it will be our Meat and Drink to do his Will; and there is no Instance of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59595:12"/>
Obedience, be it never so hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, but our Love will <hi>smother,</hi> and render it not only <hi>easy,</hi> but <hi>delightful.</hi> For what I do for <hi>him</hi> whom I love, I do for my self, <hi>his</hi> Pleasures being <hi>mine,</hi> and our Wills, and Ends, and Interests being involved in one <hi>another.</hi> So that if my Love be in any Measure <hi>intense</hi> and <hi>cordial,</hi> I shall do his Pleasure and perform his Will with the <hi>same</hi> Complacency and Delight as if I were doing my own; and whatsoever Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I meet with in serving him, I shall encounter them with Joy, that I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with Opportunities of expressing the Zeal and Sincerity of my Love to him. So that to pretend to love <hi>God,</hi> and yet to boggle at the Difficulties of obeying him, is the most <hi>shameful</hi> Hypocrisy in nature; for if we did as highly love him as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, our Wills would be so swallowed up in <hi>his,</hi> that it would be our Joy and Recreation to serve him, and the very Thought that we are doing what is <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> to him, would level all the <hi>Mountains</hi> of Difficulties in our way, and render them not only <hi>accessible,</hi> but <hi>easy.</hi> He therefore that stumbles at every Straw, and startles at every Difficulty in <hi>Religion,</hi> must be a <hi>notorious</hi> Hypocrite if he pretend to the Love of <hi>God:</hi> for where <hi>true</hi> Love is,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59595:13"/>
Difficulty is so far from daunting it, that that animates and encourages it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of blunting its Activity, whets and renders it more keen and vigorous; because the <hi>greater</hi> the Difficulty is, the <hi>greater</hi> is its Opportunity of manifesting its <hi>own</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and thereby of recommending it self to its <hi>Beloved</hi>; the Joy of which not only ballances, but endears all its Pains and Trouble. Hence the Apostle tells us, that <hi>there is no fear in love, and that perfect love casteth out fear,</hi> 1 John iv.18. It inspires us with such <hi>Bravery</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> that there is no Difficulty in our Obedience to him whom we love, that can daunt or ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify us. Wherefore since this is a <hi>necessary</hi> Property of the Love of <hi>God</hi> to make us ready to undergo any Thing for his sake, this also must necessarily resolve into the keeping his Commandments; for if we are willing to do any thing for <hi>God,</hi> we shall surely be willing to obey him; and though our Obedience in some Instances may be difficult, yet our Love, if it be real, will conquer its way through them all.</p>
            <p>And thus you see how all the <hi>essential</hi> Properties of the Love of <hi>God</hi> do finally resolve into Obedience; from whence it is evident, that wheresoever the Love of <hi>God</hi> is, it will most certainly prove a <hi>Principle</hi> of Obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:59595:13"/>II. I proceed now to the second Head of Discourse, which was to shew, <hi>that the Love of God is it self the most perfect Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Obedience.</hi> Not that I think all <hi>other</hi> Principles in their own nature <hi>bad</hi>; for <hi>God</hi> himself hath proposed other Principles of Action to us besides this of Love; he hath denounced his <hi>fearful</hi> Threatnings against us to alarm our <hi>Fear</hi>; that by <hi>that</hi> we may be moved to obey him, and propounded his <hi>glorious</hi> Promises to us to excite our <hi>Hope,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> may be a Spring and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Obedience in us. And certainly that can be no <hi>bad</hi> Principle which is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in us by <hi>divine</hi> Motives: but yet it is most certain, that there is no Principle whatsoever can be acceptable to <hi>God,</hi> that is quite separated from Love to him; for that which makes it acceptable is this, that it is a Principle of <hi>Vniversal</hi> Obedience. But now the Love of <hi>God</hi> being the <hi>greatest</hi> Instance of our Obedience, <hi>that</hi> can be no Principle of <hi>universal</hi> Obedience that is wholly separated from it. 'Tis true, the <hi>Religion</hi> of most Men begins upon a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple either of <hi>Hope</hi> or <hi>Fear,</hi> and it cannot be denied but they are very <hi>good</hi> Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but yet till by these we are induced to love <hi>God</hi> as well as to practise all other Duties, we are by no means <hi>pleasing</hi> and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59595:14"/>
               <hi>acceptable</hi> to him: So that though the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>Punishment</hi> and the <hi>Hope</hi> of <hi>Reward</hi> are <hi>good</hi> Ingredients in the Principle of our Obedience, yet till they have some Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures of Love with them, they can make no Claim to the <hi>divine</hi> Acceptation. There may be indeed, and at first there generally is, much less of <hi>Love</hi> in this Principle of Obedience than of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> whilst yet the whole Composition is very acceptable to <hi>God</hi>; for the <hi>lowest</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>cordial</hi> Love, intermixed with our <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> will leaven and consecrate them into an <hi>acceptable</hi> Principle of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but still the <hi>less</hi> Love there is in it, the <hi>more weak,</hi> and <hi>languid,</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> it is, and in all its Progresses towards Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection its Maturity is to be measured by the Degrees of Love that are in it; and till our Love is arrived unto that Degree of Ardency as to become the <hi>predominant</hi> Motive and Master-Ingredient in it, our State in <hi>Goodness</hi> is very <hi>slow</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> So that in short, the Principle of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is more and more perfect the <hi>more</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> there is in it, and the <hi>less</hi> of <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi>; and when <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> are all swallowed up in <hi>Love,</hi> and that is the <hi>sole</hi> Spring of Action within us, then it is the Principle of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and the Soul that acts
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59595:14"/>
and animates the <hi>Religion of the Spirits of just men made perfect.</hi> But to convince you how much our Obedience is perfected by Love, I shall briefly give you these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Instances of it:
<list>
                  <item>1. It rendereth our Obedience <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> and <hi>unconfined.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Spritely</hi> and <hi>chearful.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>easy.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Constant</hi> and <hi>steady.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Love renders our Obedience <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>unconfined.</hi> When Men are acted on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a Principle of <hi>Fear,</hi> they must be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>stingy</hi> in their <hi>Religion</hi>; for they will be sure to do no more than just what is necessary to <hi>quiet</hi> their Fears and <hi>calm</hi> their Consciences; and because they do not like what they do, but are meerly forced upon it by the Terror and Anguish of <hi>their own</hi> Minds, therefore, if they can, they will find some Way to pacify their Consciences without doing it, or at least with doing as <hi>little</hi> as may be, or with do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that only which they like <hi>best,</hi> and is most <hi>agreeable</hi> to their <hi>vitiated</hi> Tempers. Thus Persons of <hi>sour</hi> and <hi>morose</hi> Natures, when they are acted meerly by the Terrors of their Consciences, commonly betake themselves to some <hi>little affected</hi> Singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Severities in <hi>Religion</hi>; they will
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59595:15"/>
put on some <hi>distinguishing</hi> Garb, and tip their Tongues with some <hi>peculiar</hi> Phrases, and screw their Faces into a most <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>mortified</hi> Figure; they will condemn themselves to a State of <hi>Silence,</hi> and retire from all the Pleasures and most <hi>innocent</hi> Festivities of Conversation; they will frown all <hi>good</hi> Humour out of their Houses, and will not endure so much as a Smile in their Families, especially on the <hi>Lord's-Day</hi>; and take a world of Care and Pains to moap their Children into <hi>unsociable</hi> Statues, and to train them up in the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>pensive</hi> Looks, and <hi>solemn</hi> Faces, and <hi>ejaculated</hi> Eyes; for this is such a Reformation as is suitable to their <hi>sour</hi> and <hi>surly</hi> Natures; and therefore with this they will seek to bribe their Consciences to connive at all their <hi>black</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Inclinations. Thus also it is usual for <hi>Slanderers</hi> and <hi>Backbiters, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious</hi> and <hi>censorious</hi> Persons, when they are under an Agony of Conscience, to list themselves into some <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Party,</hi> where, under a Pretence of being the <hi>only</hi> People of <hi>God,</hi> they may consecrate their most <hi>unhallowed</hi> Passions, and rail and backbite with <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi>; where they may spit all their Venom in <hi>spiritual</hi> Gossiping, and freely employ the Talent of their Ill-nature in <hi>damning</hi> and censuring those they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59595:15"/>
dissent from; for this is such a Conversion as best agrees with their <hi>cankerous</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, so that if they can but cheat their Conscience with it, <hi>that</hi> and their <hi>beloved</hi> Lust will be very well reconciled. Thus also the <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>griping</hi> Oppressor, when he cannot otherwise still the Cries of his Conscience, will betake himself to some of the <hi>cheaper</hi> Exercises of <hi>Religion</hi>; he will <hi>fast</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> hear <hi>Sermons,</hi> and receive <hi>Sacraments,</hi> because all these Things he can do without intrenching upon his Vice; he can say his <hi>Prayers</hi> for nothing, and save Money by keeping a <hi>Fast,</hi> and eat and drink at the Sacrament <hi>gratis</hi>; all this is so <hi>cheap</hi> a <hi>Religion,</hi> that it costs him nothing to maintain it, and so his <hi>covetous</hi> Mind hath no Reason to grudge at it; so that if his Conscience will be but satisfied with this, his Lust and <hi>that</hi> may shake hands and be Friends. And to name no more, thus when the <hi>intemperate</hi> and <hi>lascivious</hi> Person is dogg'd by the Fears of his <hi>guilty</hi> Mind, it is usual for him to sigh and mourn, and make <hi>woful</hi> Confessions of his Sins; and when he hath done so, to endeavour to persuade himself that this is <hi>true</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; which if he can do, he may sin on securely, provided he doth but perpetually keep himself in this Circle of <hi>repenting</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59595:16"/>
               <hi>sinning,</hi> and <hi>sinning</hi> and <hi>repenting</hi>; but if he cannot so cheat himself, he will next fly to the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of a <hi>partial</hi> Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and disband the Vices he can best spare, that so he may keep his more <hi>beloved</hi> ones in Pay; hoping that by a Sacrifice of some <hi>few</hi> of his Sins, he may make an Atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for all the rest. Thus when Men are only acted by their Fears, they will find some way or <hi>other</hi> to contract their <hi>Religion</hi> into so <hi>narrow</hi> a Compass, that it shall be sure not to intrench <hi>too</hi> far upon the Liberties of their Lusts. For he that doth a Thing out of Fear is averse to the doing it, and that Aversation will so stint and limit him, that he will contrive all Ways to do as little as he can, and still the <hi>less</hi> he is forced to do, the <hi>better</hi> he will be pleas'd.</p>
            <p>But Love is that great Soul that acts and animates the <hi>whole</hi> Body of <hi>Religion,</hi> and equally diffuses its Influence through every Part and Member of it; for the Will of the <hi>Beloved</hi> is the Law of the <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> and every Thing pleases him, that is pleasing to <hi>him</hi> whom he loves. So that if we love <hi>God,</hi> we shall do what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, because it is his Will and Pleasure; and that Reason extends equally to all as well as to any Instances of Obedience; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59595:16"/>
therefore if the Motive of our Obedience be this, that it is God's Will and Pleasure, we must necessarily obey him, so far as we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, in every Thing that is so. For if we love <hi>God,</hi> there will be such a Consent and Harmony between <hi>his</hi> Will and <hi>ours,</hi> that we shall be best pleased with what pleases him; and being so, our Obedience will be no longer limited by any <hi>particular Likes</hi> or <hi>Dislikes</hi> of our own, which will then all vail and prostrate themselves to God's <hi>sovereign</hi> Pleasure, and so there will be nothing but <hi>that</hi> to set Limits and Bounds to our Obedience. So that then we shall be so far from contriving how to escape doing his Will, that we shall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to court all Opportunities of pleasing him, and be so passionately desirous of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we think is grateful to him, that we shall not only perform what he requires by <hi>explicite</hi> Command, but be ready to comply with the most <hi>secret</hi> Notices and Intimations of his Pleasure, and to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we think will please him when it is performed, whether it be commanded or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Love renders our Obedience <hi>spritely</hi> and <hi>vigorous:</hi> For it is certain, there is no Passion in <hi>humane</hi> Nature so <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous</hi> as that of Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for in this all the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59595:17"/>
other Passions are seated as in their <hi>common</hi> Root and Principle, and like so many Streams, though they run <hi>several</hi> Ways and in <hi>different</hi> Chanels, yet do they all issue out of one <hi>common</hi> Spring, and that is Love. For the Love of our selves is the <hi>Parent</hi> of all our Passions; 'tis that which makes us <hi>hate</hi> what is contrary to us, and <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> for whatsoever is pleasant and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And when we love any <hi>particular</hi> Object, and our Wills are pleasingly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the Beauty of it, if it be a Thing that is possible for us to enjoy, that excites in us a <hi>Desire</hi> of Enjoyment, if together with the Possibility there be a Probability of enjoying it, that excites <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation</hi>; but if there be not, that excites <hi>Fear,</hi> and this <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> being exalted to their <hi>highest</hi> Degree, turn into <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Desperation.</hi> If any Difficulty oppose it self to our Enjoyment, that excites <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Boldness</hi>; and if we surmount those Difficulties that hindred our Enjoyment, that excites <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of Mind. Thus Love, you see, as soon as it is taken with the Beauty of an Object, immediately kindles its <hi>Desires,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites its <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear,</hi> and carries the Fire into all the Passions which hold of its Empire; so that having the <hi>united</hi> Force
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59595:17"/>
of all the other Passions at its Beck and Command, its self must needs be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>potent</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi>; and consequently when it is terminated upon <hi>God,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the <hi>reigning</hi> Principle of our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, there is no Passion in our Natures can have that Influence upon us to make us <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> in the doing of his Will, as <hi>this</hi> may reasonably be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to have; because when we are under the Command of Love, <hi>that</hi> having in it the Force of all our other Passions, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily move and act us with all their <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Influence. And when the <hi>separate</hi> Force of all our Passions, like so many <hi>single</hi> Threads, are twisted into one Cord, with what a <hi>potent,</hi> I had almost said <hi>omnipotent</hi> Vigour must they draw and attract us? When our Love of <hi>God</hi> shall all at once awaken in us the <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Displeasure</hi> of losing him, the <hi>Resolution</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> to charge through every Difficulty that opposes our <hi>Fruition</hi> of him; and our Obedience shall be all at once informed and animated with the <hi>united</hi> Force of all those <hi>mighty</hi> Passions; how <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> must it needs be? For the Wise Man tells us, that <hi>Love is as strong as Death,</hi> Cant. viii.6. that 'tis an <hi>equal</hi> Match for the <hi>all-conquering</hi> King of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:59595:18"/>
Terrors, to whose Power the <hi>mightiest</hi> Things do stoop: And indeed it must needs be strong when it hath all the Force of <hi>Humane</hi> Nature in it, and is winged with the <hi>united</hi> Vigour of so many <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>active</hi> Affections. Hence the Apostle attributes a <hi>constraining</hi> Vertue to it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> v.14. <hi>For the Love of God constraineth us</hi>; it sweetly <hi>tyrannizes</hi> over all our Faculties; and by a <hi>willing</hi> Violence forces and capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates us into Obedience. But when a Man is acted only by a Principle of <hi>Fear,</hi> he must needs drive on heavily in the Course of his Obedience; because what a Man doth out of Fear, he would not do; so that he acts with Aversation, and moves all along coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his own Inclinations, and hath not the <hi>joint</hi> Concurrence of his <hi>other</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as he hath when he acts out of Love; and consequently his Passions thwarting and crossing <hi>one another,</hi> do retard and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each <hi>others</hi> Motions. So that though the Motion of Fear doth finally prevail, yet it is so broken and weakned by the counter-motions of Inclination, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not act us with that <hi>Spriteliness</hi> and <hi>Vigour</hi> as otherwise it would do: for whilst our Fear gives Wings to us, our Inclination hangs a Clog at our Heels, which wearies those Wings, and slackens and retards their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59595:18"/>
Flight. Whereas, on the contrary, when we are acted by Love, there is no Counter-motion within to let and hinder us, but all our Passions unite and conspire, and like the <hi>inferior Orbs</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> move harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with Love the first <hi>Great-mover,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is nothing within to check or allay it, and so we move on freely <hi>secundo flumine,</hi> with the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of our Natures. So that Love, you see, is a most <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Soul; it makes us all Life, and Spirit, and Wing, and animates our <hi>Religion</hi> with such a <hi>spritely</hi> Flame, as nothing is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul or suppress. If therefore we were but once throughly informed with the Love of <hi>God,</hi> this would so enliven us, that there is nothing in <hi>Religion</hi> would be <hi>too</hi> hard for us; this would turn Toils into Recreations, and Difficulties into Pleasures, and make us so <hi>nimble</hi> and <hi>agile</hi> in our Obedience, that we should <hi>run the ways of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> said he would do, <hi>when God should enlarge his heart with the love of him,</hi> Psal. cxix.32. And whereas <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid</hi> Souls, enfeebled with the want of this <hi>generous</hi> Passion, find Impossibilities, and complain of Impotencies, and make a stop; we should go on and conquer with an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible</hi> Power. Thus Love, you see, is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59595:19"/>
the most <hi>spritely</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Principle of Obedience.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Love renders our Obedience <hi>free</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi> He who obeys <hi>God</hi> only from a Principle of Fear, obeys him against his Will; he takes down his Duty as <hi>sick</hi> Men do <hi>Physick,</hi> with Loathing and Reluctancy, and only submits to it as a more <hi>tolerable</hi> Penance than the <hi>present</hi> Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror that he feels, and the after-Damnation that he fears; he only chuses it as the <hi>least</hi> of two <hi>Evils,</hi> that is, as a Thing that he hates, though not in so <hi>great</hi> a Degree as he doth those <hi>greater</hi> Evils which he knows are inseparable to his not chusing it: And while it is thus with him, it is impossible he should obey with any Freedom or Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity. For how can a Man chearfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with what he hates, or become a <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer</hi> to that which is his Torment? He may labour indeed at his Duty, and tug hard, like a <hi>Gally-slave,</hi> at the Oar, but alas! 'tis sore against his Will; he would fain be at his Lust again, but that he is chained to his Duty, and kept in Awe by that <hi>flaming</hi> Scourge that is held over him; so that he is perfectly pressed to serve <hi>God,</hi> and like an <hi>unwilling</hi> Victim is dragged to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars. Now though this may be a <hi>good</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Religion,</hi> which through the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59595:19"/>
Passion of Fear doth usually make its <hi>first</hi> Entrance into the Soul, yet if it stop here, and doth not pass forwards into Love, it is but half way, and will never be able to obtain an <hi>entire</hi> Possession. For whilst we obey God meerly out of Fear, we want one half of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and that is Love, which is that Half too wherein the Subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of our Souls to <hi>God</hi> consisteth; for while we only fear him, that may constrain us to an <hi>eternal</hi> Homage and Obedience; but 'tis Love alone that can <hi>inthrone</hi> him in our Wills, and make us <hi>Volunteers</hi> in his Service. But when once this <hi>divine</hi> Fire is inkindled within our Breasts, it will by Degrees melt away all our <hi>secret</hi> Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies and Aversations to our Duty, and so <hi>mould</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> our Wills to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> that at last our Obedience will be no longer a Burthen to us, but we shall run to our Duty with the <hi>same</hi> Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Delight, as we do now to our Pleasures and Recreations, and do the Will of our <hi>Father</hi> upon Earth as it is done by our Brethren in <hi>Heaven</hi>; who being all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with Love to him, do find a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> of Joys in serving and adoring him. For if we did heartily love God, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but we should feel a Pleasure in pleasing him; our Wills would so <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thize</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:59595:20"/>
with <hi>his,</hi> that we should feel his Joys and taste his Pleasures; and those Things only would be <hi>irksom</hi> and <hi>ungrateful</hi> to us, which we know do grieve and distaste him. For Love turns Service into Wages, and pays her self with the Pleasures of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; she counts all Commands Favours, and is highly satisfied with the Honour of obeying; and if she can but accomplish the Pleasure of her <hi>Beloved,</hi> she thinks her self wholly recompensed for all her <hi>tedious</hi> Toils and Labours. And certainly if our Souls were but inspired with any <hi>considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Degrees of this <hi>Heavenly</hi> Passion, we should find such Pleasure in pleasing <hi>God,</hi> as would for ever engage us to serve him; for then every Service that we rendred him would be a <hi>free</hi> Sally of an <hi>enamoured</hi> Will, and so our Hearts would be wrapp'd up in every Duty, and our Souls would still be ascending <hi>Heavenwards,</hi> like the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> that appeared to <hi>Manoah,</hi> in the Flames of all our Sacrifices. So that this Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency also Love hath above all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Obedience, that it renders our Obedience most <hi>free,</hi> most <hi>chearful,</hi> and <hi>voluntary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And lastly, Love renders our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>steady.</hi> When a Man's <hi>Religion</hi> is only animated with Fear, as it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:59595:20"/>
is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>languid</hi> while it lives, so it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hastens to an <hi>untimely</hi> Period. For Fear is a Passion so burthensom to <hi>humane</hi> Nature, that we cannot but desire to quit and discharge our selves of it as soon as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible may be; and accordingly the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, that <hi>there is torment in Fear,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.18. for it separates the Soul from the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of her self, and gives such an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> Tang to all her Pleasures, that she can find no Rest or Satisfaction in any Thing so long as she is haunted with it. Now when that which is the Principle of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is a Burthen to us, we cannot but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, if possible, to ease our selves of it; which we cannot otherwise do, but either by going <hi>forwards</hi> to Love, or by returning <hi>back again</hi> to <hi>sinful</hi> Presumption. For as for Fear, it is like the <hi>Wilderness</hi> through which <hi>Israel</hi> passed, a Place where there is no abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with Content and Satisfaction; so that we must go <hi>back again</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> or <hi>forwards</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> or be content to sit down in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and Disquiet. For we can never be at Rest, till our Fear is either sweetned with an Intermixture of Love, or stifled with <hi>vain</hi> Hopes and <hi>ungrounded</hi> Presumptions: And there being so many Arts of <hi>Self-deceiving</hi> in the World, and skinning over the Wounds of Conscience, if Men do not speedily cure
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59595:21"/>
their Fear by Love, they will soon find some <hi>other</hi> Way to extinguish it; either they will promise their Consciences a <hi>future</hi> Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or else they will <hi>presently</hi> amend by Halves, or else they will take Sanctuary in some <hi>false</hi> Notions in <hi>Religion,</hi> that tend to secure them in their Sins, and render them quietly wicked: These or some <hi>other</hi> Ways they will find to quit themselves of this <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome</hi> Passion; and then when the <hi>Weights</hi> of their Fear are down, the <hi>Wheels</hi> of their <hi>Religion</hi> will stand still immediately. So that you plainly see, that <hi>bare</hi> Fear can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a <hi>lasting</hi> and <hi>steady</hi> Principle of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>; and that because it is so troublesome, that Men will not long have the Patience to endure it.</p>
            <p>But as for Love, that is naturally a most <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> Passion; it sooths and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishes the Heart, and puts the Spirits into a <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> Motion; and so long as it continues <hi>pure</hi> Love, is always attended with Joy and Pleasure: And being so in it self, it is much more so when it is terminated upon God. For all the Disquietudes of Love arise from the Imperfections of its <hi>Object</hi>; either the Person <hi>beloved</hi> is <hi>coy</hi> and <hi>cruel,</hi> which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitters the Love with Sorrow and Regret; or else he is <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>inconstant,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames it with Rage and Jealousy. But when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:59595:21"/>
our Love fixes upon <hi>God,</hi> it hath neither of these Causes of Disturbance; for he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely loving unto all that love him, and he never changes the Objects of his Love, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they change, and prove <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> in their Affection to him. For whilst he hath the same Reason to love, his Love is always the same, and is as <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable</hi> as his Being. So that in the Love of <hi>God</hi> there is no Reason for any of those Griefs and Jealousies that are so commonly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with <hi>carnal</hi> Loves and Affections; for it being fixed upon an <hi>Object</hi> that doth so well deserve, and will so amply requite it, it can find nothing there but <hi>infinite</hi> Causes of Pleasure and Complacency: For the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of our Love being infinitely lovely, and infinitely loving, the Affection must needs be unspeakably <hi>pleasing</hi> and <hi>grateful.</hi> So that the Love of <hi>God,</hi> you see, must needs be <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>serene,</hi> and <hi>productive</hi> of the most <hi>delightful</hi> and <hi>ravishing</hi> Emotions, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in him but what tends to its <hi>greatest</hi> Content and Satisfaction; and being so, it must necessarily prove a most <hi>lasting</hi> Principle of Obedience to him; because wheresoever it is, it is always attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such <hi>substantial</hi> Pleasures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that there can be no Temptation to extinguish it; for so long as we feel no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:59595:22"/>
in it but what is highly <hi>grateful</hi> to our Natures, we shall be so far from using Arts to quit our selves of it, that we shall think it our <hi>greatest</hi> Interest to promote and increase it. For still the <hi>more</hi> we love him, the <hi>better</hi> we shall be pleased; and the <hi>better</hi> we are pleased, the <hi>more</hi> we shall endeavour to love him: And so our Pleasure and our Love will mutually provoke and augment one <hi>another,</hi> till both are arrived to the <hi>utmost</hi> Height of their Perfection. Thus the Love of <hi>God,</hi> you see, is a <hi>lasting</hi> Principle; 'tis a Fire that can live upon the Fuel which it self creates; and maintain it self for ever in Strength and Vigour, by feeding upon the Joys and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures which it produces: So that if this be the Principle upon which we do obey, our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> must needs be <hi>lasting</hi> and <hi>steady</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is acted and animated by a Principle that is so.</p>
            <p>Having thus demonstrated the Proposition in the Text, <hi>That wheresoever the Love of God is, it will express it self in Obedience to his Will</hi>; I shall now conclude the whole with some <hi>practical</hi> Inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence I infer, how necessary it is to the very Being of <hi>Religion,</hi> to keep up <hi>good</hi> Thoughts of <hi>God</hi> in the World; because without such, Men will never be able to love him; and without Love, they will never be
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:59595:22"/>
reduced to a <hi>through</hi> Submission to his <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Will. For it is by Love alone that <hi>God</hi> reigns in our Hearts, and doth both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and preserve the Empire of our Souls. We may be awed into a <hi>forced</hi> and <hi>fawning</hi> Submission, meerly by the Dread and Terror of his Power, and be obliged to serve him, as the <hi>Indians</hi> do the <hi>Devil,</hi> for fear he should do us a Mischief, and tear us in pieces; but this is meerly the <hi>Religion</hi> of Slaves, who are forced to undergo <hi>one</hi> Evil for fear of <hi>another,</hi> and to do what they hate for fear of suffering what they cannot endure. And as Slaves do generally hate those whom they fear, and even whilst they are <hi>fawning</hi> and <hi>cringing</hi> to their <hi>imperious</hi> Masters, had much rather cut their Throats if they could do it with safety; so when Men are acted in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to <hi>God</hi> meerly by a <hi>slavish</hi> Dread of his Vengeance, they generally hate him whilst they obey him; and if it were in their power, would rather <hi>ungod</hi> him, and pull him down from his Throne, than render him those <hi>Homages</hi> which they dare not with-hold. Now is it possible, that he who knows the Hearts of Men, and sees the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> Workings of their Minds, should ever be pleased with such a <hi>base</hi> and <hi>sordid Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; a <hi>Religion</hi> that is conjoyned with such an <hi>inveterate</hi> Hatred to his Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59595:23"/>
and restrains Men only by the Fear of Punishment from flying in his Face; a <hi>Religion</hi> that is wholly founded in Passion, that causes us to hate him, as well as to fawn upon him; that carries in it a <hi>secret</hi> Antipathy to his Nature and his Laws, and would much rather vent it self in an <hi>open</hi> Rebellion, than in a <hi>forced</hi> Submission, had it but Power enough to defend it self from his Fury? And yet this is the <hi>best Religion</hi> that Mankind is capable of without the Love of <hi>God.</hi> So that if ever we intend to keep up a <hi>generous Religion</hi> in our Souls, such as becomes <hi>free-born</hi> Minds to offer to the great <hi>Sovereign</hi> of the World; we must be sure to purge out all those <hi>sower</hi> and <hi>rigid</hi> Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>God</hi> that represent him any ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovely to us.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Hence I infer, how miserably those Men are mistaken, that make any Thing a Sign of their Love to <hi>God,</hi> but what tends to their keeping his Commandments. There are <hi>too</hi> many Persons that are apt to measure their Affection to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> by the meer Impressions of <hi>sensitive</hi> Passion, because up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>affecting</hi> Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those <hi>amiable</hi> Objects, they feel in themselves the same <hi>sensitive</hi> Emotions as they are wont to do when they fall in Love with other Things; that is, if they feel their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:59595:23"/>
Spirits <hi>soothing</hi> and <hi>ravishing</hi> their Hearts, and their Hearts <hi>diffusing</hi> and <hi>opening</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to let in those <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>amorous</hi> Spirits, they conclude themselves presently infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in love with <hi>God,</hi> and with their <hi>Saviour:</hi> Whereas many times all this is meerly the Effect of an <hi>amorous</hi> Complection, tinctured and inflamed with <hi>Religious Ideas,</hi> and is commonly as remote from the Virtue of Love, as Light is from Darkness, or <hi>Heaven</hi> from <hi>Hell.</hi> For as there are many Men who are sincerely good, that yet cannot raise their <hi>sensitive</hi> Passions in their <hi>Religious Exercises</hi>; that are heartily sorry for their Sins, and yet cannot weep for them; and do entirely love <hi>God,</hi> and delight in his Service, and yet can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move their Blood and Spirits into the <hi>ravishing</hi> Passions of <hi>sensitive</hi> Love and Joy: So on the other hand there are many <hi>gross</hi> Hypocrites that have not one Dram of <hi>true</hi> Piety in them, who yet in their <hi>Religious Exercises</hi> can put themselves into <hi>wonderous</hi> Transports of <hi>bodily</hi> Passion; who can pour out their Confessions in Floods of Tears, and cause their Hearts to <hi>dilate</hi> into Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of <hi>sensitive</hi> Love, and their Spirits to <hi>tickle</hi> them into Extasies of Joy. Which is purely to be resolved into the <hi>different</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Mens Bodies; <hi>some</hi> Tempers being naturally so <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>sedate,</hi> as that they are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59595:24"/>
scarce capable of being disturbed into a Passion; <hi>others</hi> again so <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>tender,</hi> and <hi>impressible,</hi> that the most <hi>frivolous</hi> Fancy is able to raise a Commotion in them. And hence we see that <hi>some</hi> People can weep most heartily at the Misfortunes of Lovers in <hi>Plays</hi> and <hi>Romances,</hi> and as heartily rejoyce at their <hi>good</hi> Successes, though they know that both are but Fictions and mere <hi>Ideas</hi> of Fancy; whereas <hi>others</hi> can scarce shed a Tear, or raise a <hi>sensitive</hi> Joy at the <hi>real</hi> Calamities or Prosperities of a Friend, whom yet they love a great deal better than others can be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to do their feigned and <hi>Romantick</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's. And yet because of these <hi>sensitive</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sports which Men do sometimes feel in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, when their Fancies have been chafed a while with a <hi>pathetical</hi> Description of <hi>God,</hi> they presently vote themselves his Friends and Lovers; whereas in Truth, that which commonly moves their Affection, is not any thing real either in <hi>God</hi> or in <hi>Christ</hi>; but some <hi>sensual</hi> Beauty attributed to them in <hi>fanciful</hi> Descriptions, that smites their <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalized</hi> Fancies. For generally we find that it is a <hi>Metaphorical God and Christ</hi> that such Men fall in love with; they set up an <hi>Idol</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> in their Fancies, and dress it in such <hi>carnal Metaphors</hi> and <hi>Allusions,</hi> as their <hi>sensual</hi> Minds are most apt to be taken
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:59595:24"/>
with; and then imagin that it smiles on them, and kisses and caresses them, with all the <hi>pretty</hi> endearments of a <hi>doating</hi> Lover; whereupon they grow so extreamly fond of it, that they are not able to forbear hugging and dandling it: But alas poor Men! they hug the <hi>Cloud</hi> instead of the <hi>Godess</hi>; and while they think they have <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> in their Arms, embrace nothing but a Specter of their <hi>own</hi> Fancies: For let but any <hi>other</hi> Person, though it were only the <hi>Hero</hi> of a <hi>Romance,</hi> or the <hi>Lover</hi> of a <hi>Play,</hi> be but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to them in the same Language, and the same <hi>glistering</hi> Allusions, and they shall experience in themselves the same Passion for them as they have for their <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Saviour.</hi> Thus in the <hi>Roman Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> and <hi>Monasteries</hi> we generally find the <hi>Monks</hi> fall in Love with the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> whilst the <hi>Nuns</hi> are all enamoured with <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>; that is, they chuse the <hi>Objects</hi> of their Love according to the <hi>different</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of their Sexes; and the Reason why they chuse so differently, is no <hi>other</hi> than this, that they both frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves such <hi>different carnal</hi> Ideas of the <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> Objects of their Love, as are most suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and agreeable to their <hi>carnal</hi> Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but very commonly neither the <hi>Monk</hi> loves the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> nor the <hi>Nun, Jesus
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59595:25"/>
Christ</hi>; but they both meerly doat upon the <hi>different</hi> Images of their own Fancies; which do not at all represent those <hi>divine</hi> Beauties for which those <hi>sacred</hi> Persons do so well deserve to be beloved. And thus it is <hi>too</hi> commonly among our selves, when yet we pretend to be <hi>zealous</hi> Lovers of God. Wherefore unless we have a mind to deceive our selves, let us no longer depend on such <hi>fallacious</hi> Evidences as these; but let us try our Love of <hi>God</hi> by his own Touch-stone; and that is our Obedience to his <hi>heavenly</hi> Will. <hi>If any man love me,</hi> saith our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, he will keep my Words,</hi> Jo. xiv.23. and ye <hi>are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you</hi>; for this, saith St. <hi>John, is Love, that ye walk after his Commandments,</hi> Eph. ii.6. For the Love of <hi>God</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> being a <hi>rational</hi> Love, is only to be valued by those <hi>rational</hi> Effects it produces in us; if it trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us into the Image of <hi>God,</hi> and makes us love what he loves, and hate what he hates; these are much more <hi>certain</hi> Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Love to him, than the most <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing</hi> Effects of <hi>sensitive</hi> Passion. For though our Hearts were melted into a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and Fondness to him, yet so long as our Hearts and our Practices are incomply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant to his Will and Laws, he will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and deal with us as Hypocrites and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59595:25"/>
Enemies; and esteem all our <hi>sensitive</hi> Fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses towards him, but as the <hi>base</hi> Flatteries of <hi>Judas</hi>; who kissed him, and then betrayed him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Hence I infer, what the <hi>great</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is why <hi>God</hi> doth so strictly enjoyn us to love him. For there is no Command what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever so often repeated in Scripture, as this of loving <hi>God; Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul: What doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to love him? O love the Lord all ye his Saints! Take heed therefore to your selves that ye love the Lord your God.</hi> These, and a world of other <hi>reiterated</hi> Injunctions of Love, do we meet with in the <hi>Sacred Pages.</hi> But how comes this to pass? Doth <hi>God</hi> need our Love, that he so importunately calls for it? Or doth it contribute any thing to his Happiness, to see himself beloved by all this <hi>great</hi> World of Beings; which he hath made, and which he hath endued with the Capacity of loving him? No, no; though doubtless the <hi>best</hi> Thing we can give him is our Love, yet he is <hi>too happy</hi> in himself to need any thing of ours: For he is a <hi>bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Fountain of Happiness, circumscribing all those Blisses that he can need or desire within the <hi>boundless</hi> Circle of his own Being. Or doth he court our Love meerly that he
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:59595:26"/>
may glory in the Number of his Lovers, and pride himself in those <hi>infinite</hi> Flames that concenter in him? No, nor this neither; for he is so infinitely <hi>glorious</hi> in himself, that no Act of ours can either add to, or substract from his Glory; which amidst all the <hi>Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujahs</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and all the <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies</hi> of Men and Devils, shines with the same <hi>unvaried</hi> Splendour and Brightness; and is neither diminished by our Hatred, nor improved by our Love. Well then, if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these be the Reason, what is it? 'Tis true, the Thing is infinitely <hi>reasonable</hi> in it self, That he who is so lovely in himself, should be beloved; and that all our Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should be <hi>united</hi> in him, who is the Fountain of all our Beings and Well-Beings: And <hi>God</hi> who is the Author of our <hi>reasonable</hi> Faculties, cannot but desire that we should act reasonably; and love that <hi>best,</hi> which best deserves to be beloved. But is there not some <hi>particular</hi> End for which <hi>God</hi> doth so earnestly crave and exact our Love? Yes, doubtless there is; and such as is every way worthy of him that hath proposed it. For it cannot be supposed that a Being infinitely <hi>wise,</hi> should ever act without End or Aim; but <hi>God</hi> being infinitely <hi>happy,</hi> cannot be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to propose any End for <hi>his own</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; because <hi>that</hi> would imply, that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:59595:26"/>
he wants or desires some Good that he hath not; and consequently, that he is not hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. But then he being infinitely <hi>good</hi> as well as <hi>happy,</hi> we cannot imagin what <hi>other</hi> End he should have of his Actions, but only to do <hi>good</hi> to his Creatures, and promote their Happiness; and consequently, the End and Reason for which he doth so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately demand our Love, is not to add any Thing to himself, but to do <hi>good</hi> to us; <hi>for our goodness extendeth not to God,</hi> as the Psalmist tells us, xvi.2. And though the Love of <hi>God</hi> be a very <hi>great</hi> Perfection to our Natures, yet <hi>Job</hi> tells us, that <hi>it is no gain at all to God, that we make our ways perfect,</hi> Job xxii.3. But though it is none to <hi>God,</hi> yet it is an <hi>infinite</hi> Gain to our selves; and that is the End and Reason for which he requires it: For, as I have already shew'd you, of all the Principles of our Obedience to <hi>God,</hi> Love is the most <hi>pregnant</hi> and <hi>fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> Now <hi>God</hi> requires us to obey him for <hi>our own</hi> Good, he having enjoyned us nothing but what tends to the Perfection and Happiness of our Natures; and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to love him, that so we may the more intirely and perfectly obey him; and thereby more speedily arrive to that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for which his <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed us. So that all the profit both of our
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:59595:27"/>
Love and Obedience, accrues to our selves; 'tis we only that reap the Fruit of <hi>our own</hi> Virtues; we only that are exalted by those <hi>Homages</hi> that we render to our <hi>Maker</hi>; for he is as <hi>happy</hi> without our Love, as he is with it; and all those <hi>united</hi> Flames of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints</hi> that meet and concenter in him, add not one spark to the <hi>infinite</hi> Element of his Happiness; which were not <hi>infinite,</hi> could it admit of Increase: But the Lovers themselves are <hi>glorified</hi> by their Love; and because they are so, <hi>God</hi> requires and exacts it. For our Love being the <hi>great</hi> Soul of our Obedience, and our Obedience the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> Means of our Happiness, the Profit of both must necessarily redound to our selves: and 'tis we only that must be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched and glorified by them. For this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son therefore <hi>God</hi> requires our Love, that it may be a <hi>living</hi> Principle to Obedience; and that being so, it might accelerate our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for he whose Love of <hi>God</hi> is but ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the Degree of a reigning Principle of Obedience, so as that his Obedience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds more from his Love than from any other <hi>Passion,</hi> doth already border on the <hi>heavenly</hi> State, and is within the Confines of Perfection. For as for the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> they are all acted by <hi>pure</hi> Love; which makes their Obedience <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:59595:27"/>
They see <hi>God</hi> face to face; and by their Sight are all inflamed with Love to him; and by their Love are winged with <hi>everlasting</hi> Vigour and Readiness to serve him; and all their Aversations to his <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Will being swallowed up in perfect Love, they not only obey without Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, but with <hi>infinite</hi> Ravishment and Pleasure; and never feel themselves more in <hi>Heaven,</hi> than while they are serving, praising, and adoring him. This is the <hi>happy</hi> State of those <hi>heavenly</hi> Lovers; and to this we are approaching with <hi>full</hi> Speed, while we obey from a Principle of Love: For Love will carry us on with Wind and Tide, from <hi>one</hi> Degree of Perfection to <hi>another</hi>; and whilst <hi>poor slavish</hi> Souls that are acted mainly by their Fears, are faign to tug at the Oar, and yet creep on but slowly, and by <hi>insensible</hi> Degrees; we shall run forwards with Ease and Speed; and get more ground at <hi>one</hi> stroak, than they can in <hi>twenty.</hi> For in <hi>one good</hi> Action performed out of Love, there is more Virtue and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than in a <hi>hundred</hi> of those whereunto we are dragged by our own Fears and Terrors; because as the Degrees of <hi>Evil,</hi> so the Degrees of <hi>Good</hi> in all Actions, are to be measured by the Degrees of Will that are in them; and doubtless in those <hi>good</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59595:28"/>
that have Love for their Principle, there is much more of Will than in those that proceed from Fear and Terror; and consequently, our Nature being perfected by <hi>good</hi> Actions, and <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> perfected by them, the <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less</hi> of Goodness they have in them, must needs be much more perfected by the good Actions of Love, than by those of Fear. Whilst therefore we are acted in <hi>Religion</hi> by the Love of <hi>God,</hi> our Souls are upon the Wing to Perfection, and in a <hi>swift</hi> Tendency to the <hi>heavenly</hi> State; we are already in the Neighbourhood of <hi>glorified</hi> Saints and Angels; and if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue our Course, shall soon be fit for their Society and Converse. This therefore is the <hi>great</hi> End and Reason why <hi>God</hi> doth so importunately claim our Love, because this of all others is the most <hi>perfective</hi> Principle of our Natures, and consequently the most <hi>conducive</hi> to our Happiness.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> And lastly, from hence I infer, of what <hi>vast</hi> Importance it is to us in <hi>Religion,</hi> to love <hi>God.</hi> For you plainly see, that Love is not only a Principle of Obedience, but that of all others it is the most <hi>efficacious</hi> and <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</hi>; that it doth not only engage us to keep God's Commandments, but that it enables us to keep them most universally, and vigorously, and chearfully, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:59595:28"/>
So that what the <hi>Apostle</hi> saith of <hi>brotherly Love,</hi> is more universally true of the Love of God, <hi>that it is the keeping of the whole Law,</hi> Rom. xiii.10. that is, causally and virtually it is. For so Love is that <hi>universal</hi> Cause which within its <hi>fruitful</hi> Womb contains all the Particulars of our Obedience, and is naturally productive of them all; So that virtually it is <hi>all Religion</hi>; it is <hi>Godliness,</hi> and <hi>Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> and <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>; being the <hi>common</hi> Cause and Parent of them all. For Love hath an <hi>universal</hi> Respect to the Will of the Beloved; it doth not <hi>chuse</hi> what is <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> what is <hi>hard,</hi> but likes what <hi>God</hi> likes, and disapproves of what he hates; his Will being the <hi>great</hi> Reason of all its Choices and Refusals: And whatsoever things in particular are <hi>distastful</hi> and <hi>difficult</hi> to us, by its <hi>powerful</hi> Oratory it renders <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>easie.</hi> For he that serves <hi>God</hi> out of Love, serves him with Delight; and he that serves him with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, hath no Clog to incumber him; none of those <hi>Aversations</hi> and <hi>Antipathies</hi> to his Service; that do so load and depress <hi>unwilling</hi> Minds; he doth not row against the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Nature, but acts with the <hi>full</hi> Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Mind, and so feels little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Drudgery in his <hi>Religion</hi>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:59595:29"/>
carried on with a <hi>full</hi> Tide of Delight, he goes easily and chearfully down with the Stream. Of such <hi>vast</hi> Importance is the Love of <hi>God</hi> to our <hi>Religion,</hi> that it not only produces it, but renders it <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi>; so that without some Degree of <hi>this,</hi> our <hi>Religion</hi> can have neither Being nor Well-being; and it is as possible for us to live without a Soul, and to be nourished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Food, as it is for our <hi>Religion</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> and to thrive without the Love of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore if ever we would be <hi>Religious</hi> indeed, if ever we would <hi>connaturalize</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to our Souls, so as to render it <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>delightsome</hi> to us; let us endeavour to kindle this <hi>heavenly</hi> Fire within us; and certainly if we heartily endeavour it, we cannot fa<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of success. For there are so many <hi>mighty</hi> Reasons to engage us to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> so many <hi>invincible</hi> Attractions in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in his Love towards us, as cannot but affect us if we seriously ponder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them. For how can I reflect upon that <hi>amiable</hi> Nature of his, in which there is an <hi>harmonious</hi> Concurrence of all Beauties and Perfections; where <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Justice</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> and every <hi>lovely</hi> Thing that can claim or deserve a <hi>rational</hi> Affection, are contempered together in their utmost Degrees of Perfection? How I say,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:59595:29"/>
can I steadily reflect upon such a Nature as this, without being charmed and captivated with the Love of it? How can I think of that <hi>stupendous</hi> Love which he hath expressed towards me, in giving me my Being, and all the Blessings I enjoy; in preparing a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> of <hi>immortal</hi> Joys for me, and sending his <hi>Son</hi> from thence to conduct me thither, without being all inflamed with Love to him? Wherefore let us seriously set our selves to the Contemplation of <hi>God,</hi> of the Loveliness of his Nature, and of his <hi>infinite</hi> Kindness to us and all his Creation. Let us repeat the Thoughts of these Things upon our Minds, and never give over pressing our selves with those <hi>infinite</hi> Reasons we have to love him, till we feel the <hi>heavenly</hi> Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to kindle within our Breasts; and then let us never give over feeding and blowing it with these <hi>divine</hi> Considerations, till it rise up into a <hi>triumphant</hi> Flame. And then we shall feel our selves animated with a <hi>new</hi> Soul, and inspired with so much Life and Activity in <hi>Religion,</hi> as that from our Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience we shall be able to subscribe to the Truth of the Text, <hi>This is the Love of God,</hi> this the most <hi>natural</hi> Expression and <hi>insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Effect of it, <hi>That we keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>

This, saith our <hi>Apostle,</hi> is a <hi>mighty</hi> Mistake, or a <hi>wretched</hi> Pretence for Mens Sloth and Idleness; for verily and truly the Commands of <hi>God</hi> have <hi>no</hi> such Difficulty in them, but are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves very <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be born.

            <p n="1">1. That whatsoever they enjoyn hath some <hi>natural Good</hi> inseparably appendent to it, to sweeten and endear it. The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> First-Mover hath so ordered Things in the Course of Motion which he hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, that <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> Actions should be ordinarily attended with <hi>such</hi> and <hi>such</hi> Effects and Consequents; and this is one <hi>great</hi> Way by which he hath signified to the World his Dislike or Approbation of <hi>humane</hi> Actions by the Effects and Consequents which he hath chained and annexed to them. If in the Course of Things which he hath esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished, <hi>such</hi> an Action be ordinarily attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>good</hi> Effect, he thereby signifies his Approbation of it, and declares that it is his Will and Pleasure that we should do and persevere in doing it: But if the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents which in the Course of Nature are ordinarily linked to such an Action are <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>hurtful,</hi> he thereby declares his Dislike and Abhorrence of it; and that it is his Will and Pleasure that we should carefully and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:59595:31"/>
constantly avoid it. For the <hi>great</hi> Author of our Beings hath so framed our Natures, and placed us in such Circumstances and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, that there is nothing <hi>vicious</hi> but is also <hi>injurious</hi> to us; nothing <hi>virtuous</hi> but is <hi>advantagious</hi>; and in this the <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> of all <hi>humane Virtues</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> do consist; and 'tis purely for this Reason, why he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids the <hi>one</hi> and commands the <hi>other</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is our Friend, and would not have us neglect any Thing that tends to our <hi>Good,</hi> nor do any Thing that is <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> to us; and because he knows that while we are thus framed, and do continue in these Circumstances and Relations, it is impossible but <hi>Virtue</hi> should be an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and <hi>Vice</hi> a Mischief to our Natures. And indeed the <hi>great</hi> Sanction of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> is nothing else but that <hi>natural Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> which is ordinarily conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to the Actions which it commands and forbids. For when <hi>God</hi> had no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise revealed himself to the World than only by the <hi>established</hi> Course and Nature of Things, <hi>that</hi> was the only <hi>Bible</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Mankind could be instructed in his Will and Pleasure; and there being no <hi>Threats</hi> or <hi>Promises</hi> antecedently annexed unto <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Actions, his Will and Pleasure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our doing or avoiding them, was
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:59595:32"/>
only <hi>visible</hi> in those <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> Effects and Consequences, which in the Course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he had made necessary to them. And indeed the <hi>Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> of all Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is finally to be resolved into the <hi>natural Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> that is appendent to them; for therefore our Actions are <hi>morally good,</hi> because they are <hi>naturally beneficial</hi> to us; and therefore are they <hi>morally evil,</hi> because they are <hi>naturally prejudicial</hi> and <hi>hurtful</hi>; and those that are neither of these, are <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> Actions; and stand in the middle between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> And indeed this Distinction of Actions by their Effects and Consequents, is in most Particulars so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>sensible,</hi> that all the World hath taken Notice of it: For whereas all <hi>good</hi> Actions have an <hi>apparent</hi> Tendency either to the <hi>Publick Good,</hi> wherein our own <hi>Private</hi> is involved, or to our own <hi>animal</hi> and <hi>sensitive Good,</hi> our <hi>Quiet,</hi> and <hi>Health,</hi> and <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi>; or to the Perfection of our <hi>rational</hi> Natures, and the <hi>sovereign</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Happiness of our Minds; all <hi>bad</hi> Actions tend directly contrary, either to the Damage and Ruine of the <hi>Publick-Weal,</hi> or to the Hurt and Prejudice of our <hi>animal</hi> and <hi>sensitive</hi> Felicity; to the <hi>diseasing</hi> of our Bodies, the <hi>staining</hi> our Names, or the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing</hi> our Estates; or to the <hi>defacing</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:59595:32"/>
and <hi>blemishing</hi> the Beauty of our <hi>rational</hi> Natures, and the Interruption and Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance of all the Pleasures and Felicities of our Minds. And this Distinction of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> Actions is so immutably fixed in the Nature of Things, that it can never be obliterated, until <hi>God</hi> wholly alters the Course of his Creation, and impresses quite contrary Laws of Motion on it. For so long as we continue what we are in the same Nature and Circumstances, and Relations to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>one another, Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Godliness, Humility</hi> and <hi>universal</hi> Love must necessarily be <hi>good</hi> for us; and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>destructive</hi> to our Happiness.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> Constitution of Things doth very much tend to the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating of <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> to us. For when Things are so constituted that it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Interest as well as our Duty to pursue <hi>Virtue</hi> and eschew <hi>Vice</hi>; when that which distinguishes our Duty from our Sin, is the <hi>good</hi> that it doth us, and the <hi>apparent</hi> Tendency it hath to our Happiness; this, if we love our selves, must needs very much endear and recommend it to us: For now we serve our selves in serving our Maker, the substance of all whose Injunctions is no more than this, that we should pursue <hi>our own</hi> Happiness by doing all those Things
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59595:33"/>
which are necessary thereunto. I confess had he made those Actions which are our Sins to be our Duty, we had then some Reason to complain; for then we should have been bound in <hi>pure</hi> Obedience to <hi>God</hi> to damnify our selves; and like the <hi>wretched Priests of Baal,</hi> to cut and slash <hi>our own</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Souls meerly to humour and gratify the <hi>Divinity</hi> whom we adore; then in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying him we must have acted <hi>our own</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy, and made our selves <hi>miserable</hi> in <hi>pure</hi> Loyalty to our Maker. For there is such an <hi>inseparable</hi> Bane clings to all <hi>vicious</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as necessarily renders them <hi>destructive</hi> and <hi>venomous</hi>; and we may as soon clip off the Sun-beams with a Pair of Scissers, as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Vice from its <hi>mischievous</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. But now when the Sum of all that <hi>God</hi> requires of us is to be <hi>good</hi> to our selves, and Friends to <hi>our own</hi> Happiness; to do what is <hi>beneficial,</hi> and avoid what is <hi>hurtful</hi> to us; when every Command of his is an Instance of his Love to us, and exacts nothing of us but what we would have done of <hi>our own</hi> Accord, had we but known what is <hi>good</hi> for us as well as he; and loved our selves as well as he loves us: In a word, when at the End of every <hi>good</hi> Action there stands some <hi>natural Good</hi> beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and inviting us to it; and at the End
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:59595:33"/>
of every <hi>bad</hi> One some <hi>natural Evil</hi> to warn and affright us from coming at it; so that we cannot run from any Duty into any Sin, without leaving a Benefit for a Mischief, and leaping out of some Degree of Happiness into some Degree of Misery: When things I say are thus, as it is apparent they are, with what Conscience can we complain that our Duty is <hi>burthensome</hi> and <hi>uneasie?</hi> This therefore is one <hi>great</hi> Reason why God's Commands cannot be <hi>grievous,</hi> because they require nothing but what is <hi>beneficial,</hi> and forbid nothing but what is <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> to us. And sure no Man can have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to complain, that is forbid Poyson, and commanded to eat nothing but what is <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some</hi> and <hi>nourishing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Another Thing that facilitates the Commands of <hi>God</hi> is this, That they are highly <hi>agreeable</hi> to our <hi>reasonable</hi> Natures. And hence the Apostle calls the whole of our <hi>Religion</hi> a <hi>reasonable Service,</hi> Rom. xii.1. And for the Truth of this I dare appeal to any considering Man in the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those <hi>Virtues</hi> which God hath enjoyned be not in their own Nature far more <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> than any of the Contrary Vices; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (supposing there be a <hi>God</hi> that made and governs the World; and from whom we derive our Beings, and all the Blessings
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:59595:34"/>
we enjoy or expect) it be not much more <hi>reasonable</hi> in the Nature of the Thing, that we should <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>revere,</hi> and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, than that we should <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>despise, blaspheme</hi> and <hi>rebel</hi> against him; or whether we can behave our selves so unworthily to One that hath deserved so well at our hands, without doing the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Violence to our own Reason; whether since we are all of us <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings, and our Reason is the <hi>noblest</hi> Ingredient of our Natures, it doth not much better become us to subject our <hi>blind</hi> Passions and Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, to those <hi>eternal</hi> Rules of Temperance which Right Reason prescribes, than to let loose the Reins to them, and suffer them to run headlong into all Excesses and Riots; whether since we are incorporated into the <hi>great</hi> Society of Mankind, it be not much more <hi>conducive</hi> to the <hi>Good</hi> of the Whole to behave our selves <hi>justly</hi> and <hi>honestly, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> one towards <hi>another,</hi> than to <hi>defraud</hi> and <hi>oppress, malign</hi> and <hi>persecute one another.</hi> I dare appeal to any Man that hath ever thought twice of these Matters, whether in point of Reasonableness, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is not wholly on the side of Virtue; yea, and whether the <hi>opposite</hi> Vices compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with these Virtues, seem not as <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> as the <hi>wildest</hi> Freaks of a <hi>Mad-man,</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:59595:34"/>
compared with the <hi>wise</hi> Managements of a <hi>Minister of State.</hi> But I need not appeal to <hi>particular</hi> Men in this Matter, since all the <hi>reasonable</hi> World is agreed in the point, and the Men of all Ages and Nations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, how much soever in other points they have dissented from <hi>one another,</hi> yet in this have still been <hi>unanimous,</hi> That Virtue is the <hi>wisest</hi> and most <hi>reasonable</hi> Thing in the World, and Vice the most <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi>; and this not only in the <hi>general,</hi> but in all those <hi>particular</hi> Instances of Virtue and Vice which <hi>Christianity</hi> commands and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids. For excepting the two <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and believing in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> which are the <hi>instituted</hi> Means of our <hi>Religion,</hi> there is nothing made Matter of Duty to us, but what all the <hi>wise</hi> World had long before pronounced most highly <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This therefore must needs render the Commands of <hi>God</hi> very <hi>easie</hi> to us, that they do so perfectly agree with our <hi>reasonable</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and require nothing of us either to be done or avoided, but what the Reason of every <hi>wise</hi> Man would have obliged him to, whether <hi>God</hi> had commanded it or no. So that now to <hi>facilitate</hi> our Duty, we have the <hi>full</hi> Concurrence of our Reason, which upon <hi>due</hi> and <hi>impartial</hi> Consideration can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59595:35"/>
but approve and recommend it to us as the most <hi>reasonable</hi> Thing in the World; and if it be so, how is it possible that it should be in its <hi>own</hi> Nature <hi>grievous?</hi> Is it so <hi>hard</hi> a Matter for Men to act like Men, and not to live their own Reverse and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes?</hi> Is it such a <hi>mighty</hi> Burthen to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the most <hi>genuine</hi> Inclinations of our Nature, and to swim with the <hi>full</hi> Tide and Current of our Reason, in obeying those Commands which are so far from offering any Violence to our Faculties, that they have their <hi>full</hi> Consent and Approbation? Let Men say and teach what they please, 'tis as apparent as the Sun, that the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Religion</hi> commence not so much upon the Stock of Nature, as of Education and <hi>evil</hi> Habits and Customs; for in all <hi>other</hi> Instances, that which is <hi>natural</hi> is always <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile</hi> and <hi>easie</hi>; and if Reason be the Nature of a Man, <hi>Religion</hi> must be either <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>unreasonable.</hi> So that <hi>Religion</hi> disagrees with us upon no <hi>other</hi> Account, but only because we disagree with our selves; and it just so far crosses us, as we do the Current of <hi>our own rational</hi> Natures. We have <hi>sophisticated</hi> our Natures with the Intermixtures of <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual</hi> and <hi>devilish</hi> Habits, and they are these that the Commands of <hi>God</hi> do agrieve; and so 'tis not the Man that is so burthened with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:59595:35"/>
               <hi>Religion,</hi> but 'tis either the <hi>Beast,</hi> or the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> that is in him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Another Thing that facilitates God's Commands is this, That they are mightily <hi>furthered</hi> and <hi>promoted</hi> by all the <hi>natural</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts and Passions of <hi>human</hi> Nature. There are <hi>certain</hi> Propensions in <hi>human</hi> Nature an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to all Reason and Discourse, that seem to be implanted in us by the <hi>wise</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our Beings, for no <hi>other</hi> End but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to minister to <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>; such in particular are <hi>Self-Love,</hi> the <hi>Love of Truth,</hi> and of <hi>Pleasure, Commiseration</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and <hi>Affectation of Praise</hi>; all which do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves in us in our <hi>early</hi> Infancy, before we are capable of discoursing our selves into them. For even in <hi>young</hi> Infants you may observe a great Inclination to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, and to repel Injuries, which proceeds from the Principle of <hi>Self-love</hi> that is in them; a <hi>vehement</hi> Desire of what seems <hi>good</hi> to them, and a <hi>great</hi> Displeasure when they perceive themselves deceived; the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of which must proceed from their Love of Truth, as the <hi>former</hi> from their Love of Goodness. Again, when they see a <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> Object, or one whom they think so, they presently bemoan it, and express by their Actions a very <hi>earnest</hi> Desire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and relieve it; which proceeds from
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59595:36"/>
that <hi>natural</hi> Commiseration that is in them. Again, as soon as they are able to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Faces and Persons, we see they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the <hi>greatest</hi> Love and Fondness to those that tend and feed them, and do them most good; which is a <hi>plain</hi> Expression of their <hi>natural</hi> Gratitude. And as soon as they understand the Meaning of <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> they shew themselves highly pleased when they are <hi>commended</hi> and <hi>applauded,</hi> and much grieved and ashamed when they are <hi>derided</hi> and <hi>exposed</hi>; which plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers their <hi>natural</hi> Affectation of Praise. These and such like Instincts and Propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions there are found in <hi>human</hi> Nature, which being well managed and improved by our Reason, prove <hi>excellent</hi> Instruments of <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi>; and do very much <hi>facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> and further our Practice of them. For this our <hi>natural</hi> Self-love being guided by our Reason, doth strongly incline us to serve and obey <hi>God,</hi> who being the most <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Agent in the World, can do us the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Good if we please him, and the <hi>greatest</hi> Hurt if we affront and provoke him; so that as we love <hi>our</hi> selves, it concerns us to use all <hi>reasonable</hi> Ways to endear and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our selves to him. Thus our <hi>natural</hi> Desire of <hi>Good,</hi> if conducted by our Reason, will incline us to do the best Actions, since
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:59595:36"/>
from these the <hi>greatest</hi> Good will necessarily redound to us; and our Love of Truth by <hi>good</hi> Management may be easily improved into Honesty and Sincerity, and an <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> Abhorrence of Vice upon the Account of those <hi>notorious</hi> Cheats and Impostures that are in it. Thus also by the Bias of our <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Commiseration, we are strongly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Beneficence,</hi> and <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Love</hi>; and by its own <hi>innate</hi> Gratitude our Nature is propense to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> who is our <hi>Sovereign</hi> Benefactor; to <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> our Parents, and do all the Acts and Offices of a <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> Friendship. And to name no more, thus by our <hi>natural</hi> Affectation of Praise we are strongly incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do <hi>praise-worthy</hi> Things, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to exercise our selves in all those <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Virtues, which by <hi>common</hi> Consent are lookt upon as the Graces and Ornaments of <hi>human</hi> Nature. Thus by all those Instincts that <hi>God</hi> hath implanted in our Natures, we are inclined to Virtue, and Obedience to his Will: And for this Reason chiefly hath he implanted them in us, because they are <hi>excellent</hi> Instruments of <hi>Religion,</hi> having in them such a <hi>natural</hi> Aptitude and Prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to facilitate our Duty by inclining us to it, and to farther us in Holiness and Virtue. I confess, there are none of these Instincts
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59595:37"/>
but may be improved into Vices; nor is there any Thing so <hi>good,</hi> but what may be perverted to very <hi>bad</hi> Purposes: And if Men will abuse themselves, and willfully deboach the Instincts of their Nature, there is no Remedy for their Folly; and they must thank themselves when they feel the <hi>dismal</hi> Effects of it. But this I think is plain, that there are no Propensions in <hi>human</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but what are much more improvable into Virtue than into Vice; and if Men would but use themselves well, and as it becomes <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures to do, they would doubtless find themselves very much farthered in their Duty by the <hi>natural</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts which <hi>God</hi> hath implanted within them. And this is a <hi>mighty</hi> Advantage on Virtues side, that it is thus aided and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the Instincts of our Natures; which like <hi>obedient</hi> Handmaids, are most readily inclined to execute its Commands, and minister to its Pleasure and Interest. How then is it possible that <hi>Religion</hi> in it self should be <hi>burthensome</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi> to us, when the Propensions of our Nature do so fairly comply with it, and it is helped for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and promoted by all their <hi>united</hi> Force and Influence? 'Tis difficult indeed for a Man to go against the Grain; but to act according to Nature, to follow <hi>our own</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:59595:37"/>
Propensions, and to do what we are inclined to by <hi>natural</hi> Instinct, is doubtless the <hi>easiest</hi> Thing in the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>ly.</hi> Another Thing that makes those Virtues which <hi>God</hi> Commands to be <hi>easie</hi> is this, that they are all so inseparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected to one <hi>another,</hi> that they mutually promote and help forward each <hi>other</hi>; For all the Virtues are so mutually concatenated, that the stirring of any <hi>one</hi> Link moves the whole Chain. Thus for Instance, the <hi>true</hi> Knowledge of <hi>God</hi> naturally inflames the Soul with the Love of him; and then the Love of him insensibly transforms her into the Image of his <hi>beloved</hi> Goodness; for he that loves <hi>God</hi> must needs be inamoured with that <hi>divine</hi> Goodness which is the Root of his Love: And while he is ravished with the Sweetness of his <hi>Good</hi> Will, the Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedness of his Grace, and the Clemency of his Pardon, an <hi>heavenly</hi> Spirit steals into his Soul, and he loves, and becomes like <hi>God</hi> so both at once, that like a Wedg of Steel, he is transformed into the Likeness of the Fire that heats him; and is all <hi>inflamed</hi> and <hi>inlightened</hi> at the same Moment. And as he burns with Love, so he resembles the Goodness that set him on Fire, and becomes <hi>pure</hi> as that is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as that is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> as that <hi>heavenly</hi> Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:59595:38"/>
is which he copies and transcribes. Thus wheresoever the Love of <hi>God</hi> is, it hath all the <hi>god-like</hi> Virtues attending it; and that being the <hi>first</hi> Link in the <hi>heavenly</hi> Chain, whensoever it moves, it communicates Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the rest. For he that heartily loves <hi>God,</hi> will love those whom <hi>God</hi> loves; and so the Love of <hi>God</hi> will draw <hi>Brotherly-Charity</hi> after it; and he who loves those whom <hi>God</hi> loves, will be <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> in his Dealings and Deportment towards them; and so <hi>Brotherly-charity</hi> will draw <hi>Righteousness</hi> after it: And he that demeans himself justly and righteously towards <hi>others,</hi> will neither undervalue them, nor overvalue himself; and so <hi>Righteousness</hi> will draw <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> after it: And he that doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value himself, is fairly disposed to be sober in all his Passions; and so <hi>Humility</hi> draws <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> after it. Thus <hi>one</hi> Virtue smoothens the Way to <hi>another,</hi> and makes it not only <hi>possible</hi> but <hi>easie</hi>; for there is such a <hi>near</hi> Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood between these <hi>heavenly</hi> Sisters, that when we are arrived at one, we pass insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly to the next; and so on by Degrees, till we are gone round with them all. For though there be not an <hi>immediate</hi> Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every Virtue upon every <hi>one</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, so as to make it necessary for a Man to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59595:38"/>
have all Virtues in every Moment that he hath one; for a Man may be <hi>charitable,</hi> and yet not presently <hi>humble</hi>; as he may be <hi>just,</hi> and yet not immediately <hi>temperate:</hi> Yet there is so <hi>near</hi> a Dependence between them, that <hi>one</hi> always disposes the Mind for <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi>; this Virtue always makes way for its next Neighbour, and <hi>that</hi> for its next, and so on all around the whole Circle of Virtues. Thus <hi>Humility</hi> naturally disposes the Mind to <hi>Meekness, Meekness</hi> to <hi>Charity, Charity</hi> to <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, Justice</hi> to <hi>Devotion,</hi> (which is giving <hi>God</hi> his Due) and <hi>Devotion</hi> to <hi>Heavenly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the World; and so all along there is a <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> Transition from <hi>one</hi> to t' <hi>other.</hi> Now this must needs mightily <hi>facilitate</hi> the Virtues of <hi>Religion,</hi> that they are so nearly confederated to each <hi>other,</hi> and so do naturally contribute to each others Assistance. For whereas if it were not for this there would still be the <hi>same</hi> Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in practising the <hi>second</hi> Virtue as there is in practising the <hi>first,</hi> and in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>third</hi> as there is in practising the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> and so every <hi>single</hi> Virtue would be equally difficult; now the main Difficulty lies in the <hi>first</hi> we begin with, for by pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctising of <hi>that</hi> we shall be so well disposed for the <hi>next,</hi> that afterwards we shall go on with much more Ease and Pleasure; for
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:59595:39"/>
the <hi>first</hi> Virtue being set a going, like the <hi>First-moving Heaven,</hi> will communicate its Motion from <hi>Orb</hi> to <hi>Orb,</hi> from <hi>one</hi> Virtue to <hi>another,</hi> till the whole <hi>Sphere</hi> whirls round in an <hi>harmonious</hi> Order. Thus all the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues you see do naturally lighten and ease one <hi>another,</hi> and every <hi>one</hi> contributes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to make every <hi>one</hi> more <hi>easie</hi>; so that had we but the Courage to begin to practise them, we should find they would every day grow more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to us, and that not only because we should be more and more Habituated to them, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they being mutually allyed to one <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> the stronger they grow the more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously they must farther and promote <hi>each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>ly.</hi> And lastly, Another Thing that makes the Virtues that <hi>God</hi> hath commanded us <hi>easie</hi> is this, that in themselves they are <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>direct,</hi> and have no Intricacies or <hi>Labyrinths</hi> in them. As for Sin and Wickedness it is an <hi>inextricable</hi> Labyrinth, in which the further a Man goes the more he will perplex and lose himself; it is a <hi>bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Wilderness whose Paths do all thwart and cross <hi>one another.</hi> For all Vices consist in Extremes, and are either the <hi>Excesses</hi> or <hi>Defects</hi> of Virtue; so that there are <hi>two</hi> Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to <hi>one</hi> Virtue, and both are Extremes
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:59595:39"/>
thwarting and running counter to <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Now amidst this <hi>great</hi> Diversity and Contrariety of Vices the Sinner must needs be extremely amazed and distracted; for his Lusts are so <hi>infinite</hi> that he can see no End of them, they do so cross and interfere with <hi>each other</hi> that while he humours <hi>one</hi> he displeases <hi>another.</hi> For in gratifying his <hi>Sordidness</hi> he affronts his <hi>Pride,</hi> and in feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>Covetousness</hi> starves his <hi>Sensuality</hi>; so that his <hi>wretched</hi> Soul wanders among <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> Cross-ways, and is miserably distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by its own <hi>contrary</hi> Desires, which, like <hi>Acteons Hounds,</hi> are continually wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying and tearing her in pieces. But all the Paths of Virtue lie strait forwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>vicious</hi> Extremes, and like <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel Lines</hi> do never interfere with <hi>one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; they never raise any <hi>contrary</hi> Desires, nor distract our Minds with <hi>inconsistent</hi> Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; but all their Motions are <hi>regular</hi> and <hi>uniform,</hi> conspiring with and promoting <hi>one another.</hi> For the Truth of it is, Virtue is all but one <hi>intire</hi> Thing, much like the Center of a Circle, which though many Lines are drawn from it round about, and it is look'd upon sometimes as the Term of <hi>this</hi> Line, and sometimes of <hi>that,</hi> yet it is <hi>one</hi> Term to them all, and is in it self undivided: So is Virtue but one <hi>intire</hi> Perfection, though
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59595:40"/>
it seem to be diversified in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Affections that it moderates, and the several Actions which it doth produce; And though its Precepts and Actions are <hi>many,</hi> yet they are all ordinated to <hi>one</hi> End, and in that they are united as well as in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from whence they proceed. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Account there can be none of those <hi>perplexing</hi> Intricacies in the Paths of Virtue as are ordinarily found in the Ways of Sin, because they are all of them <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>strait,</hi> leading from <hi>one</hi> Principle to <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> End; And the Principle and End of our Motion being <hi>one,</hi> 'tis impossible but our Designs, Desires and Pursuits should be <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>uniform</hi>; and consequently the whole Force of our Souls being bent <hi>one</hi> Way, we must needs proceed with more Alacrity and Ease than we can possibly do when 'tis divided and dispersed among so <hi>great</hi> a Multiplicity of Ends and Objects as Vice proposes to us. So that here is one <hi>great</hi> Advantage that Virtue hath above Vice in respect of Easiness, that whereas almost in every <hi>bad</hi> Action a Man hath a <hi>different</hi> End, now to satisfy <hi>this</hi> Lust, and anon the <hi>contrary</hi>; in every <hi>virtuous one</hi> his End is always the same; and whereas the <hi>former</hi> acts variously and inconsistently, and his Desires frequently clash and run a tilt at
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:59595:40"/>
               <hi>one another</hi>; the <hi>later</hi> always moves direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and uniformly, by <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> Rule towards <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same</hi> End. And whereas many Vices are in themselves full of Intanglements, Virtue is always <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>open,</hi> and <hi>free.</hi> As for Instance, how do we perplex and intangle our selves by <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Knavery,</hi> consuming the Pleasure of our Lives within a <hi>winding</hi> Maze of <hi>little</hi> Tricks and <hi>intricate</hi> Contrivances? And what <hi>shameful</hi> Retreats and <hi>false</hi> Colours, what <hi>Fucus's</hi> and <hi>Daubings</hi> are we feign to use to avoid Contradiction and Discovery? Whereas were we but <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in our Professions and Actions, our Way would be <hi>open</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>uniform</hi>; wherein we might pursue all <hi>our</hi> Ends by the <hi>directest</hi> Means, and need never wander about in the Labyrinths of a <hi>mysterious</hi> Subtilty; where we may walk without blushing in the Sight of the Sun, and in the View of the World, and have no Occasion to skulk into Coverts and Retirements. And the same may be said of <hi>Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Covetousness,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>wandering Lust,</hi> Vices that are usually <hi>full</hi> of <hi>great</hi> Intreagues and Mysteries; whereas the <hi>Contrary</hi> Virtues are all <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>simple,</hi> and have nothing of Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Intricacy in them. This therefore is a <hi>great</hi> Advantage that Virtue hath in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59595:41"/>
Respect of Ease, that it is <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,</hi> and <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>direct.</hi> And so I have done with the <hi>first</hi> Thing proposed, which was to shew you that God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in themselves are <hi>facile</hi> and <hi>easie.</hi> I now proceed</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the second Thing, which is to prove that our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> by what he hath done, hath render'd them much more <hi>easie</hi> than they are in themselves. Now there are these <hi>Four</hi> Things which our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath contributed to the <hi>facilitating</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The Assistance of his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The Influence of <hi>his own</hi> Example.</item>
               <item>3. The <hi>merciful</hi> Indulgence and Condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension of his <hi>Gospel</hi> to the Weakness and Infirmity of our Natures.</item>
               <item>4<hi>ly.</hi> The <hi>glorious</hi> Rewards he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised us upon our <hi>sincere</hi> Obedience.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To the rendring of God's Commands <hi>easie,</hi> he hath contributed the Assistance of his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi> For he hath promised to give his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> unto every one that asks; and therefore though our Nature of it self be extremely <hi>weak,</hi> and not able of it self to stand under the <hi>easie</hi> Burthen of its Duty, if we will but struggle and do what we are able, he is engaged by promise not to suffer us to sink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if by doing what we can,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:59595:41"/>
it is in our Power to engage him to enable us to do what we cannot, it is certainly in our Power to do all; for though in <hi>our own</hi> Strength we cannot do all, yet if we please, it may be in our Power to do more than all through him that will strengthen us, if we will but do what we can.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> To the rendring of God's Commands <hi>easie,</hi> he hath also contributed the Influence of <hi>his own</hi> most <hi>holy</hi> Example. For by <hi>his own</hi> most <hi>perfect</hi> Obedience to the Commands of his Father, he hath not only set us a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to write after, but he hath also given us most <hi>convincing</hi> Evidence that our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is both <hi>possible</hi> and <hi>honourable.</hi> That it is possible we see by what he hath done, and it is certain that what hath been done may be done; that it is <hi>honourable</hi> we see by his doing of it; for certainly so <hi>great</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> would never have stooped to an <hi>inglorious</hi> Obedience. So that the Example of our <hi>Saviour</hi> not only encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages our Obedience, but crowns and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies it; and renders it a <hi>fit</hi> Object both of our Endeavour and Ambition: For by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself what he requires of us, he hath plainly demonstrated not only that it may be done, but also that it <hi>highly</hi> becomes us to do it. Thus the <hi>glorious</hi> Example of our <hi>Saviour</hi> whilst it directs our Obedience, doth
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:59595:42"/>
at the same Time excite and encourage it. For he conversed among Men with a <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest</hi> Virtue, such as was suitable to an <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> Course of life. His <hi>Piety</hi> was <hi>even, constant,</hi> and <hi>unblamable</hi>; complying with <hi>civil</hi> Society, and a <hi>secular</hi> Conversation. It broke not forth into <hi>high</hi> Transports and <hi>Seraphic</hi> Expressions; but was such as was both <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> for Mortals to imitate. His Virtue consisted not in <hi>prodigious</hi> Fastings, or <hi>high</hi> Abstractions from Sense, but in a life of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Temperance, Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi>; that is, in such a Life as was not only proper, but possible for us to lead. And by this Means he hath transmitted to us the more of an <hi>imitable</hi> Virtue; for he did not out-run the Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men in <hi>prodigious</hi> Expressions of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity and Virtue; but complied with our Weakness, and kept pace with our Strength, that so he might entertain us all along with the Comforts of his Company, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of a <hi>perpetual</hi> Guide. And as that Rule of Faith which he hath propounded to us is fitted to our Understandings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very <hi>short, easie</hi> and <hi>intelligible</hi>; so the Copy of Manners which he hath set before us is not only fitted with Excellencies <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> but also with Complyances <hi>possible</hi> to be imitated. And therefore how efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:59595:42"/>
must such a <hi>glorious</hi> Example contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the <hi>facilitating</hi> the Commands of <hi>God</hi> to us, since it doth not only point us to our Duty, but also excite us to perform it; and that both by its Condescension to our Strength and Capacity; and by the <hi>plain</hi> Demonstration it gives, that our Duty is both <hi>possible</hi> and <hi>honourable?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> To the rendring of God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>easie</hi> to us, our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the <hi>merciful</hi> Indulgence and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention of his <hi>Gospel</hi> to the Weakness and Imperfection of our Natures: For in his <hi>Gospel</hi> he hath mercifully considered our State, that we are but <hi>frail imperfect</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that are very prone to act inconsider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and to be <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>anon</hi> surprised in this <hi>great</hi> Hurry of Temptations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in his <hi>holy Gospel</hi> he hath made Provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us accordingly, that is, he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned our Burthen to our Strength, and taken the Measure of our Duty by our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. For all that he hath required of us as the Condition of our <hi>eternal</hi> Salvation is only this, that we should honestly endeavour to understand what he commands and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us, and that we should not live in the <hi>wilful</hi> Neglect of any <hi>known</hi> Duty, or in the <hi>wilful</hi> Commission of any <hi>known</hi> Sin; and if we do this he hath engaged himself to make
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:59595:43"/>
such a <hi>merciful</hi> Abatement for our Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Inadvertencies, and Follies and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, that they shall never rise in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against us so as to exclude us from <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Happiness. So that now there can be nothing our Duty that is <hi>naturally</hi> impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nothing <hi>necessary</hi> to our <hi>eternal</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that is <hi>morally</hi> impossible; that is, that cannot reasonably be expected from us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering our State and Circumstances; and what is neither of these cannot be supposed to be very <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>burthensome.</hi> For unless we account it <hi>hard</hi> that we are not left at Liberty to be <hi>obstinate</hi> Rebels to our <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> and with an <hi>audacious</hi> Forehead to reject what they command, and pursue what they forbid, it is certain there can be no such Thing as a Burthen or Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in all our <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly, To the rendring of God's Commands <hi>easie</hi> to us our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath contributed the Promise of a <hi>glorious</hi> Reward upon Condition of our <hi>sincere</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: And this is such a <hi>vast</hi> Contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Ease of our Duty, as is <hi>sufficient</hi> to turn it all into <hi>Jubilee</hi> and Recreation. For when I seriously consider that after I have spent a <hi>few</hi> Moments here in the <hi>noble</hi> Exercises of a sincere Piety and Virtue, I shall be translated into a Region of <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:59595:43"/>
Pleasures, where, in the Society of my <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> and of <hi>blessed Spirits,</hi> I shall spend an Eternity in one <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued uninterrupted</hi> Act of <hi>rapturous</hi> Love and Joy and Pleasure; where, in a <hi>perfect</hi> Freedom from all the Arrogancies of Flesh and Blood, and from all the Vexations of an <hi>ill-natured</hi> World, I shall live as happily <hi>for ever</hi> as all the Joys of an <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> can make me; in a word, where I shall have nothing else to do, but to converse with the most <hi>happy</hi> Lovers, and to bear a part in that <hi>ravishing</hi> Consort of Praises and Halelujahs, wherewith they laud and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Fountain of all their Happiness: I say when I consider these Things, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I am enabled by those <hi>glorious</hi> Hopes and Expectations to scorn and despise all Difficulties, and, if need require, even to embrace the Flames of Martyrdom: But as for those <hi>gentle</hi> Toils of <hi>watching</hi> and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> of <hi>keeping</hi> a <hi>constant</hi> Guard upon my self and contending against the Stream of my own <hi>depraved</hi> Inclinations; <hi>Lord!</hi> how <hi>inconsiderable</hi> they appear to me; And how heartily do I pity those <hi>miserable crest-fallen</hi> Souls that tamely suffer themselves to be frighted out of <hi>Heaven</hi> by such <hi>harmless</hi> Scare-crows. Thus while I stand on the <hi>Tiptoes</hi> of my <hi>Hope,</hi> and see <hi>Heaven</hi> at my
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:59595:44"/>
Journeys End, I over-look all Rubs and Hardships in my Way, and pass on trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly without minding them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when the <hi>Reward</hi> of our Obedience is so <hi>great,</hi> so infinitely <hi>transcending</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert of it, I am astonished to think that ever any <hi>reasonable</hi> Being should be so <hi>shameless</hi> and <hi>immodest,</hi> as to take any Notice of those <hi>trifling</hi> Difficulties that are in it: For with what Conscience can we account any Thing <hi>hard,</hi> the Reward whereof is a Crown of <hi>immortal</hi> Glory? How can our Voyage be <hi>troublesome,</hi> when our Port is the <hi>Indies</hi> of Pleasure? No, no; the Work can never be hard that hath <hi>Heaven</hi> for its Wages, the very Prospect whereof is enough to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to all the Difficulties in the Way to it, and to carry us through them not only with Ease but with Triumph. For he that hath <hi>Heaven</hi> for his Haven must be infinitely peevish if he quarrels at a <hi>rough Sea,</hi> and doth nor <hi>bless</hi> the Storms and Winds that are driving him thither.</p>
            <p>And thus I have proved to you at large that the Commands of <hi>God</hi> are not <hi>grievous,</hi> and that both because they are <hi>easie</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> Nature, and are made much more <hi>easie</hi> by our <hi>Blessed Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all that hath been said, I do foresee a <hi>material</hi> Objection that will be
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:59595:44"/>
made against this Discourse, and that is this; That it contradicts the <hi>universal</hi> Experience of Mankind. For do not the Generality of those Men that have attempted a <hi>religious</hi> Life find by Experience a great deal of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty? Are they not forced to <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>wrastle</hi> with themselves, and to do the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Violence to their <hi>own</hi> Inclinations? Are they not forced to keep themselves under a <hi>severe</hi> Discipline, to pray earnestly, and watch diligently to prevent the Surprises and Incursions of those Temptations that continually <hi>way-lay</hi> them wheresoever they are, and whatsoever they are about? And do they not many times find the difficulties so <hi>great,</hi> as that they are quite beaten off and utterly disheartned by them?</p>
            <p>All this I confess is very true, and may very well be so without any Prejudice to the Argument in hand; for we have not been discoursing of what <hi>Religion</hi> may acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally be, but of what it really is in it self. The Light in it self is <hi>pleasant</hi> to the Eye, but yet it may accidentally be <hi>grievous</hi> if the Eye be <hi>sore</hi> or <hi>weak,</hi> and not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure its Splendor. And so <hi>Religion,</hi> though in its self extremely <hi>easie,</hi> yet it may and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten doth become accidentally <hi>difficult</hi> to us, by Reason of those <hi>sinful</hi> Prejudices against it which we do too often contract in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:59595:45"/>
Course of a <hi>sinful</hi> Life But 'tis an <hi>unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Thing for Men to measure the Easiness of God's Laws not by their own <hi>intrinsick</hi> Nature, but by the Reluctancy and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which they find in their <hi>own</hi> Hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>them.</hi> For to a Man in a <hi>Fever</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing is <hi>bitter,</hi> but yet the Bitterness is not in the Honey he tasts, but in the Gall that overflows his <hi>own</hi> Palate. And so to a <hi>vicious</hi> Man every Virtue is a Burthen, but the Burthensomness is not so much in the Virtue as in his <hi>own</hi> Repugnancy to bear it. For I have already proved at large that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is every way <hi>agreeable</hi> to <hi>humane</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and therefore there can be no <hi>other</hi> Reason why it should not agree with us, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be that we disagree with our selves. We spoil <hi>our own</hi> Natures and do degenerate from the <hi>humane</hi> Nature into the <hi>brutal</hi> or <hi>diabolical</hi>; and what wonder is it that the <hi>Religion</hi> of a Man should be a Burthen to the Nature of a <hi>Beast</hi> or a <hi>Devil?</hi> But if we would take but a <hi>little</hi> Pains to retrieve our selves and weed out those <hi>unnatural</hi> Habits with which our Nature is over-grown, we should find that our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>That</hi> would very well accord, and then that which is our Burthen would become our Recreation. I confess before this can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, we must take a <hi>great</hi> deal of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59595:45"/>
Pains with our selves; we must <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> and <hi>strive</hi> and <hi>contend,</hi> and <hi>undergo</hi> the <hi>severe</hi> Discipline of a <hi>sorrowful</hi> Repentance, if ever we mean to recover our Natures a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But for God's sake consider Sirs, there is now no Remedy for this, and you may thank your selves for it; for you must undergo <hi>great</hi> Difficulties, take which side you please. If you resolve to continue as you are, you must be most <hi>wretched</hi> Slaves to your <hi>own</hi> Lusts; you must tamely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to all their <hi>tyrannical</hi> Commands, and run and go on every Errand they send you; and though they countermand <hi>each other,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> sends you <hi>this</hi> Way, and <hi>another</hi> the quite <hi>contrary</hi>; though <hi>Sloth</hi> pulls you back, and <hi>Ambition</hi> thrusts you forwards, and <hi>Covetousness</hi> bids you save, and <hi>Sensuality</hi> bids you spend; though <hi>Pride</hi> bids you strut, and <hi>Flattery</hi> bids you cringe, and there is as great a Confusion in their Wills and Commands as there was in the Language of the <hi>Brick-layers of Babel</hi>; and though in such a Huddle of Inconsistencies you are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at your Wits end, and know not what to do, yet you must be contented to endure the Hurry, and if you cannot do all at once, you must do what you can; and when you have done so, 'tis a thousand to one but there will be as many of your Lusts
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:59595:46"/>
dissatisfied as satisfied: And in the mean time while you are thus hurried about in the Crowd of your <hi>own sinful</hi> Desires, your <hi>wretched</hi> Conscience will <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>anon</hi> be alarming you with its <hi>ill-boding</hi> Horrors, and griping and twinging you with many an <hi>uneasie</hi> Reflection. Thus like <hi>miserable</hi> Gally-Slaves you must tug at the Oar, work against Wind and Tyde, and row through the Storms and Tempests of your <hi>own</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; and all this to run your selves upon a Rock, and invade your <hi>own</hi> Damnation. So that considering all, I dare say the Toil of being wicked is much more insupportable than that of a <hi>holy</hi> Life; and which is sad to consider, it hath no <hi>other</hi> Issue but <hi>eternal</hi> Ruin; <hi>for the wages of Sin,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>is death,</hi> Rom. vi.23. And methinks it should be very uncomfortable for a Man to work so hard for nothing but Misery, and even to earn his Damnation with the sweat of his Brows; especially considering, that the Toil and Drudgery of a <hi>sinful</hi> Life hath no End. For though Custom and Habit ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all <hi>other</hi> Things <hi>easie,</hi> yet by accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our selves to do <hi>Evil,</hi> we add to our Toil and render those <hi>cruel</hi> Taskmasters, our Lusts, more <hi>tyrannical</hi> and <hi>imposing</hi>; for still the more we gratify them, the more craving they will be, and the more impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:59595:46"/>
of denyal, and so by working for them we shall but increase <hi>our own</hi> Toil, and still acquire new Degrees of Labour and Drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. But as for the <hi>main</hi> Difficulty of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> it chiefly lies in the Entry to it; for there we must shake hands with all our <hi>dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> Lusts, and bid them adieu for ever; and to persuade our selves throughly to this is the <hi>main</hi> Difficulty of all; for then, to be sure, they will cling fastest about us, and use their <hi>utmost</hi> Oratory to stagger our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, and the <hi>old</hi> Love we have born them, and the <hi>dear</hi> Remembrance of the Pleasures which they have administred to us will make our Hearts relent and our Bowels yearn towards them. But if with all those <hi>mighty</hi> Arguments wherewith our <hi>Religion</hi> and our Reason furnishes us, and all those <hi>divine</hi> Assistances which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ask, and if we do, are assured to obtain, we can but conquer our Reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and heartily persuade our selves to part with them; this is the <hi>sharpest</hi> Brunt in all our <hi>spiritual</hi> Warfare; for now if we do but keep the ground that we have gotten, and maintain our Resolution against the Temptations that assault it, our Lusts will every day grow <hi>weaker</hi> and <hi>weaker,</hi> and that <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Ease,</hi> that <hi>Tranquility</hi> of Mind and <hi>Peace</hi> of Conscience which we shall feel
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:59595:47"/>
accruing to us out of the Discharge of our Duty, will by Degrees so indear and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturalize</hi> it to us, that at last it will be much <hi>harder</hi> for us to sin than to obey. Wherefore let us stand no longer, like <hi>naked Boys,</hi> shivering upon the Brinks of <hi>Religion,</hi> wishing that we were in, but afraid to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but let us consider <hi>seriously,</hi> resolve <hi>sincerely,</hi> and then leap in <hi>boldly</hi>; and though at first we may find it <hi>difficult</hi> to swim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Stream, and stem the Tyde of <hi>our own bad</hi> Inclinations; yet if we can but hold out couragiously a while, we shall feel the Current slacken by Degrees till the Tyde of Nature turn, and run the contrary Way; and then we shall be carried on with Ease and Delight, and swim chearfully and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly down with the Stream. For when once we have conquered the <hi>bad</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Nature, <hi>Religion</hi> will be a <hi>migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Ease and Refreshment to us, and we shall feel a thousand times more Pleasure and Satisfaction in it than ever we did in all our <hi>sinful</hi> Enjoyments; so that then we shall find the Truth of the Text, and be able to pronounce from <hi>our own</hi> Experience, that <hi>God's Commandments are not grievous.</hi>

               <p>I Have been discoursing concerning the Necessity of our loving of <hi>God</hi> in order to our being truly <hi>Religious,</hi> and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you at large that this is not only the <hi>great</hi> Principle of all <hi>Religion,</hi> but that of all <hi>others</hi> it is the most <hi>fruitful</hi> and <hi>operative.</hi> And now that I may lay this Foundation of <hi>true</hi> Religion in you, I shall explain to you the <hi>infinite</hi> Cause and Reason that we have to love him; and because Goodness is the Beauty of a <hi>reasonable</hi> Nature, and Beauty is the Object of Love, I shall endeavour to demonstrate to you the <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness of God, that I may thereby affect you with his Beauty; and if possible, inflame all your Souls with the Love of him. And that I may the more fully convince you of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Goodness, I shall endeavour to prove it from <hi>four</hi> distinct Topicks: 1. From the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; 2<hi>ly.</hi> From the <hi>Creation</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> 3<hi>ly.</hi> From the <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> And 4<hi>ly.</hi> From the <hi>Revelations</hi> he hath made to the World. And these I intend shall be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:59595:48"/>
the Arguments of <hi>four</hi> distinct Discourses; the three first of which lie plainly in the Text, <hi>Thou art good, and thou dost good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou art good:</hi> That plainly denotes what <hi>God</hi> is in himself, that he is <hi>naturally</hi> and <hi>es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially good</hi>; that he is of a most <hi>loving, kind,</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> Nature, and hath a most <hi>vehement</hi> Propension to do <hi>good</hi> to others founded in his <hi>immutable</hi> Being. <hi>Thou dost good:</hi> that denotes the Exercise and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going of this his <hi>essential</hi> Benevolence in the Works of his Creation and Providence; and that this his <hi>natural</hi> Propension to do <hi>good</hi> is not at all <hi>sleepy</hi> or <hi>unactive,</hi> that it is not a <hi>lazy</hi> and <hi>restive Woulding</hi> or <hi>Volition</hi>; but that it always <hi>sallies</hi> forth into Action, and doth most vigorously exercise it self either in making of Objects to imploy it self about, or in upholding and governing them when they are made. So that the Words contain these two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. What <hi>God</hi> is in himself; <hi>Thou art good.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2<hi>ly.</hi> What he is in those Actions that are determined without himself; <hi>Thou dost good.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. I begin with the first of these, What <hi>God</hi> is in himself. <hi>Thou art good,</hi> i. e. Thou art so <hi>essentially,</hi> and according to the <hi>unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable</hi> Propension of thy Nature. And this,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:59595:48"/>
as I told you, I shall in the <hi>first</hi> Place endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to demonstrate from the Nature of <hi>God,</hi> that is, from that <hi>intire</hi> Complexion of all <hi>possible</hi> Perfections whereof his Nature is composed. For in Order to our handling of this Argument, <hi>this</hi> must be premised, that <hi>God</hi> is a Being endowed with all <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Perfections, and consequently thereunto that he is infinitely <hi>powerful</hi> and infinitely <hi>wise</hi>; and consequently to <hi>that</hi> that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>Happy</hi>; and consequently to this, that he loves himself infinitely; and that all this is so, is very evident from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing. For first we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily suppose one <hi>Original Cause</hi> of all Things; for else we can give no <hi>possible</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how those Things, that once were not, could ever come into Being; and we must also as necessarily suppose that this <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Cause</hi> was <hi>Self-originated,</hi> i. e. that it received its Being and Existence from none but it self; for else it cannot be the <hi>Original Cause,</hi> but must it self be the Effect of some <hi>other</hi> Cause that was in Being before it: That existing of it self without <hi>any</hi> Cause, it is infinitely removed from <hi>Not-being</hi>; for that which is without <hi>any</hi> Cause can ever be without <hi>any</hi> Cause, meerly from that <hi>exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berant</hi> Fulness of Essence that is in it self. And that which can be for ever without any
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:59595:49"/>
Cause must necessarily be so, because this is a most <hi>necessary</hi> Act, and as such must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted <hi>ad extremum virium Agentis</hi>; conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to which we must also suppose, that <hi>that</hi> which is infinitely removed from <hi>Not-being</hi> hath the <hi>utmost</hi> Perfection of Essence in it. For the Notion of Essence, nakedly considered, is <hi>to be</hi>; and therefore by how much the more <hi>remote</hi> any Essence is from <hi>Not-Being,</hi> by so much the more perfect it must necessarily be. Again, in Consequence to this we must also suppose, that <hi>that</hi> which hath in it self, without any Cause, the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> Perfection of Essence, must have in it self also the <hi>utmost</hi> of all <hi>other</hi> Perfections that by way of <hi>Adjunct</hi> or <hi>Attribute,</hi> such an <hi>inexhaustible</hi> Essence is capable of; that is, that it must be <hi>Powerful</hi> and <hi>Wise,</hi> and whatsoever else is a possible Perfection of Essence. For Plenitude of Essence consists in being as much as it can be; and so long as <hi>any</hi> Being is capable of being any more than it is, it hath not all the <hi>possible</hi> Degrees of Essence in it; for every Perfection, that Essence by way of <hi>Attribute</hi> is <hi>capable</hi> of, is a Degree of <hi>positive</hi> Entity. Thus <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> are not <hi>meer</hi> Privations of <hi>Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> but Things that have some Degree of <hi>real positive</hi> Essence in them, and consequently what Being soever hath
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:59595:49"/>
not these, must necessarily have it in some Degrees of <hi>Not-Being</hi>; and 'tis impossible that any Essence should be infinitely remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Not-Being,</hi> which hath any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of <hi>Not-Being</hi> in it. Lastly, consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this we must also suppose, that a Being endowed with all <hi>possible</hi> Perfections, being infinitely <hi>Powerful</hi> and infinitely <hi>Wise,</hi> must needs be infinitely <hi>Happy</hi>; for wheresoever those <hi>great</hi> Perfections are, they must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily supply whatsoever is <hi>necessary</hi> to an <hi>infinite</hi> Happiness: And then from hence it nessarily follows, that a Being that is thus infinitely <hi>Happy</hi> must needs infinitely <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in it self; because within the <hi>vast</hi> Circumference of its own Being, it hath every Thing that it needs, desires, or affects. These are all <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> Deductions, and seem as naturally to follow from <hi>one another,</hi> as the most <hi>immediate</hi> Consequences do from <hi>First Principles.</hi> This therefore being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, which you see is very reasonable, that <hi>God</hi> is infinitely <hi>Powerful,</hi> and <hi>Wise,</hi> and <hi>Happy</hi>; and that because he is so, he loves himself infinitely; I doubt not but from each of these it will naturally follow, that he is also infinitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>benevolent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He is infinitely <hi>powerful</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is <hi>good.</hi> For Power is nothing but an Ability to act; and Action is the End of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:59595:50"/>
all Ability for Action: So that the greater any Power is, the farther it must necessarily be removed from Inactivity; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>infinite</hi> Power must be so infinitely removed from it, that it cannot be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to exist without Exercise; or if it could, yet it cannot be imagined that <hi>any</hi> Being, in whom <hi>infinite</hi> Power exists, should deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine with it self, that the <hi>best</hi> Use it could make of <hi>that</hi> Power, were to make no Use of it at all; because such a Being can with as much Ease to it self, act as not act. And therefore since every Being doth necessarily delight in the Exercise of its <hi>own</hi> Perfections, it cannot be supposed but a Being infinitely <hi>powerful</hi> should necessarily delight in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of its Power, when it can as easily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise it as suffer it to sleep on in <hi>eternal</hi> Inacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and consequently when it can exercise its Power <hi>more</hi> vigorously as easily as <hi>less,</hi> and can do <hi>more</hi> Things as easily as <hi>fewer,</hi> it must necessarily chuse to do it; because, as the having of Power inclines the Agent to act, so the having of <hi>more</hi> Power inclines it to act <hi>more</hi> vigorously. Wherefore if the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi> be a much <hi>greater</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Power than the doing of <hi>Evil,</hi> it will hence necessarily follow, that <hi>God</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infinitely <hi>powerful</hi> must be infinitely prone to do <hi>Good</hi>; because he cannot but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:59595:50"/>
be delighted in <hi>that</hi> whereby this <hi>great</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Nature is most vigorously Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised. But now for <hi>God</hi> to chuse to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Power in doing <hi>Mischief</hi> to <hi>others</hi> rather than <hi>Good,</hi> would be to chuse to do <hi>less</hi> rather than to do <hi>more,</hi> when <hi>both</hi> are equally easy to him; and consequently to lay a <hi>needless</hi> Restriction upon the Exercise of his Power; and so far to render it <hi>useless</hi> and in <hi>vain.</hi> For in doing Mischief to <hi>others,</hi> he must be supposed either wholly to <hi>annihilate</hi> them, or to make them <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and continue them so; but by doing <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> he must be supposed either to uphold them in those Beings he gave them, or to perfect those Beings; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render them as <hi>happy</hi> as their Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities will bear: And certainly to do either of the <hi>later</hi> is a much more <hi>vigorous</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Power, than to do either of the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> For, for <hi>God</hi> to <hi>annihilate</hi> Beings, or reduce them to Nothing, is rather to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Power from them than to exercise it upon them; because that which is not of it self, cannot continue to be of it self, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Nature of the Thing as possible for a Thing to be of it self in the <hi>first</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its Existence, as to be of it self in any Moment of its Duration. So that the Continuance of our Being, and the Original
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:59595:51"/>
of it must necessarily be owing to the <hi>same</hi> Power; and consequently, as our Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in <hi>Not-Being</hi> must necessarily have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon the <hi>Non-exercise</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Power, so our Relapse into <hi>Not-being</hi> must as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow from the Discontinuance of the Exercise of <hi>this</hi> Power. So that to our <hi>Annihilation</hi> there needs no more than the <hi>bare</hi> Suspension of the Exercise of <hi>Almighty</hi> Power upon us, or a ceasing to uphold us in Being; for to the upholding us in Being, there is required a <hi>continued</hi> Exertion of that <hi>creative</hi> Power that first brought us into Being; for if we can exist of our selves <hi>this one</hi> Moment, we might as well have done so the Moment <hi>before,</hi> and may as well do so the Moment <hi>after</hi>; and so <hi>backward</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> So that unless we had such an <hi>exuberant</hi> Fulness of Essence in us as to exist of <hi>our selves</hi> from all <hi>Eternity past</hi> to all <hi>Eternity to come,</hi> we cannot exist so much as <hi>one</hi> Moment without <hi>new</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of Being from that <hi>infinite</hi> Fountain whence we were originally derived; and that we are <hi>this</hi> Moment, is as much the Effect of God's Power, as that we were <hi>that</hi> Moment when we <hi>first</hi> came into Being. So that whereas by <hi>annihilating</hi> us <hi>God</hi> would chuse to exercise no Power at all, that is, to render <hi>his own</hi> Omnipotence <hi>useless</hi> by giving
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:59595:51"/>
it a <hi>Quietus</hi> from Action; by upholding us in Being his Power is still as vigorously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised about us as it was in the <hi>first</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Creation; and therefore by <hi>how much</hi> more <hi>suitable</hi> it is to <hi>infinite</hi> Power to <hi>act</hi> than to be <hi>idle,</hi> by so much more <hi>suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> to it it must necessarily be to uphold us in <hi>our</hi> Beings, than to <hi>annihilate</hi> and destroy us.</p>
               <p>And then for making us <hi>miserable</hi> and continuing us so, it is a much <hi>less vigorous</hi> Exercise of Power than to perfect our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and thereby to render us <hi>happy.</hi> And verily should <hi>God</hi> turn the whole World into one <hi>intire</hi> Globe of <hi>unquenchable Fire,</hi> and continue its <hi>wretched</hi> Inhabitants <hi>for ever</hi> weltring in its Flames, I should not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this as so <hi>great</hi> an Act of <hi>Omnipotence</hi> as it is to perfect our <hi>rational</hi> Nature so as to render it immutably and eternally <hi>happy.</hi> For to the making of any Being <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> there is required many <hi>more</hi> Causes and many <hi>more</hi> Acts than there is to the making them <hi>miserable.</hi> For the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of Misery consists in the Privation of Happiness, and for <hi>God</hi> to deprive his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Happiness is not so much the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise as Non-exercise of his Power; for then he deprives us of it when he ceases to do any Thing for us, and refuses to produce or
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:59595:52"/>
to contribute to the producing of what tends to <hi>our</hi> Happiness: So that this Part of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery consisting in a <hi>mere</hi> Privation is not so properly the Effect of the Exercise of Power, as of the Suspension of the Exercise of Power. So that unless we can suppose that the <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Creator of the World chuses rather not to act than to act, we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily suppose that he chuses rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow Happiness on his Creatures, than to deprive them of it. And as for the <hi>positive</hi> Part of Misery which consists in Pain and Torment, I dare appeal to any Man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not much more <hi>easie</hi> to vex and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any Being than it is to render it <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.</hi> For even a Child can put a Man, yea an <hi>Elephant</hi> to Pain; but to make a <hi>sick</hi> Man <hi>well,</hi> a <hi>poor</hi> Man <hi>prosperous,</hi> a <hi>mad</hi> Man <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or a <hi>Fool wise,</hi> are such <hi>mighty</hi> Things as do most commonly transcend all <hi>humane</hi> Power whatsoever. But then to retrieve such <hi>imperfect</hi> Beings as we from the Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Sense and Sensuality, and from being almost <hi>Beasts</hi> to raise us up by Degrees to an <hi>equal</hi> Height with <hi>Angels,</hi> to fill and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inlarge the <hi>narrow</hi> Capacities of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures till by filling they are widened almost to Infinity, and yet still to supply them with <hi>new</hi> Degrees of Happiness proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their <hi>vast</hi> enlargements, is a Work
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:59595:52"/>
that highly deserves to be the <hi>eternal</hi> Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Omnipotence it self.</p>
               <p>Since therefore the End of Power to act is Action, and every Thing naturally inclines to its End, and consequently the <hi>greater</hi> the Power of any Being is, the <hi>greater</hi> is its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to Activity; and since the doing of <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi> is a much <hi>greater</hi> Exercise of Power than the doing of <hi>Mischief</hi>; it hence necessarily follows, that <hi>God</hi> being <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> must thereby be infinitely inclined to do <hi>Good,</hi> and that because doing <hi>Good</hi> is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely the <hi>largest</hi> Sphere of Activity. So that if when 'tis equally <hi>possible</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> for him to do <hi>Good,</hi> as not, he should chuse not to do it, he would chuse directly contrary to the <hi>necessary</hi> Inclination of an Omnipotent Being, which is to do that which is the <hi>greatest</hi> Exercise of Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly. God</hi> is infinitely <hi>Wise,</hi> and therefore he is <hi>Good.</hi> For the <hi>greatest</hi> Wisdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in proposing the <hi>worthiest</hi> Ends, and chusing the <hi>properest</hi> Means to obtain them. Wherefore if doing <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi> be the <hi>worthiest</hi> End that <hi>God</hi> can propose to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, it will necessarily follow that by the Infinity of his Wisdom he is inclined to do <hi>Good.</hi> For as his Power inclines him to act, so his Wisdom inclines him to act for the <hi>worthiest</hi> End; but doing <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:59595:53"/>
is evidently the <hi>worthiest</hi> End that <hi>God</hi> can be supposed to aim at; for it cannot be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that he can design any further <hi>Good</hi> to himself, any <hi>new</hi> Addition to the <hi>vast</hi> Treasure of his Happiness; which is so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>full</hi> that it can admit of no Increase: So that whatsoever he doth besides the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying of himself, he cannot be supposed to do for any <hi>Self-end</hi>; because he hath all that <hi>Good</hi> already within himself that he can pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly either desire or aim at. So that all those Actions of <hi>God</hi> which are terminated without <hi>himself,</hi> must have either no End at all, which cannot be supposed of the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an <hi>All-wise</hi> Agent, or else they must have for their End either the Happiness or the Misery of others; but to make the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of <hi>others</hi> their End is by no Means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with his infinite Wisdom. For to make <hi>pure abstracted</hi> Evil the End of Action is so far from being infinitely <hi>wise,</hi> that 'tis impossible; because the very Notion of an End necessarily includes <hi>Good</hi> in it, either <hi>real</hi> or <hi>apparent</hi>; but <hi>God</hi> can reap no <hi>Good</hi> from the Misery of <hi>others,</hi> because he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>happy</hi> already; and to be sure <hi>others</hi> can reap no <hi>Good</hi> from that which <hi>God</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be their Misery; that <hi>that</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should be God's End which is no End, which hath nothing of the Nature of an
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59595:53"/>
End in it, implies a <hi>plain</hi> Contradiction. So that to say that the End of God's Actions is the Misery of <hi>others,</hi> is all one as to say he acts for no End at all; and how an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>wise</hi> Agent can be said to act at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> to do Things without any <hi>Level</hi> or <hi>Aim,</hi> I cannot apprehend. But supposing it were possible that <hi>pure Evil</hi> might be an End, yet it is as evident as the Sun that it cannot be the End of <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom; for <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom necessarily inclines to do that which is <hi>wisest</hi>; but if it were in it self <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> to the <hi>Almighty</hi> whether he did <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> yet his <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom would incline him to do <hi>Good</hi>; because in the doing of <hi>Good</hi> there is much more Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom exercised, than in the doing of <hi>Evil.</hi> For what <hi>great</hi> Skill doth it require in an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi> Agent to make <hi>others</hi> miserable? If it hath a mind to turn them out of Being, 'tis but withdrawing that <hi>Almighty</hi> Arm that upholds them, and they will presently sink into Nothing of their own Accord; but what great Wisdom is there in it, thus to unravel his <hi>own</hi> Workmanship, to weave a <hi>Penelope's Web,</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> and <hi>undo</hi> eternally? And if he hath a Mind to make them <hi>miser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and continue them so, it is but suspend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>Almighty</hi> Influence, and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to concur to their Happiness, and they
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:59595:54"/>
will soon be as <hi>miserable</hi> as Misery can make them. I confess to invent an <hi>acute</hi> Torture requires some Skill; but yet we plainly see that a very <hi>little</hi> Wit joyned with a <hi>great</hi> deal of Malice and Cruelty is sufficient to make an <hi>exquisite</hi> Tormentor; since even Men of very <hi>ordinary</hi> Understanding have invented as <hi>sharp</hi> Torments as Men are able to bear. So that for <hi>God</hi> to do <hi>Evil</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires very <hi>little</hi> Contrivance, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is so far from being an Exercise <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> of his <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom, that not only a <hi>finite</hi> but a very <hi>shallow</hi> Understanding, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>sufficient</hi> Power and Malice, can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and inflict as <hi>exquisite</hi> Tortures as is possible for any Being to bear. But to the <hi>perfecting</hi> of Beings and rendring them <hi>hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,</hi> especially of <hi>free</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Beings, there is required a <hi>long</hi> series of <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable</hi> Contrivance; for to the effecting of this <hi>noble</hi> End, there are so many Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be removed, so many <hi>concurrent</hi> Means to be employed, such an <hi>incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Skill required in the Choice of such as are most <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>effectual,</hi> and <hi>methodizing</hi> them into such a <hi>regular</hi> Connexion with, and Dependence upon <hi>one another,</hi> as that they may all successively <hi>second</hi> and promote <hi>each other,</hi> that even the Wisdom of <hi>God,</hi> how <hi>infinite</hi> so ever it be, may here find
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:59595:54"/>
Scope and Matter enough to employ and exercise it self for ever. And I dare appeal to any <hi>reasonable</hi> Man whether in that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of <hi>saving</hi> Souls which <hi>God</hi> hath reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in his <hi>Gospel,</hi> (though yet we cannot see all, because we are not able to discern the <hi>admirable</hi> Connexion it hath with the <hi>whole</hi> series of <hi>divine</hi> Providence) there be not infinitely <hi>more</hi> Wisdom and <hi>rare</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, than an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> Being need to imploy in effecting the <hi>greatest</hi> Mischief ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; whether in the contriving of Laws so <hi>suitable</hi> to, and <hi>perfective</hi> of our Nature, and in the composing such <hi>unanswerable</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Motives to press and engage us to the Observance of them; and in all that <hi>admirable</hi> Series of Providences, by which he <hi>seconds</hi> and forces those Reasons, he hath not exercised incomparably more Wisdom than he could have done in effecting the <hi>greatest Evil</hi> in Nature. As for Example, suppose he should have designed to kindle some mighty <hi>unquenchable</hi> Flame in some <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>dismal</hi> Recess of the World, with a Resolution to hurl all <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, without any Respect or Consideration; this doubtless would have been as <hi>great</hi> a Mischief as can well be imagined; but what Contrivance doth it ask for an <hi>Almighty</hi> Being to accomplish such a <hi>direful</hi> End?
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:59595:55"/>
Could not he have roasted a <hi>little</hi> World of Worms, and tortured a Company of Beings that are not able to resist him, without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom in the Management and Contrivance of it? Or, Which will as well serve my Argument, could there have needed as much Wisdom to design and effect <hi>this,</hi> as there did to contrive and manage the great Methods of our Salvation? Sure no man can be so senseless as to imagine it. Well then, if <hi>God</hi> be infinitely Wise, and Doing the <hi>greatest Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi> be a much <hi>higher</hi> Exercise of Wisdom than doing the <hi>greatest Evil,</hi> it will hence necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that even his <hi>infinite</hi> Wisdom must needs incline him to do <hi>Good.</hi> For as the End of Power is to act, so the End of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is to act wisely; and every Thing, as I told you, inclines to its End, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the more Wisdom it hath, the more wisely it is inclined to act: Wherefore since doing <hi>Good</hi> is the <hi>greatest</hi> Act of Wisdom, <hi>God,</hi> who is infinitely <hi>wise,</hi> must needs be infinitely inclined there unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>ly. God</hi> is infinitely <hi>happy,</hi> and therefore he is <hi>good:</hi> for God's <hi>infinite</hi> Happiness doth necessarily exclude all Want, all Desire, and all Prospect of any Degree of Happiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what he enjoys; and where all these are excluded there can be no <hi>Self-end:</hi> For
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:59595:55"/>
a <hi>Self-end</hi> is some <hi>Good</hi> desired and aimed at, which yet we are not possessed of; and if <hi>God</hi> hath no <hi>Self-end,</hi> he can have no End at all, but only to do <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others.</hi> But perhaps you will <hi>object,</hi> how can you say that <hi>God</hi> hath no <hi>Self-end,</hi> when the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> so plainly tells us that <hi>his own</hi> Glory is his End, and this End he doth as well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain by doing <hi>Hurt</hi> as by doing <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>others</hi>; by damning of <hi>some,</hi> as well as by saving of <hi>others?</hi> To which I answer, that if by the Glory of <hi>God</hi> you mean any Thing else but the <hi>free</hi> Communication of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to others, it is false to say that <hi>his</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is <hi>his</hi> End; and if this be <hi>his</hi> Glory, then what I said is infallibly <hi>true,</hi> that the <hi>only</hi> End of <hi>God</hi> is to do <hi>Good.</hi> But if you think that his Glory consists in being <hi>praised</hi> and <hi>commended, admired</hi> and <hi>applauded</hi> by his <hi>poor impotent</hi> Creatures, you have very <hi>mean</hi> Conceptions of him, if you think that this is his <hi>last</hi> End. For what Advantage is it to <hi>God,</hi> that we applaud and commend him? Can the Praises and <hi>Panegyricks</hi> of a <hi>small</hi> Handful of Breath either make him more <hi>glorious</hi> than he is, or more <hi>glorious</hi> in <hi>his own</hi> Esteem? Alas! No; He is an <hi>infinite</hi> Stage and Theater to himself, his Prospect being every way <hi>adequate</hi> to his Glory, and his Glory as <hi>unbounded</hi> as <hi>Eternity</hi> it self: So that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:59595:56"/>
if all his Creation should joyn Hearts and Voices to extol and laud him, yet they could not add either <hi>one</hi> Spark to his Glory, or <hi>one</hi> Degree to that <hi>infinite</hi> Satisfaction he takes in it. So that when we have praised him as much as we are able, he is still but as <hi>glorious</hi> as he was before, and he still knows that he deserves infinitely more Praises than we are able to render him. And how can it be imagined that he who is so infinitely <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> with himself, and hath such <hi>infinite</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for it, should find any need of our <hi>poor</hi> Praises and Commendations? And if he finds no Need of it, how can he propose it to himself as the End of his Actions, since the End of Action is always some <hi>Good,</hi> which yet we have not, but do desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy? 'Tis true he doth command us to <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>laud</hi> and <hi>acknowledge</hi> him, but he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us <hi>this</hi> as he doth all <hi>other</hi> Things, not for <hi>his own</hi> Good, but for <hi>ours.</hi> He bids us extol and admire his Perfections, that by <hi>that</hi> he might engage us to transcribe and imitate them, and so by glorifying <hi>him</hi> to glorify <hi>our</hi> selves; So that still the Glory that he designs and aims at consists not in receiving any <hi>Good</hi> from us, but in doing and communicating of <hi>Good</hi> to us. And therefore though it is <hi>true</hi> that <hi>God</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this <hi>great</hi> End of his Glory as well in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:59595:56"/>
                  <hi>damning</hi> of <hi>some</hi> as in <hi>saving</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> it is not because he reaps any <hi>Good</hi> from it, but because he doth <hi>Good</hi> by it. For if he should <hi>damn</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> any Being without any <hi>good</hi> Reason, he could not expect so much as to be praised and commended for it; but if he doth it for <hi>good</hi> Reason, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is <hi>good</hi> either for <hi>himself</hi> or <hi>others</hi>: For <hi>himself</hi> it cannot be, for how can an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitely <hi>happy</hi> Being reap any Degree of <hi>Good</hi> from <hi>anothers</hi> Misery and Punishment? And therefore it must be for the <hi>Good</hi> of <hi>others,</hi> that they by the Example of those whom he punishes may be warned from incurring those Sins for which he punishes them, and from running away from <hi>their own</hi> Duty and Happiness. So that even the End of Punishment is to do <hi>Good,</hi> and this is the <hi>great</hi> Glory that <hi>God</hi> aims at in doing it. And indeed considering that <hi>God</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>happy,</hi> there is no <hi>other</hi> Glory but this that he can propose as the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> End of his Actions. For all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination that is in any Being either not to do <hi>Good,</hi> or to do <hi>Hurt</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> arises from Indigence and Insufficiency; either we envy or we covet the <hi>Good</hi> which <hi>another</hi> enjoys, the <hi>former</hi> of which restrains us from adding any more <hi>Good</hi> to him, as the <hi>latter</hi> excites us to deprive him of that which he is
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59595:57"/>
already possessed of; both which do appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently arise from the Want and Indigence of <hi>Good</hi> in our selves. But now in <hi>God</hi> there being no Want of <hi>Good,</hi> it is impossible there should be either Envy or Avarice in him; and both these being excluded, there can be no Temptation at all in his Nature either not to do <hi>Good,</hi> or to do <hi>Hurt</hi> to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi> For we see among Men, the more <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> they are, the <hi>less good</hi> still they desire for <hi>themselves,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> for <hi>others.</hi> Since therefore the <hi>great God</hi> is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>perfect</hi> and infinitely <hi>happy,</hi> it is impossible he should desire any <hi>Good</hi> for himself; and therefore if he act for any <hi>Good</hi> at all, as he cannot but do, it must be for ours. For</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly, <hi>God</hi> loves himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely, and therefore cannot but be <hi>good.</hi> For whatsoever Being loves it self, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily love its <hi>own</hi> Resemblance and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for that which is lovely in us is lovely in <hi>another,</hi> and if there be any Reason why we should love <hi>our selves,</hi> there is the same Reason why we should love <hi>another</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles us in those Things for which we love our selves. 'Tis true, we <hi>poor imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Creatures do many times love our selves without Reason, out of a meer <hi>blind</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus and <hi>necessary</hi> Instinct of Nature. But <hi>God,</hi> being infinitely <hi>wise</hi> governs all his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:59595:57"/>
Motions by the <hi>wisest</hi> Rules, and doth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing for the <hi>best</hi> and most <hi>excellent</hi> Reasons; and consequently doth not love himself he cannot tell why, out of any <hi>blind unaccountable</hi> Instinct in his Nature; but he loves himself so far only as he hath Reason to do it, and 'tis because he hath <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> Reason for it that he loves himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely: And the Reason why he loves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to that <hi>infinite</hi> Degree that he doth, is because he is infinitely <hi>perfect,</hi> and so hath <hi>infinite</hi> Reason to be delighted and satisfied with himself; and this being the Reason, he cannot but love <hi>others</hi> that resemble him in that for which he loves <hi>himself.</hi> For though <hi>others</hi> cannot be infinitely <hi>happy</hi> as he is, yet they are <hi>happy</hi> in such a Degree as there Capacities will bear; and when they are so, he hath the same Reason, though not so much, to love them as he hath to love himself. And he that loves Happiness in <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> as well as in <hi>himself,</hi> will not only love it where it is already, but be very much inclined to propagate it where it is not. So that this, I think, is a most <hi>plain</hi> Case, that if Perfection and Happiness be the Reason of God's love, he cannot but love it in <hi>another</hi> as well as in <hi>himself</hi>; and if he love it in <hi>another,</hi> he cannot but be incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to contribute to the producing it. And
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59595:58"/>
therefore unless we suppose <hi>God,</hi> contrary to the <hi>Genius</hi> of all other Beings, not to love <hi>his own</hi> Resemblance, nor to be at all concerned to propagate it; we must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily suppose him to be <hi>Good,</hi> or which is all one, inclined to make others <hi>happy.</hi> And to say that <hi>God</hi> loves Happiness in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> but yet that he affects to make <hi>others</hi> miserable without any Prospect of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>himself,</hi> is to say that he loves Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries in different Objects, that is, Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in <hi>himself,</hi> and Misery in <hi>others</hi>; which is to make his Love to be guided by the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant</hi> Impulses of a <hi>mutable</hi> Fancy, and not by the <hi>steady</hi> Rules of Wisdom. But since it is impossible for any Being to love that which is contrary to himself, we may be sure that <hi>God</hi> cannot love Misery, whose Nature is so infinitely <hi>happy</hi>; and since I am sure that every Being must love its own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, if it love it self; I am as sure that <hi>God</hi> loves that <hi>others</hi> should be happy, as I can be that he is so <hi>himself.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus I have endeavoured from the very Nature of <hi>God</hi> to demonstrate this <hi>great</hi> Truth to you, <hi>That he is good</hi>; and plainly proved to you that by all those <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> Perfections which are the <hi>necessary</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults of his Self-existence he is most strongly and vehemently inclined to do <hi>good</hi> to others.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59595:58"/>
And now to conclude all, we will briefly consider what Use may be made of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for the Guidance and Conduct of our Lives and Actions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, if <hi>God</hi> be <hi>good,</hi> this may serve to support us under all the <hi>sad</hi> Events that befall us in this World. For what <hi>greater</hi> Satisfaction than this can any <hi>reasonable</hi> Man desire, to be under the Government of, and to have all his Affairs disposed by a <hi>God</hi> that cannot but be <hi>good?</hi> For now all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and Accidents that befall us must be what <hi>God</hi> intends and designs them, because he hath the Management and Disposal of them all; and to be sure a <hi>good God</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have an <hi>ill</hi> Design upon his Creatures. 'Tis true, when his Creatures prove Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, he may and doth <hi>chastise</hi> and punish them; but even in doing thus he hath a most <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Design, namely, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Offender himself; or to make him a <hi>publick</hi> Example to all the <hi>rational</hi> World, that they may take warning by his Ruin, and not run upon the Rock that dashed him in pieces. And to punish Offenders is as great an act of Mercy to the <hi>Publick,</hi> as it is to reward the <hi>Loyal</hi> and <hi>Obedient</hi>; for if out of a <hi>fond</hi> Indulgence to <hi>insolent</hi> Rebels he should let them go on in a State of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, the <hi>Publick</hi> would suffer a great deal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59595:59"/>
more by it than those Rebels can do by a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>deserved</hi> Punishment; for their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity would embolden <hi>others</hi> to take the same Courses, and so the Contagion would run on without any stop from <hi>one</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> till the Whole were infected, and the Plague of Wickedness became <hi>Epidemical</hi> to all the <hi>reasonable</hi> Creation; and so by sparing a <hi>few</hi> he would destroy a great <hi>many,</hi> and his Mercy to <hi>Particulars</hi> would be Cruelty to the <hi>Whole.</hi> But so long as we are <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in our Obedience to <hi>God,</hi> we may be sure that whatsoever befalls us in particular is intended for our <hi>good</hi>; for he cannot intend Hurt to an <hi>honest</hi> Soul without doing <hi>open</hi> Violence to his own Goodness; because the Hurt of such an one is a <hi>pure</hi> Mischief; it can serve no <hi>good</hi> End, but is likely to prove a <hi>greater</hi> Prejudice to the <hi>Publick,</hi> than it can be to the Person that endures it: For as the Impunity of <hi>great</hi> Offenders will imbolden <hi>others</hi> to offend, so the ruining of <hi>obedient</hi> Subjects will discourage <hi>others</hi> from obeying. So that to design Hurt or Damage to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely <hi>good</hi> Man is to do Mischief for its own sake, and this can proceed from nothing but <hi>pure abstracted</hi> Malice, which is the very <hi>Quintessence</hi> of a Devil; but I am sure can have no Room in the Breast of our <hi>good God</hi> and <hi>merciful Father.</hi> I confess in this Life
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:59595:59"/>
all Things do fall out so alike to all, that 'tis impossible for us to judge of God's <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Design and Intention towards us by the Nature of the Things that we suffer; and therefore in this Case the only <hi>infallible</hi> Course we can take is throughly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially to examine our selves, and if upon a <hi>seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Review of our own Hearts and Ways we can truly say that we have been <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and our Duty, we may be as sure that he designs <hi>good</hi> to us in all those Afflictions that he lays upon us, as we can be that there is such a Being as <hi>God</hi> in the World. And if for the Time <hi>past</hi> we should find that we have been <hi>bad</hi> and <hi>false</hi> and <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical</hi>; yet since <hi>God</hi> still continues us in this Life of Tryal, and permits us the Priviledge of being <hi>Candidates</hi> and <hi>Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners</hi> for the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Preferments, we may safely conclude from the Goodness of his Nature that whatsoever he doth to us he designs as no Harm; for how can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined that the <hi>good God</hi> should design our Misery at that very time, while he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues us in a Probation for Happiness? Wherefore let us chearfully undergo what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he lays upon us, concluding that there is nothing but <hi>Good</hi> can come from a <hi>good God</hi>; that even his Punishments are <hi>cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> and all his Rods dip'd in Love; and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59595:60"/>
though they may smart severely, and fetch Blood from our very Hearts; yet let us determine with our selves that they must be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> according as <hi>God</hi> intends them, and that the <hi>good God</hi> must needs intend them for <hi>good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Is God thus naturally and essentially <hi>good</hi>? Then this may serve for an <hi>excellent</hi> Standard whereby to judge of our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Religion.</hi> For most Opinions in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> have either a <hi>near</hi> or <hi>remote</hi> Tendency to the Honour and Dishonour of God's Goodness; and though I will not say that every Opinion is <hi>true</hi> that seems to extol and advance the Goodness of God, yet I am sure that every Opinion must be <hi>false</hi> that doth either directly or by <hi>true</hi> Consequence deny or disgrace it. For let our Opinions be <hi>true</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> yet this I am sure is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally <hi>true,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>good</hi>; and while I am sure of this, I can never believe any Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin <hi>true</hi> that thwarts and contradicts it; because I am sure that from Truth there is nothing but Truth can be inferred through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>longest</hi> Train of Deductions. This therefore we ought to be infinitely cautious of, how we entertain any Opinion whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that seems but to clash with the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>God</hi>; for if it but seem to do so, we are bound by all the Zeal we owe to the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>

Goodness to suspect it of Fashood, or at least not to be over-confident of its Truth till we see it fairly acquitted of that <hi>foul</hi> Imputation. For to preserve in our Minds <hi>consistent</hi> Opinions of the Goodness of <hi>God</hi> is a thing that we ought to be as careful of, as of the Apple of our own Eyes; because an <hi>ill</hi> Opinon of <hi>God</hi> is a Flaw in the very Foundation of our <hi>Religion</hi> and our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and it will be impossible for us to serve him long, either with Sincerity or with Pleasure, if we do not firmly believe him to be a <hi>good</hi> Master.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Is <hi>God</hi> thus naturally and essential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>good</hi>? Then this may serve to hearten and encourage us in his Service.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:59595:61"/>
and graciously receive us again into his Mercy and Favour; that he will not be <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>stingy</hi> in the Recompence of our Duty to him, but reward us a Thousand-fold with such <hi>immense</hi> Glories and Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, as shall make us <hi>for ever</hi> bless the Moment we entred into his Service: All these things we may confidently conclude and build upon from the <hi>transcending</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Nature. And what <hi>greater</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement can we expect, or desire? Why then are we afraid, O <hi>foolish</hi> Souls, that we are! Why are we afraid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in his Service? Where can we hope to find a more <hi>gracious, compassionate,</hi> and <hi>bountiful</hi> Master; one that will be more ready to help and to pity, to pardon and reward us? If there be any <hi>equal</hi> Rival to <hi>God</hi> in all the World, any in whose Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you can ingage your selves with <hi>equal</hi> Hopes and Incouragements; go on and prosper in the Service of that <hi>great</hi> Rival. But if <hi>God</hi> be infinitely the <hi>best</hi> Master in the World, as doubtless he is, Why do we stand Debating the Case any longer? Why do we not run at least as chearfully to his Service, as we would to the <hi>greatest</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement that any <hi>Mortal</hi> Prince can ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us? In the name of <hi>God,</hi> Sirs, be once so <hi>Wise</hi> as to consult <hi>your own</hi> Interest, and

do not stand any longer in <hi>your own</hi> Light. Behold the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> God stands ready to entertain you, and condescends to invite you to the most <hi>glorious</hi> Service that ever was; a Service that is most <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> that is intermixt with <hi>infinite</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Sweetness, and crowned with the Reward of all that an <hi>everlasting</hi> Heaven means.

               <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly, From hence I infer, that it is an <hi>unreasonable</hi> Thing for Men to suspect the Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> because of some <hi>uncertain</hi> Appearances in the World to the contrary. For from the very Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of God's Nature we are certainly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured that he must be <hi>good,</hi> which is the <hi>highest</hi> Demonstration that Things are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of; and therefore to suspect his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon the Account of some <hi>little</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances to the contrary, is to confront De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations with <hi>slender</hi> Probabilities, and <hi>over-rule</hi> a Certainty with a <hi>doubtful</hi> Guess. And yet how common is it for Men to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign the Goodness of <hi>God</hi> meerly upon the Account of some <hi>visible</hi> Effects of his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which to their <hi>narrow</hi> Apprehensions
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:59595:62"/>
seem <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>mischievous</hi>; as if we had such an <hi>intire</hi> Prospect of all the Relations and Tendencies of God's Actions, as that none could possibly appear either <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> to us, but what is really so. Whereas, <hi>God</hi> knows, we are a company of <hi>miserable short-sighted</hi> Creatures, and are not able to see from the Beginning to the End of any <hi>one</hi> Action in all the Train of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; so that though <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Action may appear <hi>evil</hi> to us, considered singly and in the <hi>present</hi> Effects of it, yet in it self it may be highly <hi>good,</hi> considering what a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence it hath upon what went before, and what a Tendency it hath to what is to follow after. For <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>infinite</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension having all Things <hi>present</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> him, hath so ranked and disposed them, that from <hi>first</hi> to <hi>last</hi> they are all but one <hi>complicated</hi> and orderly <hi>united</hi> Means to bring about those <hi>great</hi> Ends which he first designed and intended; and consequently all the Passages in the World in his <hi>provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential</hi> Dominion over them have a <hi>strict</hi> and <hi>mutual</hi> Dependence on each other, and so cannot be judged of <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> from <hi>one another,</hi> there being no one Action but relates to <hi>Millions</hi> of others, yea to all others from the <hi>first</hi> to the <hi>last</hi> Link of Action in the whole Chain of Providence. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:59595:62"/>
for us to measure the Goodness of God's Providence in <hi>general</hi> by those <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> Parts of it that lie before us, is just as if a Man should judge of a whole <hi>Consort</hi> of Musick only by hearing <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Notes of a <hi>well-composed</hi> Lesson, whereas the whole <hi>Harmony</hi> consists in a <hi>well-composed</hi> Mixture of a <hi>thousand</hi> Notes and Discords, wherein all the particulars are so interwoven as that the <hi>several</hi> Notes <hi>united</hi> in one Lesson have a most <hi>excellent Symetry</hi> and Proportion to <hi>one another.</hi> For in the whole Consort of the <hi>divine</hi> Providence there are a <hi>thousand</hi> Discords, which, to us who hear them <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> from the rest, do many times yield a very <hi>ungrateful</hi> Sound; whereas could we discern but the whole Composure, and hear how elegantly all thole Discords are mingled into one <hi>entire</hi> Harmony, we should never be able to forbear <hi>admiring</hi> the Skill, and <hi>adoring</hi> the Wisdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the great <hi>Harmostes.</hi> But since 'tis so impossible for us to discern all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections and Tendencies of God's Actions, how unreasonable is it for us to censure the Goodness of his Nature, because there are some Actions of his, and some Effects of those Actions, whose Goodness at present we are not able to discover. Wherefore, if we have either Reason or Modesty in us,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:59595:63"/>
we ought to be satisfied with those Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Goodness that are drawn from the Principles of his Nature, and though we cannot account for the Goodness of all his Actions in <hi>particular,</hi> yet firmly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve that nothing but <hi>Good</hi> can come from a <hi>good God.</hi>

               <p>I Proceed to the second Part of the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that flow from the <hi>immutable</hi> Goodness of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; <hi>Thou dost good:</hi> And these as they flow from the Goodness of God's Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so they are <hi>plain</hi> Proofs and Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it. For as the Nature of Things is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable</hi> by their <hi>Effects</hi> as well as their <hi>Causes,</hi> so the Goodness of God may be as well demonstrated by the <hi>Operations</hi> it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts, and the <hi>Effects</hi> it produces in the World, as by those Principles and Perfections of his Nature from whence it necessarily arises. And it is as certain that <hi>that</hi> Being must be <hi>good</hi> that hath all the <hi>necessary</hi> Causes and Principles of Goodness in it; for if it were <hi>indifferent</hi> to the <hi>Almighty</hi> whether he did <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil,</hi> he would doubtless either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire from Action and do neither, or else he would do as much <hi>Mischief</hi> as <hi>Good</hi>; or if he were inclined to do <hi>ill</hi> he would do it, and not force himself to act contrary to his own Inclinations. Wherefore since he doth
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:59595:64"/>
                  <hi>Good</hi> so constantly and so universally, he can neither be supposed to be <hi>averse</hi> nor <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different</hi> to it; and if he be neither of these, his doing <hi>Good</hi> must necessarily proceed from the <hi>immutable</hi> Inclination of his Nature thereunto. If therefore we can prove from the whole Course and Series of God's <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> that he doth <hi>Good,</hi> it will be an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> Argument that he is so. Now all those <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that pass out of <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and terminate upon <hi>others</hi> are reduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi>; both which will afford us <hi>abundant</hi> Instances of the Truth of the Text, that <hi>God doth Good.</hi>

                  <item>1. That whatsoever Beings are <hi>incapable</hi> of Happiness in themselves, he hath made them so far as they can be, <hi>subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient</hi> to the Happiness of <hi>others.</hi>
                  </item>

                  <item>4. That in all those Beings that are <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of Happiness, he hath implanted a <hi>natural</hi> Disposition of Doing <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>

That whatsoever Beings are <hi>incapable</hi> of Happiness in themselves, he hath made them so far as they can be, <hi>subservient</hi> to the Happiness of <hi>others.</hi> For it is impossible that all Beings that are <hi>capable</hi> of Happiness could ever have been actually happy, had not <hi>God</hi> created some Beings that are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>incapable</hi> of it. For thus all the <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Bodies, the <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are Beings utterly <hi>incapable</hi> of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, they being all <hi>inanimate,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>void</hi> of all Sense and Perception ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Happiness or Misery; but yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but they are indispensably <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to the Happiness of a World of <hi>anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:59595:65"/>
Beings that are <hi>capable</hi> of some Degrees of Happiness. Thus, for instance, the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of all <hi>sublunary</hi> Things, of <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> of the <hi>Fowls</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> and the <hi>Fishes</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> depends in a <hi>great</hi> Measure on those <hi>dead inanimated</hi> Elements; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if <hi>God</hi> had not created some Beings <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable</hi> of Happiness, there are many Beings that are <hi>capable</hi> of it must either have not been, or have been <hi>miserable.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> hath not only created these, but out of his <hi>great</hi> Goodness to his <hi>living</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he hath created them in such an Order as renders them as <hi>subservient</hi> as they can be to their Welfare and Happiness. Thus the <hi>Sun,</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> hath ordained the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> Foster-father of all <hi>sublunary</hi> Beings, though he feels no Happiness himself, is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our <hi>great</hi> Benefactor in such a Form and put in such a Course of Motion, as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders him most <hi>serviceable</hi> to all those <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated</hi> Beings, that are <hi>capable</hi> of Happiness. For first he is created of a <hi>fiery</hi> Substance, by which he not only enlightens this <hi>lower</hi> World, but warms and cherishes it with a <hi>fruitful</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Heat. And then God hath cast all its <hi>mighty</hi> Substance into the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a <hi>perfect</hi> Globe, that so if the <hi>Earth</hi> moves round it, it might be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the comfort of its Light and Heat
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59595:65"/>
to it throughout all the Circle of its Motion; or that if <hi>it</hi> moves round the <hi>Earth,</hi> it may by its Figure, which is most <hi>apt</hi> for Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be the better enabled to walk his Rounds about the World, and so visit all his Foster-Children, and refresh them with his Light and Warmth as oft as their Necessities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. And then for his Situation in the World, what an <hi>exact</hi> Care hath the <hi>good</hi> Father of Beings taken to place him in such a <hi>convenient</hi> Distance as that he might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be <hi>too</hi> near us, nor <hi>too</hi> far from us; both which would have been equally <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous.</hi> For had he been advanced <hi>higher</hi> in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> he would have left us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually <hi>frozen</hi> and <hi>benighted</hi>; had he been thrust <hi>lower,</hi> he would have perpetually scorched us with the <hi>too</hi> near Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of his Flames. But from that <hi>Orb</hi> wherein he is placed all his Aspects on us are <hi>benigne</hi>; and Thanks be to a <hi>good God</hi> we neither want his Heat or Light, nor are we scorched and dazled by it. For if <hi>God</hi> had not been very <hi>careful</hi> of the <hi>Publick Good</hi> he might as well have fixed the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Orb</hi> of the <hi>Moon</hi> as where it now is, and then as its Nearness to us would have turned the World into a <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> so it would have run through the whole <hi>Zodiack</hi> in the space of a Month, and consequently the <hi>four</hi> Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,

                  <hi>viz. Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer,</hi> and <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn</hi> which do now fill up the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the Year, would have been all thrust together in <hi>four</hi> Weeks; by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as all <hi>living</hi> Creatures would have been very much prejudiced by the <hi>frequent</hi> Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Air, so all Vegetation must have necessarily ceased. For the <hi>Winter</hi> Frost must have Killed the Fruits of the Earth before ever the <hi>Summers</hi> Heat could have ripened them; and the Fruits of the Earth being destroyed all <hi>living</hi> Creatures must have perished with Famine. Since then there are an <hi>infinite</hi> Number of other Places in the <hi>Heavens</hi> wherein <hi>God</hi> could have fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Sun</hi> if he had pleased, but none so <hi>commodious</hi> for the World as <hi>that</hi> where it is, what could move him to choose <hi>this</hi> above all others but only his <hi>great</hi> Care of the Welfare of his Creatures? Once more, If we consider the Course of its Motion, how could it have been more exactly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered than it is for the <hi>publick</hi> Benefit of the Inhabitants of the World? For whereas in it self 'twas as apt to move in a <hi>direct</hi> Line as in a Circle, which if it had done, only one <hi>half</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> could have been warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enlightened by it, whilst the <hi>other</hi> had been covered with <hi>eternal</hi> Frost and Darkness; the <hi>good God</hi> hath appointed him
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:59595:66"/>
to run about the <hi>Globe,</hi> and that with so much Swiftness, notwithstanding he is so vast a Body, that once in <hi>Twenty four</hi> Hours he brings Day into <hi>both</hi> the <hi>Hemispheres</hi>; and whereas had he always moved round in the same middle Circle without ever swerving either <hi>Southward</hi> or <hi>Northward,</hi> all those <hi>vast</hi> Tracts of <hi>Earth</hi> that lie beyond the <hi>Polar Circles</hi> would have been well nigh lost in an <hi>everlasting</hi> Winter, and consequently their <hi>wretched</hi> Inhabitants condemned to Famine and Cold; the <hi>good God</hi> hath chalked him out those <hi>oblique</hi> Paths of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> in which <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Summer</hi> he travels towards the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,</hi> and in the <hi>Winter</hi> towards the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Hemisphere,</hi> and so once a Year brings a <hi>warm Summer</hi> to them both. Thus <hi>God</hi> hath placed the <hi>Sun</hi> in the <hi>Heaven</hi> as his <hi>Almoner,</hi> and furnished him with all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he is capable of to relieve the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of his Creatures; and every Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he visits us from his <hi>bountiful</hi> Master, and with his <hi>kindly</hi> Influence ripens the Fruits of the <hi>Earth</hi> for us, and comforts us with the Warmth and Brightness of his Rays. And though he receives no Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <hi>himself,</hi> yet is so framed, and placed, and moved by the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> that he abundantly administers to the Happiness of <hi>others.</hi>

For being the most <hi>fluid</hi> of all Bodies it easily gives Way to the Vibration of their Wings, and so, that as that <hi>Air</hi> that is under them bears them up; so that which is before them is no Hindrance to their Motion. In a word, how <hi>necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is it to supply and refresh the Spirits of all Animals in general, which if they did not suck in <hi>new</hi> Air almost every Moment would immediately be suffocated.</p>
               <p>Again, if from the <hi>Air</hi> we descend to the <hi>Earth,</hi> how liberally hath the <hi>good God</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated its <hi>vast</hi> Womb with the Seeds and Principles of all those <hi>Herbs,</hi> and <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> and Minerals that can be any ways <hi>Subservient</hi> to the Happiness of those <hi>numerous</hi> Animals wherewithall it is peopled; insomuch that it is become a <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> Magazine of Provisions not only for the Necessities, but for the Delights of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
               <p>Thus also the <hi>Sea,</hi> that <hi>vast</hi> Continent of Water, is so contrived by the <hi>Almighty</hi> Creator, that it not only administers to the Sustenance and Delight of its own Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59595:68"/>
but also to the Happiness of all <hi>other</hi> Animals. For from its <hi>vast</hi> Treasury of Waters it sends forth <hi>fruitful</hi> Streams into all Parts of the <hi>Earth</hi> through divers Holes that are bored at convenient Distances, and forces them to climb up to the Tops of Mountains, not only that they may be able to run down again with Ease, but also to carry themselves to such Heights after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as the Necessities of Men and Beasts do require; so that even the most <hi>In-land</hi> Parts of the <hi>Earth</hi> are made <hi>fruitful</hi> by their Moistures, and all their <hi>thirsty</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants are watered and refreshed by them. Besides which it is also most highly <hi>useful</hi> for <hi>Navigation,</hi> whereby the <hi>remotest</hi> Parts of the World maintain an <hi>easie</hi> Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and do mutually change the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of Life with <hi>one onother.</hi> Lastly, if we consider the <hi>Fire,</hi> what a most <hi>useful</hi> Servant hath the <hi>great</hi> Creator rendred it to Mankind? For by this we do not only supply the Absence of <hi>Summer,</hi> but do also prepare all our Food, and render it <hi>wholsome</hi> and <hi>pleasant,</hi> and most successfully serve our selves in all Arts and <hi>Manufactures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have briefly touched upon all the visible Creation of <hi>inanimate</hi> Beings, and shewn you how <hi>careful</hi> the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Creator hath been to improve them all <hi>to</hi>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:59595:68"/>
the utmost to the Happiness of his <hi>animated</hi> Creatures, that so there might no <hi>necessary</hi> Supply be wanting to compleat those <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Degrees of Happiness for all Beings in the World, and none might be <hi>miserable</hi> but such as choose to be so. What a <hi>noble</hi> Instance is this therefore of the <hi>immense</hi> Goodness of <hi>God</hi> in this Work of Creation, that he hath made all Beings that are <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable</hi> of Happiness to minister as much as they are able to those that are <hi>capable</hi> of it, and thereby spread his Table with an <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite</hi> variety not only of Necessaries, but of Delicacies to <hi>treat</hi> and entertain all his <hi>sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Creation? Who can suspect his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, when the <hi>Heavens</hi> and all the <hi>Elements</hi> do so loudly proclaim it, by their being so contrived and ordered by his Wisdom, as to do the utmost <hi>Good</hi> they are able to those Things that have any Capacity of Happiness?</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Another Instance of his doing <hi>good</hi> in this <hi>great</hi> Work of his Creation is his giving <hi>actual</hi> Existence to such <hi>innumerable</hi> Kinds of Being that are <hi>capable</hi> of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Were we but able to survey the whole <hi>Scale</hi> of Beings from the <hi>lowest</hi> of <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> to the <hi>highest</hi> of <hi>rational,</hi> we should doubtless find in it such an <hi>innumerable</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Rounds as all our <hi>Arithmetick</hi> could never be able to compute, For we see that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:59595:69"/>
even <hi>this</hi> Earth, which is but a very <hi>little</hi> Spot of the World, contains in it such a <hi>prodigious</hi> Army of <hi>distinct</hi> Kinds of <hi>sensitive</hi> Beings as all the <hi>Histories of Animals</hi> were never able to muster; and could we but reckon down from Man, to the <hi>lowest Mite</hi> of <hi>animated</hi> Matter that the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> contains, we should find that even here there are so many Kinds of Beings as are <hi>capable</hi> at least of some Degrees of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as would give us Cause enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and adore the <hi>infinite</hi> Fecundity of the <hi>divine</hi> Goodness. And is it likely that <hi>this</hi> Earth, which is but the Sink of the World, should be the only <hi>inhabitable</hi> Part of it? That since the <hi>Almighty</hi> hath so well stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this <hi>little</hi> Inclosure, he should <hi>for ever</hi> leave <hi>desolate</hi> of Inhabitants all those <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense</hi> Tracts of <hi>pure Aether</hi> in which the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Fixed Stars</hi> do swim? That when he hath so thronged this <hi>dark</hi> Cellar with <hi>living</hi> Creatures, he should make no Use at all of those <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>glorious</hi> Rooms, but let them stand empty <hi>for ever,</hi> as if he had erected them only for Pomp and Shew, without any Design to <hi>people</hi> them with such <hi>noble</hi> Inhabitants as they are capable to receive? Well then, let us but suppose, as we may very fairly do, that the <hi>other</hi> Parts of the World are stock'd with <hi>living</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:59595:69"/>
but in the same proportion with <hi>this,</hi> and then what an <hi>innumerable</hi> Drove of <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct</hi> kinds of Bings will the Whole consist of? And indeed considering what <hi>infinite</hi> Degrees of Being are within the Sphere of God's <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> and how <hi>suitable</hi> it is to his Goodness in his Productions to reach the <hi>utmost</hi> Limits of Possibility, it seems no way <hi>unreasonable</hi> to believe that he hath given <hi>actual</hi> Existence to all <hi>possible</hi> Kinds of Beings that are <hi>capable</hi> of Life and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and can without any Prejudice either to themselves or Neighbours be contained within the Compass and immensity of the World; and consequently that he hath not only filled with <hi>living</hi> Creatures the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Sea,</hi> but, if it be possible, all the Capacities of an <hi>immense</hi> and <hi>infinite</hi> Space. But whether this be so or no, it is an <hi>abundant</hi> Evidence of the Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> that he hath created such <hi>innumerable</hi> Kinds of <hi>living</hi> Creatures, the <hi>meanest</hi> of which are <hi>capable</hi> of some Degree of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For unless we will assert one of the greatest Absurdities in our <hi>modern Philosophy,</hi> That all <hi>sensitive</hi> Animals are nothing but meer <hi>Machins,</hi> and consequently have no Sense or Perception in them; we must allow them all, even to the <hi>smallest</hi> Insect, a Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of some Degree of Happiness. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:59595:70"/>
hath Sense is <hi>sensible</hi> of Pleasure, and whatsoever is <hi>sensible</hi> of Pleasure is <hi>capable</hi> of Happiness; and he that made so many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <hi>capable</hi> of Happiness, to be sure never intended that their Capacities should be in vain. Behold then the <hi>vast</hi> Design and Project of the <hi>divine</hi> Goodness that would let nothing lie buried in the <hi>Abyss</hi> of <hi>Non-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> whose <hi>Idea</hi> included but a Possibility of being <hi>happy,</hi> and hath given <hi>actual</hi> Existence unto all kinds of Beings, even the most <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable</hi> Animals, for which it was better to be than not to be; that at least hath raised up an <hi>innumerable</hi> Company of Beings into a Capacity of being <hi>happy,</hi> and made such <hi>ample</hi> Provision to supply their Natures with all the Degrees of Happiness that they are <hi>capable</hi> of! For</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Another Instance of his doing <hi>good</hi> in this <hi>great</hi> Work of Creation is his furnishing all these Beings with sufficient Means and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities to obtain the utmost Happiness that they are <hi>capable</hi> of. For I have already shewn you, that <hi>God</hi> hath so made and ordered the <hi>inanimate</hi> World that it administers <hi>sufficient</hi> Matter of Happiness unto all <hi>sensitive</hi> Beings; that the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Elements</hi> by the Ordination of <hi>God</hi> do all conspire together to contribute to our Happiness, to <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>refresh</hi> us, to <hi>feed</hi> and <hi>cloath</hi> us, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:59595:70"/>
our Lives, not only <hi>supportable,</hi> but <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> and <hi>delightful.</hi> And of this <hi>vast</hi> Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every Animal, even the most <hi>minute,</hi> hath its Share; so that now they can want nothing that is <hi>necessary</hi> to their Happiness, but only an Ability to use and apply the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral</hi> Provisions that <hi>God</hi> hath made for them; and this he hath also most graciously furnished them with, For in all <hi>Brute</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <hi>God</hi> hath implanted a <hi>natural</hi> Instinct by which they are strongly inclined to that which is <hi>good</hi> for them, and as strongly averse to what is <hi>hurtful</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi>; so that by their very Natures he hath impelled them to make Use of those Provisions which he hath made for their Happiness; and he hath also furnished them with a <hi>natural</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to provide against Want, and with <hi>fitting</hi> Instruments of Sense to relish and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the <hi>several</hi> Pleasures which he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to entertain them: All which he hath done to that <hi>vast</hi> Advantage, that 'tis impossible for <hi>humane</hi> Wisdom to say how any one Kind of <hi>Animals</hi> could have been more exactly framed for the enjoyment of such a Happiness, as is <hi>proper</hi> to its Nature. But then for us Men that are <hi>capable</hi> of much more than a meer <hi>sensitive</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he hath not only prepared such a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness as is <hi>proportionable</hi> to our Capacities,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:59595:71"/>
but hath also implanted in our Natures a <hi>full</hi> Ability to obtain it. For as for our <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> Happiness, there is <hi>sufficient</hi> Provision made for it in the <hi>common</hi> Store-house of Nature, and by the Industry and the <hi>good</hi> Use of our Reason we may ordinarily secure our selves, if we please, from the Want of whatsoever is <hi>necessary</hi> thereunto; for a very <hi>little</hi> of these <hi>sensitive</hi> Enjoyments is enough to make a <hi>wise</hi> Man <hi>happy,</hi> and we want no <hi>bodily Organs</hi> or <hi>Sensories</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish any of those Pleasures of which our <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> Happiness is composed. And then for our <hi>supreme</hi> Happiness, as we are <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Beings, <hi>God</hi> by giving us <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Choice,</hi> hath furnished us with <hi>sufficient</hi> Ability to obtain it. For our Happiness, as we are <hi>reasonable</hi> Creatures, consists in the most <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Exercise of our <hi>noblest</hi> Faculties, <hi>viz.</hi> our <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and our <hi>Will</hi>; and there is no Object in Nature about which these Faculties can be perfectly exercised but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God,</hi> who is the Fountain of all Truth and Goodness; and consequently our Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness as Men must consist in the Enjoyment of <hi>God,</hi> that is, in <hi>knowing,</hi> and <hi>loving,</hi> and <hi>resembling</hi> him <hi>for ever.</hi> And in order to our obtaining of this, <hi>God</hi> hath furnished us with <hi>Vnderstanding,</hi> by the <hi>good</hi> Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:59595:71"/>
of which we may easily arrive to the Knowledge of him; for he hath placed us so advantagiously in Being, that, as from a <hi>convenient</hi> Station in a <hi>noble</hi> Theater, we are able to contemplate the <hi>admirable</hi> Schemes of those <hi>magnificent</hi> Works which <hi>God</hi> hath set round about us; and from the <hi>Vastness</hi> of the whole <hi>Structure,</hi> the <hi>Variety</hi> of its <hi>Parts,</hi> and the <hi>beautiful</hi> Order which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in their <hi>admirable</hi> Connection, we can easily infer, that such a <hi>noble</hi> Production must needs be owing to an <hi>Almighty</hi> Skill and Goodness. And then such is the Frame of our Natures, that we easily love that which we know to be lovely, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if we are not prejudiced by <hi>preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> Lusts, that which we behold of <hi>God</hi> in his Works will imprint such an <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Notion of him in our Minds, as will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most necessarily engage us to love him; and then our Love will provoke us to <hi>imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate</hi> those Beauties for which we love him, we being naturally <hi>ambitious</hi> of transcribing those Perfections into our selves which we love and admire in <hi>another</hi>; and then by imitating him, we shall by Degrees be moulded into his Likeness and Resemblance; for <hi>Acts</hi> will beget <hi>Inclinations, Inclinations</hi> will grow into <hi>Habits,</hi> and <hi>Habits</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Nature. So that you see <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:59595:72"/>
hath implanted an Ability of <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>resembling</hi> himself in the very Frame and Structure of our Natures; these Things we are as <hi>capable</hi> of as of any Thing whatsoever that is <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>manly</hi>; we are as <hi>capable</hi> of knowing <hi>God,</hi> as of knowing any Thing that is <hi>knowable</hi>; as <hi>capable</hi> of loving him, as of loving any Thing that is <hi>amiable</hi>; as <hi>capable</hi> of resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him, as of imitating any Thing that is <hi>imitable</hi>; and these are the <hi>noblest</hi> and most <hi>essential</hi> Parts of the Happiness of a <hi>rational</hi> Nature. Now what an <hi>undeniable</hi> Instance is this of the Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> that he hath not only made so many Kinds of Beings <hi>capable</hi> of so many <hi>different</hi> Degrees of Happiness, but that he hath furnished them all with such <hi>abundant</hi> Means and Abilities to obtain it? <hi>O blessed God,</hi> what Heart can be so <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> as not to admire and adore thy <hi>exuberant</hi> Goodness, which hath thus extended it self to the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> Borders of <hi>Entity,</hi> and blessed with its <hi>overflowing</hi> Streams such an <hi>infinite</hi> Number of Beings! What Tongue is able sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>extol</hi> thy Benignity, that out of thine own <hi>immense</hi> Fulness hast sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied such a <hi>vast</hi> Creation with such Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and such Means, and such Abilities of being <hi>happy!</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:59595:72"/>4<hi>thly.</hi> And Lastly, Another Instance of his doing <hi>good</hi> in this <hi>great</hi> Work of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is his implanting a <hi>natural</hi> Inclination of doing <hi>good</hi> to <hi>others</hi> in all those Beings that are <hi>capable</hi> of Happiness. For it being his Design to propagate this Sort of Beings by way of Generation to the End of the World, he hath implanted in all Parents, as well <hi>sensitive</hi> as <hi>rational,</hi> a <hi>natural</hi> Love and Good-will to their Off-spring, and that to such a Degree as we see the most <hi>timorous</hi> and <hi>helpless</hi> Creatures are not only very <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious</hi> to nurse and cherish them, but very <hi>couragious</hi> in their Defence and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, which is a <hi>great</hi> Instance of the <hi>indulgent</hi> Care which the <hi>great</hi> Father of Beings hath of all his Children, that he hath commited them in their Infancy to such <hi>tender</hi> Nurses that will be sure to take Care to make Provision for them when they are not able to provide for themselves; that he hath not trusted them to the Compassion and <hi>good</hi> Nature of <hi>other</hi> Beings to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Alms, and <hi>free</hi> Benevolence of their <hi>fellow</hi> Creatures, but hath taken Security for their <hi>liberal</hi> Nurture and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from the very Nature and <hi>inmost</hi> Bowels of their Parents; who were so framed that they cannot choose but make Provision for them if they are able, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:59595:73"/>
doing the <hi>greatest</hi> Outrage to themselves, and stifling one of the <hi>strongest</hi> Inclinations of their Natures; which inclination of <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Parents doth therefore loudly proclaim the <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness of the <hi>great</hi> Parent of all Things to his Children; because there can be no <hi>other</hi> Reason assigned why he should implant <hi>this</hi> Inclination in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but because he loved us, and was therefore resolved to take the most <hi>effectual</hi> Course that Care might be taken of us, when we were not capable to take Care for our selves. And can we think that the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> Father, who hath implanted in all <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Parents such a <hi>necessary</hi> Inclination to do <hi>good</hi> to their Children, should be <hi>forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>regardless</hi> of <hi>his own</hi> Off-spring? He that planted the Eye, shall not he see? And he that gave the Ear, shall not he hear? And by the same Reason, he that hath so strongly inclined our Natures to the Love of our Off-spring, shall not he love <hi>his own?</hi> Shall not his Nature be as strongly inclined to do <hi>good</hi> to them? For the whole Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being nothing else but the <hi>Expansion</hi> or <hi>Spreading</hi> forth of the <hi>divine</hi> Simplicity and Perfection, all Creatures do more <hi>properly</hi> belong to <hi>God</hi> than Families or Actions do to the Principles from whence they flow; so that we are as it were <hi>Flesh of his Flesh, and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:59595:73"/>
Bone of his Bone</hi>; and <hi>no Man,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>hateth his own Flesh, but</hi> rather <hi>nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> and <hi>cherishes it:</hi> And if Man doth not, can we imagin that <hi>God</hi> doth? For as for Man, we see the more <hi>perfect</hi> he is, and the more <hi>suitable</hi> to his Nature he acts, the more he is inclined to do <hi>good,</hi> and that not only to <hi>his own</hi> but to all <hi>others</hi> that are within the Sphere of his Beneficence. He finds in himself such a <hi>diffusive</hi> and <hi>all-spreading</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Love as renders him an <hi>universal</hi> Friend and Benefactor to the World, and makes him <hi>sympathize</hi> in the Happiness and Misery of all Beings; and this <hi>brave</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind is doubtless one of the <hi>highest</hi> Perfections that the Soul of Man is <hi>capable</hi> of. Since therefore <hi>originally</hi> we came no otherwise to the Knowledge of God's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections than as we found them copyed out and transcribed into <hi>our own</hi> Natures, how can we imagin that <hi>God</hi> should not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>universal</hi> Love and Beneficence, when we acknowledge it a Perfection in <hi>our selves</hi> to be so? Can there be any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in us that is not in <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>utmost</hi> Degree of Possibility? And therefore if the Inclination to do <hi>good</hi> be a <hi>Perfection</hi> in us, it must needs be in <hi>God</hi> in all the <hi>possible</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees that an <hi>infinite</hi> Nature is <hi>capable</hi> of; and since he hath so framed all <hi>reasonable</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59595:74"/>
that <hi>universal</hi> Love and Proneness to do <hi>good</hi> is <hi>one</hi> of their <hi>greatest</hi> Perfections and Accomplishments, we may be sure that <hi>his own,</hi> which is the <hi>great</hi> Standard and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all <hi>reasonable</hi> Natures, is infinitely <hi>loving</hi> and prone to do <hi>good.</hi> And thus you see what mighty <hi>unanswerable</hi> Instances there are of the Goodness of <hi>God</hi> in the Works of his Creation.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to conclude this Argument; From hence we see what <hi>mighty</hi> Obligations we are under to serve and obey, so far as we are able, the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Author of our Beings, who hath not only created us, but created us in a <hi>vast</hi> Capacity of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and furnished us with <hi>sufficient</hi> Means and Abilities to attain it. Wherefore since, all our Powers and Abilities are from him, we are bound in Justice to imploy them in his Service; and since by giving us those Abilities he hath done us so much <hi>good,</hi> and rendred us <hi>capable</hi> of such <hi>immense</hi> degrees of Happiness, we are obliged in Gratitude not to imploy them in doing any Thing that is any ways displeasing or dishonourable to him. For what can be more <hi>just</hi> or <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> than that <hi>God</hi> should have the Use of those Powers which he gave us, and in which he still retains an <hi>unalienable</hi> Right and Property? That the <hi>Temples</hi> which he
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:59595:74"/>
hath built should be <hi>forever</hi> dedicated to his Service, and not turned into <hi>Dens</hi> of <hi>Thievs,</hi> or made <hi>Stables</hi> of <hi>Filth</hi> and <hi>Vncleanness.</hi> So that for us to withdraw our selves from his Service, or to imploy our Powers to any <hi>wicked</hi> Purposes, is to commit a Robbery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Author</hi> of our Beings, and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly to <hi>desseise</hi> him of <hi>his own</hi> Goods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath a far more <hi>absolute</hi> Propriety than we pretend to have in the Cloths on our Backs: And in every <hi>bad</hi> Action we do, steal Gods own Powers and Faculties from him, and with <hi>extreme</hi> Injustice imploy them against himself. Now what a <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous</hi> Thing is it that we, who think our selves so highly affronted, when any one charges us with Robbery and Injustice, should make no more Conscience of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>alienating</hi> from him those Faculties and Powers of Action, in which he hath a far more <hi>undoubted</hi> Propriety than any Creature can have in any <hi>Good</hi> it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys; but when he hath been so <hi>good</hi> a Creator to us as to create in us such an <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> Capacity of being <hi>happy,</hi> and furnished us with such <hi>abundant</hi> Means and Abilities of attaining thereunto, then to <hi>eloigne</hi> our selves from his Service, and to pervert those Powers of Action to <hi>sinful</hi> Purposes by which he hath enabled us to be <hi>happy</hi>; is
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:59595:75"/>
not only <hi>unjust,</hi> but barbarously <hi>ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi> For now in sinning against <hi>God</hi> we fight against him with <hi>his own</hi> Mercies, and arm the Effects of his Bounty against his <hi>Sovereignty</hi>; and as if we were resolved to revenge our selves upon him for making us so <hi>good,</hi> and raising us up into such an <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> State of Nature, we shamefully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour him with <hi>his own</hi> Blessings, and take all Advantages we can to grieve and offend him from the very Means and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities which he hath given us to be <hi>happy.</hi> He gave us <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what is <hi>good</hi> for our selves, and <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of <hi>Will</hi> to choose and imbrace it; and we like <hi>ungrateful</hi> Wretches imploy that <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> in contriving and choosing the <hi>highest</hi> Treason against him. He gave us <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Abilities</hi> of Action, that so we might not only discern and choose what is <hi>best</hi> for us, but might also pursue and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; but we like <hi>base</hi> Caitiffs exert those Abilities in grieving and offending our most <hi>gracious</hi> Benefactor. Wherefore be astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>O ye Heavens,</hi> and be horribly affraid <hi>O all ye Works of God!</hi> For whilst you are all <hi>obedient</hi> to the Laws of your Maker, and never swerve from those Lines of Motion he hath prescribed you; we, whom he hath advanced into the <hi>highest</hi> Class of Beings,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:59595:75"/>
and endowed with the <hi>largest</hi> Capacities and Abilities of being <hi>happy,</hi> are become so <hi>base</hi> and so <hi>shameless</hi> as to injure him with <hi>his own</hi> Gifts, and to convert his very Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings into Weapons of Rebellion against him. Wherefore unless we are <hi>ambitious</hi> of rendring our selves the most <hi>absolute</hi> Monsters both of Injustice and Ingratitude, unless we have a Fancy to aspire to a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in Baseness, and to <hi>rival</hi> the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves in the most <hi>infamous</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious</hi> Degrees of Wickedness; let us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all our Faculties and Abilities for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the Service of him from whom we received them, and exercise his Gifts in a <hi>perpetual</hi> Acknowledgment of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>I Have already handled <hi>two</hi> of those <hi>four</hi> Topicks from whence I intended to demonstrate the Goodness of <hi>God, viz.</hi> his <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Works</hi> of his <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; of the <hi>First</hi> of which I discoursed, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>former</hi> Part of the Words: <hi>Thou art good.</hi> Of the <hi>Second</hi> upon the <hi>later; Thou dost good.</hi> But now because the <hi>Doings,</hi> or <hi>Operations</hi> of <hi>God</hi> include his <hi>Providence</hi> as well as his <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> doth <hi>good</hi> in <hi>that</hi> as well as in <hi>this</hi>; no doubt but the <hi>Psalmist</hi> in these Words had a respect to the <hi>one</hi> as well as the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed therefore to the <hi>Third</hi> Topick, from whence it doth most evidently appear, and that is his <hi>Providence. Thou dost good,</hi> i. e. thou dost <hi>good</hi> in the great Works of thy <hi>Providence,</hi> and thereby thou dost ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest the Goodness of thy Nature, in that as thou didst create a World to <hi>great</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Purposes, so thou dost still continue to do <hi>good</hi> to it in <hi>upholding</hi> and <hi>governing</hi> it by a most <hi>gracious</hi> Providence.

               </item>
               <item>2. That though there may be some Things in the World that to us seem to be very <hi>ill</hi> and <hi>hurtful,</hi> yet it is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>unreasonable</hi> for us to suspect the Goodness and Beneficence of the <hi>divine</hi> Providence.</item>

               <hi>First,</hi> I shall give you some <hi>general</hi> and <hi>comprehensive</hi> Instances of Gods doing <hi>good</hi> in the Works of his <hi>Providence</hi>; and they are these Four.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:59595:77"/>1. His <hi>upholding</hi> Things in that <hi>good</hi> Course and Order wherein he first created them, excepting only when the <hi>publick Good</hi> of his Creatures requires him to interpose. That that Order and Course of Things which <hi>God</hi> first established in his Creation was exceeding <hi>good</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> to it, I have proved at large in my <hi>former</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and that <hi>God</hi> still continues the same <hi>good</hi> Will to us is apparent, since he still continues things in the same <hi>beneficial</hi> Course and Order wherein he first created them. For we see the <hi>Heaven</hi> and the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> still as <hi>kind</hi> to us as ever; the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars</hi> do still run the <hi>same</hi> Courses, and still they cherish and refresh us with the same <hi>benign</hi> Influences; and though for <hi>six Thousand</hi> years together they have been perpetually visiting us, and spending the <hi>liberal</hi> Alms of their <hi>great</hi> Creator upon us, yet to <hi>this</hi> Day they are neither wearied, nor exhausted; but still continue to do us <hi>good</hi> with the same Freedom and Vigour as when they <hi>first</hi> danced round the World, and sang together for Joy. The <hi>Fire,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water</hi> are still as <hi>liberal</hi> to us as ever, and do supply us with the same Necessaries of Life as they did from the <hi>first</hi> Moment of their Being; and though for so <hi>many</hi> Ages <hi>we</hi> and <hi>innumerable other</hi> Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:59595:77"/>
have been liberally maintained out of these <hi>vast</hi> Store-houses of Nature, yet still we find them replenished with an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhaustible</hi> Fulness. So that still not only the <hi>Earth,</hi> but all the <hi>other Elements</hi> are <hi>full</hi> of the Goodness of the <hi>Lord</hi>; yea, and though in their Qualities they are quite <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> to <hi>one another,</hi> yet are their Animosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties so tempered by the <hi>gracious</hi> Providence of <hi>Heaven,</hi> that they all live together like <hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>unity,</hi> and the <hi>Dryness</hi> of <hi>this</hi> drinks not up the <hi>Moisture</hi> of <hi>that,</hi> nor doth the <hi>Cold</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> quench the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi> The <hi>Fire</hi> invades not the <hi>Air,</hi> nor the <hi>Water</hi> the <hi>Earth,</hi> but every one keeps within its <hi>proper</hi> Bounds; and though in <hi>sundry</hi> Places the <hi>Water</hi> be above the <hi>Earth,</hi> yet contrary to its own Nature which is to flow and expatiate it self, it doth only <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look</hi> its Banks, but doth not <hi>overflow</hi> them, being bounded by that <hi>merciful</hi> Providence, which in <hi>mere</hi> Pity to the Inhabitants of the Earth, says to its <hi>proud</hi> Waves, <hi>hitherto shall ye go, and no further.</hi> So that in short the Continuation of the <hi>regular</hi> Motions of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> of the <hi>Vicissitudes</hi> of <hi>Seasons,</hi> and <hi>alternate</hi> Mutation of Bodies, of the safety of the whole <hi>Vniverse,</hi> notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>rude</hi> Clashings of <hi>turbulent</hi> Matter, and of the <hi>exact</hi> Symmetry of all the Parts
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:59595:78"/>
of it in Despite of the <hi>frequent</hi> Rencounters of so many <hi>contrary</hi> Principles, shews not only the Power and Presence of some <hi>great</hi> Mind, but is also a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence of the Continuation of his Care and <hi>good</hi> Will to the World. And as he hath continued the <hi>inanimate</hi> World in that most <hi>excellent</hi> Course and Order wherein he first created it, so he hath still preserved all those <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable</hi> Species of Animals which he <hi>first</hi> gave Being to; so that in so many Ages and among so many Chances there is not <hi>one</hi> Kind of them hath either failed, or perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or become <hi>less capable</hi> of Happiness, or <hi>less</hi> furnished with Means and Abilities of obtaining it. So that his Providence is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a <hi>constant</hi> Repetition of the Goodness of his Creation; and all the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them is only this, that in the <hi>one</hi> he made all Things <hi>Good,</hi> in the <hi>other</hi> he continues them so. 'Tis true, <hi>God</hi> hath left himself at Liberty when Occasion requires immediately to interpose in the Course of Nature, and to vary from the Order of his Creation. And indeed unless he had done so, he would in a <hi>great</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure have tyed up his own Hands, and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated</hi> himself from <hi>Governing</hi> the World; but yet he never makes Use of this Liberty but for very <hi>good</hi> Reason, to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59595:78"/>
serve some very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> End of his Government; either to punish some <hi>notorious</hi> Sinner, or some very <hi>sinful</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that so by their Example <hi>others</hi> may be warned from treading in their Footsteps; or to deliver or preserve some eminently <hi>virtuous</hi> Person, or Nation, that thereby <hi>others</hi> may be incouraged to imitate and transcribe their Virtues; or lastly, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and ratify by some <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects some <hi>necessary</hi> Revelations of his Will to the World: Unless, I say, it be to serve some such <hi>excellent</hi> Ends as these, he never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses by his <hi>absolute</hi> Power to make the <hi>least</hi> Interruption in the <hi>established</hi> Course and Order of the <hi>Vniverse.</hi> And as soon as ever he hath obtained the <hi>good</hi> Ends that he aims at, he withdraws his Hand, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately remits Things to their <hi>primitive</hi> Course and Order. So that if Gods <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be <hi>good,</hi> as I have largely proved it is, his <hi>Providence</hi> must needs be so too; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it continues the Course and Order of the Creation, and never interrupts, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it, unless it be to do some <hi>great Good</hi> to the World. Thus <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Providence</hi> doth continually spread forth the <hi>mighty</hi> Wings of his Goodness over all his Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and thereby reaches out Perseverance to the Being and the Happiness of every Creature.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:59595:79"/>2. Another Instance of his doing <hi>good</hi> in this <hi>great</hi> Work of his <hi>Providence</hi> is his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing</hi> Mankind under an <hi>awful</hi> Sense of <hi>Religion</hi> notwithstanding the <hi>great</hi> Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracies of <hi>human</hi> Nature. It is very strange to consider how this <hi>heavenly</hi> Spark hath been kept alive in the midst of such a <hi>vast</hi> Ocean of Impiety as hath over-spread the World; for considering into what <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous</hi> Barbarism Mankind have immersed themselves, how miserably they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced <hi>their own</hi> Nature, and blotted out their Reason; insomuch that in <hi>several</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and <hi>several</hi> Parts of the World they have had scarce any <hi>other</hi> Remains of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity</hi> in them, but only their Language and their Shape: I say, considering these Things, it is impossible but all Sense of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> must long e're now have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished in us, had not the <hi>divine</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence from Time to Time been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>careful</hi> to cherish and revive it: And this it hath done by very <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> Methods; sometimes by inflicting <hi>strange</hi> and <hi>amazing</hi> Judgments upon <hi>great</hi> and <hi>notorious</hi> Offenders; sometimes by showering down <hi>miraculous</hi> Blessings and Deliverances upon <hi>virtuous</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Men; sometimes by raising up <hi>eminent</hi> Examples and Preachers of Righteousness, such as
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:59595:79"/>
the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; sometimes by making <hi>immediate</hi> Revelations from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and confirming the Truth of them by <hi>mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous</hi> Effects; and sometimes by permitting <hi>evil</hi> Spirits to appear to possess the Bodies of their <hi>Enthusiasts,</hi> and to deliver <hi>Oracles</hi> by them; which though it sometimes tended to promote <hi>false</hi> Religions among Mankind, yet did always prove <hi>instrumental</hi> to cherish and enliven the Sense and Belief of a <hi>Divinity.</hi> By these and such like <hi>powerful</hi> Methods hath the <hi>good</hi> Providence of <hi>Heaven</hi> from time to time <hi>revived</hi> in us the <hi>dying</hi> Sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> and in Despite of <hi>our selves</hi> continually kept us under its Aw and Restraints; which if it had not done, we should have immediately run headlong into the most <hi>deplorable</hi> Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Disorders. For not only our <hi>eternal,</hi> but our <hi>temporal</hi> Interest too is bound up in <hi>Religion</hi>; for this is the Foundation of all <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Society, and of all the Blessings that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound from it; 'tis <hi>this</hi> that gives Life and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to all those <hi>Pacts</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> by which Men are linked to <hi>one another,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated into <hi>regular</hi> Societies. For if once Men were abandoned of all Sense of <hi>Religion</hi> they would own no <hi>other</hi> Law but that of <hi>their own</hi> Interest, and esteem themselves no longer obliged by their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:59595:80"/>
than 'tis their Interest to keep them; and he that thinks himself bound to be <hi>honest</hi> no longer than he needs must, will by the same Principle be obliged to be a <hi>Knave</hi> as soon as he can. So that if once Men could disingage themselves from the Sense of <hi>Religion</hi> and the Tyes of Conscience, all those <hi>Pacts</hi> and <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,</hi> which are the <hi>Cement</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> would presently be dissolved and rendred <hi>insignificant</hi>; for what will it signify for Men to take <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> of Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to any <hi>Society,</hi> since whether they take them or no, they will be <hi>faithful</hi> so long and no longer than 'tis their Interest to be so. And this <hi>vital</hi> Cement that unites us being dissolved, our <hi>Society</hi> will soon disband of its own Accord, and we, like the Parts of a <hi>dead</hi> Body having lost the Soul that <hi>united</hi> and hold us together, shall immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse <hi>our selves</hi> and fly abroad into Atoms, and out of an <hi>eternal</hi> Distrust and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>one another,</hi> having no <hi>Religion</hi> or Conscience to secure <hi>each others</hi> Honesty, shall be forced to withdraw like other Beasts of Prey into Dens and secret Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and there live <hi>poor</hi> and solitary, as <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owls,</hi> and subsist like <hi>Vermin</hi> by robbing and filching from one another. And in this <hi>deplorable</hi> Condition we should be forced to wander about the World <hi>naked</hi>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:59595:80"/>
and <hi>destitute</hi> both of all the <hi>mutual</hi> Aids and Assistances of <hi>each other,</hi> and of all the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Hopes and supports of <hi>Religion,</hi> which are the only Comforts and Refreshments that in such a <hi>calamitous</hi> State our <hi>wretched</hi> Natures would be capable of. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sense of <hi>Religion</hi> we should be of all Creatures the most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>miserable.</hi> And this the <hi>good God</hi> foresaw very well, which made him so <hi>careful</hi> to inspire us with an <hi>awful</hi> Sense of <hi>Religion</hi>; and when through the Degeneracy of our Nature it was in so much Danger of being utterly extinguished, to awaken and revive it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain from Time to Time by the wise and <hi>gracious</hi> Methods of his Providence, that so we might live happily <hi>here</hi> as well as <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> by enjoying the Blessings of <hi>each others</hi> Society, and the <hi>continual</hi> Supports and Comforts of <hi>Religion:</hi> For it is to him that we owe our Sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> and 'tis to our Sense of <hi>Religion</hi> that we owe all the Conveniencies and Comforts of our Lives. How much Reason therefore have we to <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>good</hi> Providence of <hi>God,</hi> that hath taken so much Care of us; that would not suffer us to make <hi>our selves</hi> the most <hi>wretched</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> of all Beings; that hath been so <hi>vigilant</hi> to rouze and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake us when we were nodding into a <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargick</hi>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:59595:81"/>
Stupidity, and sleeping away all the Happiness and Comfort of our Lives; in a word, that hath kept <hi>Religion</hi> alive in us in Despight of all our Attempts to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it, and would not suffer us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Foundation of <hi>our own</hi> Happiness!</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Another Instance of the <hi>Goodness</hi> of God's <hi>Providence</hi> to us, is his supporting of Government in the World, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>violent</hi> Tendency of our <hi>corrupt</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to <hi>Anarchy</hi> and Confusion. If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect but a little upon the <hi>depraved</hi> Natures of Men, what <hi>ungovernable</hi> Passions they carry about with them, how <hi>sick</hi> they are of every Yoak, and how <hi>impatient</hi> of every Restraint; how greedily they covet an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded</hi> Liberty, and how much the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Part of Men are of this <hi>violent</hi> Temper; it will afford us matter of <hi>sufficient</hi> Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to think how Government and <hi>good</hi> Order could be so long preserved as it hath been among such a sort of <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi> Creatures; especially considering how much more <hi>numerous</hi> the <hi>governed</hi> Party is than the <hi>Governing,</hi> and how apt the Government it self is to be rendred <hi>odious</hi> by <hi>ill</hi> Management, by the Tyranny and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of those that sit at the Stern, and the <hi>perpetual</hi> Factions and <hi>cross</hi> Humours and Interests of the <hi>inferior</hi> Ministers of State:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:59595:81"/>
I say, considering all these Things, 'tis a Wonder how the <hi>Ship</hi> of Government should live so long as it hath sayled in the midst of such Tempests and <hi>Hurricanes</hi>; and doubtless long ere now it must have been swallowed up in <hi>Anarchy</hi> and Confusion had it not been guarded by the Providence of that <hi>God,</hi> who, as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us; <hi>stills the noise of the Seas, and the noise of their Waves, and the tumult of the People,</hi> Psalm lxv.5. And how much his <hi>Providence</hi> hath been concerned in securing of Government in the World, is evident from the Care it hath taken to keep Men under an <hi>awful</hi> sense of <hi>Religion,</hi> which is the <hi>main</hi> Foundation upon which Government leans, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it must necessarily sink into Ruin and Confusion; for, together with <hi>Religion</hi> away go all Principles of <hi>Loyalty</hi>; and when these are all gone, their Obedience to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will wholly depend upon their Interest, and consequently whensoever it is their Interest to rebel, they have <hi>no</hi> Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all to restrain them. And as <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> hath been very careful to secure the <hi>main</hi> Foundations of Government, so it hath been no less <hi>careful</hi> to <hi>infatuate</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, and bring to light the <hi>dark</hi> Contrivances, and baffle the <hi>open</hi> Attempts of those that have sought to undermine it; and this in
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:59595:82"/>
such a <hi>remarkable</hi> manner, that all the World hath taken <hi>peculiar</hi> Notice, and all <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> abound with <hi>innumerous</hi> Instances of it. And in all the <hi>Rises</hi> and <hi>Falls</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires</hi> of the World there hath ever been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served a most <hi>astonishing</hi> Concurrence either of such <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>unhappy</hi> Accidents, as have very much furthered their <hi>approaching</hi> Fates; which is a <hi>notorious</hi> Evidence how much <hi>God</hi> is concerned in the securing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the World, in that he doth so immediatly interpose in their <hi>Rises</hi> and <hi>Falls</hi>; and whensoever in his <hi>just</hi> Displeasure he pulls down <hi>one,</hi> he always takes Care to establish <hi>another</hi> in the Room of it, lest through <hi>too</hi> long <hi>Interregnums</hi> the Nations of the Earth should insensibly crumble into <hi>Anarchy</hi> and Confusion, and finally involve themselves in all the <hi>consequent</hi> Mischiefs of it. For the Subversion of Government, like the opening of <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily let loose a swarm of Miseries into the World; for without Government <hi>wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Innocence can never be <hi>righted, invaded</hi> Property can never be <hi>retrieved</hi>; but <hi>every</hi> Man will be exposed to <hi>every</hi> Man's Lust, which must immediately involve us into a State of War, in which like so many <hi>Dogs</hi> we should try all our Right by our Teeth. Into such a <hi>miserable</hi> State would Mankind
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:59595:82"/>
be reduced, if <hi>God</hi> did not <hi>uphold</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments of the World. So that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Benefits we receive from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under which we live, we owe it all to the <hi>divine</hi> Providence; by whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curement it is that <hi>Kings reign, and Princes decree justice,</hi> Prov. viii.15. 'Tis to this <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Cause that we are to attribute our sitting safely under <hi>our own</hi> Vines, and peaceably enjoying the Fruit of our Labours; that we are not banished from <hi>Society,</hi> and exposed to the Spoils and Ravages of those that are <hi>mightier</hi> than our selves; that we are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more <hi>savage</hi> than Wolves to <hi>one another,</hi> and that the whole World is not converted into a Commonwealth of <hi>Cannibals</hi>: For <hi>this</hi> would be the consequence of the Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Government, and <hi>that</hi> would be the Consequence in all probability of God's withdrawing his <hi>Providence</hi> from the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly, Another Instance of the Goodness of God's <hi>Providence</hi> to us is its contributing to the Invention and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of all those <hi>useful</hi> Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that are in the World: For if we seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously consider the <hi>prodigious</hi> Numbers of these wherewith the World doth abound, and wherein the Generality of Mankind are imployed; we are never able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59595:83"/>
how they could have all been invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and improved as they are, without the Direction of an <hi>Almighty</hi> Providence. For had not the <hi>divine</hi> Providence prolonged the Lives of the <hi>first</hi> Inventers of them to such a <hi>prodigious</hi> Age as it did, they would not have had Time to collect Experiments enough whereon to found any <hi>certain</hi> The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orems of <hi>natural</hi> Science. How could they have measured the Motions of the <hi>heavenly Bodies,</hi> or given any <hi>tolerable</hi> Account of their <hi>slow</hi> Revolutions, if they had not lived so many <hi>Hundreds</hi> of Years as they did? And though the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of <hi>proportion</hi> are lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Minds, yet it is not imaginable how Men could ever have improved them into so many <hi>various</hi> Practices, of <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, Musick, Geometry,</hi> and <hi>Mechanicks,</hi> had they not been at first either inspired by <hi>God,</hi> or had a <hi>long</hi> Space of Time allowed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into Rules of Practice. And he that shall but seriously consider how far out of the Road of <hi>ordinary</hi> Experience many of the most <hi>useful</hi> Arts of the World lie, such as <hi>Writing</hi> and <hi>Printing,</hi> by which a Man may talk with his Friend a <hi>thousand</hi> Miles Distance, and converse with the World when he is dead and gone, will find <hi>suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Reason to attribute the Invention of them to the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Direction of the <hi>divine</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59595:83"/>
without which neither am I able to imagin how the <hi>medicinal</hi> Virtues of <hi>sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Herbs</hi> and <hi>Vegetables</hi> and <hi>Minerals</hi> could have been discovered, which now are of <hi>great</hi> Use to us, since even these also do lie exceedingly remote from <hi>common</hi> Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And when I also consider how many Things are <hi>requisite</hi> to the compleating of the most <hi>useful humane</hi> Arts, and what Intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy and <hi>Mystery</hi> there is in them, insomuch that in many Cases we are not able to give any Reason why <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Cause in our Art should produce <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Effect; I must needs conclude, that the Invention and Improvement of them hath been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly promoted by the <hi>wise</hi> Providence of God. And what Reason have we to adore and admire its <hi>unspeakabl</hi> Goodness towards us, that by instructing us in so many <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Arts hath not only found <hi>sufficient</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of Mankind to subsist by, but hath also taught us mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to assist <hi>one another</hi> with all Kinds of Commodities and Conveniencies of Life! So that now we want nothing that either <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Art</hi> can supply us withall, the <hi>good God</hi> having furnished us, not only with Materials to work upon, but also with Art and Skill to manage and contrive them to the <hi>best</hi> Advantage. One would have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:59595:84"/>
thought it had been <hi>sufficient</hi> for him to have created a World for us, and therein to have furnished us with all that is <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> for our Being and Subsistence, and so left it to <hi>our selves</hi> to use and apply his Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings as we pleased; but that he should condescend to instruct us in so many Arts of improving his Blessings, how to <hi>dress</hi> and <hi>cook</hi> them to the <hi>best</hi> Advantage, and <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>other</hi> to render the <hi>meanest</hi> of them all <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>beneficial</hi> to <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> is such a <hi>gracious</hi> Condescention of Goodness as for ever deserves our Praise and Admiration. And so I have done with the first thing proposed, which was to shew you what apparent Instances there are of the Goodness of <hi>God</hi> in his Providence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed to the next Thing proposed, which was to shew you that though there be some Things in the World that to us seem to be <hi>very ill</hi> and <hi>hurtful,</hi> yet it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>unreasonable</hi> for us therefore to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the Goodness and Beneficence of God's <hi>Providence</hi>; that because we see such an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal</hi> Distribution of <hi>good</hi> Things to <hi>bad</hi> Men, and <hi>bad</hi> Things to <hi>good</hi> Men, and do find so much Sin and Wickedness in the World, and so great a part of Mankind over-run with so much <hi>Barbarism, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:59595:84"/>
and <hi>Idolatry</hi>; because, I say, we see and find such Things as these in the World, we have no Reason at all to charge the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of <hi>God.</hi> For let us consider,
<list>
                  <item>1. That the <hi>Irregularities</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> which <hi>God</hi> permits in the World are not the Effects of his Providence, but of the Choices and Actions of <hi>free Agents.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That many Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the World, because we take <hi>false</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. That many <hi>other</hi> Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Providence, meerly because we often mistake <hi>bad</hi> Men for <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Men for <hi>bad.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. That many Things seem <hi>Evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are acquainted but with a <hi>small</hi> Part of the World, and do judge of what is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> for the Whole by what we find is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for this <hi>small</hi> Part.</item>
                  <item>5. That many <hi>other</hi> Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Providence, because we judge of them by their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sensible</hi> Effects, and are not able to comprehend the <hi>universal</hi> Drift and Connexion and Dependence of them.</item>
                  <item>6. That many <hi>other</hi> Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Providence,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59595:85"/>
meerly because we understand very <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> World.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Irregularities</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> which <hi>God</hi> permits in the World are not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his Providence, but of the Choices and Actions of <hi>free Agents.</hi> That there is such a Thing as <hi>Sin</hi> in the World is by no Means to be charged upon the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>God</hi>; for <hi>that</hi> neither commits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sin <hi>it self,</hi> nor impels or necessitates any <hi>others</hi> to commit it. <hi>Let no Man say when he is tempted, he is tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any Man,</hi> Jam. i.13. 'Tis true, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits us Men, whom he hath made <hi>free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,</hi> to act freely; and if there were no Fault at all in making of <hi>free Agents</hi> (as certainly there was not) what Fault can there be in permitting them to act <hi>congruous</hi> to their own Natures? And is it <hi>just</hi> that God's Providence should be blamed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth not <hi>metamorphose free Agents</hi> into <hi>necessary</hi> ones; that is, because he doth not unmake what he hath made, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Laws of <hi>his own</hi> Creation? or is it <hi>reasonable</hi> that we who are the only Authors of Sin, should blame the Providence of <hi>God</hi> for suffering us to be so? For if Sin be an <hi>Evil,</hi> it is an <hi>Evil</hi> to us; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are much more concerned to prevent
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:59595:85"/>
it, than the Providence of <hi>God</hi>; and if when we may, we will not do it, it is <hi>unreasonable</hi> that we should blame <hi>God</hi> for not forcing us to prevent it whether we will or no. So that all the Quarrel we can have against God's Providence is only this, that it doth not tie our Hands, and fetter our Liberty in the Chains of an <hi>Adamantine Necessity</hi>; that is, that he doth not undo <hi>his own</hi> Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship, and thereby confess himself over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen in his Creation of us, when there is no kind of Reason for it. For I beseech you, what hurt is it for Men to be made <hi>free Agents,</hi> and left to their own Choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will be <hi>happy</hi> or <hi>miserable</hi>? And if it was no Fault at all for <hi>God</hi> to make us so, what Reason have we to blame him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing us what he made us? If therefore while he continues us <hi>free Agents</hi> we will needs chuse what is <hi>evil,</hi> and misimploy the Talent of our <hi>natural</hi> Liberty, the Fault is ours and not God's, and we may thank our selves for all the <hi>bad</hi> Consequents of it; and since not only Sin but most of the <hi>other</hi> Evils that are in the World proceed from our <hi>ill</hi> Use of <hi>our own</hi> Liberty, we ought in all Reason to charge them upon our selves, and not upon the <hi>good</hi> Providence of <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> That many Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Providence that are
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:59595:86"/>
not so in themselves, by Reason that we commonly take <hi>false</hi> Measures of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> We think it a very <hi>great Evil,</hi> for Instance, that <hi>good</hi> Men are not <hi>blessed</hi> with <hi>great</hi> Plenty and Abundance, and that <hi>bad</hi> Men are; because we imagin Plenty and Abundance to be a very <hi>great Good,</hi> and the contrary a very <hi>formidable Evil</hi>: And this makes us blame the Providence of <hi>God,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we see the <hi>good</hi> Things of this World so promiscuously distributed without any Discrimination of Persons; whereas in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality Plenty and Abundance approaches nearer to the Nature of an <hi>indifferent</hi> Thing than of a very <hi>great</hi> and <hi>desirable Good.</hi> For if we consult <hi>our own</hi> Experience, we shall find that all <hi>worldly</hi> Goods are just what we make them, and that they do as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove Plagues as Blessings to the Owners of them; that they <hi>intangle</hi> their Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>insnare</hi> their Innocence, disturb their Peace, <hi>provoke</hi> and <hi>pamper</hi> their <hi>extravagant</hi> Lusts, and betray them first into <hi>Luxuries,</hi> then into <hi>Gouts</hi> or <hi>Dropsies, Catarrhs</hi> or <hi>Consumptions</hi>; and these most commonly prove the Effects of <hi>outward</hi> Abundance. So that in it self 'tis almost of an <hi>indifferent</hi> Nature, and doth <hi>good</hi> or <hi>Hurt</hi> to us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as we use and improve it; and threfore though <hi>God</hi> sometimes suffers <hi>good</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:59595:86"/>
Men to want, and <hi>bad</hi> Men to enjoy it, we have no Cause to quarrel at it; for he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands the just Value of things, though we do not; he knows that the <hi>best</hi> of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Things are <hi>bad</hi> enough to be thrown away upon the <hi>worst</hi> of Men, and so expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his scorn of the <hi>admired</hi> Vanities of this World by scattering them with such a <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Hand, and indulging the Enjoyment of them to the most <hi>despicable</hi> Persons. So that we ought to conclude, that he sets no <hi>great</hi> Value upon them, since he concerns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no more in their Distribution; for why should he partake in the Errors of <hi>vulgar</hi> Opinion by expressing himself so <hi>regardful</hi> of these Trifles as to put them in <hi>golden</hi> Scales, and weigh them out to Mankind by Grains and Scruples?</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly,</hi> That many <hi>other</hi> Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Providence that are not so, merely because we often mistake <hi>bad</hi> Men for <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> Men for <hi>bad.</hi> For I dare say that <hi>that</hi> Observation upon which we ground our Quarrel against the Providence of <hi>God, viz,</hi> that it fares <hi>worst</hi> with the <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>best</hi> with the <hi>worst</hi> of Men, is not half so <hi>general</hi> as we make it; for it is to be considered that generally we pity the <hi>miserable</hi> and envy the <hi>prosperous,</hi> and these Passions of ours do commonly bribe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59595:87"/>
our Judgments, and make us think <hi>worse</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> and <hi>better</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> than either of them do deserve. For, those whom we <hi>pity</hi> we are inclined to <hi>love,</hi> and those whom we <hi>love</hi> we are inclined to <hi>think well</hi> of; and if we <hi>think well</hi> of them whether we have Reason for it or no, we conclude that <hi>God</hi> ought to be as fond of them as we: As on the contrary, those whom we <hi>envy</hi> we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>hate,</hi> and those whom we <hi>hate</hi> we are inclined to <hi>think ill</hi> of; and if we think <hi>ill</hi> of them we think that <hi>God</hi> is obliged to think so too. And because we are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably inclined by our Passions to pass such <hi>false</hi> Judgments upon Men, is it fit that we should quarrel at <hi>God</hi> because he doth not judge as unreasonably as our selves; or because he doth not <hi>reward</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> Men according to the sentence that our <hi>blind</hi> Pity or Envy passes upon them? If we could but strip <hi>our selves</hi> of all Passion, and were but able to judge of Men, not by what they appear, but by what they really are; I doubt not but we should find that even in <hi>this</hi> Life it fares <hi>best</hi> with the <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>worst</hi> with the <hi>worst</hi> of Men; but since we are not <hi>competent</hi> Judges of this Matter, we should have a Care of reproaching the Providence of <hi>God</hi> with a <hi>Maxim</hi> that hath no <hi>other</hi> Foundation in the Nature
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59595:87"/>
of things, but our own <hi>fallacious</hi> Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> That many Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of Gods Providence that are not so, because we are acquainted but with a <hi>small</hi> Part of the World, and do judge of what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil</hi> for the Whole, by what we find is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> for this <hi>small</hi> Part. We are never able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how far the Dominions of the <hi>divine</hi> Providence extend, nor how many Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Beings as well <hi>above</hi> as <hi>below</hi> us are concerned in its Empire and Government; but unless we could do this, we cannot be <hi>capable</hi> Judges of what is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> in the <hi>general</hi> Course of its Actions. For that is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> in the Providence of <hi>God,</hi> that is <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> for its whole Empire and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; and though <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> may be an Inconvenience to <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that</hi> Part of it, yet these <hi>particular</hi> Inconveniencies may be a <hi>great</hi> Convenience to the Whole. As for Instance; suppose a Man should come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country of <hi>Syberia,</hi> which is a great Part of the Empire of <hi>Russia,</hi> whither <hi>that Emperor</hi> is wont to banish all <hi>great</hi> Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; he would there find the Inhabitants in a most <hi>miserable</hi> Condition, they being there exposed to Hunger and Cold, and <hi>perpetual</hi> Slavery. So that if a Man should
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:59595:88"/>
judge of the <hi>whole</hi> Empire by this Part of it, he would conclude <hi>that Emperor</hi> to be a most <hi>savage</hi> Tyrant, and his Country to be the most <hi>miserable</hi> Place in the World; whereas in Reality all the <hi>other</hi> Parts of <hi>that Empire</hi> are rendred more <hi>happy</hi> by the Miseries of this Place, which serve to strike an Aw into all the <hi>other</hi> Subjects of it, and to restrain them within the Bounds of their Loyalty and Duty. And so unless we had as <hi>full</hi> a Prospect of the whole Dominion of Gods Providence as we have of this <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Spot of it, we ought not to censure his Government of the Whole by the <hi>little</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that occur in his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Part; for in such a <hi>vast</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as God's is, there may be a thousand <hi>good</hi> Reasons, that we know not of, why <hi>some</hi> Parts of it should be more <hi>unhappy</hi> than <hi>others</hi>; and if in some <hi>particulars</hi> he incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modes <hi>this</hi> Part for the <hi>publick</hi> Commodity of the Whole, we are so far from having any Reason to complain, that we ought in all Justice to praise and adore his Goodness for it. It is enough for us that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand so much of Gods Nature as we do, and have such <hi>apparent</hi> Instances of his Goodness in the Works of his Creation and Providence; and therefore if we in this <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> Part of Gods Empire suffer some <hi>small</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:59595:88"/>
Inconveniencies, we ought to bless and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore his Goodness for those <hi>greater</hi> Goods we enjoy, and to rest satisfied with <hi>this,</hi> that our <hi>particular</hi> Inconveniencies may for all we know be <hi>great</hi> Conveniencies to the <hi>Publick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> That many <hi>other</hi> Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of Gods Providence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we judge of them by their <hi>present sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> Effects, and are not able to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>universal</hi> Drift and Connexion and Dependence of them. For, as I have already shewn you in the former Discourse on this Argument, there is a <hi>continued</hi> Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture and Dependence from <hi>first</hi> to <hi>last</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the Actions and Contrivances of <hi>divine</hi> Providence, and <hi>every one</hi> hath a Relation to <hi>every one</hi> from the Beginning to the End of all that <hi>mighty</hi> Chain of Causes whereof it consists. So that 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to judge rightly of <hi>one</hi> Part of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence separately from the rest, because we see not the Relation it hath either to what went before, or to what is to follow after; and though singly considered it may be <hi>hurtful,</hi> yet in Conjunction with all the rest it may be exceedingly <hi>advantagious.</hi> He that looks only on the <hi>first</hi> Links of that <hi>curious</hi> Chain of Providence in the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Joseph,</hi> will be apt to entertain a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:59595:89"/>
very <hi>bad</hi> Opinion of the Whole; first he is thrown into a <hi>desolate</hi> Pit, then sold a <hi>Slave,</hi> then falsely accused, then cast into Prison: <hi>Lord,</hi> what a <hi>tragical Prologue</hi> is here! But then take all those Things in Conjunction with what follows, and you shall presently see that Scene clear up, and all those <hi>sad</hi> Preparations ending in a <hi>joyful</hi> Conclusion. And if we consider that most <hi>glorious</hi> Part that ever Gods Providence acted on the Stage of the World, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>History</hi> of our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi>; how <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>gloomy</hi> doth the <hi>former</hi> Part of it look, if we view it separately from the Antecedents and Consequents of it? Surely, if any Thing would justify our <hi>hard</hi> Censures of God's Providence, it would be the beholding of such a <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> Person exposed to so many Miseries and Calamities; to see him cast forth to the <hi>wide</hi> World as a <hi>help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Prey to the Rage of his Enemies, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him hanging upon the Cross, <hi>deserted</hi> of his Friends, <hi>mock'd</hi> and <hi>tormented</hi> by his <hi>barbarous</hi> Murderers, and in the most <hi>bitter</hi> Agonies breathing out his <hi>white</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Soul: O <hi>good Lord</hi>! What a <hi>dismal</hi> Prospect of thy Providence is here? But stay a little, let us but see the <hi>glorious</hi> Light that in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion broke out of this <hi>dismal</hi> Darkness; first he is <hi>raised</hi> from the <hi>Dead,</hi> then he <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends</hi>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59595:89"/>
up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> where at the <hi>right</hi> Hand of his Father he reigns an <hi>eternal</hi> King in <hi>full</hi> Power and Authority to give Gifts unto Men, and bestow those <hi>immortal</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on them which he purchased for them with his Blood. So that though <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> the <hi>first</hi> Scenes of this <hi>great</hi> Providence were very <hi>dismal</hi> and <hi>affrighting,</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered altogether, how <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious</hi> doth it appear? So true is that of the Preacher, Eccles. 3.11. <hi>He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: Also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</hi> And therefore because we are not able to see from the Beginning to the End of God's Providence, it is an <hi>unreasonable</hi> Thing for us to censure the Whole, because of some <hi>seeming</hi> Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that we see in those Parts of it that lie before us. Let us stay but till the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the Bottom, till all is finished, and Present it one <hi>intire</hi> Piece to our View, and then we shall have leave to censure, if we can find any Reason for it.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly, many <hi>other</hi> Things seem <hi>evil</hi> to us in the Course of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence which are not so, merely because we understand very <hi>little</hi> of the <hi>other</hi> World. It seems to us a <hi>mighty Evil</hi> in Providence
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59595:90"/>
that so <hi>great</hi> a Part of the World is left in Darkness and Ignorance, and in so <hi>great</hi> a Measure deprived of the <hi>vast</hi> Advantages of <hi>true Religion</hi>; but how do we know how <hi>God</hi> will dispose of them in the <hi>other</hi> World, what Abatements he will make them, and by what Measures he will judge them; whether he will not allow them some <hi>farther</hi> Time of Tryal, and so make <hi>good</hi> to them <hi>there</hi> whatsoever hath been wanting to them <hi>here?</hi> But whatsoever he doth or will do, this we may be sure of, that he will <hi>damn</hi> none but those that are first <hi>self-condemned,</hi> but those that <hi>knowingly</hi> and <hi>willingly</hi> miscarry; and if so, then he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of them but in Proportion to their Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and will not require <hi>Brick</hi> where he hath given no <hi>Straw.</hi> But which way so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he deals with them, to be sure <hi>first</hi> or <hi>last</hi> he will not be wanting in any Degrees of Kindness to them that are fit either for a <hi>wise</hi> Sovereign to grant, or a <hi>reasonable</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to demand; and if he will do so (as undoubtedly he will) how unreasonably do we complain of his Providence towards us? And though in this Life, we see many <hi>good</hi> Men reduced to a very <hi>calamitous</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet how do we know how <hi>necessary</hi> this may be to the securing of their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the World to come? For since our
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59595:90"/>
               <hi>main</hi> State and Interest is in that <hi>other</hi> World, there is no doubt but the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>God</hi> over us doth chiefly Respect that; and if so, how unreasonably do we censure it upon the Score of the <hi>present</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils it exposes us to, when we know so <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> of the <hi>future</hi> State, to which all its Transactions do chiefly relate? Wherefore, let us forbear a while till we come into the <hi>other</hi> World, and understand the <hi>whole</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and Contrivance; and then we shall see that all will be <hi>right</hi> and <hi>well,</hi> yea and infinitely <hi>better</hi> than ever we could ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. But for us to censure now, when we know so <hi>little</hi> of our <hi>future</hi> State, which is the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>ultimate</hi> Scope of Providence, is just as if a Man should pass his Judgment on a Picture when he sees nothing of it but some <hi>few rude</hi> Lines and very <hi>imperfect</hi> Strokes. Let us have but the Patience to suspend our Judgment a while till <hi>God</hi> hath finished the whole Draught, and given it all its <hi>natural</hi> Colours and Proportions, and then I am sure we shall see Cause enough <hi>forever</hi> to admire his Skill, and adore his Wisdom and Goodness. And thus you see by <hi>apparent</hi> Instances how <hi>good</hi> God is in his Providence towards us, and how unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable it is for us to censure his Goodness notwithstanding all those <hi>seeming Evils</hi> that happen in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:59595:91"/>And now what remains but that with all Humility and Chearfulness we resign up our selves into the Hands of our most <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi> Father, concluding, as most certainly we may, that whatsoever he doth with us, or howsoever he disposes of us, it will be all for our <hi>good</hi> in the <hi>later</hi> End, if it be not through our own Default. For where can we be safer than in the Hands of an <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent</hi> and <hi>Omniscient</hi> Goodness, a Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness that knows what is <hi>best</hi> for us, and wills what it knows to be so, and doth whatsoever it wills. Surely in such Hands our Condition is a thousand times <hi>better</hi> and <hi>safer</hi> than if we had <hi>full</hi> Power to effect <hi>our own</hi> Wishes, and all the Events that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us were in <hi>our own</hi> Disposal. And if God should shake us <hi>off</hi> from all Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on him, and resign up the whole Conduct of our Affairs into <hi>our own</hi> Hands; if he should say to us, <hi>since you mislike of my Conduct I will no more intermedle with you, or any thing that concerns you; take your selves into your own Disposal and manage all your Concernments as you please:</hi> If I say, he should do thus with us, we should be left in a most <hi>forlorn</hi> and <hi>deplorable</hi> Condition, and unless we were wholly abandoned of <hi>our own</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as well as Gods Providence, we should on our <hi>bended</hi> Knees resign up all into his
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:59595:91"/>
Hands again, and beseech him for his Pity and his Mercy sake to do any Thing with us that will consist with his Goodness; to scourge and chasten us for our Froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as much and as long as his own <hi>father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Bowels will endure it; rather then give us up to <hi>our own</hi> Conduct, or leave our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in the Disposal of our own <hi>blind</hi> and <hi>precipitant</hi> Wills. For so long as <hi>God</hi> is so powerfully and so wisely <hi>good</hi> as he is, it is the Interest of every Creature in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to be at his Disposal, and to take up that <hi>self-resigning</hi> Prayer of our <hi>Saviour, Father, not our Wills, but thy Will be done.</hi> For since <hi>God</hi> wills our <hi>good</hi> as much or more than our selves, it must doubtless be our Interest that <hi>his</hi> Will should take place whensoever it stands in Competition with <hi>ours</hi>; because he doth not only wish well to us as much as we do to our selves, but he knows what is best for us a <hi>great</hi> deal better than we. Wherefore let us learn in all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to repose our Minds in the <hi>good</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of <hi>God,</hi> and to satisfy our selves in its Managment and Disposal of us; for whatsoever Condition it may bring us into whilst we are wandring through this <hi>Vale of Tears,</hi> this is most certainly and eternally <hi>true,</hi> that <hi>God is good, and doth good,</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Three first</hi> Topicks from whence I undertook to prove the Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> I have already handled on <hi>another</hi> Text, and shewed 1<hi>st,</hi> from his Nature, 2<hi>ly,</hi> from his Creation, and 3<hi>dly,</hi> from his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, That he is infinitely <hi>good.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now to the 4<hi>th,</hi> and last, <hi>viz.</hi> from Principles of <hi>Revelation,</hi> the main of which is comprehended in the Text, <hi>God so loved the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is indeed a most <hi>glorious</hi> Instance of the Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> that when he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed his Laws upon our Nature in such <hi>legible</hi> Characters, and given them such <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent</hi> Sanctions in the Nature of Things; having made such a <hi>sensible</hi> Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Moral Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> by those <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> Consequents which he hath inseparably intailed on them: And when Mankind by their <hi>wilful</hi> Wickedness and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59595:92"/>
Inadvertency had almost obliterated the Law of their Nature, and extinguished their <hi>natural</hi> Sense of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed themselves in the most <hi>barbarous</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and Immoralities: Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this that he had done for us, and we against our selves, he should still be so <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>compassionate</hi> as to put forth a <hi>new</hi> Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Laws, and reveal his Will anew to us in such an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner; that when he had implanted a Light in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that was <hi>sufficient</hi> to have directed us into the <hi>several</hi> Paths of our Duty, and we by <hi>our own</hi> Neglect and Abuse of it had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extinguished this <hi>Candle of the Lord</hi> in us, and consequently involved our selves in <hi>Midnight</hi> Darkness and Ignorance; he should then be so <hi>compassionate</hi> as to hang out a Light from Heaven to us to rectify our Wanderings, and guid our Feet in the Paths we should walk in, was such a <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Expression of his Goodness as for ever deserves our most <hi>thankful</hi> Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But then that he should not only reveal to us what he had before imprinted on our Nature, and we had most unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>rased</hi> out and <hi>obliterated</hi>; but also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover so much more to us than ever we did or could have known by the <hi>Light</hi> of our <hi>Nature</hi>; that he should not only repeat his

               <hi>former</hi> Kindness to us, which we had so shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully abused, but make such <hi>stupendous</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to it as he hath done in the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of his <hi>Gospel</hi>; that manger all those Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Provocations by which for so many Ages we had excited his Patience, he should not only so love us as to restore to us the Light which we had almost extinguished, but to give his <hi>only begotten Son, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him should not perish,</hi> &amp;c. is such an <hi>amazing</hi> Instance of Goodness as can hardly be reflected on without an Exta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy of Admiration.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:59595:94"/>
imports a much <hi>higher</hi> signification than his being begotten in the <hi>Virgins Womb</hi> by the Overshadowing of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> For though it cannot be denied but in <hi>Scripture</hi> he is called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of this his <hi>divine</hi> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Virgins Womb,</hi> and sometimes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Score of his being ordained by <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>Messiaship</hi>; sometimes because he was raised by <hi>God</hi> from the <hi>Dead,</hi> and sometimes because he was installed by him into his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatorial Kingdom</hi>: Yet upon neither of these Accounts can he be properly called the <hi>only begotten Son</hi>; for upon the <hi>three last</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts sundry <hi>others</hi> have been as properly begotten by <hi>God</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi>; some ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been installed by him into <hi>great</hi> and <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> Offices; <hi>others</hi> raised from the <hi>Dead; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> truly ordained by him his <hi>Messiah's,</hi> or <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed</hi> Ones; so that upon neither of these Accounts can he be stiled the <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> others having been thus begotten as well as himself. And as for the <hi>first,</hi> his being conceived by the <hi>Holy Ghost in the Virgins Womb,</hi> this was not sufficient neither to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him the <hi>only begotten</hi>; because though it was indeed a <hi>miraculous</hi> Production, yet was it not so much above the Production of the <hi>first</hi> Man as to place him in that <hi>singular</hi> Eminence. For the forming of <hi>Adam</hi> out of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59595:94"/>
Substance of the Earth was altogether as <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous</hi> a Production as the forming of <hi>Christ</hi> out of the substance of the Woman; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since <hi>Adam</hi> is called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Luk. 3.38. because <hi>God</hi> immediately formed him of the substance of the Earth; he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as <hi>good</hi> a Right to the Title of God's only begotten Son as <hi>Christ</hi> himself had; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>God</hi> immediately formed him of the substance of a Woman. Wherefore his <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> Right above all others to this <hi>glorious</hi> Title of God's <hi>only begotten Son</hi> must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be founded upon some <hi>higher</hi> Reason than this, that is, upon some such Reason as is wholly peculiar to himself. For if he be really and truly God's <hi>only begotten Son,</hi> all <hi>other</hi> Persons whatsoever must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be excluded from that Claim; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently he must be <hi>so</hi> begotten of <hi>God</hi> as no <hi>other</hi> Person is, or ever was: And to be- <hi>so</hi> begotten of <hi>God,</hi> is to be begotten by him by a <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> Generation, which is nothing else but a <hi>vital</hi> Production of <hi>another</hi> in the <hi>same</hi> Nature with him, from whom it is produced; even as a Man begets a Man, and every Animal begets <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> of the same Kind and Nature with it self: And thus to be begotten of <hi>God,</hi> is to be begotten into the same <hi>divine</hi> Nature with himself; to derive or communicate
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:59595:95"/>
from him the infinitely <hi>perfect</hi> Nature and Essence of a <hi>God.</hi> And in this Sense only our <hi>blessed Saviour</hi> is the <hi>only begotten Son of the Father,</hi> as being generated by him from all <hi>Eternity</hi> into the <hi>same</hi> Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating from him his own <hi>infinite</hi> Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and Perfections; in which sense he is truly the <hi>only begotten</hi> Son, because in this Sense, and in this only, none is or was, or ever shall be begotten of the <hi>Father</hi> but <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When therefore it is said that <hi>he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> the Meaning is this; he gave <hi>up</hi> that infinitely <hi>great</hi> and <hi>dear</hi> Son of his, that is, his <hi>natural</hi> Image and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; that <hi>only Son</hi> to whom from all <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> he hath communicated his own most <hi>perfect</hi> Essence and Nature. If then it was so <hi>great</hi> an Instance of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith and <hi>ardent</hi> Love of <hi>God</hi> at his Command to offer up his only Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> a Son, who though how hopeful soever, yet who fell infinitely <hi>shorter</hi> of the Perfection of our <hi>Saviour</hi> than the Light of the <hi>Glow-worm</hi> doth of the Light of the <hi>Sun</hi>; what an <hi>astonishing</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Love was it in the <hi>great</hi> Father of the World to give up his <hi>only begotten Son</hi>; a Son whom he had begotten in his own <hi>divine</hi> Nature, and to whom he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated all the <hi>infinite</hi> Perfections of his
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:59595:95"/>
own Being; a Son who was the most <hi>perfect</hi> Image of himself, who was infinitely <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and differed from him in nothing but only in being <hi>his Son</hi>; who had the Fulness of the <hi>Godhead</hi> dwelling in him, and whom, being infinitely <hi>perfect</hi> as himself, he loved as infinitely as <hi>his own</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and consequently could as easily have given <hi>up</hi> himself for us, as he did, that <hi>dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Beloved</hi> in whom his Soul was so well pleased? Who but a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>infinite</hi> Love and <hi>immeasurable</hi> Inclination to do <hi>good</hi> to his Creatures, would have given them such an <hi>inestimable</hi> Jewel out of his Bosom; a Jewel wherein all the Brightness of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> did sparkle, and which upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was as <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> to him as his own Life? And hence we find the <hi>Apostle</hi> valuing the Greatness of God's Love to us, by the Greatness and Dearness of the Person whom he gave <hi>up</hi> for our sakes; <hi>in this was manifested the love of God towards us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 Joh. iv.9. And indeed without this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of his being the <hi>only begotten Son of God</hi> by <hi>eternal</hi> Generation and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Nature with him, God's Love in giving him <hi>up</hi> for us would not be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably so <hi>considerable</hi> as it is. For if, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:59595:96"/>
to the Doctrin of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> he should only have caused a Man to be born for us after <hi>another</hi> manner than <hi>other</hi> Men are, and then have delivered him for our sake; there would have been no such <hi>great</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his Love in this Way of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, more than what must have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed should he have chosen to redeem us any <hi>other</hi> Way. To have redeemed us indeed, by what Means soever, would have been a most <hi>glorious</hi> Expression of his Love and <hi>good</hi> Will to us; but since the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath raised the Consideration of God's Love <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> from the Dignity of the Person whom he sent to redeem us, by how much <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> the Dignity of this Person is, by so much <hi>greater</hi> is the Estimation of his Love. But if the Dignity of <hi>Christ</hi>'s Person, as the <hi>on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son of</hi> God, consisted meerly in being a Man born into the World in such an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Manner, this would have made such an <hi>inconsiderable</hi> Addition to his Love in redeeming us, that he would have much more <hi>agrandized</hi> his Kindness to us to have offered up an <hi>Angel of Heaven</hi> for us, though of the most <hi>inferior</hi> Order, than to have thus delivered <hi>up</hi> his only begotten Son. But to offer up his <hi>natural</hi> Son to whom he had communicated his Nature, his Son who was <hi>God co-eternal</hi> and <hi>co-essential</hi> with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:59595:96"/>
was a more <hi>transcendent</hi> Expression of his Love to us, than if he had unpeopled <hi>Heaven</hi> for our sakes, and delivered up to us the whole <hi>Quire</hi> of <hi>Angels, Archangels</hi> and <hi>Seraphims.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> The Greatness of God's Love and Goodness towards us appears in this also, that he gave up his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> for us when we were Sinners: And this is implied in that Expression, <hi>God so loved the World</hi>; that is, the World as it then was, a <hi>base, depraved,</hi> and <hi>degenerate</hi> World; for of this very World whom <hi>God</hi> thus loved, the <hi>Apostle</hi> gives this <hi>extream bad</hi> Character, <hi>the whole World lieth in Wickedness,</hi> 1 Joh. v.19. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> distributing the whole World into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> pronounces univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally concerning them, <hi>that they were all under Sin,</hi> Rom. iii.9. So that in giving up his Son for such a World as this, he must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily give him for Sinners. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly should we measure God's Goodness by <hi>our own,</hi> this Consideration is enough to render his giving his only begotten Son for us a most <hi>incredible</hi> Expression of it; that when by our Sins we had provoked him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sufferance of any Patience but <hi>his own</hi>; when in Despight of all those <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable</hi> Mercies wherewith from Time to Time he had sought to oblige us, and mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:59595:97"/>
all those <hi>Stupendous</hi> Judgments with which from <hi>one</hi> Generation to <hi>another</hi> he had endeavoured to curb and restrain us; when he had used so many <hi>effectual</hi> Arts to reclaim and amend us, and we by <hi>our own</hi> Obstinacy had bafled and defeated them all, and in stead of mending grew <hi>worse</hi> and <hi>worse</hi> under all his <hi>powerful</hi> Applications; one would have thought that now at last, in stead of trying any <hi>further</hi> Experiments on us, he might have been sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to give us up, as <hi>Physitians</hi> do their <hi>Patients</hi> when they are past all Hope of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and so let us alone to perish in <hi>our own</hi> Obstinacy. And doubtless if after all these Provocations we had known that he had intended to send his Son into the World, <hi>our own</hi> Guilt and Consciousness would have made us conclude that the Design of his sending him was only to ruin and destroy us, to extirpate the whole Race of us from the Face of the Earth, that so his Creation might be no longer <hi>scandalized</hi> with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of such a Generation of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. But now that after so many <hi>repeated</hi> Affronts and Rebellions, and in the midst of so many <hi>loud-crying</hi> Guilts that perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rang in his Ears, he should still persevere to love us in such a <hi>transcendent</hi> Degree, as to part with what is <hi>nearest</hi> and <hi>dearest</hi> to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:59595:97"/>
him for our sakes, even his only <hi>begotten</hi> Son out of his Bosom, is such an <hi>astonishing</hi> Expression of his Goodness to us, as we can never sufficiently magnify and admire. Had Mankind been as <hi>innocent</hi> as they are <hi>guilty</hi> before <hi>God,</hi> had their Virtues been as <hi>great</hi> and as <hi>numerous</hi> as their Crimes were; yet to send his <hi>great</hi> Son down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to visit them, had been such an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>condescending</hi> Goodness in him as would have justly merited our <hi>everlasting</hi> Praise and Remembrance; but to send him down to Sinners, to such a Race of <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> and <hi>incorrigible</hi> Sinners, and that not to destroy but to save them; to obtain for, and tender to them a Kingdom of <hi>immortal</hi> Pleasures, and use all <hi>possible</hi> Means safely to conduct them thither; <hi>Lord,</hi> what a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Love is this! And hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> estimates this <hi>prodigious</hi> Instance of the Love of <hi>God,</hi> by the <hi>Vndeservingness</hi> of those upon whom it was exercised; <hi>but God,</hi> says he, <hi>commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet Sinners Christ died for us,</hi> Rom. v.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The Greatness of God's Love and Goodness towards us appears in this also, that he gave up his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> for the whole World of Sinners; he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine and limit this <hi>great</hi> Design of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:59595:98"/>
by granting a <hi>monopoly</hi> of it to a <hi>few particular</hi> Favourites, but settled it as a <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi> Charter upon the <hi>whole</hi> Corporation of Mankind; for he <hi>so loved the World,</hi> says the Text, <hi>that he gave his only begotten Son</hi>; that is, for the benefit of the World. For how could his giving of his <hi>Son</hi> have been an Expression of his Love to the World, if he had not given him for the <hi>publick</hi> Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the World? Had his Design been to restrain his Gift to a <hi>few particular</hi> Persons, whom he had designed to rescue from the <hi>general</hi> Shipwrack, the Text must have run thus, <hi>God so loved some particular Persons in the World, that he gave up his only begotten Son.</hi> For to make that an Instance of his Love to <hi>all</hi> which he designed only for the Benefit of a <hi>few,</hi> is to pretend a Love to the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of Men which he never intended them; for that by the <hi>World</hi> here he means the whole World, he himself assures us, 1 Joh. ii.2. <hi>And he is the Propitiation for our Sins: And not for ours only, but also for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> And what he means by the <hi>whole World,</hi> he tells us in the same <hi>Epistle,</hi> 1 Joh. v. <hi>The whole World lieth in Wickedness.</hi> So that this whole World that lies in Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, is that whole World for whose Sins <hi>Christ</hi> is a Propitiation; and that whole World for whose Sins <hi>Christ</hi> is a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59595:98"/>
is the World whom <hi>God</hi> so loved, as to give his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> for. But the <hi>Apostle</hi> yet more expresly tells us, that the <hi>head of every Man is Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. xi.3. And if so, then every Man is a Part of <hi>Christ's Body</hi>; and if so, then every Man hath a Communion in the Benefits of his Blood; for Ephes. v.23. he is said to be the <hi>Saviour of the Body</hi>; and more expresly yet, Heb. ii.9. it is said, that <hi>by the grace of God he tasted death for every Man.</hi> So that the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath as <hi>emphatically</hi> declared the <hi>universal</hi> Extent of this <hi>great</hi> Gift of God's Love, as it was possible for it to do in any <hi>human</hi> Words; and methinks 'tis strange that any Men should presume to restrain it, when they have no <hi>other</hi> Defence for so doing but only an <hi>odd</hi> Distinction that makes the <hi>whole</hi> World to signify the <hi>smallest</hi> Part of it, the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to import a <hi>few particular</hi> Atoms of it, and <hi>every</hi> Man to denote <hi>one</hi> Man of Ten Thousand.</p>
            <p>Behold then the <hi>immense</hi> Goodness of God, that hath not only given up his <hi>Son,</hi> for Sinners, but for a <hi>whole</hi> World of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and excluded none but those who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude themselves from the Benefits of this <hi>mighty</hi> Donation! That hath planted this <hi>heavenly Tree of Life</hi> in the midst of a <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi> World, and hath not confined or
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:59595:99"/>
inclosed it for the Use of a <hi>few selected</hi> Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; but laid it open for all Comers, that whosoever would, might take of its Fruit, and <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>live for ever.</hi> O <hi>good God!</hi> How <hi>vast</hi> is thy Love, that hath thus impartially diffused it self over such a <hi>wide</hi> World of Sinners, that in this <hi>stupendous</hi> Gift of thy <hi>Son</hi> had so <hi>kind</hi> a Respect to every <hi>Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,</hi> and made no Exception of any how <hi>sinful</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> soever, that will but comply with the <hi>merciful</hi> Terms and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> The Greatness of God's Love and Goodness towards us appears also in this, that he hath given up his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> to become a Man for Sinners. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he was upon God's giving him up, he was what <hi>God</hi> gave him up to be; and therefore since upon God's giving him up he became a Man, it necessarily follows that he gave him up to become so. And indeed since <hi>God</hi> had such a <hi>merciful</hi> Design as to send his <hi>Son</hi> into the World to reform and save it, it was highly <hi>convenient</hi> for <hi>us,</hi> though not for <hi>him,</hi> that he should come to us in <hi>our own</hi> Natures, not only that he might consecrate <hi>human</hi> Nature that had been so miserably <hi>desecrated</hi> and <hi>prophaned</hi>; but also, that he might endear himself to us by the <hi>great</hi> Honour he did us in assuming our
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:59595:99"/>
Natures; and that having our Passions, and being in our Circumstances he might by <hi>his own</hi> Practice give us an Example how to govern the <hi>one,</hi> and how to behave our selves in the <hi>other.</hi> Had he come down from the <hi>Heavens</hi> inrobed with Splendor and Light, and preached his <hi>Gospel</hi> to us in the midst of a <hi>Choir of Angels</hi> from some <hi>bright</hi> Throne in the Clouds, this indeed would have been more <hi>convenient</hi> for him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more <hi>suitable</hi> to the <hi>natural</hi> Dignity and Majesty of his Person. But the <hi>All-merciful</hi> Father in the Disposal of his <hi>Son</hi> consulted not so much <hi>his</hi> Convenience as <hi>ours</hi>; he knew well enough that should he have sent his <hi>Son</hi> to us in such an <hi>illustrious</hi> Equipage, his Appearance amongst us would have been more apt to astonish than to instruct us, and to have fixed our Thoughts in a <hi>profound</hi> Admiration of his Glory than to have directed our Steps in the Paths of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and <hi>true</hi> Happiness; and that it would be much more for our Interest that he should conduct us by his Example than <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze</hi> us by his Appearance; and therefore that he might do so, he sent him to us in <hi>our own</hi> Natures, that so going before us as a Man he might shew us by his Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple what became Men to do, and direct us by the Print of his own Footsteps. Since
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:59595:100"/>
therefore he assumed our Nature purely for our sakes, what a <hi>stupendous</hi> Instance of God's Goodness was this; that for the sake of a World of <hi>miserable</hi> Sinners he should be content that his own most <hi>dear</hi> and most <hi>glorious</hi> Son should condescend to become a Man, and to empty himself into our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; that he who by the <hi>Divinity</hi> of his Nature was exalted more above that of the <hi>highest</hi> Angel than <hi>that</hi> is <hi>above</hi> the <hi>lowest</hi> Animal, should personally unite himself to a Handful of Dust, and marry his <hi>Divinity</hi> to the Infirmities of our Nature; that he whose Throne was in the <hi>Heavens,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whose <hi>sacred</hi> Feet the whole <hi>Choir</hi> of <hi>heavenly Angels</hi> lie prostrate, should abase himself so <hi>low,</hi> as to come down among Mortals, and associate himself with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions so <hi>unworthy</hi> of him? O <hi>good God!</hi> When thou hast condescended so <hi>low,</hi> what is there thou wilt not condescend to, to do <hi>good</hi> to thy Creatures? But this is not all, you shall see him stoop <hi>lower</hi> yet; For</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The Greatness of God's Love and Goodness towards us appears also in this, that he gave up <hi>his only begotten Son</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>miserable</hi> Man for Sinners. It would have been some Abatement to his <hi>mighty</hi> Condescention, if when he sent him down among us in our Nature he had made him
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:59595:100"/>
               <hi>supream visible</hi> Monarch of the World; if he had crowned him with all the Splendors of an <hi>earthly</hi> Condition, if he had ushered him into the World in a <hi>triumphal</hi> Chariot with all the Kings of the Earth either <hi>prostrate</hi> before him or chained at his Chariot-Wheels: This though a <hi>vast</hi> Condescention in the <hi>eternal</hi> Son, yet would not have been so <hi>low</hi> as it was to be born of a <hi>poor</hi> Mother, to be educated as a <hi>Carpenters Son,</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Penury,</hi> to the <hi>Contempt</hi> of every <hi>sordid</hi> Wretch, and the <hi>perpetual</hi> Persecutions of a <hi>borish</hi> and <hi>ill-natured</hi> Rable; and yet this was the <hi>wretched</hi> State to which <hi>God</hi> humbled his <hi>own dear</hi> Son for our sakes. For the Design of his Humiliation being to raise us, the most <hi>merciful</hi> Father consulted not so much what was for his Ease, as what was for our Benefit; for he knew well enough that should he have introduced him into the World in <hi>earthly</hi> Pomp and Magnificence, it would not have been so <hi>well</hi> for us; that we were <hi>too</hi> Ambitious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready of the Vanities of this World, and that <hi>that</hi> had been the <hi>great</hi> Snare that had intangled and ruined us; and that therefore it was <hi>necessary</hi> when his <hi>Son</hi> came among us, he should take us off from our <hi>over-eager</hi> Pursuit of them, disgrace and expose them to us by his own <hi>voluntary</hi> Refusal of them;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59595:101"/>
that by seeing him trample on them when they lay all at his Feet we might learn to despise them, and be at length convinced what <hi>foolish</hi> Bargains we make when we sell our Innocence and our Happiness for such <hi>insignificant</hi> Trifles. He thought it much more <hi>necessary</hi> for us, that his <hi>Son</hi> should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise his Virtue than display his Greatness among us; and therefore he placed him in such Circumstances of <hi>human</hi> Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by his own Example he might copy out to us the <hi>noblest</hi> Pattern of <hi>holy</hi> living. For of all States, that of Affliction affords the <hi>largest</hi> Sphere to exercise <hi>human</hi> Virtue in; and therefore in this State out of his <hi>good</hi> Will to us he placed his own Son, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he might set us a Patten of Obedience to <hi>Superiors,</hi> and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the World; of <hi>Patience</hi> and <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Meekness</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation</hi> to the Will of God; that so by his Example we might be excited to the Exercise of all those <hi>passive</hi> Virtues, which are not only most <hi>glorious,</hi> but most <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> to <hi>human</hi> Nature; and that by behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how <hi>mean</hi> and yet how <hi>good</hi> he was, we might all become more <hi>ambitious</hi> of being <hi>good</hi> than <hi>great</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Now what an <hi>amazing</hi> Instance of God's Goodness is this, that meerly for our sakes, and to promote our Happiness; he should
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:59595:101"/>
depress his own <hi>Son</hi> into such a <hi>miserable</hi> Condition, that he who was in the <hi>Form of God, who thought it no Robbery to be equal with God,</hi> should, by the Appointment of <hi>his own</hi> Father to whom he was so infinitely <hi>dear,</hi> make himself of <hi>no Reputation,</hi> take on him the Form of a Servant, become a <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>sorrows</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and acquaint himself with Griefs; and all this to put himself into a <hi>better</hi> Capacity of doing <hi>good</hi> to the World? <hi>Good God!</hi> When I consider with my self that once there was a Time when thou didst send thy <hi>blessed</hi> Son from <hi>Heaven</hi> to assume my Nature; that therein he dwelt <hi>upon</hi> this Earth and conversed with such <hi>poor</hi> Mortals as my self; that he suffered himself to be despised and persecuted, and by thy own Appointment wandred about like a <hi>poor</hi> Wretch <hi>naked</hi> and <hi>destitute</hi> of all those Comforts which I abundantly enjoy, and all this that he might the more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do <hi>good</hi> to a World of <hi>ill-natured</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, methinks this <hi>wonderous</hi> Prodigy of Love not only <hi>puzles</hi> my Conceit, but outreach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es my Wonder and Admiration: And though it be a Love that exceeds my <hi>largest</hi> Thoughts, such as I have <hi>infinite</hi> Cause to rejoyce in, but could never have had the Impudence to expect; yet while I stand <hi>gazing</hi> on it, methinks I am like one that is
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:59595:102"/>
looking down from a <hi>stupendous</hi> Precipice, whose Height fills me with a <hi>trembling</hi> Horror and even oversets my Reason.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly, The Greatness of God's Love and Goodness towards us appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in this, that he gave his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> to be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for the Sins of <hi>miserable</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and this is plainly implied in that Expression, <hi>he gave his only begotten Son</hi>: For in the two Verses foregoing the Text, our <hi>Saviour</hi> foretells his own Death; <hi>for as Moses,</hi> saith he, <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have eternal Life</hi>; and then it immediately follows, <hi>for God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> that is, he gave him to be lifted <hi>up</hi> upon the Cross, even as the Serpent was lifted up by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wilderness; that so by his <hi>precious</hi> Death and Sacrifice he might make an Atonement for the Sins of the World: And accordingly he is said to be <hi>delivered up for our offences,</hi> Rom. iv.25. even as the Sacrifice was delivered up at the Door of the Tabernacle to propitiate <hi>God</hi> for the Sins of the Offerer. For to compleat the <hi>propitiatory</hi> Sacrifices under the Law <hi>three</hi> Things were requisite; first, the <hi>offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it at the Door of the Tabernacle; the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:59595:102"/>
               <hi>slaying</hi> of it, and the <hi>presenting</hi> of its Blood either within the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, all which were found in the Sacrifice of our <hi>blessed Saviour.</hi> First, he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>willing</hi> Victim for the Sins of the World. Hence Joh. xvii.19. <hi>for this cause,</hi> saith he, <hi>do I sanctify my self,</hi> that is, offer up my self as a Sacrifice to thee; for so in Levit. xxii.2, 3. and sundry other places, to <hi>hallow</hi> or <hi>sanctify</hi> any Thing to the <hi>Lord</hi> denotes the offering it to him in Sacrifice. And accordingly we find that <hi>that Prayer</hi> by <hi>which Christ</hi> consecrated himself to the Lord, Joh. xvii. was much like that by which the <hi>High Priest</hi> did consecrate his Victims before the Altar on the <hi>great</hi> day of Expiation; for as he, before he slew the Sacrifice, did <hi>first</hi> commend himself and <hi>his own</hi> Family; then the Family of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the whole Congregation to the <hi>Lord</hi>; so our <hi>Saviour,</hi> in this <hi>excellent</hi> Prayer whereby he sanctified himself to his Father a Sacrifice for the Sins of the World, <hi>first</hi> commended <hi>himself</hi> to him, then his <hi>Apostles,</hi> then all those who should afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in his Name; which having done, he went forth presently to the Place where he was apprehended, and carried to Judgment and condemned to Death. Then as a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory</hi> Sacrifice he was slain for our sins, for
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:59595:103"/>
so St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, Ephes. ii.24. <hi>he bore our Sins in his own Body on the Tree</hi>; that is, that <hi>natural</hi> Evil of a most <hi>shameful</hi> and <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Death was inflicted on him for our Sins, that so he might make an Expiation for them, and free us from the Guilt and Punishment that was due to them. Hence in that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of him, Isa. liii. we often meet with such Expressions as these, <hi>surely he hath born our Griefs, and carried our Sorrows; he was Wounded for our Transgressions, he was Bruised for our Iniquities: The chastisement of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are Healed. The Lord hath laid on him the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquity of us all: For the transgression of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was he stricken: Thou shalt make his Soul an offering for Sin, and he shall bear their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities: He was numbered with the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, and he bare the sin of Many, and made intercession for the Transgressors:</hi> All which Expressions do plainly imply that what he suffered he suffered for our Sins as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice substituted in the Room of us who were the Offenders, that so he might make Expiation for us, and obtain our Pardon from his Father. And accordingly in the <hi>New Testament</hi> he is said <hi>to be made a Curse for us,</hi> to be our <hi>Ransom</hi> and <hi>Propitiation,</hi> to <hi>redeem</hi> and <hi>reconcile</hi> us, and <hi>obtain</hi> the Remission of our Sins by his Blood; to <hi>die</hi>
               <pb n="199" facs="tcp:59595:103"/>
for us and for our Sins, and to be our <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation</hi>; all which Expressions being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the <hi>Sacrifices of Atonement</hi> under the <hi>Law,</hi> and from them derived upon our <hi>Saviour</hi> do plainly denote him to be a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Atonement for the Sins of the World. And then lastly, there is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of his Blood for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and in the Virtue thereof his interceeding for us with his Father. And hence the Blood of <hi>Christ,</hi> as it is now presented in <hi>Heaven,</hi> is called the <hi>blood of Sprinkling, which speaketh better things than that of Abel,</hi> Heb. xii.24. In which he plainly alludes to the <hi>High Priest</hi>'s sprinkling of the Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in the <hi>Holy of Holies,</hi> which was a Type of Christs presenting his Blood for us in <hi>Heaven,</hi> as you may see, Heb. ix.7. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the 11th and 12th Verses. Verse 7th he tells us that <hi>the High Priest entered not into the Holy of Holies without blood</hi>: But then Verse 12th it is said that Christ <hi>with his own blood entred in once into the holy place, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving obtained eternal Redemption for us.</hi> And in Virtue of this Blood, which he poured out as a Sacrifice of our Sins upon the Cross, he now pleads our Cause at the <hi>right Hand</hi> of his Father, and ever lives to make Intercession for us. So that you see the Death of Christ had in it all the <hi>necessary</hi>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:59595:104"/>
Ingredients of a <hi>propitiatory</hi> Sacrifice for the Sins of the World; and having so, what a <hi>prodigious</hi> Instance is it of the Love of <hi>God</hi> to us, that rather than destroy us, he would give up his own <hi>Son</hi> to be a Sacrifice for us? I do not deny, but if he had pleased he might have pardoned and saved us without any Sacrifice at all; but he knew very well that if he should do so, it would be much worse for us. He knew that if he should pardon our Sins without giving us some <hi>great</hi> Instance of his <hi>implacable</hi> Hatred of them, we should be <hi>too</hi> prone to presume upon his Lenity, and thereupon to return again to our <hi>old</hi> Vomit and Uncleanness; and therefore though it would have been more for the Ease and Interest of his <hi>blessed</hi> Son to have pardoned us without any Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at all, yet such was his Love to us, that because he foresaw that this Way of pardoning would prove <hi>fatal</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi> to us, he was resolved that he would not do it without being moved thereunto by the <hi>greatest</hi> Sacrifice the World could afford him, and that no <hi>less</hi> a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation should appease his Wrath against Offenders than the Blood of his own Son; that so by beholding his Severity against our Sins in this <hi>unvaluable</hi> Sacrifice of the Blood of his <hi>Son,</hi> we might be sufficiently terrified
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:59595:104"/>
from returning again to them, by the very same Reason that moved him to pardon them; that we might not think light of that which <hi>God</hi> would not forgive without such a <hi>vast</hi> Consideration, but might tremble to think of repeating those Sins, the Price of whose Pardon was the <hi>dearest</hi> Blood of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Hence is that of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> Rom. iii.25, 26. <hi>whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteousness,</hi> that is, his righteous Severity against Sin, <hi>for the remission of Sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his Righteousness; that he might be just,</hi> that is, sufficiently <hi>severe</hi> against the Sins of Men so as to warn them from returning, <hi>and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus.</hi> So that now he hath reduced Things to an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> Temper, having so provided, that neither himself nor we might be damnified; that we might not suffer by our doing again what we have done; and that he might not suffer by our doing still the same; that he might be what he is, a <hi>pure</hi> and a <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Saviour; and that we might be what we ought, <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> Subjects. Now what an <hi>amazing</hi> Instance of God's Love is this, that he should so far consult the <hi>good</hi> of his Creatures as to Sacrifice his own <hi>Son</hi>
               <pb n="202" facs="tcp:59595:105"/>
to their Benefit and Safety? How inexpres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly must he needs love us, that for our sakes could behold his most <hi>dearly beloved Son</hi> hanging on the Cross, <hi>covered</hi> with Wounds and Blood, <hi>forsaken</hi> by his Friends, <hi>despised</hi> and <hi>spit</hi> on by his <hi>Barbarous</hi> Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; that could hear him complain in the Bitterness of his Soul, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> And yet suffer him to continue under that <hi>unsufferable</hi> Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny till he had given up his <hi>white</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Soul an <hi>unspotted</hi> Sacrifice for the Sins of the World: Yea, that notwithstanding the <hi>infinite</hi> Love that he bore him, and the <hi>piteous</hi> Moans that his Torments forced from him, was so far from relieving him, that for our sakes he inflicted upon him the <hi>utmost</hi> Misery that <hi>human</hi> Nature could bear; that so having an <hi>experimental</hi> Sense of the most <hi>grievous</hi> Suffering that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is liable to, and being touched with the <hi>utmost</hi> Feeling of our Infirmities, and in all Points tempted like unto us, he might carry a more <hi>tender</hi> Commiseration for us to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and know the <hi>better</hi> how to pity us in all our Griefs and Extremities. For <hi>in all things it behoved him,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>to be made like unto his Brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest,</hi> Heb. ii.17. Hear <hi>O Heavens,</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:59595:105"/>
give Ear O <hi>Earth,</hi> and let all the Creation attend with Astonishment to this <hi>stupendous</hi> Story of Love, which so far exceeds all the <hi>heroick</hi> Kindnesses that ever any <hi>Romance</hi> of Friendship thought of, that no <hi>less</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than that of Miracles could have ever rendred it credible. Well then might the <hi>Apostle</hi> say, <hi>herein is love, not that we loved God,</hi> for after such <hi>vast</hi> Obligations this is no <hi>great</hi> Wonder, <hi>but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our Sins,</hi> 1 Joh. iv.10. And thus you see what an <hi>unspeakable</hi> Instance of the Love of God, his giving his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> is. I shall now conclude this Argument with a few <hi>practical</hi> Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence I infer what <hi>monstrous</hi> Ingratitude it would be in us to deny any Thing to <hi>God</hi> that he demands at our Hands, who hath been so <hi>liberal</hi> to us as to give up his <hi>only begotten Son</hi> for our sakes. O <hi>blessed God!</hi> If it were <hi>possible</hi> for us to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> for thee a thousand Times <hi>more</hi> than at <hi>present</hi> we are able, what a <hi>poor</hi> Return were this for the Gift of thy <hi>Son,</hi> that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable</hi> Expression of thy Goodness? And can we deny thee any Thing after such an Instance of Love, especially when thy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are so <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>reasonable?</hi> When he requires nothing of us but what is for
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:59595:106"/>
our <hi>good,</hi> and the Requital he demands for all his Love to us, is only that we should love our selves, and express <hi>this</hi> Love in doing those Duties which he therefore enjoyns, because they tend to our Happiness; and avoiding those Sins which he therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, because he knows they will be our Bane and Poyson? Can any of my Lusts be as <hi>dear</hi> to me as the <hi>only begotten Son</hi> was to the Father of all things? And yet he parted with him out of Love to me; and shall not I part with these for the Love of him? How can we pretend to any Thing that is <hi>modest</hi> or <hi>ingenuous, tender</hi> or <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive</hi> in <hi>humane</hi> Nature, when nothing will oblige us, no not this <hi>astonishing</hi> Love of <hi>God</hi> in sending his <hi>Son</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die</hi> Miserably for our sakes? <hi>Lord!</hi> What do thy <hi>holy</hi> Angels think of us? How do thy <hi>blessed</hi> Saints resent our Unkindness towards thee? Yea, how justly do the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves reproach and upbraid our Base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; who, <hi>bad</hi> as they are, were never so much <hi>Devils</hi> yet as to make an <hi>ungrateful</hi> Return of such a <hi>vast</hi> Obligation?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> From hence I infer how <hi>desperate</hi> our Condition will be if we defeat the End of this Gift of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and render it <hi>ineffectual</hi> to us. For <hi>God</hi> hath no more Sons to bestow upon us, he being the <hi>only
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:59595:106"/>
begotten</hi> of his Father; <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> are not able to furnish him with such <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other</hi> Gift to bestow upon us; and if he should lay a Tax upon all his Creation to raise one <hi>great</hi> Contribution to the Happiness of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and exact the <hi>utmost</hi> of every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that it is able to Contribute, it would all fall infinitely short of what he hath done for us in this <hi>inestimable</hi> Gift of his own <hi>Son.</hi> So that if this prove <hi>ineffectual,</hi> it is beyond the Power of an <hi>omnipotent</hi> Bounty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us. For though <hi>God</hi> can do all Things that can be well and wisely done, and do not imply a Contradiction; yet this can be no Relief at all to us, who reject his <hi>Son,</hi> and refuse to be made <hi>happy</hi> in the <hi>gracious</hi> Method which he hath prescribed to us. For after this <hi>mighty</hi> Gift of his own <hi>Son</hi> to save us according to the Method of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> there remains nothing more to be done for us, but either to save us whether we will, or no; or else to make us <hi>happy</hi> in our Sins, and save us notwithstanding our Continuance in them; the <hi>former</hi> of which can neither be well nor wisely done, because by saving us against our Wills he must deal with us in such a Way as is <hi>repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> to that Law of Liberty that is implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Natures, and use us not as <hi>Free,</hi> but as <hi>Necessary</hi> Agents. And if considering all
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:59595:107"/>
things, it was <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest</hi> that he should make us <hi>free</hi> Agents, then it can neither be well nor wise to govern us as <hi>necessary</hi> ones; since by so doing he must alter the Course of our Nature, and consequently swerve and decline from what is <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wisest,</hi> which would be to do Violence to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his own Nature. And then as for the <hi>latter,</hi> he cannot do it; because it implies a Contradiction. For to make Men <hi>happy</hi> in their Sins, is to make them <hi>happy</hi> in their Miseries; Misery being as <hi>inseparable</hi> from Sin as Heat is from Fire, and as intimately related to it as the <hi>Son</hi> is to the <hi>Father</hi>; and consequently he may as possibly make a <hi>Father</hi> without a <hi>Son,</hi> as a Sinner without Misery. When therefore <hi>God</hi> hath done all for us that can possibly be done, and we by <hi>our own</hi> Obstinacy have rendred all <hi>ineffectual,</hi> we are beyond the Power of Remedy, and must necessarily perish in our Sins. And when we have no <hi>other</hi> Hope to depend on but this, that the <hi>All-wise</hi> God will <hi>undo</hi> his own Workmanship, and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel</hi> our Nature by governing us contrary to the most <hi>wise</hi> Constitution of it; or that the <hi>All-powerful</hi> God will effect Impossibilities, and do <hi>that</hi> for us which is not an Object of Power, how <hi>deplorable</hi> and <hi>desperate</hi> must our Condition be? Wherefore, as you would
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:59595:107"/>
not run your selves beyond the Reach of all Mercy, and <hi>excommunicate</hi> your own Souls from all Hope of Salvation, be now at last persuaded to comply with Christ's Coming, which was to reduce you from the Error of your Ways, and to bring you to a <hi>serious</hi> Repentance.</p>

            <p>IN these Words you have the Love of <hi>God</hi> measured by a <hi>twofold</hi> Standard; <hi>first</hi> by the Greatness of the Gift which he hath bestowed upon the World, <hi>God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son; Secondly,</hi> by the <hi>blessed</hi> End for which he did bestow him, <hi>that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,</hi> &amp;c.

            </p>
            <p>In which Words you have also <hi>two</hi> very <hi>great</hi> Instances of God's <hi>infinite</hi> Love and <hi>good</hi> Will to Mankind; the <hi>First</hi> is his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing upon us such a <hi>gentle,</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Condition, <hi>That whosoever believeth in him. Secondly,</hi> His proposing such a <hi>vast</hi> Reward to us upon our performing of this Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="tcp:59595:108"/>I begin with the <hi>first,</hi> viz. His imposing upon us such a <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Condition, <hi>That whosoever believeth in him should not perish.</hi> In the Management of which I shall do these two Things:
<list>
                  <item>1. Shew you what it is that is included in <hi>this</hi> Condition, <hi>whosoever believeth in him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. How <hi>good</hi> God hath been to us in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Condition which he hath imposed upon us so <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What is it that is included in <hi>this</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? To which I answer in <hi>general,</hi> that <hi>believing in Christ</hi> doth not only denote a <hi>naked</hi> Assent to the Truth of this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That he is the Son of Cod,</hi> and the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger of Gods Mind and Will to the World, and the <hi>Saviour</hi> of Mankind; but that it also includes whatsoever is naturally <hi>consequent</hi> thereunto. For thus it is very <hi>ordinary</hi> with the <hi>Scripture</hi> to express the <hi>natural</hi> Effects and Consequents of things by their Causes and Principles. <hi>This is the love of God,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>that we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Jo. v.3. whereas in strictness of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, our keeping his Commandments is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Effect or Consequence of our loving him. So <hi>Prov.</hi> viii.13. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to hate evil</hi>; whereas indeed this is only
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:59595:109"/>
the Effect, or Consequence of the Fear of the Lord. Thus by <hi>knowing,</hi> and <hi>hearing,</hi> and <hi>remembring</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Scripture</hi> usually expresses the <hi>consequent</hi> Effects of them, Thus Act. xxii.14. <hi>The God of our Fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his Will</hi>; that is, that thou mayst not only know it, but by thy Knowledge mayst be suitably affected with it; (for it was not to a <hi>bare contemplative</hi> Knowledge of it that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was chosen:) and then it follows, <hi>and see that Just one, and shouldst hear the voice of his Mouth</hi>; that is, that hearing the Voice of his Mouth, thou shouldst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by be induced to obey it; for he was not meerly to hear <hi>Christ</hi> speaking to him out of the <hi>Heavens,</hi> but that hearing him he might submit to his Will, and become his <hi>Apostle</hi> to the World. Many <hi>other</hi> Places I might easily give you, where the <hi>natural</hi> Effects and Consequents are in Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by their Causes and Principles. And thus also <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Believing</hi> whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is used in <hi>Scripture</hi> to signify the Condition of the <hi>Gospel-Covenant</hi> always imploies its <hi>natural</hi> Effects and Consequents, that is, <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>universal</hi> Obedience to those Rules of <hi>Holy Living</hi> which the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel</hi> prescribes; for this is the most <hi>natural</hi> Effect of our believing in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> And
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:59595:109"/>
hence it is called <hi>the obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. xvi.26. that is, the Obedience which springs from Faith, as from its Cause and Principle; And accordingly, <hi>Rom.</hi> x.16. you find that to <hi>believe</hi> and to <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>Gospel</hi> signifies one and the same Thing; <hi>But they have not all obeyed the Gospel,</hi> saith he; for <hi>Esaias</hi> saith, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?</hi> that is, who hath believed it, so as to obey it? So that wheresoever <hi>Faith</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned singly as the Condition of the <hi>Gospel-Covenant,</hi> it is apparent it must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in the <hi>largest</hi> Sense, as comprehending <hi>that</hi> Obedience which is the Effect and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of it. So 1 Joh. v.1. <hi>Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God</hi>; that is, whosevever so believes the Truth of this Proposition as to practise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and govern his Life and Actions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenour and Direction of it, is truly a Child of <hi>God.</hi> For he who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>Christ</hi> to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> but continues obstinately <hi>disobedient</hi> to his Laws, is so far from being <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>really</hi> a <hi>Child</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> that he thereby becomes <hi>ten</hi> Times more a <hi>Child</hi> of the <hi>Devil</hi>; for, saith the <hi>Apostle, If I have all Faith, and have not Charity, I am nothing</hi>; and Gal. v.6. <hi>For in Jesus Christ neither Circumcision availeth any thing, nor Vncircumcision, but Faith which worketh by
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:59595:110"/>
Love</hi>; and if so, then <hi>Faith</hi> it self is nothing abstracted from this <hi>blessed</hi> Effect of it, i. e. <hi>working by love:</hi> For in Gal. vi.15. he tells us that <hi>Circumcision is nothing, but the new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>; by which <hi>new Creature</hi> he means an <hi>obedient</hi> Temper and Disposition of Mind, as he plainly tells us, 1 Cor. vii.19. <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision is nothing, and Vncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</hi> So that by these <hi>different</hi> Variations of expression it is apparent, that by <hi>Faith</hi> as <hi>significant</hi> in the Account of <hi>Christ,</hi> he always means a <hi>working Faith,</hi> the Effect of which is the <hi>new Creature,</hi> or <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Commandments of God.</hi> And so I have done with the <hi>first</hi> Thing proposed, which was to shew you what is included in <hi>this</hi> Condition, <hi>whosoever believeth in him,</hi> which you see is not to be confined to a <hi>bare</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> Belief of him, but must be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed further, even to that <hi>whole</hi> Course of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which is the <hi>natural</hi> Effect of such a Belief. So that whosoever believes in him, is as much as if he had said, <hi>Whosoever so believes in him, as sincerely and universally to obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed now to the <hi>next</hi> Thing, which was to shew you how <hi>good</hi> God hath been to us in making the Condition which he hath imposed upon us, so <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi>;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:59595:110"/>
and this will appear if we consider these five Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That he hath put nothing into <hi>this</hi> Condition but what is in its <hi>own</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exceeding <hi>good</hi> for us.</item>
               <item>2. That he hath most mercifully <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned</hi> the Whole to the <hi>present</hi> State and Circumstances of our Nature.</item>
               <item>3. That he hath rendred the Whole al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most necessarily <hi>consequent</hi> to our believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That to beget that <hi>Belief</hi> in us, he hath given us the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing</hi> Evidence.</item>
               <item>5. That to render this Belief <hi>operative,</hi> he hath engaged himself to <hi>assist, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate,</hi> and <hi>inliven</hi> it by his ow <hi>immediate</hi> Concurrence.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>God</hi> hath put nothing into <hi>this</hi> Condition but what is in its <hi>own</hi> Nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>good</hi> for us. For there is no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in all the <hi>Gospel</hi> but what contains ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther some <hi>effectual</hi> Means or <hi>apparent</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of what is <hi>morally</hi> and <hi>eternally Good</hi>; and whatsoever is <hi>morally good</hi> is <hi>naturally so.</hi> For the moral Goodness of Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Fitness and Reasonableness of them, and that which is the <hi>moral Good,</hi> or Duty of Men consists in doing that which is eternally <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> for them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:59595:111"/>
the Frame and Circumstances of their Natures, and the <hi>different</hi> Relations wherein they are placed in the World. But now for Men to do what is eternally <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> is naturally <hi>good</hi> for and <hi>beneficial</hi> to themselves; because by so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>advance</hi> their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and accomplish their own Satis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faction and Happiness. For our Reason being that <hi>proper</hi> Character of our Natures that distinguishes us from all <hi>sublunary</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and sets us in a Form of Being above them; the Perfection of our Nature must necessarily consist in being perfectly <hi>reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi>; in having our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> informed with the Principles of <hi>right</hi> Reason, and our <hi>Wills</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> regulated by them; and when once we are released from the Slaveries of Sense and Passion, and all our Powers are so perfectly subdued to this <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior</hi> Principle of Reason, as to do every Thing that it <hi>commands,</hi> and nothing that it <hi>forbids,</hi> and we <hi>chuse</hi> and <hi>refuse,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>hate,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as <hi>right Reason</hi> directs and dictates; then, and not till then we are come to the <hi>full</hi> Stature of <hi>perfect</hi> Men in <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi> Now all the Duty of the <hi>Gospel</hi> being a <hi>reasonable Service,</hi> as the Apostle calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> xii.1. the End and Tendency of it must be to <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:59595:111"/>
us to live according to the Laws of <hi>right</hi> Reason, which is all one as to advance us to the Perfection of <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings; and being once arrived at <hi>this,</hi> we shall find <hi>unspeakable</hi> Satisfaction from within our selves, and feel a <hi>Heaven</hi> of Joys springing up within <hi>our own</hi> Bosoms. For when once our <hi>disjointed</hi> Powers are set in Order, and all our Faculties reduced to their <hi>natural</hi> Subordination, our Nature will be in <hi>perfect</hi> Rest and Ease, being freed from that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> Violence and Oppression under which it now groans, and cured of all those <hi>Spasms</hi> and <hi>Convulsions</hi> of Mind which are the <hi>inseparable</hi> Effects of its Lapse and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy. And all the Motions of our Wills and Affections being regulated by the <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Reason of our Minds, with what <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi> Relishes and <hi>sweet</hi> Gusts of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure shall we taste and review <hi>our own</hi> Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they being always such as our <hi>best</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Reason doth approve of with a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>ungainsaying</hi> Judgment? So that God's Commands, you see, being all of them most <hi>reasonable</hi> must necessarily tend to the Perfection and Happiness of our Nature; besides, that they generally promote even our <hi>sensitive</hi> Happiness, our <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> in <hi>this</hi> World. Now what a most <hi>endearing</hi> Instance is this of
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:59595:112"/>
God's Goodness towards us, that he should make our Benefit the Measure of our Duty, and oblige us to nothing but what is for our <hi>good</hi>; that he should so far concern himself in our Happiness, as to impose it upon us under the Penalty of his <hi>severest</hi> displeasure, and to inforce his Laws with such <hi>inviting</hi> and such <hi>dreadful</hi> Sanctions, only to secure us from running away from <hi>our own</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies? So that to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> is in Effect nothing else but only to be obliged to be <hi>kind</hi> to our selves, and bound in Conscience to be <hi>happy: Good God,</hi> that thou shouldst be so infinitely <hi>Zealous</hi> of our Welfare as to make the Means of it the only Matter of thy Laws, and to promise such <hi>vast</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and <hi>denounce</hi> such <hi>dreadful</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments against us for no <hi>other</hi> Reason but only to <hi>affright</hi> and <hi>allure</hi> us out of Misery into Happiness! That thou shouldst <hi>hate</hi> our Sins so implacably, only because they are our <hi>irreconcilable</hi> Enemies, and be so infinitely <hi>pleased</hi> with our Obedience, only because it leads to our <hi>endless</hi> Bliss and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection! And that it is thus, is so <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>apparent,</hi> that we cannot but acknowledge it a most <hi>convincing</hi> Instance of God's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> Goodness towards us,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> That <hi>God</hi> hath most mercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned <hi>this</hi> Condition to the <hi>present</hi> State
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:59595:112"/>
and Circumstances of our Naure. He saw very well into what a <hi>deplorable</hi> Condition <hi>humane</hi> Nature was reduced, how its Strength was <hi>broken,</hi> and its Health and Vigor <hi>impair'd</hi> and <hi>decayed</hi>; how its Reason was <hi>clouded,</hi> and all its Faculties <hi>depraved</hi>; how apt it was to be <hi>surprized,</hi> and to act unadvisedly; sometimes for Want of <hi>Time,</hi> sometimes for Want of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> in its Thoughts; how much it was <hi>hindred</hi> from acting regularly by <hi>intervening</hi> Accidents, and how it was <hi>weakend</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined</hi> by the <hi>bad</hi> Habits and Necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it had generally contracted: and seeing it reduced to this <hi>sad</hi> State, he hath most graciously accommodated its Burthen to its Strength, and taken Measure of its Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by its Ability to discharge it. For though in his <hi>Gospel</hi> he requires that we should <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holiness in the fear of God,</hi> and <hi>be perfect, as our Father in Heaven is perfect,</hi> that is, that we should advance to the <hi>utmost</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Improvements in Virtue that our Natures are capable of; yet he requires this of us under such <hi>moderate</hi> Penalties as are no ways <hi>destructive</hi> to our <hi>eternal</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, such as the <hi>hiding</hi> his Face from us, and <hi>other</hi> such like <hi>paternal</hi> Severities and Castigations; his correcting us with the Rod of <hi>temporal</hi> Judgments, and abating us in the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:59595:113"/>
Degrees of our <hi>future</hi> Happiness proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to our <hi>moral</hi> Defects and Non-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Penalties though they are <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> to <hi>quicken</hi> our Endeavours, and <hi>excite</hi> us still to a <hi>farther</hi> Progress from <hi>one</hi> Degree of Virtue to <hi>another</hi>; yet are they not such as do <hi>excommunicate</hi> us from <hi>Heaven,</hi> or <hi>disseize</hi> us of the Reward of our <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And indeed should <hi>God</hi> have been <hi>severe</hi> in marking what we do amiss, and exacted of us under the Penalty of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>utmost</hi> Degrees and Improvements that are <hi>possible</hi> for us to attain, no Flesh would be saved; it being <hi>morally impossible</hi> for us in this <hi>degenerate</hi> State to do always the <hi>utmost Good,</hi> or avoid the <hi>utmost Evil</hi> that we are able; and therefore out of a <hi>tender</hi> Regard to the Weakness and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our Nature, he hath only forbid those Neglects and Miscarriages under this Declaration that they are <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Sincerity of our Submission and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him. But as for our <hi>moral</hi> Defects and Infirmities and Surprises, though so far as it is in our Power to avoid them, they are truly Sins against the Law of Perfection, and as such we ought to lament, and beg Pardon for them; yet, Thanks be to a <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi> God, <hi>we shall only be chastned for them here, that we may not be condemned with the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:59595:113"/>
World,</hi> as the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresses it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi.32. and reap <hi>less</hi> Happiness in the <hi>other</hi> World for having sowed <hi>less</hi> Degrees of <hi>good</hi> than we might, and ought to have done in <hi>this</hi>; as the same <hi>Apostle</hi> in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix.6. 'Tis true indeed, as for <hi>wilful</hi> Sinners, he hath concluded them (as it is very reasonable he should) under the Sentence of <hi>eternal</hi> Death; for should he let <hi>such</hi> go unpunished, he must e'en resign up his Government, and leave the <hi>wretched</hi> World in a State of <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> and Confusion; but yet to these he hath extended as much Kindness, as was possible for a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> Governour to do; for he hath not so irrecoverably concluded them under this <hi>direful</hi> Sentence, but that still he doth indulge to them the <hi>saving</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of Repentance, having for the sake of <hi>Jesus,</hi> and his <hi>all-sufficient</hi> Propitiation bound himself by Promise to pardon and receive into his Favour every <hi>wilful</hi> Sinner in the World, if he will but repent of what is <hi>past,</hi> and amend for the <hi>future.</hi> Thus to save the <hi>miserable</hi> World he hath gone to the <hi>utmost</hi> Borders of what is <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> and done as much for us as it was <hi>possible</hi> for the Justice and Rectitude of his Nature to admit of; for should he have proceeded any further he must have pardoned <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi> Sinners which he could not have done
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:59595:114"/>
without allowing and incouraging their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: And to pardon an Offendor that persists in his Fault, that is neither sorry for it, nor willing to amend it, is utterly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruous</hi> to <hi>all wise</hi> Rules of Government, and cannot be practised by any Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>humane</hi> without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering its own Foundations. What then is there beyond this that we can modestly ask, or <hi>God</hi> wisely grant? If <hi>God</hi> had summoned us to his <hi>Privy Council</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and there promised to grant us any Terms of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that we our selves could think fit to propose to him, surely the <hi>utmost</hi> that any <hi>modest</hi> Man could have asked would have been only this; <hi>Lord! Be but so merciful as to consider the Weakness and Infirmity of our Natures so as not to cast us off for every Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or Miscarriage that was only possible for us to avoid: And if at any time we should be such Wretches as knowingly and wilfully to Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, be but so gracious as to receive us again into thy Favour whensoever we heartily repent and amend: This is the utmost that we can request at thy Hands, and for this we will praise thee on the bended Knees of our Souls, and adore thy Goodness for ever and ever:</hi> Why now all this he hath freely granted us of his own Accord; and is not this a most <hi>amazing</hi> Instance of his Goodness,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:59595:114"/>
that of his own <hi>free</hi> Motion he should thus indulge to us the <hi>utmost</hi> Mitigations that we could have modestly desired, and condescended so far to our Weakness, that without an <hi>unpardonable</hi> Impudence we cannot desire him to condescend yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That he hath rendred the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>whole</hi> Condition of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on almost necessarily <hi>consequent</hi> to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> For in that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his Will which he hath made by <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> he hath pressed the Performance of <hi>this</hi> Condition upon us with such <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible</hi> Arguments, as must needs prevail wheresoever they are heartily believed and duly considered. What Man can be so <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> as to trample upon Christ's Law, that firmly believes and considers those <hi>glorious</hi> Rewards it proposes to all that sincerely obey it? What pleasures of Sin can seduce <hi>that</hi> Man from his Duty who is firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that after a <hi>few</hi> Moments Obedience he shall swim in Rivers of Pleasures that flow from God's right Hand <hi>for evermore?</hi> How can any Man have the Courage to <hi>violate</hi> the Laws of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believes and considers those <hi>direful</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments which he hath denounced against the Transgressors of them? And what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:59595:115"/>
or Miseries can scare <hi>that</hi> Man from his Duty, that is chained so <hi>fast</hi> to it by the Consideration of that Wrath of <hi>God</hi> which is revealed from <hi>Heaven</hi> against all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness and Ungodliness of Men? How can any Man love his Sins any longer, that believes and reads that <hi>bloody</hi> Story of them that is written in the <hi>Agony</hi> and <hi>Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>Son of God?</hi> When we consider that he was delivered for our Offences, and that our Sins were the <hi>principal</hi> Actors of all that <hi>woful</hi> Tragedy; that they were these that <hi>betrayed, arraigned,</hi> and <hi>condemned</hi> him; that <hi>borrowed</hi> the Throats of a <hi>barbarous</hi> Rabble to cry out <hi>Crucify him, Crucify him</hi>; that <hi>buffeted</hi> and <hi>scourged</hi> him with the Hands of the <hi>rude</hi> Soldiers; that <hi>gored</hi> his Sides with the Spear, <hi>pierced</hi> his Temples with the Thorns, <hi>rent</hi> his <hi>sacred</hi> Hands and Feet with the Nails that fastned him to the Cross; how can we believe and consider that our Sins did thus barbarously treat the <hi>best</hi> Friend we have in the World without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>inflamed</hi> with Indignation against them? Again, how can we reflect upon that <hi>dreadful</hi> Displeasure <hi>God</hi> expressed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Sins in this <hi>dismal</hi> Example of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing his own <hi>Son</hi> for them, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with Horror, and struck into a <hi>trembling</hi> Agony at the Thought of them?
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:59595:115"/>
Once more, How can we be so desperatly <hi>fool-hardy</hi> as to go on in our Sins, if we believe and consider the Article of the <hi>Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> wherein we must give an Account of whatsoever we have done in the Flesh whether it be <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>evil,</hi> and <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> to all <hi>Eternity</hi> according as we have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged or neglected this <hi>great</hi> Condition of our Salvation? These are such <hi>mighty</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, as one would think, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for Men firmly to <hi>believe,</hi> and yet not be <hi>persuaded</hi> by them. Thus <hi>God</hi> in his Mercy and Goodness to us hath furnished the <hi>Revelation</hi> of his <hi>Son</hi> with such <hi>preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Motives, that our believing in him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most necessarily draws after it the Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>whole</hi> condition of our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for upon our believing in <hi>Jesus,</hi> and considering his Proposals, we are compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed round about with so many <hi>puissant</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to submit our selves to his Laws, as (one would think) all the Temptations of the <hi>Devil</hi> and the <hi>World</hi> are not able to resist. So <hi>careful</hi> hath <hi>God</hi> been to secure us from Sin and Misery, that knowing the Force of our <hi>natural</hi> Reason to be so <hi>weak</hi> to secure us, he hath sent us down these <hi>fresh</hi> Auxiliaries from <hi>Heaven,</hi> by whose Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if we do but trust to and imploy them, we may easily repulse <hi>all</hi> the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:59595:116"/>
of Sin, and fight our Way through <hi>all</hi> the Difficulties of our Duty. <hi>For this is the Victory,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>by which we overcome the World, even our Faith,</hi> 1 John v.4. which Words are urged by him as an Instance of the Easiness and Gentleness of our Obedience to the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which is the Condition of our Salvation; for v.3. saith he, <hi>this is the love of God, that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> Well, but how doth this appear? Why saith he, <hi>for every one that is born of God overcometh the World, and this is the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</hi> For <hi>who is he that overcometh the World, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God,</hi> v.5. So that he proves the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of the <hi>Gospel Commands</hi> by this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the keeping them depends upon that <hi>Faith</hi> by which we <hi>believe Jesus to be the Son of God.</hi> By this means therefore <hi>God</hi> hath mercifully rendred the Condition of our Salvation <hi>easie</hi> to us by rendring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it so necessarily <hi>consequent</hi> to <hi>our believing in Jesus</hi>; in which how <hi>good</hi> he hath been to us will evidently appear, if we consider.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> That to beget this <hi>Belief</hi> in us he hath given us the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>convincing</hi> Evidence; <hi>viz.</hi> the Evidence of those <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous</hi>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:59595:116"/>
Works wherewith he accompanied the Ministry of our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and sealed and confirmed it to the World; which of all Kinds of Evidence is the most <hi>apt</hi> to convince, and persuade the World of the Truth of any <hi>divine</hi> Revelation; for this Kind of Evidence appeals to Mens Senses, and is such an Argument as they may <hi>see</hi> and <hi>touch</hi> and <hi>handle</hi>; and Men are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally apt to give more Credit to their own Senses than to the <hi>clearest</hi> Inferences and Deductions of Reason. And indeed the Generality of Men are hardly <hi>capable</hi> of any <hi>other</hi> Notices of Things but what are immediatly impressed upon them by the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of their Sense; for they have not Skill enough to compare <hi>simple</hi> Terms so exactly with <hi>one another</hi> as to compound them into <hi>true</hi> Propositions, and then to infer from every such Proposition its <hi>natural</hi> Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents and Deductions. These are Things that require a <hi>great deal</hi> more Art and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, than Mens <hi>Educations</hi> and <hi>Affairs</hi> will ordinarily afford them. But <hi>Miracles</hi> are Things that are <hi>obvious</hi> to Mens Senses, and from them to infer a <hi>divine</hi> Commission in the Person that works them, is not only <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> but very <hi>easie</hi> to the most <hi>vulgar</hi> Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. For <hi>Miracles</hi> being the <hi>visible</hi> Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of a <hi>divine</hi> Power cannot be supposed
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:59595:117"/>
to be wrought by any but Persons that are <hi>divinely</hi> commissionated, and he that shews me an <hi>immediate</hi> Effect of God's Power gives me <hi>that</hi> in Token that he came from <hi>God.</hi> So that the Argument of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> you see, is the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible</hi> of all others; and as it is so, it is the most <hi>powerful</hi> to convince and persuade Men. For whereas had our <hi>Saviour</hi> prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Doctrins in a Way of <hi>rational</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and Inference, he must have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> by <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>different</hi> Arguments, which would have been so <hi>tedious</hi> that the <hi>Vulgar</hi> would never have Leisure enough to attend them, nor yet Capacity enough to retain them; but by this Argument of <hi>Miracles</hi> he proved them all at once, because his <hi>Miracles</hi> were a Token that the <hi>God</hi> of Truth did approve his Doctrin; and it cannot be supposed that the <hi>God</hi> of Truth would have so visibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of his Doctrin in the <hi>Gross,</hi> had any Part or Proposition of it been <hi>false</hi> and <hi>erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous.</hi> Thus <hi>God</hi> out of his <hi>infinite</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath not only revealed his <hi>everlasting Gospel</hi> to us, but hath also taken the most <hi>effectual</hi> Course to convince and persuade us of the Truth of it. He hath set his own <hi>Almighty</hi> Power at Work to <hi>still</hi> the <hi>Seas,</hi> and <hi>raise</hi> the <hi>Dead,</hi> to <hi>cure</hi> the <hi>Blind</hi> and
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:59595:117"/>
               <hi>Lame</hi> and <hi>Diseased,</hi> to <hi>change</hi> and <hi>vary</hi> the Course and Order of his Creation, and all this for no <hi>other</hi> Purpose but to persuade Mankind of the Truth of those <hi>glad</hi> Tidings which he revealed from <hi>Heaven</hi> to them by his own <hi>Son.</hi> And as he hath given us the <hi>best</hi> Evidences to convince us of the Truth of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> so he hath taken the most <hi>effectual</hi> Course, to continue and perpetuate it to the World. For <hi>first,</hi> he raised up <hi>sundry Eye-witnesses</hi> who conversed with our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> and beheld his <hi>Miracles,</hi> and after they had seen him <hi>risen from the Dead,</hi> and <hi>ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into Heaven,</hi> did openly publish and testify them to the World, and finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and ratified their Testimony by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down their Lives for it; which was as <hi>high</hi> a Confirmation as could possibly have been given of the Truth of it. But lest after all, the World should suspect them, God also furnished them with the Gift of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and continued <hi>that</hi> Gift as an <hi>Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lome</hi> to their Successors for <hi>Three Hundred</hi> Years together; that so as the Testimony of the <hi>first Eye-witnesses</hi> was confirmed not only by their <hi>Martyrdoms,</hi> but by their <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> also; so it might still be handed down from them through the <hi>successive</hi> Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the same <hi>infallible</hi> manner till it was spread over all the World, and needed no
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:59595:118"/>
farther <hi>Martyrdoms,</hi> or <hi>Miracles</hi> to confirm it. O <hi>blessed God!</hi> What care hast thou taken, <hi>first</hi> to provide, and <hi>then</hi> to secure the Evidences of our <hi>holy Religion,</hi> that all Generations might have <hi>sufficient</hi> Motives of Credibility; and that Mankind might still have <hi>abundant</hi> Reason to believe in thy <hi>Son</hi> to the End of the World, when they shall see him come down from <hi>Heaven</hi> to Judgment? How <hi>easie</hi> therefore hath <hi>God</hi> rendred the Condition of our Salvation to us, when he hath not only rendred the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of it so necessarily <hi>consequent</hi> to our <hi>believing in Jesus,</hi> but also to beget this <hi>Belief,</hi> in us hath given us such <hi>abundant</hi> Evidence? How can we sufficiently <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> his Goodness that hath been so infinitely <hi>solicitous</hi> to secure our Happiness, and hath so contrived Things that we cannot heartily believe his <hi>Gospel</hi> and not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded by it to comply with the Terms of our Salvation; nor yet impartially consider the Evidence of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and not heartily believe it? And yet as if all this were not enough,</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly, to render this Belief <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>effectual,</hi> he hath engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>assist, actuate,</hi> and <hi>enliven</hi> it by his own <hi>immediate</hi> Concurrence. Provided we use our own <hi>honest</hi> Endeavour he hath
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:59595:118"/>
assured us <hi>again</hi> and <hi>again</hi> that <hi>he will give his Holy Spirit to every one that asks; that he will work in us to will and to do,</hi> if we will but take care to <hi>work out our own Salvation with fear and trembling</hi>; and that <hi>to him that hath,</hi> i. e. makes an honest Improvement of that Strength that he hath, <hi>it shall be given, and he shall have more abundantly.</hi> So that though one would have thought he had done suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for us before in giving us such <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> Evidence to beget in us an <hi>hearty</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and such <hi>prevalent</hi> Motives to persuade us to submit to it, and comply with his <hi>gracious</hi> Proposals; yet such was his Goodness to us, such his <hi>importunate</hi> Care of our Welfare, that he could not stop here, nor think that yet he had done enough for us till by an <hi>irrepealable</hi> Promise he had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself to us to <hi>co-operate</hi> with us, and by the <hi>immediate</hi> Influences of his Grace to bless and succeed our <hi>honest</hi> Endeavours. So that we can no sooner attempt <hi>our own</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration, no sooner set our selves in the way to our Happiness, but the <hi>good God</hi> is immediately <hi>present</hi> with us, <hi>exciting</hi> our <hi>Fath, fixing</hi> our <hi>Consideration, animating</hi> and <hi>encouraging</hi> our <hi>poor Endeavours,</hi> and <hi>supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> us with all manner of Grace and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that our State and Necessities require. Nay, and many and many a Time, while

we are Sleeping on in our <hi>wretched sinful</hi> Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, he comes in Pity to visit us, and <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>anon</hi> suggests <hi>good</hi> Thoughts to our Minds to rouse and awake us out of those <hi>fatal</hi> Slumbers, to enliven our <hi>Faith,</hi> and call up our <hi>Consideration</hi>; nay, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he doth so <hi>urge,</hi> and <hi>second,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat</hi> those Thoughts to us, that by being so haunted with their Importunities, we are forced to fix our Minds on them whether we will or no. And though <hi>we</hi> like <hi>ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Wretches do many times stifle his <hi>good</hi> Motions, and turn a <hi>deaf</hi> Ear to his Calls and <hi>gracious</hi> Invitations to Happiness; yet doth he not presently give over, but whilst we are running away from him, we hear a Voice behind us calling after us to return; and though we <hi>still</hi> run on, yet <hi>still</hi> he follows us with his Importunities through the <hi>whole</hi> Course of our <hi>sinful</hi> Life, till ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath brought us <hi>back,</hi> or we have run our selves <hi>past</hi> all Hope of Recovery. These are Things, I dare say, that every Man in the World, <hi>one</hi> Time or <hi>other,</hi> hath had <hi>sensible</hi> Experience of. And is not this a <hi>strange</hi> Condescention of Goodness to see the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> thus <hi>courting</hi> and <hi>wooing</hi> a Company of <hi>impotent</hi> Rebels to lay down their Arms, and accept his Grace and his <hi>everlasting</hi> Preferments? And
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:59595:119"/>
though they reject his Motions, and stop their Ears to those <hi>still</hi> Whispers of his that secretly <hi>invade</hi> their Souls; yet to consider how he still solicits and importunes them, as if he would take no Denyal, and were resolved not to let them alone till he had persuaded them to be happy; O <hi>good God!</hi> what <hi>prodigious</hi> Stories of Love are these? What <hi>strange amazing</hi> Condescentions to thy <hi>wretched undeserving</hi> Creatures? And now after all this what can the <hi>Lord our God</hi> do more for us that is <hi>consistent</hi> either with his own Wisdom, or with the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our Natures? He hath done all that can be done to draw us to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and if that will not do, it is by no Means fit that he should drag us thither; since it would be a most <hi>mean unreasonable</hi> Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scention in him to force us to be <hi>happy</hi> when we are unwilling to accept it, and to prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the Reward of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> to those that scorn, and reject it.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude this Argument; from hence I infer how monstrously <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful</hi> those Persons are who complain of the Difficulty and Burthensomeness of this <hi>gentle</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Condition of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: When in so many Instances it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent how <hi>merciful</hi> God hath been in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such a Condition upon us. In the Name
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:59595:120"/>
of <hi>God</hi> what would you have Sirs, would you have <hi>Heaven</hi> drop into your Mouths, while you lie still and do nothing? Or can you think it is fit that so <hi>vast</hi> a Reward should be prostituted to the <hi>lazy</hi> Wishes of such <hi>Drones</hi> and <hi>Sluggards,</hi> as do not think it worth the labouring for? That those <hi>golden</hi> Fruits should hang down from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to us on an <hi>overladen</hi> Bow, to be cropt by every <hi>idle Wanton</hi> Hand, that will stretch forth it self to take and eat it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no <hi>reasonable</hi> Creature can be so <hi>senseless,</hi> as to entertain such a <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>fond</hi> Conceit. Well then, would you have <hi>God</hi> admit of <hi>such</hi> a Condition of Salvation, as includes in it a Licence to enjoy your Lusts, and gives you Liberty to be as <hi>wicked</hi> as you please? But alas! if <hi>God</hi> should be so <hi>fond</hi> of your Salvation as to offer Violence to his own Nature and Government, by yielding to your Sins, and granting you a <hi>free</hi> Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation to enjoy them; yet it is impossible in the Nature of the Thing; because your Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation will not consist with it. For to be saved from Misery whilst we are let alone to enjoy our Sins is a Contradiction, and so not the Object of any Power, no not of <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence</hi> it self. For Sin it self is the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> Misery that <hi>human</hi> Nature is <hi>liable</hi> to; 'tis this that <hi>convulses</hi> all its Faculties, that
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:59595:120"/>
               <hi>racks</hi> and <hi>stretches</hi> them out of Joint, and <hi>distorts</hi> them into an <hi>unnatural</hi> Figure and Position; 'tis this that makes us <hi>our own</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, <hi>transposes</hi> our <hi>Head</hi> with our <hi>Feet,</hi> and makes our <hi>Reason</hi> truckle to our <hi>Sense</hi>; our <hi>intellectual</hi> Faculties that were made to govern, to serve those <hi>brutish</hi> Passions and Appetites which Nature designed to be their Vassals; which is such a <hi>barbarous</hi> Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the very Frame and Constitution of our Nature, as will, whensoever we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover out of our <hi>lethargick</hi> Stupidity, be as sensibly <hi>dolorous</hi> to our Souls, as <hi>Racks,</hi> or <hi>Wheels,</hi> or <hi>Catasta</hi>'s to our Bodies. So that for <hi>God</hi> to save us from Misery whilst he suffers us to continue in our Sins, is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as <hi>impossible</hi> as it is to save us from <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> whilst he suffers us to continue <hi>weltring</hi> in the Flames of Fire; and to make us <hi>well</hi> in Sickness, or <hi>easie</hi> in Diseases are not more <hi>repugnant</hi> to the Nature of Things, than 'tis to make us <hi>happy</hi> in our Sins; and yet this is the only Matter we complain of, that <hi>God</hi> will not allow us a <hi>free</hi> Dispensation to be <hi>wicked</hi> in that which is the Condition of our Salvation. O <hi>blessed God!</hi> How is it <hi>possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> thou shouldst ever please such <hi>froward, peevish,</hi> and <hi>ungrateful</hi> Creatures, who will never be satisfied unless thou performest Impossibilities, and makest Contradictions
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:59595:121"/>
to be true for their sakes? For shame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us no longer complain, that the Condition of our Salvation is <hi>too hard</hi> and <hi>rigorous</hi>; but since <hi>God</hi> hath been pleased to condescend so <hi>low</hi> to us, as to indulge us whatsoever is <hi>consistent</hi> with our Salvation, let us <hi>admire</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> his Goodness, and with our Souls <hi>inflamed</hi> with Love and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to him, chearfully undertake what he hath so mercifully enjoyned us.</p>

            <p>I Am now upon the latter Part of this Text, <hi>that whosoever believeth in him,</hi> &amp;c.

And in this you have
<q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First, the</hi> negative <hi>Part of it,</hi> that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever believeth in him, might not perish.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, the</hi> positive <hi>One,</hi> but have everlasting Life,</p>

            </p>
            <p>In prosecution of which Argument I shall do these three Things;
<list>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:59595:122"/>
                  <item>1. Shew you what is meant by <hi>perishing</hi> here.</item>
                  <item>2. By what <hi>Right</hi> we were concerned in, and obliged to it.</item>
                  <item>3. What <hi>unspeakable</hi> Goodness <hi>God</hi> hath discovered to us in freeing and absolving us from <hi>this</hi> Obligation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by <hi>perishing</hi> here, or not perishing? <hi>That whosoever believeth in him, should not perish,</hi> that is, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believes in him might be pardoned, or absolved from the obligation of <hi>perishing for ever,</hi> to which his Sins have rendred him justly <hi>liable.</hi> For that by this <hi>Phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he should not perish,</hi> or be destroyed, is not meant the <hi>Annihilation</hi> or Destruction of our Beings, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> and some others imagin, is evident by its being opposed to <hi>everlasting Life,</hi> which, as I shall shew you hereafter, doth not denote our <hi>mere</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in Life and Being <hi>for ever,</hi> but our Continuance in a most <hi>blissful</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> Life <hi>for ever</hi>; and consequently the Destruction that is <hi>here</hi> opposed to it must not denote our <hi>eternal</hi> Discontinuance to <hi>be</hi> and live, but our living most <hi>wretchedly</hi> and <hi>miserably for ever.</hi> And indeed wheresoever <hi>Death,</hi> or <hi>Destruction</hi> is spoken of in Opposition to <hi>eternal</hi> Life, this is apparently the Sense of it. So Rom. vi.23. <hi>The wages of Sin is death,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:59595:122"/>
but the Gift of God is eternal Life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</hi> Now that by <hi>Death</hi> here is understood a State of <hi>endless</hi> Misery and Suffering, in Opposition to that State of <hi>endless</hi> Happiness which <hi>eternal</hi> Life implies, is evident; because he cannot mean the <hi>first Death,</hi> which consists in the Separation of the Soul from the Body; for though <hi>this</hi> were originally the <hi>Wages</hi> of Sin, yet in it self it is not so now, but the <hi>necessary</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Nature; for whether we Sin or no, we must undergo it, being obliged to it by the <hi>irreversible</hi> Decree of our Maker. But the <hi>Death</hi> here spok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of is the Effect of our own <hi>personal</hi> Sin, without which we are not liable to it, as you may plainly see <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>What fruit had ye then in those things,</hi> (i. e. those Sins) <hi>whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things,</hi> or Sins, <hi>is Death.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since it cannot be meant of the <hi>first,</hi> it must be meant of the <hi>second</hi> Death, which St. <hi>John</hi> makes mention of <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.11. <hi>He that overcometh, shall not be hurt of the second Death.</hi> And what that is, the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor tells you <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.14. <hi>And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire: This is the second Death</hi>; that is, this Lake of Fire, or the Torments and Miseries which <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned</hi> Sinners endure in it, is the <hi>second</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:59595:123"/>
Death; for so he explains himself <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>And the Devil that deceived them, was cast into the Lake of Fire and Brimstone, where the Beast and the false Prophet are, and shall be tormented Day and Night for ever and ever.</hi> And this is that Death which is opposed to the <hi>immortal</hi> Rewards of the <hi>Blessed,</hi> as you may see <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.7, 8. <hi>He that overcometh shall inherit all things,</hi> that is, all those <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> Recompences which <hi>God</hi> has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for virtuous Souls. <hi>But the fearful and unbelieving,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall have their part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimstrone: Which is the second Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as Death, when opposed to <hi>eternal</hi> Life, denotes a State of <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> Misery, so doth Destruction also. So <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Broad is the way that leadeth to Destruction. Narrow is the way which leadeth unto Life:</hi> By the <hi>later</hi> of which it is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on all hands he means Life <hi>eternal</hi>; and that by Destruction he means a State of <hi>endless</hi> Misery, is evident from <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. <hi>but fear him which is able to destroy both Soul and Body in Hell</hi>; which according to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Exposition, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.10. is to torment them <hi>Day and Night for ever and ever.</hi> And this destroying in <hi>Hell</hi> our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> elsewhere expresses <hi>by casting into Hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched; where
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:59595:123"/>
their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>; which is as <hi>plain</hi> a Description of an <hi>endless</hi> State of Misery as Words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press; for how is it possible that <hi>Annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> should signify either a Fire that never goes out, or a Worm that never dies: So also, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1.9. <hi>who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord,</hi> meaning the <hi>wicked</hi> Persecuters at <hi>Christ</hi>'s coming to Judgment. Now that by that <hi>everlasting Destruction</hi> he means a State of <hi>endless</hi> Suffering and Torment is evident, if we consider the Description which our <hi>Saviour</hi> gives of that Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which the Wicked shall be senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the <hi>last Day; Go ye cursed,</hi> saith he, <hi>into everlasting Fire,</hi> Matth. 25.41. And lest we should fancy that 'tis the Fire only that is <hi>eternal,</hi> but not the Punishment, <hi>v.</hi> 46. of that Chap. <hi>And these,</hi> saith he, shall <hi>go away into everlasting Punishment: but the Righteous into Life eternal.</hi> And that they do actually exist in <hi>this</hi> Fire, and continue in the Torment of it is evident by those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are therein attributed to them, such as <hi>weeping and wailing and gnashing of Teeth,</hi> Matth. 13.42, 50; which Actions are <hi>plain</hi> Indications not only of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in this <hi>everlasting</hi> Fire, but of the <hi>extream</hi> Horror and Anguish they shall
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:59595:124"/>
therein endure. And as this Fire is said to be <hi>everlasting,</hi> so the <hi>Everlastingness</hi> of it is described so as to exclude all Limits, and prescind from all Determinations. For Fire must be extinguished e're it can cease to burn, and therefore that which cannot be extinguished can <hi>never</hi> end; but such is <hi>that</hi> Fire whereunto the <hi>Wicked</hi> are condemned at the <hi>Day of Judgment</hi>; so <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. <hi>whose fan is in his hand;— but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable Fire.</hi> And that the Sufferers shall be no more <hi>extinguished</hi> than the Fire that burns them, is evident from <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.11. <hi>And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever. And they have no rest day nor night.</hi> And how can the smoke of this Fire be said to be <hi>the smoke of their torment ascending up for ever and ever,</hi> unless they exist in it <hi>for ever and ever</hi>; especially considering what follows immediately after, <hi>they have no rest day nor night?</hi> Which Expression is the same with that by which the same <hi>Author</hi> signifies the <hi>eternal</hi> Happiness of <hi>good</hi> Men; so <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.8. <hi>They rest not day and night, saying, holy, holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> holy</hi>; and <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15. <hi>The are before the Throne of God, and serve him day and night in his Temple.</hi> And if <hi>Day and Night</hi> here, when applied to the State of <hi>Heaven,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes the <hi>continued blisful</hi> Employment of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:59595:124"/>
               <hi>happy</hi> Souls there <hi>forever</hi>; then for the same Reason, when 'tis applied to the State of <hi>Hell,</hi> it must denote the <hi>continued</hi> Miseries of the <hi>Damned</hi> there <hi>forever.</hi> Well then, if the Fire of <hi>Hell</hi> be <hi>everlasting,</hi> yea if it be so absolutely <hi>everlasting</hi> as that it is <hi>unquencha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>; and if those that are cast into it shall be tormented <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> all which the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth directly teach; then it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follows, that the <hi>Wicked</hi> must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in their Miseries <hi>for ever,</hi> and be <hi>co-eternal</hi> with the Flames that torment them. The Reason therefore why that <hi>future</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment to which our Sins do consign and oblige us, is called by the Name of <hi>Destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Perdition,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> is not because it puts a <hi>final</hi> Period either to our Being or Subsistence, as some fondly Dream; but because it <hi>forever</hi> separates and disjoyns us from <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>better</hi> and the <hi>nobler</hi> Life of Man, and from all those <hi>sweet</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of Comfort and Pleasure, of which Life is the Principle. And there is no <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Phrases,</hi> or <hi>Expressions</hi> can be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>patronize</hi> a <hi>contrary</hi> Opinion, since the same <hi>Scriptures</hi> which say that the <hi>Wicked</hi> shall be <hi>destroyed,</hi> and <hi>perish,</hi> and <hi>die,</hi> say also that they shall be tormented with <hi>never-dying</hi> Pains, as they plainly and frequently do. This I have the longer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:59595:125"/>
upon; because it is a very <hi>dangerous</hi> Thing for Men to be deceived in this Matter, not to know the worst of the Consequents of their own Follies, but to expect an <hi>easier</hi> and a <hi>shorter</hi> Hell than ever they are like to find. And so I have done with the <hi>first</hi> Thing proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> what is here meant by <hi>perishing,</hi> and proved to you at large that hereby is meant living miserably <hi>forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> I proceed now to the <hi>next</hi> Thing proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> how we came to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned <hi>in,</hi> and obliged <hi>to</hi> this <hi>dreadful</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty? To which I answer, that originally we were hereunto obliged by the Law of our Nature; for Man being naturally an <hi>immortal</hi> Creature, must necessarily be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> liable to the <hi>natural</hi> Effects of his own Actions; and therefore since Misery is the <hi>natural</hi> Effect of <hi>sinful</hi> Actions, if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue Sinners <hi>forever,</hi> we must necessarily continue <hi>miserable forever</hi>; And if God should have inflicted no <hi>other</hi> Miseries upon <hi>wicked</hi> Souls when they are separated from their Bodies than what are necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent to their own Wickedness, these would be an <hi>Hell</hi> of <hi>insufferable</hi> Torment to them. So that from the very <hi>Immortality</hi> of our Natures we are <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>everlasting</hi> Perseverance in Sin, and from our <hi>everlasting</hi>
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:59595:125"/>
Perseverance in Sin we are fatally <hi>damned</hi> to <hi>evelasting</hi> Misery. And as by the Law of our Natures we are thus bound over to <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Punishment, so are we also by the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive</hi> Sentence and Determination of <hi>God,</hi> who hath not only obliged us to obey him under the Penalty of enduring <hi>forever</hi> the Miseries that are naturally <hi>appendent</hi> to our Sins, but hath added thereunto all those <hi>positive</hi> Torments which the Lake of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone,</hi> and the Horrors of <hi>outer</hi> Darkness do imply: For so in his <hi>Word</hi> he hath plainly declared to us that if after he hath tryed us to the utmost, we will not be reclaimed, but are so <hi>desperate</hi> as to proceed in our Wickedness <hi>maugre</hi> all the Arts and Methods he can use to reduce us, he will at last shut us up in a State of <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>irreversible</hi> Torment. And this is no more than what he might very justly and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do; for he being the <hi>Supream</hi> Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver of the World, hath an <hi>immutable</hi> Right to enforce his Laws with such Penalties as are <hi>sufficient</hi> to secure them from being vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by his Subjects; for otherwise he would be <hi>defective</hi> in his Power of <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; for how could he have <hi>sufficient</hi> Power to make Laws, if he had not Right to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them with <hi>sufficient</hi> Penalties? But we that are his Subjects being so <hi>apt</hi> to offend,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:59595:126"/>
and so extreamly <hi>liable</hi> to Temptations thereunto, no <hi>less</hi> Penalty could be sufficient to secure our Obedience than that which is <hi>eternal</hi>; for which Reason he hath enforced his Laws with the Threatning of it. And if <hi>God</hi> thought no <hi>less</hi> than the Threatning of <hi>eternal</hi> Punishment necessary to deter Men from their Sins, what <hi>less</hi> than the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of that Threat can be sufficient to render them Examples of his Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it? For Threats without Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are but <hi>mere</hi> Scare-crows; and it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>unreasonable</hi> for us to be afraid of any Threat, which we have Reason to conclude shall never be executed upon us. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since the <hi>Sovereign</hi> Lord and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World hath in himself an unali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable Right to enforce his own Laws by what Penalties he pleases, and since to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force them in the <hi>highest</hi> Degree he hath established them under the Penalty of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Torment; it is no less <hi>reasonable</hi> for him to execute this Penalty than it was to threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and denounce it; otherwise his Threats will be altogether <hi>insignificant.</hi> For the End of <hi>legal</hi> Threats is to terrify the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from Disobedience; but since we are assured that <hi>God</hi> will do nothing but what is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> why should we be terrified at any Threats of his, which he cannot as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably

inflict as denounce against us? Nor is it any Blemish to the <hi>divine</hi> Goodness, that he hath threatned such an <hi>heavy</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment against those that transgress his Laws; for since he hath injoyned us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is for our <hi>good,</hi> and tends to our Happiness; and since the End of his Threats is to oblige us to observe his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; it hence necessarily follows, that the more <hi>terrible</hi> his Threatnings are, the more he obliges us by them to pursue <hi>our own</hi> Happiness. And certainly for <hi>God</hi> to lay his Creatures under the <hi>strongest</hi> Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to be <hi>happy,</hi> is so far from being a Blemish to his Goodness that it is a most <hi>glorious</hi> Expression of it; and if we will be so obstinate as to incur that <hi>direful</hi> Penalty under which he hath obliged us to be <hi>happy,</hi> it is but <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable</hi> that he should inflict it upon us, and make us feel <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> the <hi>rueful</hi> Effects of <hi>our own</hi> Folly and Madness. Wherefore since we had all broken his Laws, and wilfully render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our selves <hi>guilty</hi> before him, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by became most justly <hi>obnoxious</hi> to this most <hi>dreadful</hi> Penalty of <hi>perishing forever.</hi> And thus you see by what Right we were concerned in, and obliged to <hi>this</hi> Penalty.</p>

               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:59595:127"/>3<hi>dly,</hi> I now proceed to the <hi>third,</hi> and Last Thing proposed, which is to shew you the <hi>unspeakble</hi> Goodness that <hi>God</hi> hath expressed to us in that Way and Method which he hath prescribed to release us from this Obligation of <hi>perishing forever.</hi> For the Way and Method prescribed by him is <hi>this,</hi> to send his own most <hi>blessed Son</hi> to suffer in our Stead, that so we repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Sins and forsaking them, might upon the Account of his Sufferings be released from this Obligation to <hi>eternal</hi> Punishment. And hence <hi>Christ</hi> is said to <hi>put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himself,</hi> Heb. ix.26. that is, to make Expiation for it, even as the <hi>Jewish High Priest</hi> did by those Sacrifices which he offered. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, Col. i.14. it is said, that <hi>in him we have Redemption through his Blood, even the forgiveness of Sins</hi>; that is, upon Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we heartily and sincerely repent of them. For, <hi>if we walk in the light,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>as he is in the light</hi>; that is, if we forsake our Sins, and become <hi>pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy; we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth us from all Sin.</hi> This therefore being the Way and Method which <hi>God</hi> hath prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to release us from the Obligation to <hi>eternal</hi> Punishment, what an <hi>unspeakable</hi>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:59595:127"/>
Love and Goodness he hath herein expressed to us will evidently appear by the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of these <hi>four</hi> Things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. His <hi>admitting</hi> of <hi>another</hi> to suffer in our Stead.</item>
               <item>2. His <hi>exacting</hi> such a Suffering for the Price of our Pardon, as was most <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> to secure us from sinning again.</item>
               <item>3. His <hi>consenting</hi> that his own <hi>Son</hi> should submit to <hi>this</hi> Suffering.</item>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. One very <hi>great</hi> Instance of God's Love and Goodness to us in this Method of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don is his admitting of <hi>another</hi> to suffer in our Stead. Had he been pleased, he might have exacted the Punishment of the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, and made the Offenders smart <hi>forever</hi> in their own Persons; yea, and this he might have justly done notwithstanding the <hi>best</hi> Reason they could render him to the contrary. For the <hi>best</hi> Reason a Sinner can render why he should not be punished, is his <hi>hearty</hi> Repentance; for next to being perfectly <hi>innocent,</hi> the <hi>best</hi> Thing we can do, is to reform when we have done amiss; but yet this doth not at all diminish the Guilt and Demerit of our <hi>past</hi> Transgressions. For Repentance doth not at all alter the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:59595:128"/>
Nature of the Act, nor make it <hi>less</hi> evil, nor <hi>less</hi> deserving of Punishment; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since the Act it self obliges us to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, our Repentance of it doth no way <hi>cancel</hi> the Obligation. 'Tis true, <hi>God</hi> might if he had pleased, have pardoned us upon our Repentance without any <hi>other</hi> Reason or Motive; but it is certain, that Repentance is not a <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason to move him to declare a Promise of Pardon to a <hi>sinful</hi> World, it being no way consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the Safety either of <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Governments, so far to encourage Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders as to indemnify them universally by a <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>standing</hi> Declaration merely upon their <hi>future</hi> Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; because by such a Declaration they must let <hi>loose</hi> the Reigns to all manner of Licentiousness. For if Subjects are now so <hi>prone</hi> to transgress when they have so much Reason to expect a <hi>severe</hi> Punishment for it, how much more <hi>prone</hi> would they be, were their Governours so <hi>easie</hi> as to assure them beforehand that the Punishment due to their Crimes should be immediately remitted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>unfeigned</hi> Repentance? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, since our Repentance is no <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason to oblige <hi>God</hi> to pardon us, and much less to move him to make a Promise of Pardon to us; and since this is the <hi>best</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:59595:128"/>
Reason that we can offer in our Behalf, to move him thereunto; it hence necessarily follows, that if he had pleased, when once we had broken his Laws, he might have just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly executed upon us that <hi>eternal</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he had threatned, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all we could have done to move him to the contrary. But such is his <hi>inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible</hi> Goodness towards us, that to put himself into a Capacity of pardoning <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> Sinners with Safety to his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of making a <hi>publick</hi> Grant of Pardon and Indemnity to them, thereby to encourage them to repent, he hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously admited <hi>another</hi> Person to suffer in our Stead; that so neither their Persons might be ruined, nor yet their Sins be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punished, and that he might sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press to them his Severity against their Sins without exposing them to the <hi>eternal</hi> Smart of it. For though the Suffering of <hi>this</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, as I shall shew you by and by, was a <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason to move <hi>God</hi> to forgive us upon our <hi>unfeigned</hi> Repentance, yet it was no such Reason as did necessarily oblige him thereunto; for if he had pleased he might have righteously exacted our Punishment at <hi>our own</hi> Hands, and made us <hi>forever</hi> rue for <hi>our own</hi> Folly and Madness; but such was his Goodness towards us, that for the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:59595:129"/>
Sufferings of the <hi>Innocent</hi> he hath mercifully acquitted the Punishment due to Offenders, and so scourged our Sins upon the Back of our <hi>Saviour</hi>; for though he suffered for us, yet we suffered not in <hi>him,</hi> our Persons were not at all damnified by those <hi>bitter</hi> Agonies which he endured for our Sins; so that to a wonder of Mercy they have been so severely punished as 'tis fit they should, and yet we who were the Authors of them never felt the Smart. <hi>Blessed God!</hi> How <hi>merciful</hi> hast thou been to thy Creatures, that hast thus found out a Way to distinguish the Sin from the Sinner, and so to punish the <hi>one,</hi> as to let the <hi>other</hi> escape? For by his <hi>gracious</hi> Admission, <hi>Christ hath once suffered for Sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God,</hi> 1 Pet. iii 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Another Instance of God's Love and Goodness to us in this Method of Pardon, is his exacting such a Suffering for the Price of our Pardon as is most <hi>effectual</hi> to secure us from sinning again, which is a <hi>plain</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>mighty</hi> Care he hath taken to pardon us in such a way as might be most for our <hi>future</hi> Security. For it would have been no way <hi>proper</hi> for the <hi>wise</hi> Governour of the World to grant a <hi>general</hi> Pardon to Offenders without some <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason moving him thereunto. Now that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:59595:129"/>
which is the <hi>best</hi> Reason we can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him is not <hi>sufficient,</hi> I have already shewed you, because it is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to secure his Government, in the <hi>good</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement whereof the Welfare of all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is involved. For his Laws requiring nothing but what is for our <hi>good,</hi> 'tis truly our Interest to be kept under a <hi>strict</hi> Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them; so that should he pardon us upon any Reason that is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure <hi>his</hi> Government and <hi>our</hi> Obedience, it would be a <hi>publick</hi> Nuisance and Damage to Mankind; and consequently the <hi>greater</hi> the Reason is that moves him to pardon us what is <hi>past,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> it enforces our Obedience for the <hi>future,</hi> the <hi>greater</hi> is the Goodness which he expresses in pardoning us, and the <hi>more</hi> it conduces to our Welfare and Happiness. But now upon what <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Motive could he have made a Grant of Pardon to us than upon the most <hi>meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Sufferings of his own <hi>Son</hi> for us? For since nothing that we could do was a <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Reason to move him to promise to us the Forgiveness of our Sins, it was requisite that something more should be done for us by some <hi>other</hi> Person, and the <hi>greatest</hi> Thing that any <hi>other</hi> Person could do for us to move <hi>God</hi> to forgive us, was to suffer in our Stead; because hereby not only a <hi>publick</hi>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:59595:130"/>
Acknowledgement is made of what we have deserved for our Sins, but something of the Punishment <hi>due</hi> to them is paid as a <hi>publick</hi> Satisfaction to the Law. So that if <hi>God</hi> pardons us upon such a Reason, he doth by the same Act express his most <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Mercy to us, and his <hi>implacable</hi> Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Sins; for by pardoning us upon the Sufferings of <hi>another</hi> in our Stead, he expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses his <hi>hearty</hi> Good-Will to us, and openly signifies how <hi>unwilling</hi> he is to ruin us. But then by exacting the Sufferings of <hi>another</hi> in our Stead, before he will be induced to grant a Pardon to us, he manifests to us how implacably he <hi>hates</hi> our Sins, and how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorably <hi>severe</hi> he is against them. But then if he pardon us upon <hi>this</hi> Reason of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others suffering in our Stead, then the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> and more <hi>excellent</hi> the Person is that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for us, the <hi>greater</hi> Reason he hath to forgive us upon it. For <hi>such</hi> as the Person is that suffers, <hi>such</hi> is the Moment and Value of his Suffering; because the End of all such <hi>vicarious</hi> Punishments being only this, to give such an Example of the Severity of Governours against Offenders, as may be <hi>sufficient</hi> to vindicate the Honour of the Law, and secure the Obedience of the Subject; the Value of his Suffering, who thus suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers for us must consist in this, that it is a <hi>more</hi>
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:59595:130"/>
or <hi>less</hi> exemplary Signification of the Severity of the Lawgiver against our Sins for which he suffers; and doubtless it would be a <hi>higher</hi> Signification of God's Severity against our Sins not to pardon us but upon the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of an <hi>innocent</hi> Angel, than not to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us but upon the Sufferings of an <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> Man. What a most <hi>exemplary</hi> Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication then is this of his Severity against our Sins, that he would not pardon us but upon the Sufferings of his own most <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> Son; who being the <hi>greatest</hi> Person in all the Creation, did by his suffering in our Stead exhibit the <hi>greatest</hi> Instance of God's Severity against our Sins that could possibly have been given by any Person whatsoever that was <hi>capable</hi> of suffering for us? So that his suffering in our Stead was apparently the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>highest</hi> Reason that could possibly have been given to move <hi>God</hi> to pardon us, and consequently his pardoning us in <hi>such</hi> a Way and upon <hi>such</hi> a Reason is a most <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Instance of his Goodness towards us, and of that <hi>tender</hi> Regard he hath of our Welfare. For now in the very Method of his pardoning us what is <hi>past,</hi> he hath taken a most <hi>effectual</hi> Course to secure our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the <hi>future,</hi> that very Reason that moved him to pardon us being the <hi>greatest</hi> Reason that can be urged to terrify us from
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:59595:131"/>
sinning again. For what Consideration is there that can fill us with <hi>greater</hi> Horror against our Sins than this, that the Guilt of them is so <hi>great</hi> and <hi>heinous</hi> that the most <hi>merciful</hi> Father would never have forgiven them, had not his own most <hi>glorious</hi> Son suffered for them in our Stead? And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had not <hi>God</hi> thus provided for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of our Obedience in the very Method of his Pardon, his Grace in pardoning us would have been very <hi>insignificant</hi>; for our Welfare and Happiness being all bound up in our Obedience, our Pardon without this could not have secured us from being <hi>miserable.</hi> So that if in the Method of his Pardon he had not so <hi>manifested</hi> his Severi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against our Sins as to discourage us suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently from sinning again, his very Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Compassion would have proved <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive</hi> to us; because it would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged us to Sin on, and thereby to make our selves <hi>miserable.</hi> For Sin and Misery are so inseparably <hi>interwoven,</hi> that all the Pardon <hi>God</hi> can give us while we continue in our Sins is not <hi>sufficient</hi> to prevent our being <hi>miserable</hi>; but such hath been his Goodness towards us, such his Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our Sin and Misery, as that in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Reason that moves him to pardon us, for what is <hi>past,</hi> he gives us a most terrible
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:59595:131"/>
warning not to Sin again. For he that can behold such a <hi>dreadful</hi> Spectacle as the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> dying for Sin, and yet Sin on, is a <hi>valiant</hi> Sinner indeed, and may with the <hi>same</hi> Courage follow his Lusts into the Flames of <hi>Hell.</hi> So <hi>careful</hi> hath the <hi>good God</hi> been to plot and contrive for the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his Creatures, that he would not so much as pardon them when they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him, but in such a Way as was most for their Security and Good.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> His consenting that his own <hi>Son</hi> should submit himself to this Suffering, is another <hi>great</hi> Instance of his Goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in this method of pardoning us. That he should not only admit of a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to bear our Transgressions and suffer in our Stead, but that himself should provide <hi>one</hi> for us, and such a <hi>one</hi> too as his own most <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>precious</hi> Son, is such a Miracle of Love and Goodness as the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot parallel. For though Mankind had provoked him to that Height that none but a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>infinite</hi> Patience could have born it, yet such was his Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to inflict that <hi>direful</hi> Punishment upon them which he had justly threatned, and they had justly deserved, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their Demerits he was still ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently inclined to be <hi>propitious</hi> to them.
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:59595:132"/>
But then how to save them, and at the same Time so to manifest his Severity against their Sins as was <hi>needful</hi> to preserve the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Honour of his Laws that had threatned Destruction to them, was the <hi>great</hi> Difficulty; for should he have whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly omitted the Punishment, he would have very much undervalued the Authority of his Laws in the Esteem of his Subjects, the main security of their Authority being the Punishment annexed to them; but on the contrary should he have exacted the <hi>utmost</hi> of the Punishment, he must have destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole Race of Men, we being all Offenders in his Sight. In this Extremity therefore, that he might pardon such a World of Sinners with safety to his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it was highly <hi>necessary</hi> for him to exhibit to the World some <hi>dreadful</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Severity against them, such as might be <hi>sufficient</hi> to prevent Offenders from taking any Encouragement from his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning them to offend again. But to make a Sinner such a <hi>great</hi> Example of his Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity against the Sins of others was <hi>impossible,</hi> because his own Sins may deserve the <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> Severity that <hi>God</hi> can inflict upon him; and therefore among our selves who were all Sinners there was no Person could be found fit to be made <hi>such</hi> an Example of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:59595:132"/>
his Severity against the Sins of the whole World. And if an <hi>innocent</hi> Angel should have freely offered up himself to bear our Punishment, and Suffer in our Stead, his Suffering in our Room would not have so sufficiently expressed Gods Severity against the Sins of a whole World of Sinners, as was <hi>convenient</hi>; for what great Severity would it have been to have exacted the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of one <hi>innocent</hi> Angel, in lieu of that <hi>eternal</hi> Punishment that was due to a whole World of Men? Wherefore it being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>convenient,</hi> that the Dignity of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son who suffered for us should be such as might render his Suffering in some Degree <hi>proportionable</hi> to the Punishment due to our Sins, that so his Suffering in our stead might be as <hi>exemplary</hi> to the World, as if we our selves had suffered to the <hi>utmost</hi> of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, and there being no Creature of that Dignity either in <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi>; in this Extremity, the <hi>eternal Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> himself interposes, and freely offers to <hi>unite</hi> himself to our Natures, and therein to suffer in our Stead, upon Condition that on our <hi>unfeigned</hi> Repentance and Amendment a <hi>free</hi> Charter of Pardon might be granted for all our <hi>past</hi> Provocations. So that now an Expedient being proposed by which <hi>God</hi> might both pardon our Sins, and sufficiently <hi>manifest</hi>
               <pb n="258" facs="tcp:59595:133"/>
his Severity against them, to <hi>secure</hi> the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of his Laws, and deter us from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning again; though he saw how <hi>dear</hi> an Expedient it would prove, that it would cost him the most <hi>precious</hi> Blood of his own <hi>Son</hi>; yet such was his <hi>tender</hi> Pity towards us, so <hi>great</hi> his Unwillingness to ruin us <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> that he freely complyed with the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and consented that his <hi>Son</hi> should be sacrificed for the Sins of the World. And hence it is said, that <hi>he spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> Rom. viii.32. And the Reason why he deliverd him <hi>up,</hi> as he tells us, v.3. of the same Chapter, was to <hi>condemn Sin in the Flesh,</hi> that is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce in the Suffering of his own <hi>Son</hi> for it, what a <hi>dreadful</hi> Punishment it deserved, and how much his Soul was incensed against it, that would not pardon it without such a <hi>mighty</hi> Propitiation. How inexpressibly <hi>gracious</hi> therefore hath <hi>God</hi> been to us, that when for the securing the Authority of his Laws it was so <hi>necessary</hi> to condemn our Sins, rather than condemn them in our own <hi>personal</hi> Punishment, he should chuse to condemn them in the sufferings of his own <hi>Son?</hi> It was a <hi>great</hi> Instance of his Goodness towards us to admit of <hi>another</hi> to suffer for us, in our stead; but to admit of his own <hi>Son,</hi> who is the <hi>Darling</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:59595:133"/>
               <hi>Delight</hi> of his <hi>Soul,</hi> and not only so, but freely to give and deliver him <hi>up</hi> for us, and amidst all the yearnings of his <hi>fatherly</hi> Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els towards him, not to spare his <hi>precious</hi> Life when it was to be made the Price of our Redemption, is such a Miracle of Love as transcends all <hi>Hyperboles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>ly</hi> and lastly, his choosing to grant Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to us upon the Sufferings of his <hi>Son</hi> as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for our Sins, is also another <hi>great</hi> Instance of his Goodness to us in this Way of pardoning us. For the End of granting Pardon to Sinners upon their Repentance being to encourage them to repent, it was highly <hi>convenient</hi> to grant it to them in <hi>such</hi> a Way and upon <hi>such</hi> Reason, as might most effectually assure them thereof. And considering what was the <hi>general</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suasion of Mankind in this Matter, there was no such <hi>effectual</hi> Way to secure them of Pardon upon their Repentance, as this of granting Pardon to them upon the Motive of a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for their Sins. For however it came to pass I know not, but it was a Principle generally received by Men of all <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Religions,</hi> that to appease the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed</hi> Divinity it was necessary; First, that some <hi>Sacrifice</hi> should be made to him for their Sins, and then that some <hi>high</hi> Favourite of his should intercede with him in their Be-;
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:59595:134"/>
half; upon which were founded those two <hi>great</hi> Rights of <hi>Propitiatory Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>worshiping of Demons,</hi> which made up a <hi>great</hi> Part of all the <hi>Heathenish Religions</hi> in the World. For as for <hi>Propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> they were generally used not only by the <hi>barbarous,</hi> but by the most <hi>civiliz'd Heathens</hi>; which Sacrifices they devoted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>God</hi> to be their <hi>Proxies</hi> in Punishment, to undergo the Punishment that was due to them for their own Sins. And hence is that of the <hi>antient Poet, Cum sis ipse nocens, moritur cur Victima pro te?</hi> — When thou thy self art the Offender, for what Reason should the Victim die for thee? And <hi>Porphery</hi> tells us that the <hi>first</hi> Rise of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Animals</hi> was,<note place="margin">

And hence in many Places, the <hi>ordinary</hi> Sacrifice of Attonement which they offered, was the Lives of Men; and though this indeed was most used in the most <hi>barbarous</hi> Countries, yet in Cases of <hi>great</hi> Danger and Extremity the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> themselves did frequently Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

               <hi>humane</hi> Lives to their Gods; for so it is recorded of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when their <hi>City</hi> was in <hi>great</hi> Danger of being taken by <hi>Hanibal,</hi> they sacrificed a Man to their <hi>Tutelar God</hi>: And <hi>Servius</hi> tells us of the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silians,</hi> that in Time of Pestilence one of the <hi>poorer</hi> sort was wont to offer himself to be sacrificed for the whole <hi>City</hi>; who being for a whole Year nourished with the <hi>purest</hi> Meat, was then led about the <hi>City</hi> adorned with <hi>sacred Vestments</hi> and <hi>Cathartick Herbs,</hi> the People following him making <hi>solemn</hi> Execrations that the Plague might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from the <hi>City</hi> and fall upon his Head; which done, they offered him <hi>up</hi> in a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And in other Places they offered up <hi>pure</hi> Virgins of the <hi>noblest</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, to <hi>propitiate</hi> their <hi>angry</hi> Gods; and elsewhere, as <hi>Servius</hi> tells us, they were wont to cast a Man into the Sea with this <hi>Imprecation,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, be thou our Purgament, or Redemption. So also it is said of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> that they maintained some of the most <hi>unprofitable</hi> and <hi>ignoble</hi> of their People, that so when any <hi>great</hi> Calamity befell the <hi>City,</hi> they might <hi>offer</hi> them <hi>up</hi> in <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to appease their Gods. And that Passage of <hi>Caesar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Gallic Nation</hi> is very observable, that in Cases of <hi>great</hi> Danger and Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:59595:135"/>
they either devoted themselves to the Altar, or else offered <hi>up</hi> some Man in their Stead; quod pro vita hominis nisi homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis vita reddatur, non posse Deorum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortalium Numen placari arbitrantur; that is, <hi>thinking that the immortal God's would never be appeased unless they offered up to them the Life of a Man for the Life of a Man:</hi> All which is an Evidence that they not only thought Sacrifices necessary to appease <hi>God,</hi> but that they also believed the <hi>better</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was, the <hi>more</hi> effectually it did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease him. Nor did they think it less <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> that there should be some <hi>Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> between them and the <hi>Supream</hi> Divinity to Solicite their Cause, and render Sin <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious</hi> to their Desires. And hence it was the <hi>general</hi> Doctrin of their <hi>Divines,</hi> that 'twas <hi>great</hi> Prophaneness for any thing that was <hi>earthly</hi> and <hi>sinful</hi> immediately to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that <hi>Pure</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Being; but that the <hi>Demons</hi> were to be the <hi>Mediators</hi> and Agents between him, and <hi>mortal</hi> Men, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as <hi>Plato in his Sympos.</hi> expresses it; that is, <hi>God is not approached by Men, but all the Commerse, and Intercourse between him and us is performed by the Mediation of Demons.</hi> So that howsoever they came by this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:59595:135"/>
it is apparent that they generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved both <hi>Sacrifices</hi> and a <hi>Mediator</hi> to be <hi>necessary</hi> Means to reconcile them to <hi>God,</hi> and that without these they could not satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy themselves that <hi>God</hi> would be <hi>propitious</hi> to them, no not upon their Repentance and Reformation. Some <hi>good</hi> Hopes they might have, and it is apparent they had, from the Goodness and Benignity of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature, that if they forsook their Sins <hi>God</hi> would not be <hi>inexorable</hi> to them, at least they could not tell but they might find Mercy; but yet they durst not absolutely trust to this without devoting some <hi>other</hi> to suffer in their Stead, and engaging some <hi>other</hi> to intercede in their Behalf. And therefore we see that when the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Nineveh</hi> upon <hi>Jonah's</hi> Preaching obliged his People to Fasting and Repentance, the <hi>utmost</hi> Encouragement he could give them was only this; <hi>Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not,</hi> Jonah iii.9. Wherefore to give us the <hi>highest</hi> Assurance of Pardon if we repent, <hi>God</hi> hath been so infinitely <hi>good</hi> to us as to choose that very Method of reconciling us to himself, which we had chalked out to him, and to meet with us in <hi>our own</hi> Way, thereby to give us a <hi>fuller</hi> Assurance of his most <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:59595:136"/>
Intentions to us; for how could he have better satisfied the Anxiousness and Jealousy of our <hi>guilty</hi> Minds, than in granting us our Pardon in that very Way, wherein we did so universally hope for and expect it? <hi>Good God!</hi> How <hi>indulgent</hi> hast thou been to thy <hi>poor</hi> Creatures, that wast not only so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to pardon them upon their Repentance, but so <hi>careful</hi> to give them the most <hi>effectual</hi> Assurance of it; that so thou might'st re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all discouragements out of the Way to our Amendment and Happiness? For doubtless the Reason why he took <hi>this</hi> Way of Pardoning us more than <hi>another,</hi> was not only because it was best in it self, and most for the Interest of his own Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; but also because of all others it was the most <hi>effectual</hi> to satisfy our <hi>guilty</hi> Fears, and assure us of his <hi>merciful</hi> Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to receive us into Favour again upon our Repentance and Amendment. For when Mankind were so unanimously <hi>agreed</hi> in this Belief, that without a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and a <hi>Mediator</hi> he would not be appeased, how could he more effectually have convinced our Mistrust of his Mercy, than by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>Son</hi> to be our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi>; to die for our Sins upon <hi>Earth,</hi> and intercede for our Pardon in <hi>Heaven</hi>? So that if now we will heartily repent of our
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:59595:136"/>
Sins and forsake them, we have all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of Mercy that we can desire; our <hi>God</hi> being <hi>attoned</hi> by the <hi>noblest</hi> Sacrifice that ever was, and interceded with, on our Behalf by the most <hi>powerful</hi> and <hi>prevailing</hi> Mediator. <hi>Having</hi> therefore such <hi>an High Priest over the House of God,</hi> we may <hi>safely draw near with a true Heart, in full assurance of Faith,</hi> as the Apostle expresses it <hi>Heb.</hi> x.21, 22. Thus you see how <hi>good</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi> God hath been to us in the Way and Method which he hath prescribed of pardoning our Sins, and releasing us from the obligation of Punishment <hi>for ever</hi>; which is so <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and every way <hi>God-like,</hi> that I think, had I no <hi>other</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> but only this <hi>wondrous</hi> Contrivance of pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners revealed in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> this would have been enough to persuade me that none but a <hi>God</hi> could be the Author and Contriver of it. And now I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Argument with a <hi>few</hi> Inferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence I infer what a very <hi>great Evil</hi> Sin is, seeing it is such an <hi>Evil</hi> as binds us over to <hi>perish for ever,</hi> and such as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make Expiation for, but only the <hi>precious</hi> Blood of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; such, as our <hi>Saviour</hi> must die for, or our Souls must
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:59595:137"/>
have suffered for, to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> How different therefore are our Thoughts from God's! We think it a Matter of <hi>Sport</hi> and <hi>Laughter,</hi> a Thing to <hi>Play,</hi> and make <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> with; but <hi>God,</hi> who knows the <hi>inmost</hi> Nature of things, looks upon it as a Thing of such a <hi>black</hi> and <hi>horrid</hi> Nature, as that nothing but the Blood of our <hi>Souls,</hi> or the Blood of his <hi>Son</hi> can make Expiation for. O <hi>blessed God!</hi> Had we but such Thoughts of our Sins as thou hast, how should we <hi>start</hi> and <hi>tremble</hi> at the Sight of them, and with what Horror and Amazement should we reflect upon them? Surely if all the <hi>Devils</hi> in <hi>Hell</hi> should stand round about us in the most <hi>gastly</hi> Shapes and Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it would not put us into half that Agony of Fear, as would the Sense and Remembrance of <hi>our own</hi> Guilts and Follies. For had we but a Window into <hi>Hell</hi> to look through and see what <hi>unsufferable</hi> Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the <hi>damned Ghosts</hi> undergo there for those Sins we make so light of; how they <hi>burn</hi> and <hi>roar</hi> in those Flames of Lust, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we like <hi>silly</hi> Flies do <hi>sport</hi> and <hi>dally</hi>; or had we but the <hi>Cross</hi> always stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before our Eyes with the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hanging on it for those Sins that are our Recreation, <hi>sighing</hi> and <hi>groaning</hi> out his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> Soul in Torment and Agonies to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:59595:137"/>
those Faults which we commit with so much Greediness and Pleasure; surely either of these <hi>sad</hi> Spectacles would be <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> to <hi>cool</hi> our Courage, and to make us affraid of ever sinning more. Why then should not our Belief of these Things have the same Effect upon us, as the Sight and Sense of them must needs be supposed to have? O <hi>my Soul,</hi> why should I be so <hi>mad</hi> as to hug and embrace my Lusts any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when I believe the <hi>Evil</hi> of them to be so <hi>great</hi> as that the <hi>merciful</hi> Father would never have forgiven them, had not his own most <hi>blessed Son</hi> born their Punishment, and freely submitted himself to suffer for them in my Stead; yea, and which I verily believe he will never Pardon yet, unless I heartily repent of, and forsake them; but notwithstanding all that his <hi>Son</hi> hath suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make Expiation for them, will yet pursue and prosecute them with the most <hi>direful</hi> effects of an <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>omnipotent</hi> Vengance?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly,</hi> Hence I infer the Certainty of our <hi>perishing for ever,</hi> if we do not repent of our Sins and forsake them. For if <hi>God</hi> would not have forgiven them upon our Repentance, unless an Expiation had been made for them by the Blood of his <hi>Son</hi>; how can we imagin that he will <hi>now</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:59595:138"/>
them whether we repent of them or no? When all that could be obtained for us from our <hi>offended</hi> God by the <hi>vocal</hi> Blood and Wounds of his own <hi>Son,</hi> (whose Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was a thousand Times more <hi>effectual</hi> for us, than all the <hi>Retorick</hi> of <hi>Angels</hi> could have been) was only this, that if yet we would heartily repent and amend, we should certainly find Mercy and Favour at his Hands; can we be so <hi>assured</hi> as to hope for any more? Is it likely, that our <hi>obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Continuance in <hi>wilful</hi> Rebellion against him should be a more <hi>prevalent</hi> Advocate for us, than the most <hi>eloquent</hi> Blood of that <hi>innocent</hi> Lamb, which spoke <hi>better</hi> Things for us than the Blood of <hi>Abel</hi>? Will he be more <hi>indulgent</hi> to our Sins than he was to the <hi>obedient</hi> Sufferings of his own <hi>Son,</hi> whose Blood cryed <hi>Mercy, Mercy,</hi> with a Voice more <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>persuasive</hi> than the <hi>united</hi> Prayers of a World of <hi>sinful</hi> Creatures could have done, though they had been washed in Floods of <hi>penitent</hi> Tears? Let us not therefore be so fond as to presume, that when the <hi>utmost</hi> that <hi>God</hi> would grant us for his own <hi>dear</hi> Son's sake, was to receive us to Mercy upon our <hi>unfeigned</hi> Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; he will now for <hi>our own</hi> sakes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don us whether we repent or no. And since at the <hi>powerful</hi> Intreaties of the Blood
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:59595:138"/>
of <hi>Jesus</hi> he hath indulged to us as much Mercy as was fit for him to grant, and much more than we could ever have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, let us not be so <hi>immodest</hi> as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any farther, but fix <hi>this</hi> as an <hi>eternal</hi> Verity in <hi>our own</hi> Minds, that either our Sins, or our Souls must <hi>perish</hi>; and then if after all that he hath done for us we will continue <hi>wicked,</hi> there is no Remedy but we must be <hi>miserable for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> And lastly, Hence also I infer how <hi>inexcusable</hi> we are if we now <hi>perish</hi> in our Sins, now <hi>God</hi> hath done such <hi>great</hi> Things for us, and contrived such an <hi>excellent</hi> Way to pardon us. So that now there can be nothing wanting to the Accomplishment of our Pardon, but only <hi>our own</hi> Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Reformation; for <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> have done all that is to be done on their Part; our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath suffered for us, and <hi>God</hi> hath accepted it as an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation for our Sins. And now the whole Matter sticks at us, and there is nothing wanting, but only our Repentance; and if we will not Repent, and thereby inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle our selves to that <hi>merciful</hi> Pardon which <hi>God</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi> have prepared for us, there is none can be blamed for our Ruin but our selves: For when <hi>Inquisition</hi> shall
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:59595:139"/>
be made for the Blood of our Souls, the only Cause of our Ruin will be found to be this, that we were wilfully and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately <hi>impenitent.</hi> What then shall we be able to say for <hi>our</hi> selves, when we come to plead for <hi>our</hi> Lives at the <hi>Tribunal</hi> of <hi>God?</hi> Shall we plead that our Condition was <hi>hopeless</hi> and <hi>desperate,</hi> we being bound over for our <hi>past</hi> Sins to an <hi>irrevocable</hi> Damnation? Alas! With what Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence can we plead this, when <hi>God</hi> had been so <hi>merciful</hi> as not to exact of <hi>our own</hi> Persons the Penalty which his Law had denounced against us; but graciously ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>another</hi> to suffer for us, and upon his suffering promised to forgive us if we would heartily repent? Or can we pretend that by this <hi>gracious</hi> Indulgence of his he encouraged us to Sin on, and gave us Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope that he, who without our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance had remitted so <hi>much</hi> of the Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Laws as to admit <hi>another</hi> to suffer in our Stead, might as easily be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to remit <hi>all</hi> whether ever we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented or no? Why how could he have more effectualy discouraged us from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, when he would admit of no <hi>less</hi> Suffering, but what, considering the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Person who underwent it, was as <hi>dreadful</hi> an Example of his Severity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:59595:139"/>
Sin as if he had damned <hi>for ever</hi> a whole World of Sinners? Or will you urge that you thought it in vain to return, since by your <hi>former</hi> Sins you had <hi>for ever</hi> forfeited the Favour of <hi>God?</hi> For though there was <hi>some</hi> Hopes that he might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to pardon, or remit your Punishment; yet 'twas in vain to hope that after so <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Provocations he would ever be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reconciled again, so as to receive you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Grace and Favour. But when by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own <hi>Son</hi> to die for us, he had given us so <hi>plain</hi> a Proof of the Sincerity of his Affection towards us, with what face can we suspect his Kindness? For is it likely that he who was so <hi>good</hi> as to give his <hi>Son</hi> for us whilst we were in Impenitence, should be so <hi>implacable</hi> as to deny his Love to us upon our Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Was it not a much <hi>higher</hi> Act of Love to give his <hi>Son</hi> for Sinners, than to receive <hi>poor prostrate</hi> Penitents into Favour? He then who was so free to do the <hi>former,</hi> we might well imagin would be much more free to do the <hi>latter.</hi> Or lastly, Dare we plead for our selves, that considering the Anxiousness and Jealousy of <hi>guilty</hi> Minds, <hi>God</hi> had not given us such Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Readiness to pardon and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:59595:140"/>
to us, as was <hi>requisite</hi> to dispel all those Fears and Doubts by which we were discouraged from Repentance and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? But how <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>groundless</hi> this Plea is, will soon appear to all the World, when it shall be considered what an <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Course <hi>God</hi> took to obviate all our Doubts and Fears by pardoning us in <hi>our own</hi> Method, namely, upon the Motive of a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and Intercession of a <hi>Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>; especially of such a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator</hi> as his own <hi>Son:</hi> For let him be never so <hi>severe</hi> and <hi>stern,</hi> yet 'tis impossible he should be <hi>inexorable</hi> to the <hi>vocal</hi> Blood and <hi>importunate</hi> Intercessions of that <hi>dear</hi> Person, whom he loves above all the World. And now when <hi>God</hi> had so contrived the Method of his pardoning us, as to take from us all Occasion either of presuming upon his Mercy whilst we continue <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi>; when he hath taken such an <hi>effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual</hi> Course to raise both our <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> which are the Springs of our Action, to their <hi>highest</hi> Pitch and Capacity, and given us the <hi>greatest</hi> Certainty that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Thing will bear, that he will punish us <hi>for ever</hi> if we Sin on, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and receive us into Favour if now at last we will repent and return; what can we
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:59595:140"/>
say for our selves, if in Despite of all <hi>this</hi> we will run from Mercy whilst its Arms are open to embrace us, and leap in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hell</hi> with our Eyes <hi>open,</hi> and we see it gaping ready to devour us?</p>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Why this Reward is stiled by the Name of <hi>Everlasting Life</hi>; For it is very <hi>usual</hi> with <hi>Scripture</hi> to express all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings it promises to Men by the Name of <hi>Life</hi>; for thus by <hi>Life</hi> the <hi>Old Testament</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:59595:141"/>
very frequently expresses those <hi>temporal</hi> Blessings, which are therein promised and proposed: So Deut. xxx.15. <hi>See, I have set before thee this day, Life and Good, and Death and Evil</hi>; in which he plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to those <hi>temporal</hi> Blessings and Curses, which he had proposed to, and denounced against them, Chap. xxviii. for so v.19. of this Chapter he explains himself, <hi>I call Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing: Therefore chuse Life, that both Thou and thy Seed may live.</hi> So Levit. xviii.5. <hi>Ye shall keep my Statutes and my Judgments: Which if a Man do, he shall live in them</hi>; that is, he shall enjoy all those <hi>temporal</hi> Blessings, which I have therein promised: For so Ezek. xx.21. <hi>their living in them</hi> is opposed to his pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out <hi>temporal</hi> Judgments upon them. And hence the Statutes of the <hi>Mosaic Law</hi> are called the <hi>statutes of Life, in which whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever walks, shall surely Live, and not Die,</hi> Ezek. xxxiii.15. And as these <hi>temporal</hi> Blessings promised in the <hi>Old Testament</hi> are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed by <hi>Life,</hi> so those <hi>eternal</hi> Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings promised in the <hi>New Testament</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequently expressed by <hi>Life</hi> also. So Mat. xviii.8. <hi>It is better for thee to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life halt or maimed, rather than having

two Hands or two Feet, to be cast into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Fire.</hi> So also Mat. xix.17. <hi>If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And Joh. iii.36. <hi>He that believeth on the Son, hath everlasting Life: And he that believeth not the Son, shall not see Life; but the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Blessings which the <hi>Gospel</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses are not <hi>temporal</hi> but <hi>eternal</hi>; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Life by which they are expressed is stiled <hi>eternal, everlasting,</hi> and <hi>immortal:</hi> For so 2 Tim. i.10. We find <hi>Life and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> joyned together; and Rom. vi.22. <hi>Ye have your fruit unto Holiness, and the end everlasting Life</hi>; and Vers. 23. <hi>The gift of God is eternal Life.</hi> Now that it is not called <hi>eternal</hi> Life merely as it is a State of <hi>endless</hi> Being and Existence, is evident; because <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Existence</hi> are <hi>indifferent</hi> Things abstracted from all sense of Happiness and Misery; but eternal <hi>Life</hi> is proposed to us as a Thing that is infinitely <hi>desirable</hi> in self, as being the Crown and Reward of all our Obedience; for which Reason it is called the <hi>crown of Life,</hi> Jam. i.12. And therefore the Reason why the <hi>everlasting</hi> Blessings of the <hi>Gospel</hi> are expressed by <hi>Life</hi> are,
<q>
                  <p>First, Because of the <hi>inestimable</hi> Worth and Value of <hi>Life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:59595:142"/>Secondly, Because <hi>Life</hi> is the Root of all our Sense of <hi>Pleasure</hi> and <hi>Happiness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Because it is the <hi>Principle</hi> of all our Activity.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>everlasting</hi> Blessings of the <hi>Gospel</hi> are called <hi>Life,</hi> because <hi>Life</hi> is the most inestimably <hi>precious</hi> of all the Blessings we enjoy. For without Life there is nothing can be a <hi>real</hi> Blessing to us, nothing that we can <hi>tast, relish,</hi> or <hi>enjoy:</hi> And this the <hi>Devil</hi> knew well enough when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced so confidently, <hi>Skin for Skin, yea all that a Man hath will he give for his Life,</hi> Job ii.4. Now it is usual with <hi>Scripture</hi> to describe the Blessings of the <hi>future</hi> State by Things that are of the <hi>greatest</hi> Value among Men, by <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Treasure,</hi> by a <hi>Crown</hi> and a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> by a <hi>Paradise,</hi> or a <hi>Garden of Pleasure</hi>; but as if all these were <hi>too faint</hi> and <hi>dim</hi> to represent the <hi>true</hi> Value of that <hi>blessed</hi> State, it is stiled <hi>Life</hi> also, which is much more <hi>valuable</hi> than either, yea than all those Things together. And hence the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls it a <hi>more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. iv.17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is called <hi>Life,</hi> because <hi>Life</hi> is the Root of all our Sense of Pleasure and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. For without Life we are nothing else but a Lump of <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> Flesh, <hi>incapable</hi> of perceiving either <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:59595:143"/>
or <hi>Pain.</hi> So that all Sensation being founded in Life, and all Pleasure a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> Sensation; by a very <hi>easie</hi> Figure the <hi>natural</hi> Effect and Operation of Life is expressed by Life. And indeed all the Advantage of <hi>living</hi> consists in living in a Sense of Pleasure; and therefore it hath been very much disputed among <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> whether this <hi>temporary</hi> State of ours, in which there is so <hi>great</hi> an Intermixture of <hi>Pain</hi> with <hi>Pleasure,</hi> and <hi>Misery</hi> with <hi>Happiness,</hi> doth not <hi>better</hi> deserve the Name of <hi>Death</hi> than <hi>Life</hi>; and those of them who thought it more <hi>liable</hi> to <hi>Misery</hi> than <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,</hi> affirmed it to be a State of <hi>Death,</hi> and strictly maintained this <hi>Paradox,</hi> that at our <hi>Birth</hi> we <hi>die</hi> into a <hi>worse</hi> State than Non-existence, and at our <hi>Death</hi> are <hi>born</hi> into a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> State of Life. But they who counted our <hi>present</hi> Life to be intermixt with more <hi>Pleasure</hi> than <hi>Misery,</hi> esteemed our <hi>present</hi> Existence a Priviledge deserving the Name of <hi>Life</hi>; which is an Argument that <hi>both</hi> placed all the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of <hi>living</hi> in those <hi>pleasant</hi> Perceptions that are founded in it. And thus also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Scripture Philosophy</hi> to live, as it imports Advantage to us, is to live in a State of Joy and Pleasure; so Psal. xxii.26. <hi>The meek shall eat and be satisfied: They shall
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:59595:143"/>
praise the Lord that seek him; your Heart shall live for ever,</hi> that is, you shall so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with Matter of Joy and Praise that your Hearts shall be satisfied and contented <hi>for ever.</hi> So Joh. xiv.19. <hi>Because I live, ye shall live also</hi>; that is, because I rise from the Dead and live <hi>for ever,</hi> ye shall <hi>rejoyce</hi> and be glad. So also 1 Thes. iii.8. <hi>For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord</hi>; that is we rejoyce in your Constancy and Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for so it follows immediately after, <hi>For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before God?</hi> How properly therefore may the <hi>future</hi> State be expressed by <hi>Life,</hi> since 'tis the <hi>proper</hi> Scene of Happiness where <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> doth <hi>for ever</hi> abound; where there is an <hi>inexhaustible</hi> Spring of <hi>pure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled</hi> Delights issuing forth in Rivers of Pleasure from God's right Hand <hi>for ever?</hi> So that if there be any Thing worthy of the Name of <hi>Life,</hi> it is the <hi>blisful</hi> State of those <hi>happy</hi> Souls above, who live in the <hi>continued</hi> Sense of all those <hi>unspeakable</hi> Joys and Comforts that an <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> imports.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi> it is called <hi>Life,</hi> because <hi>Life</hi> is the Principle of all Activity. 'Tis this that inlivens all our Instruments of Action, and communicates Motion to all our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:59595:144"/>
and Powers. And hence the State of <hi>Heaven</hi> may well be called the State of <hi>Life,</hi> because 'tis a State of the <hi>highest</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, wherein all our Faculties act with <hi>unspeakable</hi> Vigour, are freed from all that Weight of Sin and Matter that <hi>here</hi> do continually <hi>clog</hi> and <hi>incumber</hi> them, and entertained with such <hi>agreeable</hi> Objects as do perpetually imploy and exercise them to the <hi>utmost</hi> of their Strength and Activity: Where <hi>infinite</hi> Truth and <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness being always in our View and Prospect, will continually draw forth the <hi>utmost</hi> Force of our <hi>Vnderstandings, Wills,</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> in the most <hi>rapturous</hi> Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Fruition, and Embracements of that <hi>all-glorious</hi> Object in which we behold them; So that we shall not only Act suitably to the <hi>Genius</hi> of our <hi>rational</hi> Natures, but in every Act shall exert our <hi>utmost</hi> Activity, and <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce,</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> as much as ever we are able. Wherefore since in that <hi>blessed</hi> State we shall be all <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Wing,</hi> since all our <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Faculties shall be most incessantly and vigorously imployed about the most <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable</hi> and <hi>consentaneous</hi> Objects, we being converted as it were into <hi>pure</hi> Acts of <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi>; our State and Condition may be very well
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:59595:144"/>
expressed by <hi>Life,</hi> which is a most <hi>vigorous</hi> Principle of Activity. So that as Life is the most <hi>inestimable</hi> Jewel we have, as it is the Root of all our Sense of Pleasure, and the Principle of all our Activity, it doth most properly express the <hi>infinite</hi> Value, Pleasure, and Activity of that <hi>blisful</hi> State which <hi>God</hi> hath prepared to reward our Obedience. And so I have done with the <hi>First</hi> Thing proposed, which was to shew you for what Reason the <hi>eternal</hi> Rewards of the <hi>Blessed</hi> are so frequently expressed by <hi>everlasting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed now to shew you in the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> Place, how unspeakably <hi>good</hi> God hath been to us in proposing such a <hi>vast</hi> Reward upon the Performance of such an <hi>easie</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. In the Management of which I shall first discourse of <hi>this</hi> Reward <hi>absolutely,</hi> and shew you how <hi>great</hi> it is in it self. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>comparatively,</hi> and shew you how <hi>great</hi> it is in Respect of the Condition upon which it is promised.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We will consider it <hi>absolutely</hi> how <hi>great</hi> it is in its self. And here I do not pretend to give you a <hi>perfect</hi> Map of all the <hi>Beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes</hi> of that <hi>heavenly</hi> State; for that is a Talk fit only for an <hi>Angel,</hi> or a <hi>glorified</hi> Spirit; all I aim at is to give you such an <hi>imperfect</hi> Account of it as <hi>God</hi> hath thought fit to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:59595:145"/>
to Mortals in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which though it fall infinitely short of the Thing it self, yet is doubtless the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>utmost</hi> that our <hi>narrow</hi> Capacities can bear. In short therefore concerning this <hi>blessed</hi> State, <hi>God</hi> hath revealed to us, that it includes these six Things:
<list>
                  <item>1. A <hi>perfect</hi> Freedom from <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. A most <hi>intimate</hi> Enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</item>
                  <item>3 A most <hi>endearing</hi> Fruition of our <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Saviour.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. A most <hi>delightful</hi> Conversation with <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Spirits.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. The <hi>infinite</hi> Glory and Delightfulness of the Place, wherein all these <hi>Felicities</hi> are to be enjoyed.</item>
                  <item>6. The <hi>endless</hi> Duration of this most <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> State.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Everlasting Life</hi> includes a most <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> Freedom from <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Misery.</hi> For so we find the State of the <hi>Blessed</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> described, that <hi>they hunger no more, neither thirst any more</hi>; that <hi>the Sun lights not on them, nor any heat,</hi> that is, that they are no longer liable to the <hi>scorching</hi> Heats of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution; but that <hi>God hath wiped away all tears from their Eyes,</hi> Rev. vii.16.17. And hence also <hi>Heaven</hi> is called a State of <hi>Rest,</hi>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:59595:145"/>
Heb. iv.9, 11. <hi>There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. Let us labour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to enter into that rest</hi>: Which denotes this State to be a <hi>perfect Sabbath,</hi> and <hi>Jubile</hi> of Redemption from all <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Misery.</hi> For as soon as the Souls of <hi>good</hi> Men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this <hi>corporeal</hi> State in which they now live, they are immediatly released from all those <hi>bodily</hi> Passions of <hi>Hunger,</hi> and <hi>Thirst,</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> and <hi>Diseases</hi> whereunto they are now liable by Reason of their <hi>Vnion</hi> with the Body; and having in a <hi>great</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure conquered their Wills while they were in the Body, and subdued them to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> they shall immediately commense into an <hi>high</hi> Degree of Perfection. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from the Incumbrances of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> from the Importunities of their <hi>bodily</hi> Passions and Appetites, and the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Sensuality</hi> that do now continually sollicit them, they shall no longer be liable to those Irregularities of Affection that do <hi>here</hi> disturb the Tranquility of their Minds; and their Actions and Affections being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways regulated by their Reason, their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences shall be no longer <hi>bestormed</hi> with those Terrors and Affrightments, which nothing but the Sense of Guilt can suggest to them; but enjoy a <hi>perpetual</hi> Calm and Serenity. And being thus freed from all Evils and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:59595:146"/>
Disquietudes both from <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> they shall be at <hi>perfect</hi> Ease, and <hi>for ever</hi> enjoy a most <hi>undisturbed</hi> Repose. O <hi>blessed</hi> Day, when I shall take my Leave of Sin and Misery <hi>for ever,</hi> and go to those <hi>calm</hi> and <hi>blisful</hi> Regions, whence <hi>Sighs</hi> and <hi>Tears</hi> and <hi>Sorrows</hi> and <hi>Pains</hi> are banished <hi>for ever more!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Everlasting Life</hi> includes a most <hi>inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> Enjoyment of <hi>God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For <hi>God</hi> being a <hi>rational</hi> Good, is capable of being enjoyed by <hi>rational</hi> Beings no otherwise than by <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and by <hi>Love,</hi> and by <hi>Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi>; all which Ways he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised that we shall enjoy him, when once we are arrived into that <hi>blisful</hi> State. For as for the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that whereas <hi>now we see through a Glass dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we shall then see</hi> him <hi>Face to Face:</hi> And whereas now <hi>we know in part,</hi> then <hi>we shall know even as also we are known,</hi> 1 Cor. xiii.12. and St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>we shall see him as he is,</hi> 1 John iii.2. Which expressions must needs import such a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of him as is unspeakably more <hi>distinct</hi> and <hi>clear</hi> than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny we enjoy in this <hi>present</hi> State. For then the Eyes of our Minds shall be so <hi>invigora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> that we shall be able to <hi>gaze</hi> on the Sun without <hi>dazling,</hi> to contemplate the <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi> Glory of the <hi>Divinity</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being confounded with its Brightness;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:59595:146"/>
and our Understandings shall be so exalted that shall we see more at every <hi>single</hi> View than we do now in <hi>Volumes</hi> of Discourse; and the most <hi>tedious</hi> Trains of Inference and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. And enjoying a most <hi>perfect</hi> Repose both from <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> we shall have nothing to disturb or divert our <hi>greedy</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations, which having such an <hi>immense</hi> Horizon of Truth and Glory round about them, shall still discover farther and farther, and so entertain themselves with <hi>everlasting</hi> Wonder and Delight. For what an <hi>infinite</hi> Pleasure will that <hi>all-glorious</hi> Object afford to our <hi>raised</hi> Minds, which then shall no longer labour under the <hi>tedious</hi> Difficulties of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, but like <hi>transparent</hi> Windows shall have nothing to do but only to receive the Light, which freely offers it self unto them, and shines <hi>for ever</hi> round about them; when every <hi>new</hi> Discovery of <hi>God,</hi> and of those <hi>bottomless</hi> Secrets and Mysteries of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shall enlarge our Capacities to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more, and still <hi>new</hi> Discoveries shall freely offer themselves as fast as our Minds are enlarged to receive them! This doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less will be a Recreation to our Minds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>transcending</hi> all that we can conceive or imagin of it, especially considering that all our <hi>Knowledge</hi> shall terminate in <hi>Love,</hi> that <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> Passion that <hi>sooths</hi>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:59595:147"/>
and <hi>ravishes</hi> the Hearts, and <hi>dissolves</hi> it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Joy and Pleasure: For <hi>God</hi> being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>good</hi> and <hi>amicable,</hi> the <hi>more</hi> we know him the <hi>more</hi> Cause and Reason we have to love him. When therefore we are arrived to that Degree of <hi>Knowledge</hi> which the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atifical Vision</hi> implies, we shall find our Hearts inflamed with such a <hi>vehement</hi> Love to him as will issue into an <hi>unspeakable</hi> Delight and Satisfaction, and even overwhelm us with Extasies of Joy and Complacency, for if those <hi>divine</hi> Illapses, those more <hi>immediate</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Sensations of <hi>God,</hi> which <hi>Good Men</hi> do sometimes experience in <hi>this</hi> Life, do so affect and ravish them that they are even forced into <hi>Triumphs</hi> and <hi>Exultations</hi>; how will they be wrapt and transported in that State of <hi>Vision,</hi> when they shall <hi>see</hi> him so immediately, and <hi>love</hi> him so vehemently, and their Souls shall be nothing else but <hi>entire</hi> Globes of Light and Love, all <hi>irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated</hi> and <hi>inflamed</hi> with the <hi>immediate Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluvia's</hi> of the Fountain of Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? But alas! As these Joys are <hi>too big</hi> for <hi>mortal</hi> Language to express, so are they <hi>too strong</hi> for <hi>frail</hi> Mortality to bear; and if we but for one Day or Hour should see <hi>God,</hi> and love him as those <hi>glorified</hi> Spirits do, we should questionless die with an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy</hi> of Pleasure, and our <hi>glad</hi> Hearts being
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:59595:147"/>
tickled with such <hi>insupportable</hi> Joys, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to enlarge themselves to make Room for them, all would quickly stretch into a Rupture. But then as our <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>God</hi> shall <hi>terminate</hi> in the Love of him, so both together shall <hi>terminate</hi> in our Resemblance of his Perfections; for having so <hi>immediate</hi> a Prospect of his Beauties, and being so infinitely <hi>enamoured</hi> with them, with what <hi>inexpressible</hi> Vigour must we imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and transcribe them? And our Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being <hi>invigorated</hi> with such a <hi>clear</hi> Knowledge and such a <hi>vehement</hi> Love, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of producing the described Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance; so that the more we <hi>know God,</hi> the more we shall <hi>love</hi> him; and the more we <hi>know</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> the more we shall <hi>imitate</hi> and <hi>resemble</hi> him. So that then both our <hi>inward</hi> Motions and <hi>outward</hi> Actions will be all most <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Imitations of <hi>God</hi> which will produce such an <hi>exact</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between his <hi>Original</hi> and our <hi>Copy,</hi> that whilst we interchangably turn our Eyes to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>our selves,</hi> and compare Beauty with Beauty, it will fill our Minds with <hi>unspeakable</hi> Content to see how the Image answers to the <hi>Prototype,</hi> what a <hi>sweet</hi> Harmony and Agreement there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>his</hi> Nature and <hi>our own.</hi> For if from our Love of <hi>God</hi> there must necessarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:59595:148"/>
to us such <hi>ineffable</hi> Joy and Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, what a <hi>ravishing</hi> Delight will it afford us to see the <hi>Signatures</hi> of those <hi>adorable</hi> Beauties for which we love him, stampt and impressed upon <hi>our own</hi> Natures; when the Glory that shines about, and inflames us, shall shine into us and become <hi>our own</hi>; and those <hi>amiable Ideas</hi> of him which are impressed upon our Understanding, shall stamp our Wills and Affections with their own Resemblance! For so the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us it shall be, 1 John iii.2. <hi>For when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. Lord,</hi> how must our Souls be <hi>enlarged</hi> and <hi>widened</hi> to be able to contain all those <hi>mighty</hi> Joys that must necessarily spring from our Fruition of thee! And to what a Degree of Happiness shall we be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, when we shall be entertained with all the delights that the Enjoyment of an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Good</hi> can afford us, and have Hearts <hi>great</hi> enough to contain them all without being <hi>overcharged</hi> with their Weight and Number!</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly, Everlasting Life</hi> includes a most <hi>endearing</hi> Fruition of our <hi>glorified Saviour.</hi> And certainly this is none of the <hi>smallest</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients of that <hi>blisful</hi> State, that we shall <hi>ever be with our blessed Lord</hi>; as the <hi>Apostle</hi> expresses it, 1 Thes. iv.17.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:59595:148"/>
evident the same <hi>Apostle</hi> placed one <hi>great</hi> Advantage of his <hi>future</hi> State; for so he tells us, he had <hi>a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better,</hi> Phil. i.23. And indeed 'tis impossible but it must be a <hi>vast</hi> Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Happiness of all <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>grateful</hi> Souls to see this <hi>blessed</hi> Friend and Benefactor, who came down from the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som of his Father, and for their Sake ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself to a <hi>miserable</hi> Life, and <hi>shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Death; to see him sitting at his Father's right Hand <hi>crowned</hi> with Majesty and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, <hi>surrounded</hi> with the whole Choir of <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> like a <hi>Sun</hi> in the midst of a Circle of Stars.

the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> Verily methinks though I were excluded from that <hi>happy</hi> Place, and had only the Priviledge to look <hi>in</hi> and see my <hi>blessed Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> it would be a most <hi>heavenly</hi> Consolation to me to behold the Glory and Honour and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness with which he is surrounded, though I were sure never to partake of it; and the Communion I should have in the Joys of my Master, the <hi>sweet</hi> Sympathy in all his Pleasures would be a <hi>Heaven</hi> at <hi>second</hi> Hand to me, and I should feel my self unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <hi>happy</hi> in being a Spectator of his Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Advancement. But Oh!

loaded with so many <hi>vast</hi> Obligations to love thee, shall be introduced into thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, to see thy Glories, and <hi>Sympathize</hi> in thy Joys, as thou didst in my Miseries; to <hi>thank</hi> and <hi>praise</hi> thee Face to Face for all those Wonders of Love with which thou hast obliged me, and to bear a Part in that <hi>heavenly</hi> Song, <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; who hast redeemed us to God by thy blood, our of every Kindred, and Tongue, and People and Nation,</hi> Rev. v.9, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly, Everlasting Life</hi> includes a most <hi>delightful</hi> Conversation and Society with <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>glorified Spirits.</hi> For when we come to the <hi>City of the Living God, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Jerusalem,</hi> the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, what our Society will be, <hi>viz. an innumerable company of Angels, the general Assembly and Church of the first-born, God the judge of all, the Spirits of just Men made perfect, and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus the Mediatour of the new Covenant,</hi> Heb. xii.22, 23, 24. <hi>Lord,</hi> what <hi>glorious</hi> Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety is here!

from all that <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Peevishness, Disguize</hi> and <hi>Dissimulation</hi> which is the Bane of <hi>humane</hi> Conversation; their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings are exceeding <hi>large</hi> and <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive,</hi> and their Charity and Goodness is full as <hi>extensive</hi> as their Knowledge: And in such a Conjunction of Wisdom with Goodness, what an <hi>excellent</hi> Society must there needs be produced?

will all receive and entertain me with the <hi>tenderest</hi> Indearments of <hi>heavenly</hi> Lovers.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly, Everlasting Life</hi> includes also the <hi>infinite</hi> Glory and Delightfulness of the Place wherein all these Felicities are to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For though the very State of the <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> be sufficiently <hi>glorious</hi> to transform the most <hi>dismal</hi> Place into a Paradise, and to create a <hi>Heaven</hi> in the <hi>darkest</hi> Dungeon of <hi>Hell</hi>; yet such hath been the Goodness of <hi>God,</hi> that he hath prepared a Place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably <hi>glorious</hi> to that <hi>blessed</hi> State; which according to the <hi>Sciripture</hi> Account is the <hi>highest Heaven,</hi> or the <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>purer</hi> Tracts of the <hi>Aether.</hi> For so our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells the <hi>penitent</hi> Thief, <hi>to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise,</hi> Luk. xxiii.43. and where this <hi>Paradise</hi> is St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, 2 Cor. xii. for Vers. 2. he tells us of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>caught up to the third Heaven,</hi> which in the 4th Vers. he calls <hi>Paradise, where he heard unspeakable Words.</hi> Now that by the <hi>Third Heaven</hi> he means the <hi>uppermost, viz.</hi> that <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>Heavens</hi> which is the Throne of God's most <hi>glorious</hi> Residence, where <hi>Jesus</hi> sits at his right Hand among the <hi>holy Miriads</hi> of Angels and <hi>glorious</hi> Spirits, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from this; because according to the <hi>Jewish Philosophy,</hi> to which he here alludes, <hi>Heaven</hi> was divided into <hi>three</hi> Regions, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:59595:151"/>
the <hi>Cloud-bearing, Star-bearing,</hi> and <hi>Angel-bearing</hi> Region, the last of which they call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> in which they placed the Throne of the <hi>Divine</hi> Majesty. And that by <hi>Paradise</hi> he means the same Place is as evident, because by this Name the <hi>Jews,</hi> in whose Language he speaks, were wont to call it the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Angel-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Region. And hence <hi>Rab. Menachem</hi> on <hi>Leviticus,</hi> tells us it is apparent that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Obedience is not to be enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Life; Verum post dissolutionem Justus adipiscitur Regnum quod dicitur Paradisus, fruiturque conspectu divino; <hi>i. e. but after Death the Just shall obtain that Kingdom which is called Paradise, and there enjoy the beatifical Vision.</hi> And 'tis very usual for them to express the Blessings of the <hi>future</hi> Life by enjoying the Delights of <hi>Paradise</hi>; and therefore is this <hi>heavenly</hi> Region of <hi>Angels</hi> called by the Name of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise</hi> in Allusion to the earthly Paradise of <hi>Eden,</hi> denoting to us, that as <hi>that</hi> was the Garden of this <hi>lower</hi> World, which of all other Places did most abound with Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and Delights; so <hi>this</hi> is the Paradise of the whole Creation, the most <hi>fruitful</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> Region within all this <hi>bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Space of the World. Nor indeed can it be imagined to be otherwise, it being
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:59595:152"/>
the <hi>Imperial Court</hi> which the <hi>great</hi> Monarch of the World hath chosen for his <hi>special</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence, and which he hath prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and lodge the <hi>glorified humane Nature</hi> of his own <hi>eternal Son,</hi> and to entertain his Friends and Favourites <hi>for ever.</hi> For if these <hi>Out-Rooms</hi> of the World are so <hi>royal</hi> and <hi>magnificent,</hi> how infinitely <hi>splendid</hi> must we needs imagin the <hi>Presence-Chamber</hi> of the <hi>great</hi> King to be, the Glory of whose Presence will render it more <hi>lightsome</hi> and <hi>illustrious</hi> than the <hi>united</hi> Beams of <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand</hi> Suns. And therefore though the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> hath nowhere given us an <hi>exact</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of this <hi>glorious</hi> Place, because in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no <hi>humane</hi> Language can describe it; yet since <hi>God</hi> hath chosen it for the <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Theater of Bliss and Happiness, we may reasonably conclude that he hath most exquisitely furnished it with all Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>requisite</hi> for a most <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>blisful</hi> Life, and that the House is every way <hi>suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to the Entertainment. Whensoever therefore a <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> Soul gets free from this Cage of Flesh, away it flies under the Conduct and Protection of <hi>Angels</hi> through the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Aether</hi> beyond the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Stars, and never stops till it is arrived to those <hi>blessed</hi> Abodes, where <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Jesus, Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> dwell; where
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:59595:152"/>
being come, with what <hi>unspeakable</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light will it contemplate <hi>that</hi> Scene of Things? When all of a suddain it shall see it self surrounded with an <hi>infinite</hi> Splendor and Brightness, so that which way soever it casts its Eyes, it is entertained with <hi>new</hi> Objects of Wonder and Delight; then shall it say, as the <hi>Queen of Sheba</hi> did of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s <hi>Court,</hi> alas! How <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>dim,</hi> how <hi>short</hi> and <hi>imperfect</hi> were all <hi>humane</hi> Conceits and Descriptions of this <hi>blessed</hi> Place! For though I have heard <hi>great</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> Things of it, yet now I find that not <hi>one</hi> Half of its <hi>real</hi> Glory and Magnificence hath ever been reported to me.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly, <hi>Everlasting Life</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the <hi>endless</hi> Duration of this most <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> State. Thus Joh. vi.27. he calls his Doctrine the <hi>meat which endureth unto everlasting Life, which the Son of Man shall give unto you</hi>; and Vers. 40. he tells them that <hi>this was the will of his Father, that every one that believeth on him, might have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Life</hi>; and Vers. 47. <hi>Verily verily I say unto you, he that believeth on me, hath everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life</hi>; and Vers. 51, 54, 58. he promises them that upon their <hi>believing in him, they should live for ever.</hi> But because <hi>Everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life,</hi> and <hi>For ever,</hi> doth in <hi>Scripture</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times signify a <hi>long,</hi> but not an <hi>endless</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:59595:153"/>
therefore he hath taken Care to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press this <hi>Article</hi> in such Words as must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily denote an <hi>endless</hi> Duration of Bliss; for he not only tells them, Chap. vi.50. that they who believed his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> should <hi>not die,</hi> but that <hi>whosoever liveth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him, shall never die,</hi> Joh. xi.26. yea, and not only so, but that they should <hi>never see death,</hi> Joh. viii.51. that is, should never come within Ken or Prospect of it: Nay, and Luk. xx.36. he tells them, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they die any more; for they are equal to the Angels.</hi> If then our <hi>future</hi> Life be so <hi>everlasting</hi> as that it neither can nor shall be terminated by Death, it must necessarily be a Life without End; whose Duration is <hi>parallel</hi> to <hi>Eternity.</hi> Now what a <hi>mighty</hi> Addition must this needs make to the Joys of the <hi>Blessed,</hi> to consider that they are such as shall never expire; when the Soul shall reflect upon her <hi>happy</hi> State, and think thus with her self, <hi>O blessed, for ever be a good God! I am as happy now as ever my Heart can hold; every Part of me is so thronged with Joy, that I have no room for any more; and that which compleats and crowns them all, is that they shall be renewed to all Eternity, and Millions of Millions of Ages hence be as far from a period as they were the first moment wherein I enjoyed them.</hi> For our Lives and our Happiness shall be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:59595:153"/>
               <hi>co-eternal</hi> to <hi>one another,</hi> our <hi>God</hi> shall live <hi>for ever,</hi> and we shall live <hi>for ever</hi> to enjoy him, and in the Enjoyment of such an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Good</hi> we need not doubt to find Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety enough still to renew our Joys, and to keep them <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>flourishing for ever.</hi> For as we shall always know <hi>God,</hi> so we shall always know him <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more,</hi> and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>new</hi> Beauty that <hi>infinite</hi> Object discovers to us will kindle a <hi>new</hi> Flame of Love, and <hi>that</hi> a <hi>new</hi> Rapture of Joy, and <hi>that</hi> a <hi>new</hi> Desire of knowing and discovering more, and so <hi>for ever</hi> round again there will be <hi>knowing</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>rejoycing</hi> more and more to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> For so <hi>immense</hi> will our Happiness be, that we shall need as well as desire an <hi>Eternity</hi> to enjoy it fully, and after <hi>millions</hi> of Ages are spent in the Enjoyment of it, we shall still renew our Fruition with the same <hi>fresh enravishing</hi> Pleasures as when we <hi>first</hi> possessed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it; for as <hi>new</hi> Pleasures will still pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves unto us, so when we have enjoyed them never so long we shall still be at an <hi>infinite</hi> Distance from any End of our Enjoyment. So that our Happiness consisting of an <hi>infinite</hi> Variety of Pleasures extended to an <hi>infinite</hi> Duration, we shall neither be cloyed with the Repetition of it, nor tormented with the Fear of losing it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:59595:154"/>And now you see how <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>immense</hi> the Reward of our <hi>obediential</hi> Belief of our <hi>Saviour</hi> is; I need not tell you that 'tis a <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>apparent</hi> Instance of God's <hi>great</hi> Love and <hi>good</hi> Will to the World; For 'tis indeed such a <hi>transcendent</hi> Instance, as may justly astonish the whole Creation, and put both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> into an Extasy to see the <hi>benevolent</hi> Father of the World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject such <hi>mighty</hi> Entertainments for such <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving</hi> Children, and prepare such a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>boundless</hi> and <hi>endless</hi> Pleasure to treat such a Company of <hi>wretched sinful</hi> Worms.

But this will yet more evidently appear, if from the <hi>absolute</hi> Consideration of this Reward we descend to the <hi>comparative</hi>; which was,</p>

And this I shall endeavour to make appear to you in these seven Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:
<list>
                  <item>1. The Condition is <hi>due,</hi> but the Reward is <hi>free</hi> and <hi>arbitrary.</hi>
                  </item>

                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:59595:154"/>2. The Condition is no ways <hi>advantageous</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but the Reward is infinitely <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous</hi> to us.</item>
                  <item>3. The Condition is <hi>small,</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be performed; but the Reward is <hi>immense</hi> and <hi>boundless.</hi>

                  <item>4. In performing the Condition <hi>God</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates <hi>more</hi> than we; but in receiving the Reward <hi>we</hi> only are concerned.</item>
                  <item>5. The Condition is <hi>momentary</hi> and <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,</hi> but the Reward is <hi>eternal.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6. In the performance of the Condition, there are <hi>great</hi> Intermixtures of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with our Labour, but in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward there is not the <hi>least</hi> Intermixture of Misery with Happiness.</item>
                  <item>7. The Condition <hi>admits</hi> of Intermissions of Labour, but in the Reward there are <hi>no</hi> Intermissions of Happiness.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Condition is <hi>due,</hi> but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is <hi>free</hi> and <hi>arbitrary.</hi> For <hi>God</hi> being our Creator we ow all our Powers of Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; and from this <hi>absolute</hi> Propriety that he hath in our Powers, he derives an <hi>immutable</hi> Right to all the <hi>possible</hi> Service we can render him; so that whilst he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns us nothing but what is <hi>possible,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly requires what is his <hi>Due,</hi> and what we cannot withold without a most <hi>injust</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion of his Right and Property. For he
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:59595:155"/>
being the <hi>Supreme</hi> Proprietor of all our Powers and Faculties, must needs have an <hi>eternal</hi> Right to imploy and exercise them as he pleases; because by so doing he only uses <hi>his own</hi> Goods to <hi>his own</hi> Ends and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, which every Proprietor hath an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable</hi> Right to do; so that to <hi>substract</hi> our Powers from his Use and Service, is to <hi>embezzle</hi> our Masters Goods, and commit <hi>dow right</hi> Theft and Robbery. Wherefore, since in the Condition of our <hi>Salvation</hi> he hath required nothing of us but what is <hi>possible</hi> for us to do, this he might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded as a <hi>just</hi> Debt, without offering us any Reward for the Payment of it; but that he should give <hi>us</hi> a <hi>Heaven</hi> only for giving him <hi>his</hi> Due, and bestow upon us for paying what we <hi>owed</hi> him, <hi>infinitely</hi> more than the whole Debt amounts to, is an Expression of Love beyond all Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. When he might have justly sent us into this <hi>Theater</hi> to act what Part soever he pleased, have endeared our Duty to us by nothing but its <hi>appendent</hi> Delights, and when we had done, remanded us back into our <hi>Primitive Non-entity</hi>; yet that he should recompense the <hi>bare</hi> Discharge of that Duty we own him with the Reward of such an <hi>immortal</hi> Bliss, is such a <hi>stupendous</hi> Height of Goodness, as not only <hi>puzzles</hi> our Conceit,

but <hi>out-reaches</hi> our Wonder and Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The Condition is no ways <hi>advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but the Reward is infinitely <hi>advantageous</hi> to us; for he is so infinitely <hi>happy</hi> in the Enjoyment of <hi>himself</hi> and <hi>his own</hi> Perfections, that all the Services of Men and Angels can make no Addition to his Felicity; which depends wholly upon the <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness and Perfection of <hi>his own</hi> Nature, and is not derived either in <hi>whole</hi> or in Part from the Tributes or <hi>Free-will</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of his Creatures. For <hi>can a Man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that we are righteous? Or is it gain to him that we make our ways perfect,</hi> Job. xxii.2, 3? No certainly; when he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but himself to <hi>contemplate</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> his Happiness was the same as it is <hi>now</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Praises and Services which he receives from the World of <hi>Angels</hi> and of <hi>Men</hi>; and if they should revolt from him, or relapse into <hi>Non-Entity</hi> again, he would still remain the same most <hi>happy</hi> Being that now he is, and ever was. For all <hi>true</hi> Happiness being founded in Perfection, it it is impossible that any Being that is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely <hi>perfect</hi> in himself should become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>more</hi> or <hi>less happy</hi> by any Thing that
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:59595:156"/>
happens from without him. So that as to the Happiness of <hi>God,</hi> it is the same Thing whether we obey, or disobey him; so that whatsoever Condition he imposes on us, our Performance of it is but just like bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Wax</hi> to a <hi>dying</hi> Father, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not to inrich himself, but only to <hi>seal</hi> away Fortunes to his Children. And that he imposes <hi>this</hi> Condition on us ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>another,</hi> is not because it is most <hi>advantageous</hi> to him, but because it is most conducive to our Welfare and Happiness: So free and <hi>uninterested</hi> is his Love and Goodness to us, that upon Considerations no ways <hi>advantageous</hi> to himself, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises <hi>infinite</hi> Advantages to us; for 'tis <hi>we</hi> reap all the Profit as well of the Condition as of the Reward <hi>appendent</hi> to it, and he promises us <hi>Heaven</hi> upon Terms, that carry <hi>Heaven</hi> in the Performance of them. For <hi>first</hi> the Condition <hi>perfects</hi> our Natures, and then the Reward <hi>beatifies</hi> them; for there is nothing in the Condition of the <hi>Christian Covenant</hi> but what <hi>our own</hi> Self-love rightly directed would oblige us to; nothing but what tends to our <hi>good,</hi> and is highly <hi>conducive</hi> to our Perfection and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness. So that whatsoever Advantages accrue either from the Condition, or the Reward annexed to it, they all redound to
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:59595:156"/>
our selves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So infinitely <hi>bountiful</hi> is our <hi>blessed</hi> Master, that with <hi>vast</hi> Wages he hires his Servants to a Work that is a <hi>noble</hi> Reward to it self; and courts them with the Promise of <hi>Heaven</hi> to be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful</hi> to themselves. O thou <hi>boundless</hi> and <hi>bottomless</hi> Love! What Tongue is able to express thy Beneficence, that hast prepared and promised a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>endless</hi> and <hi>ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Joys and Pleasures only to tempt and bribe thy Creatures to do what is <hi>good</hi> for themselves; and without any Prospect of Self-advantage hast obliged us to be <hi>our own</hi> Benefactors by promising to reward us for being so, with a most <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>blisful</hi> Immortality?</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The Condition is <hi>small,</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> to be performed; but the Reward is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense</hi> and <hi>boundless.</hi> For what doth the <hi>Lord our God</hi> require of us, bot only to act like Men, and follow the Prescriptions of <hi>Right Reason?</hi> Which, if there had never been <hi>any</hi> Law given to the World, nor <hi>any</hi> Reward annexed to the keeping it, would have prescribed to us to live <hi>soberly, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously,</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> in this <hi>present</hi> World; for prescinding from all Obligations of Law and Conscience, to do thus becomes all <hi>reasonable</hi> Natures, and is much more for their Interest and Happiness than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:59595:157"/>
And is this so <hi>hard</hi> a Restraint to be confined to do nothing but what becomes us, and <hi>with-hold</hi> from nothing but <hi>counter-mining</hi> our own Happiness? But then, if we consider how our Duty is <hi>sweetned</hi> over with Pleasure, <hi>encouraged</hi> with the Smiles of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>backt</hi> with the Approbations of <hi>our own</hi> Consciences; with what <hi>gentle</hi> Mitigations it is required, with what <hi>puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> Motives it is inforced, and with what <hi>powerful</hi> Grace it is assisted and promoted; we must needs acknowledge it to be a most <hi>gracious, easie,</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> Yoke. But if we measure it by the Vastness of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I confess it looks like some <hi>great</hi> and <hi>mighty</hi> Thing. For if we value God's Bounty by <hi>our own,</hi> we cannot but conclude that sure he would never have made such <hi>vast</hi> Preparations for our Happiness, nor planted such a <hi>Paradise</hi> of Pleasures to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain us, but upon some <hi>mighty</hi> Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be performed on our Part. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had he imposed the <hi>hardest</hi> Condition in the World, sent us to <hi>row</hi> in the <hi>Gallies,</hi> or <hi>dig</hi> in the <hi>Mines</hi> for a <hi>thousand</hi> Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; such a <hi>vast</hi> Reward would have been <hi>sufficient</hi> to have rendred it not only <hi>tollerable,</hi> but <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>delightful.</hi> But that he should promise us such a <hi>mighty</hi> Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence as the Joys of an <hi>everlasting</hi> Heaven
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:59595:157"/>
includes, a Recompence as <hi>large</hi> as our <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> Capacities, and as <hi>lasting</hi> as our <hi>longest</hi> Duration; and this upon no <hi>other</hi> Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but our <hi>sincere</hi> Belief of, and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his <hi>Gospel,</hi> whose Precepts are all <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and <hi>pregnant</hi> with <hi>unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Pleasure and Delight; is such a <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> of Goodness as we can never sufficiently admire and adore: That meerly for believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Revelation,</hi> of whose Truth we have such convincing Evidence, and practising suitably to our Belief, we should from <hi>wretched mortal</hi> Worms, be advanced to an <hi>equal</hi> Pitch of Bliss and Glory with <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Angels, and live as happily <hi>for ever</hi> as all the Joys of <hi>Heaven</hi> can make us, is doubtless such an Instance of Love and Bounty as could only proceed from <hi>infinite</hi> Goodness.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> In performing the Condition, <hi>God</hi> operates more than we; but in receiving the Reward <hi>we</hi> only are concerned. For to our <hi>sincere</hi> Belief and Obedience of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,</hi> it is plain, that <hi>God</hi> contributes much <hi>more</hi> than we; for besides that he is the Author of all those <hi>Faculties</hi> by which we do believe and obey him, of all those <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences</hi> by which we are convinced of the Truth of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and of all those <hi>Motives</hi> by which we are <hi>animated</hi> in our Obedience
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:59595:158"/>
to it; besides all which, I say, he is also the Author of all that <hi>inward</hi> Grace and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance by which our <hi>pious</hi> Endeavours are excited and crowned with a <hi>blessed</hi> Success. And considering how much all these Things do operate upon our Performance of the <hi>Gospel-Condition,</hi> it is not only <hi>true</hi> that without God's Grace we should never have performed it, but also that in our Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, <hi>that</hi> is the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> Agent; and no Man ever yet became a <hi>hearty</hi> Believer and Disciple of <hi>Jesus,</hi> but was much <hi>more</hi> beholding to the Grace of <hi>God,</hi> than to his own Activity and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. And hence we are said <hi>to be created in Christ Jesus unto good works,</hi> Eph. ii.10. not but that <hi>God</hi> exacts the Concurrence of our Endeavours with his Grace, and that in the Performance of the <hi>Gospel-condition</hi> as well as in any <hi>other</hi> Affair of our Lives. For it is the Blessing of the <hi>Lord</hi> that makes Men <hi>rich</hi> as well as <hi>Good,</hi> and we may as well expect that he should make us <hi>rich</hi> without Industry, as <hi>good</hi> without Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and Endeavour; But when we have done our <hi>utmost,</hi> 'tis to the <hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as to the <hi>principal</hi> Cause that all our <hi>good</hi> is to be attributed. But yet though 'tis he that works <hi>this</hi> Condition in us, that is the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finisher</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi>; yet the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:59595:158"/>
Reward doth wholly redound to ourselves, as if <hi>we</hi> had been the Authors and Finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all; and though he hath the <hi>greatest</hi> Share in the Work, yet he substracts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all from the Wages, but pays us infinitely <hi>more</hi> than the <hi>utmost</hi> Merit of the Work amounts to. He gives us <hi>Faith,</hi> and then he crowns <hi>his own</hi> Gift with <hi>Glory,</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>Immortality.</hi> He <hi>sows</hi> and <hi>cultivates</hi> our Nature, that we may <hi>reap</hi> the <hi>Crop</hi> and <hi>Harvest.</hi> So infinitely <hi>liberal</hi> is our <hi>blessed</hi> Master as to reward his Servants for his own Work, to undergo the <hi>greatest</hi> Part of their Labour, and when 'tis done, to pay them <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> Fold for it.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The Condition is <hi>momentary</hi> and <hi>temporal,</hi> but the Reward is <hi>eternal.</hi> It is but a <hi>little little</hi> while that the Labour of our Duty lasts; for Constancy and Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, will soon render it <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>easie</hi>; and if it did not, yet Death will quickly put an end to all; and within these very <hi>few</hi> Days or Years we shall see an <hi>everlasting</hi> Period of all the <hi>Pains</hi> of our Watchfulness, of all the <hi>Severities</hi> of Mortification, and of all the <hi>Sorrows</hi> of Repentance; but then the Reward abides to all <hi>Eternity,</hi> and lasts out to a <hi>never-ending</hi> Duration. So that though we shall soon see an End of our Work, yet the Wages is so <hi>vast</hi> that we shall be
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:59595:159"/>
spending on it <hi>for ever</hi>; and <hi>Myriads</hi> of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riads</hi> of Ages hence shall be rejoycing in the Fruits of our <hi>present</hi> Labour and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>blisful</hi> Effects of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to the <hi>latest</hi> Moment of <hi>Eternity.</hi> O thou <hi>liberal</hi> Rewarder of Men! Who can sufficiently admire thy Goodness, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneratest our short Pains with <hi>endless</hi> Pleasures, and exchangest with us an <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of Happiness for the Labour and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of a <hi>Moment?</hi> For when we are arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into that vast <hi>Eternity</hi> of Bliss, all the Pains we have taken in our Voyage thither will hardly bear the Proportion of a <hi>single Vnite</hi> to an <hi>infinite Sum</hi>; for what are <hi>twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> Years, but a <hi>moment</hi> to <hi>Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Thousand?</hi> and what are <hi>Ten Thousand</hi> Years, but a <hi>moment</hi> to an <hi>endless Eternity?</hi> So that methinks, when I consider that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Ten,</hi> or <hi>Twenty,</hi> or <hi>Thirty</hi> Years Service, I shall be allowed an <hi>Eternity</hi> to spend in the most <hi>ravishing</hi> Joys and Pleasures, and live as happily <hi>for ever,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> and an <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Heaven</hi> can make me; the Bounties of my <hi>blessed</hi> Master appear in such a <hi>prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> Bulk to me, that I am even confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Prospect of them; and all this Time I have to spend in <hi>Religion,</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness,</hi> in subduing my <hi>Passions</hi> and <hi>Appetites,</hi> and contending with my own
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:59595:159"/>
               <hi>Inclinations</hi> seems nothing to me; but like a <hi>little Rivulet,</hi> is swallowed up in that <hi>boundless</hi> and <hi>bottomless</hi> Duration, where it loses it self, and is no more remembred by me.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> In the Performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there are <hi>great</hi> Intermixtures of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure with our Labour; but in the Reward, there is not the <hi>least</hi> Intermixture of Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with Happiness. That Man must be very much <hi>unexperienced</hi> in a <hi>Christian Life,</hi> who thinks it a <hi>melancholy, sower,</hi> and <hi>rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Thing; for besides that, it freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges to us all the <hi>innocent</hi> Gratifications of our Senses, and all the Refreshments of <hi>honest</hi> Mirth and <hi>moderate</hi> Recreation; it hath so many <hi>choice</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> Pleasures of its own, as are sufficient to endear it unto all <hi>wise</hi> Men, though it had no <hi>other</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to recommend it: For all the Acts and Functions of it being most <hi>agreeable</hi> to <hi>humane Nature,</hi> must needs be highly <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> to it. For what can be more <hi>agreeable</hi> to a <hi>reasonable</hi> Nature, than to <hi>adore</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> to <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>confide</hi> in the Fountain of its Being and Happiness? And being so <hi>agreeable,</hi> how can they but abound with Pleasure and Delight? What can be more <hi>suitable</hi> to a <hi>sociable</hi> Nature than to be <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>obliging, courteous</hi> and <hi>beneficent</hi> to all
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:59595:160"/>
we converse with? and being so <hi>suitable,</hi> how is it possible but it should be <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>delightsome?</hi> In a word, what can be more <hi>convenient</hi> to a Nature that is compounded of an <hi>immortal</hi> Spirit and a <hi>mortal</hi> Body, than to keep the <hi>Body</hi> in Subjection to the <hi>Mind,</hi> and Govern its Appetites and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the Rules of <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety?</hi> and being so <hi>convenient,</hi> what <hi>Content</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> must there needs accrue from it? For the Pleasure of every Being consists in acting <hi>agreeably</hi> to its own Nature; and therefore since to act <hi>religiously</hi> is so <hi>agreeable</hi> to the Nature of Man, it is impossible but it must be <hi>pleasant,</hi> especially considering how much it conduces to the <hi>Tranquility</hi> of our Minds, and the <hi>Peace</hi> of our Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and the <hi>Advancement</hi> of our Interests in <hi>both</hi> Worlds: All which being consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I dare boldly affirm, that if there were no <hi>other</hi> Reward of a <hi>religious</hi> Life, but only its own <hi>appendent</hi> Delights, yet this were enough to recommend it unto any <hi>wise</hi> Man; and that there never was any Man whatsoever that made a <hi>through</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, but found it far more <hi>pleasant</hi> and <hi>agreeable</hi> to him, than the most <hi>jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial</hi> Course of Wickedness and Impiety. And yet to this <hi>pleasant</hi> Life it is, that the <hi>good God</hi> doth tempt and invite us by the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:59595:160"/>
Promise of a <hi>Heaven</hi> of Pleasures; and though the Life he <hi>wooes</hi> us to hath Joy and Bliss enough in it to compensate all the Toil and Labour of it, yet to oblige us hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, he hath made it a most <hi>certain</hi> Passage to a Life of <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmingled</hi> Bliss, that hath not the <hi>least</hi> Alloy of Misery in it: For from that most <hi>blissful</hi> Region all <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Sorrow, Trouble</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> are ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>for evermore.</hi> There are no <hi>Winter-Frosts</hi> of Grief to <hi>nip</hi> or <hi>blast</hi> its <hi>everlasting Spring</hi> of Joy; no <hi>Clouds</hi> to <hi>darken</hi> or <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cast</hi> its <hi>Light</hi>; but we shall <hi>know</hi> without <hi>Mistake, love</hi> without <hi>Jealousie, obey</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reluctancy, <hi>praise</hi> without Complaint or Murmuring, and <hi>rejoice for ever</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sighing or Disturbance.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:59595:161"/>
doth not so wholly take up our Lives, as to admit of no Interruptions; for besides that it not only permits, but requires us to mind our <hi>secular</hi> Business and Affairs; and is so far from interfering with the Work of our Callings, that it promotes and furthers it; it doth not so wholly <hi>ingross</hi> our Time, as not to allow us a <hi>sufficient</hi> Season for our <hi>Rest</hi> and <hi>Recreation</hi>; so that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all that it includes or requires, without breaking of a <hi>Nights</hi> Rest, or abridging our selves a <hi>Meals Meat,</hi> or retrenching from our <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Diversions,</hi> any further than <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> requires; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently abstracted from the Work of our Callings; which though it be included in this Condition, yet even our <hi>temporal</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest obliges us to follow, 'tis by so much the <hi>smallest</hi> Portion of our Lives which we are obliged to spend in the Exercise of our <hi>Religion.</hi> And if we would make but <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate</hi> Retrenchments from that Time we spend either in doing <hi>nothing,</hi> or nothing to the Purpose; and together with <hi>that</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieve those <hi>precious</hi> Moments we squander away in serving and pampering of <hi>our</hi> Lusts; we might serve <hi>God</hi> faithfully every Day, and yet have as much Time remaining to do our Business, and enjoy our Pleasures as now: We might every Morning say our
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:59595:161"/>
Prayers, renew our Resolutions, and arm our selves with Considerations against the Temptations of the <hi>Day</hi>; and every <hi>Night</hi> review the Actions of the <hi>Day, confess</hi> and <hi>lament</hi> the Defects of them, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our selves to God's Grace and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the <hi>future</hi>; and when all this is done, have as much Time as ever we had before to mind our Affairs, and divert our selves. Nay, so far would this be from any ways hindring our <hi>Business</hi> or <hi>Diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that the <hi>sweet</hi> Sense of having done our Duty, would make us much more <hi>chearful</hi> in the <hi>one,</hi> and give us a far <hi>sweeter</hi> Relish of the <hi>other.</hi> So far is <hi>Religion</hi> from insla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us to an <hi>uninterrupted</hi> Toil and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that it doth not only allow us all the Intermissions that our <hi>secular</hi> Business, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and Pleasure requires; but also sweetens them to us, and renders them much more <hi>grateful.</hi> But as for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which <hi>Religion</hi> draws after it, <hi>that</hi> excludes all Intermissions of Happiness. For in that most <hi>blissful</hi> State our Life will be all but one <hi>continued</hi> Act of Joy, and to <hi>eternal</hi> Ages there shall not be one <hi>Moment</hi> wherein we shall either be <hi>sensible</hi> of Pain, or <hi>insensible</hi> of Pleasure and Happiness. For as our Happiness will always abound with <hi>fresh</hi> Pleasures, so our Faculties will <hi>never</hi>
               <pb n="316" facs="tcp:59595:162"/>
be cloyed with the Enjoyment of them; for those Pleasures being <hi>pure, rational,</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> will be so far from spending and weakning our Powers, that they will every Moment strengthen and improve them. So that whereas our Pleasures <hi>here</hi> consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a <hi>vehement</hi> Motion, are very <hi>transient,</hi> and quickly slip away, and we must <hi>rest</hi> a while before we can renew them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the Motion again; those <hi>heavenly</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are such as will indeed most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently affect and move, but <hi>never</hi> weary the Faculties of the Enjoyer. For still the more we <hi>know</hi> the more we shall <hi>love</hi>; and the more we <hi>love,</hi> the more we shall <hi>rejoice</hi>; and the more we <hi>rejoice,</hi> the more we shall <hi>know</hi> and <hi>love:</hi> And so in this <hi>sweet</hi> but <hi>endless</hi> Circle, we shall move round <hi>for ever</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Weariness, and be so far from spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Vigour, that every <hi>Moment</hi> of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> we shall improve it by Exercise and Motion. So that as our Happiness will always abound with <hi>new</hi> Pleasures without any Discontinuance or Intermission, so our Faculties will always renew their Strength and Vigour by Enjoyment. And as there will be no Pause between <hi>one</hi> Joy and <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> but they will come so thick upon us <hi>for ever,</hi> that the <hi>Follower</hi> will always tread on the <hi>Foregoers</hi> Heels; so <hi>one</hi> will still

So that whether you consider this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>absolutely,</hi> and in its self, or <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively</hi> with the Condition whereunto it is annexed, you see it is a most <hi>glorious</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God's <hi>unspeakable</hi> Goodness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us: And now I shall conclude this Argument with a few <hi>practical</hi> Inferences from the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I infer how much Reason we have to be contented and satisfied under all the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> Afflictions of <hi>this</hi> Life. For shall we receive so much <hi>good</hi> at the Hands of <hi>God</hi> as
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:59595:163"/>
               <hi>Everlasting Life</hi> implies, and not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to receive some <hi>Evil,</hi> when our <hi>good</hi> Father hath provided for us a Crown of <hi>endless</hi> Bliss and Glory <hi>hereafter?</hi> With what Conscience or Modesty can we complain of those <hi>little paternal</hi> Castigations he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts on us here? especially considering that the <hi>great</hi> Design of all his <hi>present</hi> Severities is to prepare and discipline us for that <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> State; that by all these <hi>dismal</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences he is only training us up for a <hi>Crown</hi>; fitting, instructing and disposing us to reign with him in Glory <hi>for ever?</hi> Can any Thing be <hi>unwelcom</hi> to us that is in Order to so <hi>blessed</hi> an End? Can any <hi>Physick</hi> be <hi>nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> or <hi>distastful</hi> that is prescribed to recover us into such an <hi>happy</hi> Immortality? No doubtless; every Thing that leads <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> though never so <hi>grievous,</hi> is a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and all those <hi>kind</hi> Severities that tend to our <hi>eternal</hi> Welfare, are Favours for which we are bound to <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> the Goodness of <hi>Heaven for ever.</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find our selves inclined to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain under our <hi>present</hi> Pressures and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, let us lift up our Eyes to <hi>yonder blessed Regions,</hi> and consider the <hi>Joys</hi> and <hi>Pleasures,</hi> the <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Triumphs</hi> that do there await us; and how <hi>necessary</hi> these <hi>bitter</hi> Trials are to prepare us for, and wast
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:59595:163"/>
us to them: And if this doth not <hi>stop</hi> our Mouths, and silence our Complaints <hi>for ever</hi>; nay, if it doth not cause us to rejoice in our Tribulations, and to thank <hi>God</hi> for them on our <hi>bendid</hi> Knees; if it doth not make us chearfully submit and say, <hi>Vre, Seca, Vulnera, Lord! cut, or wound, or burn me; if thou seest fit, strip me of all my dearest Comforts; handle me as severely as thou pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, so I have my Fruit unto Holiness, and my end everlasting Life</hi>; we are infinitely <hi>fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> and <hi>ungrateful.</hi> For 'tis but a <hi>little</hi> while e're all these <hi>Storms</hi> will clear up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an <hi>everlasting</hi> Calm; e're all these <hi>dismal</hi> Clouds will vanish, and an <hi>everlasting</hi> Day break forth upon us, whose Brightness shall never be obscured with the <hi>least</hi> Spot or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique of Darkness. And when that <hi>blessed</hi> Time comes, <hi>Lord!</hi> how <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable</hi> will all our <hi>present</hi> Griefs appear? With what Contempt shall we reflect upon our <hi>present</hi> Cowardise and meanness of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that would not bear without Murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a <hi>few</hi> Inconveniences on the Road to such an <hi>immortal Heaven</hi> of Pleasure? Wherefore if our Voyage be not so <hi>pleasant</hi> as we would have it, yet let us remember 'tis not <hi>long</hi>; we have but a <hi>short</hi> Days Sail to an <hi>Eternity</hi> of Happiness; and when once we are landed on that <hi>blessed</hi> Shore,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:59595:164"/>
with what <hi>ravishing</hi> Content and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall we look back on the <hi>rough</hi> and <hi>boisterous</hi> Seas we have past, and for ever <hi>bless</hi> the Storms and Winds that drave us to that <hi>happy</hi> Port! Then will the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of these <hi>light</hi> Afflictions serve only as a <hi>Toil</hi> and <hi>Anti-mask</hi> to our Happiness, to set <hi>off</hi> its Joys, and render them more <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>ravishing.</hi> Let us therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our selves with these Things; and when at any Time our Spirits are sinking under any <hi>worldly</hi> Trouble or Affliction, consider that while we have a <hi>Heaven</hi> to hope for, we can never be <hi>miserable</hi>; for so long as we are guarded with this <hi>mighty</hi> Hope, our Mind will be <hi>impregnable</hi> against all <hi>foreign</hi> Events, and maugre all Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from without, its Serenity will shine as undisturbedly as the Lights of <hi>Pharos</hi> in the midst of Storms and Tempests.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Hence I infer, what a <hi>vast deal</hi> of Reason we have to slight and contemn <hi>this</hi> World. For it is plain, that we are born to infinitely <hi>greater</hi> Hopes than any <hi>this</hi> World can propose to us, even to the Hopes of <hi>everlasting</hi> Life: And being so, methinks our Ambition should soar as <hi>high</hi> as our Hopes, and disdain such <hi>low</hi> and <hi>ignoble Quarries,</hi> as the <hi>Pleasures,</hi> and <hi>Profits,</hi> and <hi>Honours</hi> of this Life. Certainly Sirs, we
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:59595:164"/>
mistake the Scene of our <hi>Eternity,</hi> or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that it is removed from <hi>Heaven</hi> to <hi>Earth</hi>; and so we are to enjoy our <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi> Life below; or else we are most strangely <hi>besotted,</hi> who when we are born to live <hi>for ever above</hi> in the most <hi>ravishing</hi> Glory and Happiness, can suffer our selves to doat upon <hi>this</hi> World, and to be so strangely <hi>bewitched</hi> as we are by its <hi>deluding</hi> Vanities. O! could we but stand a while in the <hi>Mid-way</hi> between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and at one Prospect see the Glories of <hi>both,</hi> how <hi>faint</hi> and <hi>dim</hi> would all the Splendors of <hi>this</hi> World appear to us in Comparison with those above? How would they <hi>sneak</hi> and <hi>disappear</hi> in the Presence of that <hi>eternal</hi> Brightness, and be forced to shroud their <hi>vanquished</hi> Glories, as <hi>Stars</hi> do when the <hi>Sun</hi> appears? And whilst we interchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably turned our Eyes from <hi>one</hi> to <hi>t'other,</hi> with what Shame and Confusion should we reflect upon the wretched <hi>groveling</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of <hi>our own</hi> Minds? what <hi>poor mean-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited</hi> Creatures we are to satisfy our selves with the <hi>impertinent</hi> Trifles of <hi>this</hi> World, when we have all the Joys of an <hi>everlasting Heaven</hi> before us, and may, if we please, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a <hi>few</hi> Moments Obedience be admitted into them, and enjoy them <hi>for evermore?</hi> Ah! <hi>foolish Creatures that we are,</hi> thus to
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:59595:165"/>
prefer a <hi>far</hi> Countrey, where we live on nothing but Husks, before an <hi>everlasting Festivity,</hi> that is celebrated in our Father's House! where the <hi>meanest</hi> Creature hath Bread enough, and to spare: To chuse <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi>'s Fate, and leave <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters,</hi> and live among the <hi>salvage</hi> Herds of the Wilderness! Could the <hi>blessed Saints</hi> above divert so much from their more <hi>happy</hi> Employments, as to look down a <hi>little</hi> from their Thrones of Glory, and see how busy <hi>poor</hi> Mortals are in scrambling for this <hi>wretched</hi> Pelf, which within a <hi>few</hi> Moments they must leave <hi>for ever</hi>; how they <hi>jostle,</hi> and <hi>rencounter, defeat, defraud,</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine one another</hi>; what a most <hi>ridiculous</hi> Spectacle would it appear to them? with what Scorn would they look on it; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with what Pity, to see a Company of <hi>heaven-born</hi> Souls, capable of, and designed for the same Glory and Happiness with themselves, groveling like <hi>Swine</hi> in Dirt and Mire; <hi>one</hi> priding it self in a <hi>gay</hi> Suit, <hi>a nother</hi> hugging a Bag of <hi>glistering</hi> Earth, a <hi>third</hi> stewing and dissolving it self in Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury and Voluptuousness, and all imployed at that <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>mean,</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi> Rate, as might justly make these <hi>blessed</hi> Spirits asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to own their Kindred and Alliance? To tell you truly and seriously my Thoughts,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:59595:165"/>
I cannot imagine, but if when we are thus extravagantly concerned about the pitiful Trifles of <hi>this</hi> World, the <hi>blessed</hi> Spirits do see and converse with us, it is a much more <hi>ludicrous</hi> and <hi>ridiculous</hi> Sight in their Eyes, to see us thus sillily concerned and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than it would be in us to see a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Boys with <hi>mighty</hi> Zeal and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <hi>wrangling</hi> and <hi>crying, striving</hi> and <hi>scrambling</hi> for a Bag of <hi>Cherry-stones.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> Sirs, let us not expose our selves any longer to the <hi>just</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision of all the World, by our <hi>excessive</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage upon the <hi>trifling</hi> Vanities of <hi>this</hi> Life; but let us seriously consider that we are all concerned in Matters of much <hi>higher</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, even in the <hi>unspeakable</hi> Felicity of an <hi>everlasting</hi> Life.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Hence I infer how <hi>unreasonable</hi> it is for <hi>good</hi> Men to be afraid of <hi>Dying,</hi> since just on <hi>t'other</hi> side the Grave you see there is a State of <hi>endless</hi> Bliss and Happiness prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to receive and entertain them; so that to them <hi>Death</hi> is but a <hi>dark</hi> Entry out of a <hi>Wilderness</hi> of Sorrow into a <hi>Paradise</hi> of <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Pleasure. And therefore if it be an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable</hi> Thing for <hi>sick Men</hi> to dread their <hi>Recovery,</hi> for <hi>Slaves</hi> to tremble at their <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee,</hi> or for <hi>Prisoners</hi> to quake at the News of a <hi>Goal-delivery</hi>; how much more <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi>
               <pb n="324" facs="tcp:59595:166"/>
is it for <hi>good</hi> Men to be afraid of <hi>Death,</hi> which is but a <hi>momentary</hi> Passage from <hi>Sickness, Labour,</hi> and <hi>Confinement</hi> to <hi>eternal Health,</hi> and <hi>Rest,</hi> and <hi>Liberty?</hi> For God's sake consider, Sirs, what is there in <hi>this</hi> World that you have Reason to be fond of, what in the <hi>other</hi> that you need be afraid of? Suppose that now your Souls were on the <hi>Wing</hi> mounting upwards to the <hi>celestial Abodes,</hi> and that at some <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> Stand between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> from whence you might take a Prospect of both, you were now making a Pause to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey and compare them with <hi>one another</hi>; that having viewed over all the Glories <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> and tasted the <hi>beatifical</hi> Joys, and heard the <hi>ravishing</hi> Melodies of <hi>Angels,</hi> you were now looking down again with your Minds <hi>filled</hi> with these <hi>glorious</hi> Ideas, upon this <hi>miserable</hi> World, and that all in a View you beheld the <hi>vast</hi> Numbers of Men and Women that at this Time are <hi>fainting</hi> for Want of Bread, of <hi>young Men</hi> that are hewn down by the Sword of <hi>War,</hi> of <hi>Orphans</hi> that are weeping over their Fathers Graves, of <hi>Mariners</hi> that are shrieking in a Storm, because their <hi>Keel</hi> dashes against a Rock, or bulges under them; of <hi>People</hi> that are groaning upon <hi>Sick-Beds,</hi> or racked with Agonies of Conscience; that are <hi>weeping</hi>
               <pb n="325" facs="tcp:59595:166"/>
with Want, <hi>mad</hi> with Oppression, or <hi>des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi> by <hi>too quick</hi> a Sense of a <hi>constant</hi> Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity: Would you not, do you think, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on such a Review of <hi>both</hi> States be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glad that you are gone from hence, that you are out of the Noise and Participation of so many Evils and Calamities? Would not the sight of the Glories <hi>above</hi> and the Miseries <hi>beneath</hi> you make you a <hi>Thousand</hi> Times more <hi>fearful</hi> of returning <hi>hither</hi> than ever you were of going <hi>hence?</hi> Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it would. Why then should not our Sense of the Misery <hi>here,</hi> and our Belief of the Happiness <hi>there,</hi> produce the <hi>same</hi> Effect in us, make us willing to remove our Quarters, and exchange <hi>this Wilderness</hi> for <hi>that Canaan?</hi> 'Tis true indeed, the Passage from <hi>one</hi> to <hi>t'other</hi> is commonly very <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>grievous</hi>; but what of that? In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cases we are willing enough to endure a <hi>present</hi> Pain in order to a <hi>future</hi> Ease; and if a <hi>few mortal</hi> Pangs will work a <hi>perfect</hi> Cure on me, and recover me into <hi>everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Bliss and Life, methinks the Hope of this <hi>blessed</hi> Effect should be sufficient to sweeten and indear <hi>that</hi> Agony, and render it <hi>easy</hi> and <hi>desirable.</hi> But alass! To <hi>die</hi> is to leave all our Acquaintance, to bid <hi>adieu</hi> to our <hi>dearest</hi> Friends and Relations, to pass into an <hi>unknown</hi> State, to converse with
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:59595:167"/>
Strangers whose Laws and Customs we are not acquainted with; why now all that looks <hi>sad</hi> in this is a very <hi>great</hi> mistake; for I verily hope that I have more Friends and Acquaintance and Relatives in <hi>Heaven</hi> than I shall leave behind me here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and if so, I do but go from <hi>worse</hi> Friends to <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>; for <hi>one</hi> Friend <hi>there</hi> is worth a <hi>Thousand here</hi> in Respect of all those <hi>endearing</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments that render a Friend a Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. But if I die a <hi>good Man</hi> I shall carry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eternity</hi> with me the <hi>Genius</hi> and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of a <hi>glorified</hi> Spirit, and that will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me to the Society of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and render the Spirits of those <hi>just Men,</hi> whose Names I never heard of, as <hi>dear</hi> Friends to me in an Instant as if they had been my <hi>ancient Cronies</hi> and Acquaintance. But why should I grieve at parting with my Friends <hi>below,</hi> when I shall go to the <hi>best</hi> Friend I have in all the World; to <hi>God my Father,</hi> to <hi>Jesus my Redeemer,</hi> and to the <hi>Holy Ghost my constant Comforter and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</hi> And what though the State and the Laws and Customs of it be in a <hi>great</hi> Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure unknown to me? Yet what I know is infinitely <hi>desirable,</hi> from whence I may reasonably infer that what I know not is so <hi>too</hi>; and if I have but the Temper of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> I am sure I shall easily comply with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:59595:167"/>
the <hi>heavenly</hi> Laws and Customs of it. So that in the whole, I cannont imagine why any <hi>good Man</hi> that seriously believes the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a <hi>blessed Immortality,</hi> and hath a <hi>just well-grounded</hi> Hope of being made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of it at the Expiration of this <hi>mortal</hi> Life, should be so loath to leave <hi>this wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed World,</hi> and expire into <hi>that blessed Eternity.</hi> I do not deny, but the Circumstances of our Affairs in this Life are many times such as may justly excuse even a <hi>good</hi> Mans Willingness to die; some <hi>great</hi> Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing <hi>Good</hi> may present themselves, and invite him to stay a <hi>little longer</hi>; or his having begun his Repentance <hi>late,</hi> or not having made a <hi>competent</hi> Provision for his Family may for a Time justify his Unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness to depart; and render it both <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable</hi> and <hi>reasonable.</hi> But unless it be in these <hi>excepted</hi> Cases, methinks I can hardly reconcile our <hi>Hopes</hi> of Happiness with our <hi>Fear</hi> of Death. For when I am verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded that <hi>Death</hi> is only a <hi>narrow</hi> Stream running between <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> and I see my <hi>God</hi> and my <hi>Saviour</hi> with Crowns of Glory in their Hands beckoning to me from the <hi>farther</hi> Shoar, and calling to me to come over and receive those <hi>happy</hi> Recompences of my Industry and Labour, that I like a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked timorous</hi> Boy should stand shivering on
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:59595:168"/>
this <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> as if I were afraid to dip my Foot in that <hi>cold</hi> Stream of <hi>Fate,</hi> which as soon as I am in I am past, and in the Twinkling of an Eye will land me on <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Bliss, is such an <hi>extravagant</hi> Inconsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as (if I did not feel it in me) I should never believe I could be guilty of.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly, Hence I infer what a <hi>vast deal</hi> of Reason we have to be <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>industrious</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> since <hi>God</hi> hath proposed such a <hi>vast</hi> Reward to us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and animate our Industry. How can we account any Work hard, of which <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Wages? How can we faint in our <hi>Christian</hi> Race when we see the Crown of Glory hanging over the Goal? Methinks this should be enough to infuse Life and Spirit into the most <hi>crest-fallen</hi> Souls, to make <hi>Cripples</hi> run, and to convert the most <hi>sneaking</hi> Coward into a <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>magnanimous</hi> Hero. For how much Pains do we ordinarily take upon far <hi>less</hi> Hopes? in Hope of a <hi>little transitory</hi> Wealth which we know we shall enjoy but a <hi>few</hi> years, and then part with <hi>for ever,</hi> we thrust our selves into a <hi>perpetual</hi> Croud and Tumult of Business, where with <hi>vast</hi> Concern and Thoughtfulness, with <hi>eager</hi> and <hi>passionate</hi> Prosecutions, with <hi>endless</hi> Brauls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, with <hi>jostling</hi> and <hi>rencountring one
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:59595:168"/>
another,</hi> we toil and weary our selves, and make our Lives a <hi>constant</hi> Drudgery: And shall we flag when <hi>Heaven</hi> is the Object of our Prosecutions, who are so <hi>active</hi> in the Pursuit of Trifles? Whensoever therefore we find our Endeavours in <hi>Religion</hi> begin to <hi>jade</hi> and <hi>droop,</hi> let us lift up our Eyes to the Crown of <hi>Glory,</hi> and if we are capable of being moved by Objects of the <hi>greatest</hi> Value, <hi>that</hi> must infuse <hi>new</hi> Vigour into us, and make us all <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Wing.</hi> For what though my Way lies <hi>up</hi> the Hill, and leads me along through Thorns and Precipices; so that I am fain to sweat at every Step; and every Ascent is a Toil to me: Yet when I am <hi>up,</hi> I am sure to be entertained with such <hi>pleasant Gales</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Prospects, as will fully recompence all my Toil in climbing thither. There with an <hi>over-joyed</hi> Heart I shall sit down and <hi>bless</hi> my Labours: Blessed be you my <hi>bitter</hi> Agonies and <hi>sharp</hi> Conflicts, my <hi>importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> Prayers, and <hi>well-spent</hi> Tears; for now I am fully repaid for you all, and do reap <hi>ten thousand</hi> Times more Joys from you than ever I endured Pains. For what are the Pains of a <hi>Moment</hi> to the Pleasures of an <hi>Eternity?</hi> Wherefore hold out my <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> yet a little longer, and your Work will soon be at an end; and after a
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:59595:169"/>
               <hi>few laborious Week-days,</hi> you shall keep an <hi>everlasting Sabbath.</hi> What though my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age lie through a <hi>stormy</hi> Sea, yet 'tis to the <hi>Indies</hi> of Happiness; and a <hi>few</hi> Leagues far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lies the <hi>blessed</hi> Port, where I shall be crowned as soon as I am landed. Go on therefore, <hi>O my Soul,</hi> with thy <hi>utmost</hi> Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Alacrity; for let the Winds <hi>bluster,</hi> and the Waves <hi>swell</hi> never so much, yet thou canst not miscarry, unless thou wilt. Thou art not like <hi>other</hi> Passengers left to the Mercy of Wind and Weather, but thy Fate is in thy <hi>own</hi> Hands; and if thou wilt but have <hi>thy Fruit unto Holiness, thy End shall be everlasting Life.</hi>

For in the <hi>former</hi> Verses the <hi>Apostle</hi> earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:59595:170"/>
presses <hi>Christians</hi> to love <hi>one another</hi> upon the Consideration of God's <hi>great</hi> love to them; and then considering how naturally their Love to <hi>one another,</hi> would follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>mutual</hi> Love to <hi>God,</hi> he concludes, that the most <hi>effectual Course</hi> to oblige them to love <hi>one another,</hi> was to excite them to the Love of <hi>God</hi> upon the Consideration of his <hi>great</hi> Love to them. For saith he, Vers. 20. <hi>If a Man say, I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a liar</hi>; because Light it self is not more <hi>inseparable</hi> to the Sun than <hi>Brotherly-Love</hi> is to the Love of <hi>God</hi>: So that unless we render <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. The Love of <hi>God</hi> consists in Delight and Complacency. And indeed this is the <hi>proper</hi> Act of Love, as it is distinguished from all other Passions. For we find by experience, that the <hi>first</hi> Act of our Minds upon the Apprehension of a <hi>lovely</hi> Object, is Delight and Complacency in the View or Contemplation of it; and when any <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> Object presents it self to our Sense, or to our Minds, or Fancies, it causes our Thoughts to <hi>pause</hi> and <hi>stay</hi> themselves a while upon it till we have viewed it round about, and drawn its Picture in our Minds, and when we have done, the very <hi>first</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of our Love to it, is to be <hi>well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the Contemplation of it; and while we review it <hi>over</hi> and <hi>over,</hi> to be sweetly <hi>ravished</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> with the <hi>charming</hi> Prospect of its Beauty. And from this <hi>prime</hi> and <hi>essential</hi> Act of Love arises all those <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent</hi> Affections of <hi>Hope, Benevolence,</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> of Fruition: For the reason why we <hi>wish</hi> well to, <hi>hope</hi> for, or <hi>desire</hi> to enjoy any
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:59595:171"/>
Object, is because we are <hi>well-pleased</hi> with it, and do find a <hi>sweet</hi> Content and Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that Picture or <hi>Idea</hi> of it which we have drawn upon <hi>our own</hi> Minds. So that the very Essence of Love, you see, consists in a <hi>Well-pleasedness</hi> arising from the <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended</hi> Goodness and Congruity of the Thing <hi>beloved</hi>; and 'tis meerly by Accident that there is <hi>any other</hi> Emotion intermingled with this <hi>grateful</hi> Affection. For if it were not for the Want of what we love, if there were no Distance between <hi>us</hi> and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of our Affection, our Love would be all but one <hi>pure continued</hi> Act of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Delight; for if all our Needs were fully satisfied, we should love without either <hi>Desire</hi> or <hi>Hope,</hi> both which imply Want and Absence from the Objects of our Love; which is a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence, that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency is the very Essence of Love, since there may be Love without <hi>Hope,</hi> or <hi>Desire,</hi> or <hi>any other</hi> Passion mingled with it; but without Complacency there can be none. 'Tis true, the Degrees of Love's Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies are much <hi>greater</hi> in the Fruition of its Objects, than they are in the Pursuit of them, but still 'tis of the <hi>same</hi> Kind; for 'tis the Delight we take in an Object that makes us desire to enjoy it; but in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment our Desire expires into an <hi>higher</hi>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:59595:172"/>
Degree of Delight and Satisfaction. For Desire and Delight are only the <hi>Wings</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> of Love, <hi>those</hi> for Pursuits, and <hi>these</hi> for Embraces; but 'tis the <hi>Arms</hi> that give the <hi>Wings</hi> both Motion and Rest, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light we take in the Objects of our Love, that both <hi>inflames</hi> and <hi>quenches</hi> our Desire. So that though in this <hi>indigent</hi> State <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Desire</hi> are <hi>inseparable</hi> to our Love, yet that is by Accident; but as for its Essence and Definition it wholly consists of <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency.</hi> And therefore if our Love of <hi>God</hi> hath the <hi>common</hi> Notion of Love in it, as questionless it hath, it must necessarily consist in our being <hi>well-pleased</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> in the Beauty, and Goodness, and Perfection of his Nature. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we find in <hi>Scripture</hi> that our Love to <hi>God</hi> and God's Love to us is expressed by delighting in <hi>one another</hi>; so Prov. iii.12. <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth, even as a Father the Son in whom he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> i. e. whom he loves. So also our Love to God is expressed by delighting in him, Psal. xxxvii.4. <hi>Delight thy self also in the Lord; and he shall give thee the desires of thine Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> The Love of <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>rational</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Complacency in him; by which it is distinguished from those <hi>sensible</hi> Emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:59595:172"/>
of <hi>bodily</hi> Passion which many times are nothing else put the <hi>natural</hi> Effects of an <hi>over-heated</hi> Fancy. For I make no doubt but a Man may be wrapt even into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasy of <hi>sensible</hi> Delight and Complacency in <hi>God</hi>; that is, upon an <hi>amiable</hi> Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>God,</hi> his Spirits may be made to flow in a <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>placid</hi> Torrent to his Heart, and by their <hi>nimble</hi> Motions about it to <hi>sooth</hi> and <hi>tickle</hi> it into a most <hi>sensible</hi> Pleasure, till it opens and dilates its Orifices, and the <hi>grateful</hi> Flood breaks in and drowns it in Delight and Ravishment. And yet in all this <hi>mighty</hi> Storm and Commotion of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion there may not be the <hi>least</hi> Spark of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Love to <hi>God</hi>; For all this not only may be, but many times is nothing else but the mere <hi>Mechanism</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi> Effect of a <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Fancy, which being flushed with such <hi>brisk</hi> and <hi>active</hi> Spirits as are most apt to be figured into <hi>amorous Phantasms</hi> and <hi>Ideas,</hi> can with these with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Assistance from Reason raise great Commotions of Joy in the Heart; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally where the Temper is <hi>soft,</hi> and the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions <hi>easie</hi> to be wrought upon. And of the Truth of this the <hi>Histories</hi> of the <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos</hi> of all <hi>Religions</hi> will furnish us with <hi>sufficient</hi> Experiments. For even among the <hi>Turkish</hi> and <hi>Heathen Saints</hi> there are as
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:59595:173"/>
               <hi>notorious</hi> Instances of these <hi>sweet</hi> Incomes and Manifestations, as among <hi>our own</hi>; and the same <hi>sensitive</hi> Complacencies which ours <hi>too</hi> often mistake for the <hi>Sealings</hi> and <hi>Witness</hi> of the Spirit, they frequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in their Communion with <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, Bacchus,</hi> and <hi>Apollo.</hi> So that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we love <hi>God</hi> from those <hi>corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Passions, is very <hi>unsafe</hi> and <hi>dangerous</hi>; and we may almost as certainly judge of the Hunger of our <hi>Souls</hi> after Righteousness by the Hunger of our <hi>Bodies</hi> after Bread, as of the Love of our Souls to <hi>God</hi> by our <hi>bodily</hi> Ravishments and Passions. For <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi> Passion differs according to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Body; <hi>some</hi> Tempers are so <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>impressive,</hi> that the most <hi>frivolous</hi> Fancy will affect them; <hi>others</hi> so <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>sturdy,</hi> that the <hi>greatest</hi> Reason will hardly move them; and consequently Persons of <hi>this</hi> Temper, though they should love <hi>God</hi> much <hi>more</hi> than the <hi>other,</hi> and have a much <hi>higher</hi> Esteem of, and more <hi>rational</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency in his <hi>divine</hi> Perfections; yet will have much <hi>less</hi> of <hi>corporeal</hi> Passion inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with it. I do not deny, but even this <hi>sensitive</hi> Passion, when prudently man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, may be of <hi>great</hi> Advantage to a <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> Love; for the Passions being <hi>soft</hi> and <hi>easie,</hi> and apt to follow the Motions of the
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:59595:173"/>
Soul, do naturally <hi>intend</hi> and <hi>quicken</hi> them, and render them more <hi>vigorous</hi> and <hi>active</hi>; and we have very much Cause to <hi>bless God</hi> even for that <hi>sensitive</hi> Joy and Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which accompanies our Love to him, since this, I doubt not, is many times ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by his own <hi>blessed Spirit,</hi> to <hi>quicken</hi> and <hi>invigorate</hi> our <hi>rational</hi> Affection, and render it more <hi>active</hi> and <hi>vivacious.</hi> But that which I aim at is only this, if possible to beat Men <hi>off</hi> from measuring the <hi>Strength</hi> or <hi>Weakness,</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Falshood</hi> of their Love to <hi>God</hi> by any <hi>corporeal</hi> Passion what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; since Men may, we see, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times have a <hi>vehement</hi> Passion without any Reason, and all those <hi>Ticklings</hi> and <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishments</hi> of Heart which <hi>too</hi> many Men mistake for the Love of <hi>God,</hi> are very often nothing else but the <hi>necessary</hi> Effects of a <hi>chafed</hi> and <hi>overheated</hi> Fancy. But that which is really the Love of <hi>God</hi> is always founded in a <hi>rational</hi> Conviction of the Beauty and Goodness of his Nature, and proceeds from an <hi>high</hi> Esteem and <hi>profound</hi> Veneration of his Perfections. For no Man loves <hi>God,</hi> but can give very <hi>good</hi> Reason why he loves him; he is not moved to it by a <hi>Musical Tone,</hi> or a <hi>gaudy Metaphor,</hi> or an <hi>unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Impulse</hi> of Fancy; but by the <hi>real</hi> Charms and Attractions of the <hi>divine</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:59595:174"/>
and Perfections, which darting <hi>through</hi> his Mind, like the Sun-beams through a <hi>Burning-glass,</hi> have kindled his Affections, and made him love with <hi>infinite</hi> Reason; so that 'tis his <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> that <hi>inamours</hi> his <hi>Will,</hi> and that which makes him a Lover of <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>deep</hi> Sense of his Reason, how much he deserves to be beloved. He hath seriously considered how lovely <hi>God</hi> is in himself, how <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> unto all his Creation, and what <hi>particular</hi> Obligation <hi>God</hi> hath laid upon him to return him Love for Love; and this gives Fire to his Love, and affects his Will with Delight and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency; and though perhaps he may not feel those <hi>passionate</hi> Soothings and Expansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heart which <hi>sensitive</hi> Joy is wont to produce, yet he finds himself highly pleased with <hi>God,</hi> and his Will acquiesces in the Thought of his Goodness and Perfections with a <hi>Calm</hi> and <hi>even</hi> Complacency: And thus his Will is inflamed with the <hi>purest</hi> Light of his Understanding, and his Love is nothing else but the <hi>warm</hi> Reflection of his Reason. Thus Psal. cxvi.1. <hi>I love the Lord,</hi> saith <hi>David,</hi> and then he goes on to enumerate the <hi>vast</hi> and <hi>important</hi> Reasons why he loved him; <hi>because he hath inclined his Ear,</hi> &amp;c. And in the 1 Cor. viii.3. <hi>If any Man love God, the same,</hi> i. e. God, <hi>is
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:59595:174"/>
known of him</hi>; intimating that all <hi>true</hi> Love of <hi>God</hi> is founded in the Knowledge of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The Love of <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>fixed</hi> as well as <hi>rational</hi> Complacency in him, by which I distinguish this <hi>heavenly</hi> Affection from those <hi>short</hi> and <hi>transitory</hi> Fits of Love, that like Flashes of Lightning <hi>come</hi> and <hi>go, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi> and <hi>vanish</hi> in a Moment. For thus up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some <hi>affecting</hi> Providence, or <hi>passionate</hi> Representation of the <hi>Divine</hi> Goodness, it is very ordinary for Men to be chafed into an <hi>amorous</hi> Fit, and touched with very <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> Resentments of the Loveliness and Love of <hi>God</hi>; so that at <hi>present</hi> they seem to be in Raptures of Affection, and, with the <hi>Spouse in the Canticles, to be wondrous sick of Love</hi>; but alas! It commonly proves but a <hi>sudden</hi> Qualm, that after a Pang or <hi>two</hi> goes over, and so they are well again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately; for upon their <hi>next</hi> Encounter with Temptation, or Intermixture with <hi>secular</hi> Affairs, their <hi>hot</hi> Love begins to lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, and quickly dies into a <hi>cold</hi> Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency; and notwithstanding all the Reasons and Obligations that they have to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, their <hi>fickle</hi> Hearts unwind again, and by Degrees decline and sink into their <hi>old habitual</hi> Aversation to <hi>God</hi> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; which is a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence that <hi>that</hi> which at first lookt like the Love of <hi>God</hi>
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:59595:175"/>
in them, was only a <hi>sudden</hi> Blush of Passion, and not the <hi>true</hi> Complexion of their Souls. For when once a Man is brought to love <hi>God</hi> upon Principles of Reason and Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, 'tis much more <hi>difficult</hi> to extinguish this, than any <hi>Virtue</hi> whatsoever; because of all the <hi>Virtues</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> this is founded in the <hi>greatest</hi> Reason, and accompanied with the <hi>strongest</hi> Pleasure. For Love it self consisting in <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency,</hi> where the Object of it is an <hi>infinite Good,</hi> there is not only <hi>infinite</hi> Reason to Love, but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite</hi> Occasion of Pleasure and Complacen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. When therefore our Love of <hi>God</hi> is back'd with so <hi>much</hi> Reason, and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with so <hi>much</hi> Pleasure, how is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we should extinguish it without doing the <hi>greatest</hi> Violence to our selves? For I am verily persuaded, that one of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>moral</hi> Changes that can be made upon a <hi>rational</hi> Creature, is from a <hi>Lover</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Enemy</hi> to <hi>God</hi>; for wheresoever this <hi>heavenly</hi> Affection is, it sweetens and endears it self by its own <hi>appendent</hi> Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, which are in themselves a <hi>sufficient</hi> Counter-charm against all Temptations to the contrary. So that when once it is kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in the Soul, like a <hi>subtil</hi> Flame 'twill by Degrees <hi>insinuate</hi> farther and farther, till it hath eaten into the <hi>Center</hi> of the Soul,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:59595:175"/>
and turned it all into its <hi>own</hi> Substance. Wherefore this we may certainly conclude upon, that he who can suddenly or easily entertain an Aversation to <hi>God</hi> and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, did never truly Love; <hi>for Love,</hi> saith the <hi>Wise Man,</hi> is <hi>strong as Death, and many Waters cannot quench it,</hi> Cant. viii.6, 7. Wheresoever it lights it clings, and can never be torn away again without <hi>violent</hi> Spasms and Convulsions. So that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Passion we may have for <hi>God,</hi> we can never conclude it to be <hi>hearty</hi> Love till it fixes and settles in our Souls; till our Wills are <hi>habitually</hi> pleased with <hi>God,</hi> and do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Thoughts of his Love and Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, with a <hi>constant</hi> Complacency and Delight; and then we may venture to call it Love, and to rejoyce in the Nativity of this <hi>heavenly</hi> Flame within us.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> 'Tis an <hi>affecting</hi> Delight and Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in <hi>God</hi>; by which I distinguish it from a <hi>mere</hi> Liking and <hi>naked</hi> Approbation. For <hi>God</hi> is a Being so infinitely <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent,</hi> that 'tis impossible almost for any <hi>reasonable</hi> Creature to know him, and not <hi>like,</hi> and approve of him. But though in all Approbation there is <hi>some</hi> Degree of Complacency, yet there is no Doubt but a Man may approve of what he doth not Love, and there is no Doubt but there are
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:59595:176"/>
many Men that do approve of <hi>God</hi> as the most <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> of Beings, and the most <hi>worthy</hi> of Love and Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who yet have not one Spark of <hi>real</hi> Love towards him. For thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> we find, when he was a <hi>Jew</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of the Law <hi>as holy, and just, and good,</hi> Rom. vii.12. and that in this Approbation of his there was some Degree of Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Delight, <hi>for</hi> saith he, <hi>I delight in the Law of God according to the inward Man,</hi> Vers. 22. but all this while he was very far from having any <hi>real</hi> Love and Affection for it; for in the next Verse he tells us, that he had <hi>a Law in his Members warring against the Law of his Mind</hi>; that is, he had an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> Repugnancy and Aversation against this <hi>excellent</hi> Law, which his Reason did approve of as <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>good</hi>; and no Degree of <hi>true</hi> Love could consist with such an Aversation. And there is no doubt but most Men who have <hi>right</hi> Conceptions of <hi>God,</hi> do in their Mind and Reason as much approve of, and delight in the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Nature, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did in the Perfection of his Law; and yet their Wills are as <hi>repugnant</hi> and <hi>averse</hi> to the Holiness and Purity of the <hi>one,</hi> as St. <hi>Pauls</hi> then was to the Justice and Goodness of the <hi>other.</hi> Wherefore to constitute us <hi>true</hi> Lovers of

               <hi>God,</hi> it is <hi>necessary</hi> that our <hi>Approbation</hi> of, and <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Complacency</hi> in him should be such as doth powerfully affect our Wills and reconcile them to the Nature of <hi>God.</hi> For whilst our Wills are <hi>averse</hi> to that <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate</hi> Purity and Goodness which is so <hi>inseparable</hi> to his Nature, it is impossible we should heartily love him; and though in our Minds we may approve of him as a most <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>excellent</hi> Being, yet in our Hearts we shall still retain a <hi>secret</hi> Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy against him. And I doubt not but the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves do so far approve of <hi>God,</hi> as to acknowledge him altogether <hi>amiable</hi> and <hi>lovely</hi>; for if they do not, I am sure they are very <hi>shallow</hi> Spectators; but yet we see this Approbation of theirs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with an <hi>inveterate</hi> Rancour and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against him. And till our Wills are so <hi>affected</hi> by our Reason as to consent and <hi>eccho</hi> to its Approbations, to take Compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in that <hi>divine</hi> Purity which our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son acknowledges to be the Crown and Ornament of <hi>God</hi>; whilst we reverence him in our Minds, we hate and despise him in our Affections. So that he only is a Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>God,</hi> whose Will is reconciled to <hi>true</hi> Goodness.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly, This Love must be terminated on the <hi>proper</hi> Goodness and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:59595:177"/>
of <hi>God</hi>; and hereby I distinguish it from that Love which we <hi>too</hi> commonly terminate upon a <hi>God</hi> of <hi>our own</hi> making. For it is very ordinary with Men to set up <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>false</hi> Representations of <hi>God</hi> in their Minds, and then fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship them: And it is no <hi>great</hi> Wonder if they are extreamly fond of these <hi>Idol-Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi> of their own making, since common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are nothing else but the Pictures and Images of themselves. <hi>Thou thoughtst,</hi> saith God to those profligate Persons, <hi>that I was such a one as thy self,</hi> Psal. l.21. Men have always been prone to cast all their <hi>Ideas</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Mould of their <hi>own</hi> Tempers, and to fashion the <hi>Divinity</hi> whom they Worship, according to the Model of their <hi>own</hi> Inclinations. Thus Men of <hi>ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>imperious</hi> Tempers are apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present <hi>God</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> Likeness, a Being that governs <hi>himself</hi> and <hi>others</hi> by a meer <hi>blind omnipotent</hi> Self-will, that wills Things merely because he wills them, and is no way concerned to regulate his <hi>own</hi> Motions by any <hi>antecedent</hi> Rules of Justice, Wisdom, or Goodness. So also Men of <hi>wrathful</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> Tempers are apt to look upon <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>froward, furious,</hi> and <hi>implacable</hi> Being, that is to be pleased or displeased with Trifles, that <hi>frowns</hi> or <hi>smiles</hi> as the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:59595:177"/>
Humour takes him; that when the <hi>froward</hi> Fit is upon him Breaths nothing but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Fury, and whose <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> is <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>mutable,</hi> and never <hi>constant</hi> to the same Reasons. And to name no more, thus Men of <hi>fond</hi> and <hi>indulgent</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are apt to represent <hi>God</hi> to themselves as one that dotes <hi>invincibly</hi> on those who have once the Luck to be his Favourites, and in <hi>Christ,</hi> at least will hug their very Deformities, and connive at their <hi>greatest</hi> Treasons and Rebellions. And since these <hi>false</hi> Representations that Men make of <hi>God</hi> are nothing but the Reflections of their <hi>own</hi> Images, in loving him they only love themselves; and 'tis no wonder that they are more devoutly affected towards such an <hi>imaginary Divinity</hi> than towards the <hi>true God</hi> himself clothed with his <hi>own</hi> Attributes, and circled about with his <hi>own</hi> Rays of <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained</hi> and <hi>immaculate</hi> Glory; since the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> is nothing but their <hi>own</hi> Shadow, which <hi>Narcissus-like</hi> they gaze upon and fall in love with. But whatsoever Love we may bestow upon these <hi>false</hi> Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it is not terminated upon <hi>God,</hi> but on the <hi>Spectres</hi> and Images of our Fancies, which have nothing of <hi>God</hi> about them but the Name. Wherefore to constitute our Love truly <hi>divine,</hi> it is <hi>necessary</hi> that it
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:59595:178"/>
should respect <hi>God</hi> as he is in himself, and not as he seems to be in these <hi>disfigured</hi> I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols of our own Fancies. We must blot out of our Minds all these <hi>false</hi> Conceptions, which like the <hi>Aethiopian Idols,</hi> are nothing but <hi>our own</hi> Resemblance, and <hi>portrait</hi> him in all those <hi>fair</hi> Ideas wherein he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented himself unto us; and when we have righted him in <hi>our own</hi> Opinions, and formed such Notions of him as are <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> to his <hi>native</hi> Perfections, then we must love him for what we see in him, even for the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> the <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of his Nature. For unless we love these his <hi>moral</hi> Perfections, which are indeed the only Objects of Love in him, all our <hi>kind</hi> Pretences are <hi>base</hi> Flatteries, and in stead of him we only Love a <hi>Mock-God</hi> of <hi>our own</hi> making. And thus I have shewed you at large wherein the Essence of this <hi>heavenly</hi> Virtue, our Love of <hi>God</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists. But because Things are better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by their <hi>essential</hi> Characters and Properties than by their <hi>naked</hi> Essences, and we may much more easily discern whether we truly love <hi>God</hi> or no by the <hi>former</hi> than by the <hi>latter,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. I proceed in the next Place to shew you what are the <hi>essential</hi> Properties and Characters of our Love of <hi>God</hi>: And these
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:59595:178"/>
are to be fetched from the Nature of Love in general, the Properties whereof when it is determined on a Person, are chiefly these four:
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Benevolence</hi> to the Person beloved.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Desire</hi> of enjoying him.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Imitation</hi> of his Perfections.</item>
                  <item>4. <hi>Conformity</hi> to his Will.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Benevolence is an <hi>essential</hi> Property of our Love of <hi>God</hi>; by which I do not mean wishing of any <hi>additional</hi> Good or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to <hi>God</hi> which yet he wants; for that is Extravagance, to wish that a Being who is infinitely <hi>happy</hi> should be more happy than he is; since his Happiness would not be <hi>infinite</hi> if it could admit of Addition or Increase. By our Benevolence to <hi>God</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I only mean our <hi>hearty</hi> Desire that he may be pleased by <hi>our selves</hi> and <hi>others</hi>; that all his Creation may conspire to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>glorify</hi> him in that Method which he hath prescribed; and that his Will may be done upon <hi>Earth,</hi> as it is in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And this must necessarily be the <hi>hearty</hi> Wish of every <hi>sincere</hi> Lover of <hi>God</hi>; and when he sees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self defeated of his Wish by the <hi>wicked</hi> Lives and Manners of Men; when he considers how <hi>God</hi> is offended every Day, how his Authority is <hi>affronted,</hi> his Laws <hi>trampled</hi> on, his Name <hi>vilified</hi> and <hi>blasphemed</hi> by <hi>bold</hi>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:59595:179"/>
and <hi>insolent</hi> Sinners, he cannot forbear griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at it, to see <hi>him</hi> his Soul loves, loaded with so many Indignities and Dishonours. For thus did <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>great</hi> Lover of <hi>God; Rivers of tears run down mine Eyes, because Men keep not thy Law,</hi> Psal. cxix.136. So that what the <hi>brave Portia</hi> said to her <hi>dear Brutus</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that can every Lover of <hi>God</hi> say; <hi>Lord! Thou knowest that I sympathize in all thy Pleasures and Displeasures; when thou art pleased, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce; and when thou art offended, I am grieved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Another Property of <hi>divine</hi> Love is an <hi>earnest</hi> Desire of enjoying <hi>God.</hi> For so when we love a Friend, we desire to enjoy as much of him as we are able; that is, we would fain be more <hi>intimately</hi> acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, we would love him more, and be more beloved by him, and resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him in all those <hi>amiable</hi> Qualities for which we love and admire him. And thus if we have chosen <hi>God</hi> for our Friend, we shall still be breathing after a more <hi>intimate</hi> Fruition of him; our Thoughts will be often imployed in the Contemplation of his <hi>Beauty</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi>; and our Minds will be perpetually longing after a <hi>clearer</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, and more <hi>intimate</hi> Acquaintance with him. We shall never think we love him sufficiently; and never think we can
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:59595:179"/>
do enough to <hi>endear</hi> our selves to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; but shall always feel in our selves both Want of Love to him, and Want of Desert to be beloved by him. We shall incessantly covet more and more to <hi>resemble</hi> him in those <hi>adorable</hi> Perfections for which we love him; that so if it were possible, he might have the same Reason to love <hi>us,</hi> as we have to love <hi>him.</hi> We shall earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>hunger</hi> and <hi>thirst</hi> after Righteousness, and vehemently wish that all those <hi>amiable</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Justice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> for which we do admire and love him, were more fairly imprinted on <hi>our own</hi> Natures; that so by partaking of these Perfections, we may grow more and more <hi>god-like,</hi> till we are arrived to a most <hi>perfect</hi> Resemblance and Conformity of Natures with him. Thus to enjoy <hi>God</hi> must needs be the Desire of every <hi>true</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Lover of him. And indeed this is the only En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment we are <hi>capable</hi> of; for we cannot enjoy God's <hi>Essence,</hi> because we cannot possess it, it being neither <hi>communicated</hi> nor <hi>communicable</hi>; and therefore all that our Enjoyment of him can include, is to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and be <hi>beloved</hi> by him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble him in those <hi>charming</hi> Beauties of Purity and Goodness which render him so infinitely <hi>lovely</hi>; and it is <hi>essential</hi> to every
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:59595:180"/>
               <hi>faithful</hi> Lover of him thus to desire to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Imitation of his Perfections is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>essential</hi> Property of Love to him: and <hi>this</hi> is necessarily <hi>consequent</hi> to the <hi>former</hi>; for if we love <hi>God,</hi> it is either for the <hi>good</hi> he doth us, or for the Beauty and Loveliness of his Nature. If we love him for the <hi>good</hi> he doth us, we must needs be <hi>sensible</hi> that it is a <hi>lovely</hi> Thing to do <hi>good,</hi> and this must strangely incline us to imitate him in doing all the <hi>good</hi> we are able. If we love him for the Beauty and Excellency of his Nature, we cannot but desire to be like him; because whatsoever we esteem lovely in <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,</hi> we desire to partake of out of love to <hi>our selves</hi>; and if we desire to partake of what is lovely in <hi>another,</hi> that must needs engage us to imitate him, since we have no <hi>other</hi> Way to partake of anothers Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies but only by a <hi>constant</hi> Imitation of them. So that 'tis impossible we should love <hi>God</hi> for the Beauty and Perfection of his Nature, and not <hi>hearily</hi> desire to partake of it; and 'tis impossible we should <hi>heartily</hi> desire to partake of it, and not endeavour to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it by a <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>vigorous</hi> Imitation. So that whatsoever <hi>good</hi> Reason we love <hi>God</hi> for, it must necessarily terminate in our Imitation of those <hi>amiable</hi> Actions or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:59595:180"/>
for which we love him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for any Man to pretend to love <hi>God</hi> while he acts contrary to the Reasons for which he loves him, is plainly to <hi>contradict</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and <hi>baffle</hi> his own Pretensions. For to say that I love <hi>God</hi> for doing <hi>good,</hi> or for being <hi>just, holy,</hi> and <hi>benevolent,</hi> while I take no Care to do <hi>good</hi> my self, but take Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in <hi>Impurity, Injustice,</hi> or <hi>Vncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> is to say that I love him for those Things which I plainly declare I do not love. If therefore we heartily love <hi>God</hi> as we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to do, it will be <hi>visible</hi> in our Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him; for unless we endeavour to be <hi>pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>just</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> as he is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi>; all our Pretensions of Love to him are Cheats and <hi>fulsom</hi> Hypocrisy.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> and lastly. Complyance with the Will of <hi>God</hi> is another <hi>essential</hi> Character and Property of our Love to him. For if we sincerely love a Person, we must needs desire to <hi>please</hi> him, that so thereby we may <hi>endear</hi> our selves to him; and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally desire to <hi>please</hi> him, to be sure we shall readily comply with his Will in whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable.</hi> And hence the <hi>Scripture</hi> makes our Obedience to the Will of <hi>God essential</hi> to our Love of him; <hi>For this,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, is the love of God, that
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:59595:181"/>
we keep his Commandments,</hi> 1 Joh. v.3. <hi>and this is love, that we walk after his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> 2 Epist. vi. <hi>If ye love me,</hi> saith our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, keep my Commandments,</hi> Joh. xiv.15. that is, give me this Token that ye love me; for without this I can never believe that you have any <hi>real</hi> Kindness for me what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Pretensions you may make; for so Vers. 23. he adds <hi>If any Man love me, he will keep my Commandments,</hi> intimating that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Love of, and Obedience to him, there is a <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>inseparable</hi> Connection. So that we may as soon be Men without <hi>Risibility,</hi> as Lovers of <hi>God</hi> without <hi>sincere</hi> Submission to his Will. For Lovers have <hi>one</hi> Will and <hi>one</hi> Soul; they conspire in the <hi>same</hi> Designs, and drive at the <hi>same</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests; their Affections are <hi>perfect Vnizons,</hi> and do in the same <hi>Likes</hi> and <hi>Dislikes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound and <hi>eccho</hi> to <hi>one another</hi>; and so far as they love, there is such a <hi>perfect</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between them that they seem mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>lend</hi> and <hi>borrow</hi> Wills and Souls with <hi>one another.</hi> And so if we love <hi>God,</hi> there will be a <hi>sweet</hi> Harmony between <hi>our</hi> Wills and <hi>his,</hi> at least so far as we love him; for if we love him, we shall love to <hi>please</hi> him, by complying in all Things with his <hi>heavenly</hi> Will, and rejoyce that we are able to do any thing that we are sure will be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:59595:181"/>
in his Eyes, and certainly <hi>endear</hi> us to his most <hi>tender</hi> Affection. Whilst therefore we live in <hi>wilful</hi> Disobedience and Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his <hi>heavenly</hi> Will, all our Pretences of Love to him are <hi>rank</hi> Dissimulations, and like the Kisses of <hi>Judas</hi> are only Prefaces to our <hi>succeeding</hi> Treasons and Rebellions. And thus you see wherein the <hi>Essence</hi> of our Love to <hi>God</hi> consists, and what are its <hi>essential</hi> Properties; by a <hi>serious</hi> Review of which you may easily conclude whether in reality you are Lovers of <hi>God</hi> or no.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I now proceed to the next Enquiry, namely what Measures and Degrees of <hi>this</hi> Love are Matter of <hi>indispensable</hi> Duty to us. For answer to which we must consider, that <hi>this</hi> as well as all the <hi>other</hi> Virtues of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> are required of us by a <hi>twofold Law</hi>; the <hi>first</hi> is the Law of <hi>Perfection,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> is the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi>; both of which it will be necessary for us to explain before we can exactly determine what Degrees and Measures of Love to <hi>God</hi> are Matter of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable</hi> Duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First therefore there is the Law of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> which requires the <hi>utmost</hi> Degrees of every <hi>Christian</hi> Virtue that in the <hi>seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> States and Periods of our Lives we are capable of attaining. For thus we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:59595:182"/>
not only <hi>to do,</hi> but <hi>to abound in the work of the Lord</hi>; not only to <hi>have Grace,</hi> but to <hi>grow in it; to perfect holiness in the fear of God, and be perfect as our Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi> And indeed the Nature of <hi>God</hi> is the only Standard of <hi>that</hi> Perfection whereunto we must aspire, and we are still bound to be growing on till we are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>holy</hi>; which, because our <hi>finite</hi> Natures can never arrive to in any Period of Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore I doubt not but it will be our Duty to be growing on <hi>eternally.</hi> So that this Law having prescribed no Limits to the Degrees of our <hi>Growth</hi> in Virtue, hath thereby cut out work enough to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our Faculties <hi>for ever.</hi> Not that we are Sinners against this Law so long as we are <hi>short</hi> or <hi>defective</hi> of the <hi>utmost</hi> Degree of Perfection; for it requires of us no more than what is within our <hi>present</hi> Possibility, and our Possibility encreases together with our Improvements. When we have but <hi>one</hi> Degree of Virtue, it is no Sin against the Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> that we do not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately leap to <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven</hi>; because it is not in our Power, and no Law can oblige a Man to that which is <hi>impossible</hi>; but when we have acquired <hi>one</hi> Degree we have Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to acquire a <hi>second,</hi> and when we have acquired <hi>that,</hi> we have Power to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:59595:182"/>
a <hi>third</hi>; and so on <hi>ad infinitum</hi>; and consequently our Obligation to be more and more <hi>perfect,</hi> increases according to the Improvement of our Power. A <hi>Babe in Christ,</hi> or <hi>Beginner in Religion</hi> hath not the Strength and Power of a Man, that is, of one that hath made a <hi>considerable</hi> Progress; and consequently he is not immediately o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged by <hi>this</hi> Law to the same Degree of Growth and Perfection; but whatsoever Degree is within his Power in the <hi>different</hi> Periods of his Growth and Progress, that he is actually and immediately obliged to, and while he continues <hi>defective</hi> in it he sins against the Law of Perfection. So that in short, <hi>this</hi> Law requires us to be in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects as <hi>good</hi> in the several Stages of our <hi>Christian</hi> Progress as at present 'tis possible for us to be; and so far as we fall <hi>short</hi> of any Attainment that is within our Power, we are guilty of <hi>violating</hi> its <hi>righteous</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation. 'Tis true, <hi>this</hi> Law doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige us under the Pain of <hi>eternal</hi> Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and indeed if it did, no Flesh could be saved, since there never was any <hi>mere</hi> Man but might have possibly been <hi>better</hi> than he was, had he been so <hi>diligent</hi> as to improve himself to the <hi>utmost</hi> Degree of his Power. The <hi>proper</hi> Sanction therefore of <hi>this</hi> Law is this, that we should actually do
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:59595:183"/>
all the <hi>good,</hi> and acquire all the Degrees of <hi>Virtue</hi> that are at <hi>present</hi> within our Power, under the Pain of losing some Degree of Happiness in the <hi>other</hi> World, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise we should have attained; which is no more than what naturally follows upon all <hi>sinful</hi> Defects. For every <hi>sinful</hi> Defect is a Privation of some Degree of Goodness, and Goodness is so <hi>essential</hi> to Happiness, that there cannot be a Privation of the <hi>one</hi> without a Diminution of the <hi>other.</hi> But besides those Defects of Happiness that are naturally <hi>consequent</hi> to our Defects of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the <hi>Scripture</hi> plainly assures us that <hi>God</hi> himself will substract from our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>hereafter</hi> in Proportion to our <hi>moral</hi> Defects and Nonimprovements in <hi>this</hi> Life; for <hi>he which soweth sparingly,</hi> saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, <hi>shall reap sparingly: And he which sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth bountifully, shall reap also bountifully,</hi> 2 Cor. ix.6. And Luke xix. our <hi>Saviour</hi> by way of a <hi>Parable</hi> doth expressly teach us, that our Reward shall be <hi>apportioned</hi> to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of our Improvement; for there he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents himself as a <hi>Master</hi> coming to take Account of his <hi>Servants,</hi> among whom he had intrusted a Stock of <hi>Ten Pounds,</hi> giving every one of them an <hi>equal</hi> Share; the <hi>first</hi> by an <hi>extraordinary</hi> Diligence had improved his <hi>Pound</hi> into <hi>Ten,</hi> and he is rewarded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:59595:183"/>
with the Government of <hi>ten Cities,</hi> Vers. 16, 17. The <hi>other</hi> had been <hi>faithful,</hi> though not altogether so <hi>diligent,</hi> and by his <hi>one Pound</hi> had gained <hi>five,</hi> and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably is made Lord of <hi>five</hi> Cities, Vers. 18, 19. By which he plainly declares that so much as we come short of the <hi>utmost</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in Virtue, so much will he substract from the <hi>utmost</hi> Degree of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. So that in short the Sense of the Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> is this, as thou wouldst not incur the Forfeiture of some Degrees of thy Happiness in the <hi>other</hi> Life, be sure to imploy thy <hi>utmost</hi> Diligence in improvlng thy self in every <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi> of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But then</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> There is the Law of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> which only requires the Being and Reality of all <hi>Christian</hi> Graces and Virtues in us, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the <hi>proper</hi> Acts and Exercises of them according as we have Opportunity, and doth no farther forbid the Deficiency and Non-improvement of them than as it is <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>continued</hi> and <hi>inconsistent</hi> with Sincerity. Now the Reality of these <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Virtues in us consists in the <hi>universal</hi> and <hi>prevalent</hi> Consent of our Wills to them, to practise them as often as Occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and not wilfully to commit any <hi>contrary</hi> Sin upon any Occasion whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:59595:184"/>
and so long as this Consent <hi>continues</hi> and <hi>prevails</hi> in our Practice, we are <hi>just</hi> in the Eye and Judgment of the Law, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever <hi>Weakness</hi> and <hi>Defects, Surprizes</hi> and <hi>Inadvertencies</hi> we may otherwise be <hi>guilty</hi> of. For he who hath so submitted his Will to <hi>God</hi> as to consent effectually without any Reserve to obey him, is evidently <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>sincere,</hi> though perhaps he may be <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>imperfect.</hi> For as he is sincerely <hi>chast,</hi> whose Will doth prevalently Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Law of <hi>Chastity</hi>; so he is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally a <hi>vertuous</hi> Man, whose Will doth prevalently Consent to the <hi>universal</hi> Law of Virtue; because that very Consent of his includes the Being and Reality of all Virtues, though not the <hi>utmost</hi> Degrees and Improvements of them. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the <hi>utmost</hi> that the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> requires, that we should <hi>universally</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valently</hi> Consent to the Will of <hi>God</hi> so as not <hi>wilfully</hi> to neglect any Duty which he hath enjoyned, and practise any Sin which he hath forbid; but though this be all it requires, yet this it exacts under the <hi>severest</hi> Penalty in the World, even that of <hi>eternal</hi> Death and Condemnation; only this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso</hi> it admits of, that if we do repent and amend, this <hi>dreadful</hi> Obligation shall be <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void.</hi> So that the <hi>great</hi> Difference
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:59595:184"/>
between the Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> and the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> is only this, that the Penalty of the <hi>later</hi> is much more <hi>Severe</hi> than that of the <hi>former</hi>; but the Duty of the <hi>former</hi> is much more <hi>large</hi> and <hi>comprehensive</hi> than that of the <hi>later.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus briefly explained to you these <hi>two Different</hi> Laws by which the Love of <hi>God</hi> as well as all <hi>other</hi> Virtues are made our Duty, this I conceive will be of very <hi>great</hi> Use in stating the <hi>due</hi> Bounds and Measures either of Love or any <hi>other</hi> Virtue <hi>God</hi> requires of us: We must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by what Laws it is that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it, and what Measures of it those Laws do require. <hi>First</hi> therefore, we will consider what Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law of <hi>Perfection. Secondly,</hi> what Degree of it is required by the Law of <hi>Sincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> What Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law of <hi>Perfection?</hi> To which I answer, that it requires all that Love which in the <hi>several</hi> Periods of our Growth and Progress in <hi>Religion</hi> we are able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him. For it is to be considered that in this <hi>corrupt</hi> Estate, both our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> and <hi>Wills</hi> are so <hi>darkened</hi> and <hi>depraved,</hi> that we do not apprehend the <hi>thousandth</hi> Part of those Degrees of Loveliness that are in him,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:59595:185"/>
and if we did, yet our Affections are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigled by these <hi>sensual</hi> Goods among which we are placed, that we are not able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him the <hi>thousandth</hi> Part of that Love, which those Degrees of Loveliness we do apprehend in him do deserve. But there is no <hi>just</hi> Law can exact of us beyond what we are <hi>able</hi> to perform; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> being <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> cannot be supposed to exact <hi>more</hi> Love to <hi>God</hi> from us than we have Strength and Power (all our Circumstances consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) to render unto him. So that he who doth his utmost to understand, and affect himself with the Beauty and Loveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>God,</hi> and to substract his Love from <hi>sensual</hi> Good, and <hi>terminate</hi> it on <hi>God,</hi> is a <hi>just</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Man in the Judgment of the Law of <hi>Perfection.</hi> From whence it is evident <hi>first,</hi> that no Man can be bound by any Law to Love <hi>God</hi> as much as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be beloved; because he being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>lovely</hi> in himself is the <hi>adequate</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an <hi>infinite</hi> Love, which no <hi>finite</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is <hi>capable</hi> of. 2<hi>ly.</hi> That no Man is bound to understand how much he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be beloved, because <hi>this</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Comprehension of any <hi>finite</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, especially of ours which are so <hi>dim-sighted</hi> in their Apprehensions of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
               <pb n="363" facs="tcp:59595:185"/>
and <hi>invisible</hi> Beings. 3<hi>ly.</hi> That in this State no Man is bound <hi>actually</hi> to love <hi>God</hi> so far as he apprehends Reason to love him; this indeed we ought to endeavour after, but while we continue in these <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> it is impossible for us so <hi>absolutely</hi> to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract our Love from <hi>sense</hi> and <hi>sensual</hi> Things, as not to be in the least diverted by it from loving him to that Degree in which we know he deserves to be beloved. It is, I confess, our Imperfection that our Love to him is not <hi>proportionate</hi> to our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of his Loveliness: but besides this we have many <hi>other</hi> Imperfections that are our Misery indeed, but not our Sin. For no Imperfection is any farther our Sin than 'tis in our Power to correct it; and there is no <hi>true</hi> Lover of <hi>God</hi> did ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to that Degree of Love as not to see <hi>great</hi> Reason to wish that it were in his Power still to love him more; which is a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence in every Period of this <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect</hi> State that our Affections are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by these <hi>sensible</hi> Goods about us, that we are not able to raise them to such a Degree of Love as is <hi>proportionate</hi> to our Apprehensions of his Loveliness. 4<hi>ly</hi> and lastly, That no Man is bound to love <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>several</hi> Periods of his Growth and Progress in <hi>Religion</hi> with the same De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:59595:186"/>
of Affection; for by the Law of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> a Man is always bound to love him as <hi>much</hi> as he can, but in the <hi>Progress</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> we can love him much <hi>more</hi> than in the <hi>Beginning.</hi> For the <hi>more</hi> we know of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>more</hi> our Affections are disingaged from these <hi>sensual</hi> Goods, the <hi>more</hi> Power and Ability we have to love him; and we are equally bound to love him as much as we can, when we have <hi>ten</hi> Degrees of Power, as we are when we have but <hi>one</hi>; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently 'tis as <hi>great</hi> an Offence against the Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> not to love him as much as we can when we have <hi>more</hi> Power to love him, as it was when we had <hi>less.</hi> So that by this Law we are always bound to love him as much as we are able, and to be always <hi>augmenting</hi> our Ability of loving him, and always to love him <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> as our Power and Ability increases; and under this <hi>sweet</hi> Obligation perhaps we shall lie to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> For there being <hi>infinite</hi> Degrees of Loveliness and Amabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>finite</hi> Understandings will need an <hi>Infinity</hi> of Duration to discover them all, and it would be <hi>unreasonable</hi> for us not to love him <hi>more,</hi> according as we discover <hi>more</hi> of the Beauty and Loveliness of his Nature. 'Tis true, in <hi>this</hi> Life the
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:59595:186"/>
Difficulty lies not so much in discovering his Loveliness, as in affecting our Hearts with the Sense of it, and in raising our <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> Affections to a Love <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate</hi> to those Discoveries; and 'tis this that creates us so much Toil and Labour in the Progress of our Obedience to the Law of <hi>Perfection</hi>; but when once we are arrived into the <hi>blessed</hi> Regions of <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> our Affection being perfectly subdued to the Reason of our Minds, and <hi>dreined</hi> and <hi>clarified</hi> from all its <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> Love will as naturally flame out <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God</hi> upon every <hi>new</hi> Discovery of his Beauty, as Fire doth when more <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible</hi> Fuel is layd upon it; and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Toil or Difficulty, the <hi>more</hi> we <hi>know</hi> the <hi>more</hi> we shall <hi>Love,</hi> and so more and more <hi>for ever.</hi> If therefore we would know what Measures of Love to <hi>God</hi> we are obliged to by this Law of <hi>Perfection,</hi> the Answer is <hi>easy,</hi> viz. that to all <hi>Eternity</hi> we are bound to love him as much as we are able, and always to love him <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> as our Ability increases. And this I take to be the Sense of that <hi>comprehensive</hi> Law of our <hi>Saviour, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength,</hi> Mar. 12.30. that is, thou shalt imploy thy
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:59595:187"/>
Faculties, thy <hi>Mind,</hi> thy <hi>Will,</hi> and thy <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> to the <hi>utmost</hi> of thy Strength and Power in <hi>loving, delighting,</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> Complacency in the Goodness, Beauty, and Perfections of <hi>God.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> What Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Law of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> which is the Law by which we must stand or fall <hi>for ever?</hi> So that the Sense of the Enquiry is this, what Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> is <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to put us into a State of <hi>Salvation,</hi> the <hi>indispensable</hi> Condition of our Salvation being nothing else but our Obedience to this Law of <hi>Sincerity.</hi> Now as to this <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> of our Love of <hi>God</hi> there are <hi>two</hi> Things which this Law exacts of us; <hi>First,</hi> it requires the <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Existence</hi> of this <hi>heavenly</hi> Virtue in us, that is, it requires not only that we should not hate <hi>God,</hi> or be <hi>indifferent</hi> between Love and Hatred in our Affection to him, but that we should <hi>really, cordially,</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> love him. And hence those <hi>eternal</hi> Glories and Beatitudes in which our Salvation doth consist, are said to be <hi>prepared by God for them that love him,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. which is a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence that it is one of the Conditions or Qualifications upon which our Salvation doth depend, and consequently an <hi>indispensable</hi> Duty of the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi>; and St. <hi>James</hi> expresly
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:59595:187"/>
tells us, <hi>that the Lord hath promised the Crown of Life to them that love him,</hi> Ja. 1.12. And therefore since that Law of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity</hi> contains the Condition of <hi>that</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, it hence necessarily follows, that our Love to <hi>God</hi> is a Part of it, since that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made to those that love him. Nay, so <hi>necessary</hi> a Part of <hi>that</hi> Law is this <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> Virtue, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, without this the most <hi>vertuous</hi> Actions whatsoever are insignificant Cyphers in the Account of <hi>God</hi>; for <hi>though,</hi> saith he, <hi>I bestow all my Goods to feed the Poor, and though I give my Body to be Burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth me nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. where it is plain he takes Charity in the <hi>largest</hi> Sense for our Love to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>one another.</hi> He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that doth not really love <hi>God,</hi> who is not heartily <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>affected</hi> with the Sense of his Goodness and Perfections stands condemned by the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi>; and without Repentance and Amendment shall have no Part or Portion in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> But then</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> requires such a Degree of Love to <hi>God,</hi> as doth, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> effectually render us <hi>obedient</hi> to his Will. For, as I have shewed you, the <hi>Scripture</hi> every where makes our keeping his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:59595:188"/>
the most <hi>essential</hi> Property of our Love of him; for <hi>if a man love me,</hi> saith our <hi>Saviour, he will keep my Words,</hi> Joh. 14.23. And <hi>whoso keepeth his Word,</hi> saith St. <hi>John,</hi> that is, his Commandments, <hi>in him is the love of God perfected</hi>; that is, in him it is <hi>real,</hi> and <hi>cordial,</hi> and <hi>sincere,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.5. When therefore our Love to <hi>God</hi> hath that Power over us, as together with the <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Christianity,</hi> to restrain us from the <hi>wilful</hi> Omission of any <hi>known</hi> Duty, or Commission of any <hi>known</hi> Sin, it is then perfected to that Degree which the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exacts. But before we dismiss this Argument, it will be <hi>necessary</hi> to give a more <hi>particular</hi> Account of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore, this Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that some Degree of <hi>true</hi> Love to <hi>God</hi> should be intermingled with the <hi>other</hi> Parts of our Obedience to him; because this, as I have shewn you, is one <hi>great</hi> and <hi>essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> Part of that Obedience which it requires; and therefore if out of <hi>mere</hi> Fear of <hi>God</hi> we should obey him in all <hi>other</hi> Instances, yet so long as we are defective in <hi>this,</hi> our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience will be <hi>lame</hi> and <hi>partial,</hi> and want a <hi>great</hi> Part of that Intireness which the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exacts. For since it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us to love <hi>God</hi> under the <hi>same</hi> Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>eternal</hi> Death that it requires all its <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:59595:188"/>
Duties, we can no more be saved by it without this <hi>Virtue</hi> than without <hi>Justice, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Chastity</hi>; yea, considering how <hi>necessary</hi> this is both to quicken our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience <hi>here,</hi> and qualify us for Happiness <hi>hereafter,</hi> we may much better spare any Virtue of <hi>Religion</hi> than this of the Love of <hi>God.</hi> This therefore is <hi>indispensably necessary,</hi> according to the Tenor of the Law of <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity,</hi> that there should be some Degree of <hi>true</hi> Love to <hi>God</hi> intermingled with the <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Parts of our Obedience.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> This Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exacts of us only such a Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> as, in Conjunction with the <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> is actually <hi>sufficient</hi> to enforce our Obedience. It doth not require us to love <hi>God</hi> in that <hi>heroic</hi> Degree, as not to need any <hi>other</hi> Motive to engage us to obey his Will; for if it did, no Man could be in a <hi>good</hi> State till he were able to obey <hi>God</hi> purely for his <hi>own</hi> Sake, without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect either to those <hi>glorious</hi> Advantages he promises, or those <hi>endless</hi> Torments he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces; which requires such an <hi>ardent</hi> Degree of Love to him as I doubt few <hi>good</hi> Men arrive to in this Life. I know 'tis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually said by those that handle this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that to love <hi>God</hi> above all Things is the Degree of Love to which the Law of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:59595:189"/>
               <hi>Sincerity</hi> obliges us; but either this must be a Mistake, or no Man can be <hi>good</hi> till he is so <hi>perfect</hi> a Lover of <hi>God</hi> as not to need any <hi>other</hi> Motive but that of <hi>his own</hi> Love to oblige him to Obedience. For Men need no Motives to persuade them to chuse what they love <hi>best</hi>; and therefore if Men loved <hi>God</hi> above all, they would need no farther Motives to persuade them to chuse what he Wills and Commands against all Persuasions to the contrary. If I love <hi>God</hi> above my self, I shall certainly chuse <hi>his</hi> Will before my <hi>own:</hi> If I love him above all my Pleasures, I shall chuse <hi>his</hi> Pleasures before my <hi>own</hi>; and it will be a <hi>needless</hi> Thing to propose Motives to persuade me to do that which I like best, and chuse that which I love above all the World. So that whilst a Man hath Need of Motives to persuade him to chuse <hi>God,</hi> and prefer his Will above all Temptations, it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent he loves him not above all; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently according to this <hi>Doctrine</hi> cannot be a <hi>good</hi> Man in the Judgment of the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi>; which if it were <hi>true,</hi> I doubt, the List of <hi>good</hi> Men would be reduced to a very <hi>small</hi> Number. Wherefore since lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>God</hi> above all is a <hi>high</hi> strain of Piety much above the <hi>low</hi> Estate of <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Goodness, to make it necessary to a
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:59595:189"/>
               <hi>good</hi> State must needs be very <hi>dangerous,</hi> since it cannot but dishearten <hi>beginners in Religion,</hi> and perplex their Consciences with <hi>needless</hi> and <hi>inextricable</hi> Scruples. I confess, not to love <hi>God</hi> above all, who doth so infinitely exceed all in Degrees of Loveliness and Amability, is an Argument of <hi>great</hi> Imperfection, though not of Insin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; but if my Love to him be such, as that together with my <hi>Hope</hi> and <hi>Fear</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Religion,</hi> it effectually operates on my Will, so as to win it to an <hi>universal prevalent</hi> Consent to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> I know no Reason I have to judge severely of my <hi>main</hi> State, though I should be <hi>conscious</hi> to my self that my Love <hi>singly</hi> and <hi>apart</hi> from those <hi>other</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives had not Force enough in it to produce this <hi>happy</hi> Effect. This therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is the <hi>utmost</hi> Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> that the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exacts, that we should <hi>so</hi> love him as by our Love, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the <hi>other</hi> Arguments of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> to be effectually prevailed on to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> The Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exacts such <hi>a Degree</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> of us, as together with those <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Christianity</hi> is prevalent to <hi>sincere</hi> Obedience; and in this it differs from the Law of <hi>Perfection,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:59595:190"/>
such a <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Love</hi> of us, as toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with those <hi>other</hi> Motives is productive of <hi>perfect unsinning</hi> Obedience. For, as I have shewed you, the Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> requires the <hi>utmost</hi> of our Possibility, and consequently that we should love <hi>God</hi> as much as we can, and consider and apply to our selves the <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Religion</hi> as well and as closely as we are able, and then proceed upon the whole to serve and obey <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>utmost</hi> of our Power and Ability; which if we do, we are perfectly <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>inculpable</hi>; unless you suppose, that a Man may be <hi>blame-worthy</hi> for not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than he can. But should the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exact thus much of us, I doubt it would exclude the <hi>best</hi> of Men out of the State of Goodness and Salvation; for what Man is there that doth always love and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>God</hi> to the <hi>utmost</hi> of his <hi>present</hi> Possibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Wherefore all that this Law can be supposed to require of us, is only such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Love as is requisite to render it a <hi>concurrent</hi> Cause of <hi>true sincere</hi> Obedience, that is to say, such a Love as in Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with those <hi>great</hi> Motives of Reward and Punishment produces such an <hi>hearty</hi> Consent in us to the Will of <hi>God</hi> as will not suffer us any longer to persist either in <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lss</hi> or <hi>affected</hi> Ignorance of it, or in <hi>known</hi>
               <pb n="373" facs="tcp:59595:190"/>
and <hi>wilful</hi> Disobedience to it; and there are no Infirmities or Miscarriages whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>inconsistent</hi> with such a Degree of Love to <hi>God,</hi> but what are also <hi>inconsistent</hi> with such a Consent to his <hi>heavenly</hi> Will. If therefore we thus love <hi>God</hi> to the Purposes of a <hi>sincere</hi> Obedience, the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> acquits us; and as for our Sins of <hi>Infirmity, Surprize,</hi> or <hi>Inadvertency,</hi> we are <hi>accountable</hi> for them only to the Law of <hi>Perfection.</hi>

            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly, The Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> requires such a Degree of Love to <hi>God</hi> as together with those <hi>other</hi> Motives makes us not only <hi>sincere</hi> in our Obedience, but also <hi>careful</hi> to improve it to further Degrees of Perfection. And indeed <hi>this</hi> is necessarily included in the <hi>former</hi>; for if our Love of <hi>God</hi> joyned with the <hi>other</hi> Arguments of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> hath so far prevailed upon us as to win us to a <hi>sincere</hi> Consent to his <hi>heavenly</hi> Will, we shall not only industriously avoid the <hi>known</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> Violations of it, but be very careful to correct those Flaws and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections that are intermixed with our Obedience to it. 'Tis true, when there is nothing but <hi>slavish</hi> Fear at the Bottom of a Mans Obedience, <hi>that</hi> must necessarily <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract</hi> and <hi>shrink</hi> up the Sinews of his Care and Endeavours, and render him exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>stingy</hi> in the Discharge of
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:59595:191"/>
his Duty; for having no farther Aim than <hi>his own</hi> Security, he will do no more than what is <hi>necessary</hi> to avoid the Danger that he stands in Fear of; and if he can but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape those <hi>known</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> Sins that layd <hi>waste</hi> his Conscience, and expos'd him to the Wrath of <hi>God,</hi> that is the <hi>utmost</hi> he desires or aims at; but as for those Miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and <hi>sinful</hi> Imperfections which do only fall under the Cognizance of the Law of <hi>Perfection,</hi> he is not at all concerned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them. But when our <hi>Fear</hi> is inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with such a Degree of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as the Law of <hi>Sincerity</hi> exacts, that will make us <hi>careful,</hi> not only to avoid those <hi>known</hi> and <hi>willful</hi> Sins that divorse us from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>God,</hi> but also to indear our selves <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> to him by correcting even those <hi>smaller</hi> Defects and Imperfections that do still adhere to our Duties and Natures: For this is plain, that no Man can heartily love <hi>God</hi> that doth not <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> desire to be beloved by him; and that no Man can sincerely desire to be <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> beloved by <hi>God,</hi> that doth not honestly endeavour to render himself <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> lovely in his Eyes; that is, to reform all those <hi>sinful</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Imperfections which <hi>stain</hi> and <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish</hi> the Beauty of his Soul. Whosoever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contents himself with this, not to be
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:59595:191"/>
hated by <hi>God,</hi> did never sincerely love him; and whosoever desires <hi>more</hi> than this, will as well be <hi>careful</hi> to correct those <hi>small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> Imperfections which render him less be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of <hi>God,</hi> as to avoid those <hi>known</hi> and <hi>wilful</hi> Sins which do expose him to God's Hatred. If therefore our <hi>Religion</hi> doth not in some Measure improve our Natures, if it doth not render us more <hi>patient</hi> and <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> more <hi>charitable</hi> and <hi>heavenly minded,</hi> it is a <hi>certain</hi> Sign that it is not acted by Love. For if after having a long while continued in a Round of <hi>religious</hi> Duties we still return to the same Point, and are in no Degree <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than we were when we <hi>first</hi> began, it is a <hi>plain</hi> Token that we do not heartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be more beloved of <hi>God,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently that we do not love him. So that in fine the Sum of all is this, The Law of <hi>Perfection</hi> requires us to love <hi>God</hi> with all our Might and with all our Strength, that is, as much as we are able in every Period of our <hi>Growth</hi> and <hi>Progress</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi>; and by how much we love him <hi>less</hi> than we are able, by so much <hi>less</hi> shall be the <hi>future</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of our Love. But then for the Law of <hi>Sincerity,</hi> that only requires of us such a Degree of Love to him as doth together with the <hi>other</hi> Motives of <hi>Religion</hi> effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally incline us to obey him sincerely, and
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:59595:192"/>
to endeavour to improve our Obedience into farther Degrees of Perfection; and so long as we fall short of this we are <hi>bad</hi> Men, and the Wrath of <hi>God</hi> abides upon us. And so I have done with the First Part of the Text, We <hi>should</hi> or <hi>ought</hi> to love <hi>God.</hi>

            <p n="2">2.

                  <item>2. That he <hi>began</hi> before we could any Way deserve it.</item>

                  <item>5. He <hi>began to love us</hi> to such a Degree as to think nothing <hi>too dear</hi> or <hi>too good</hi> for us.</item>
                  <item>6. That he so <hi>began</hi> to love us as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend by all the Arts of Importunity to <hi>court</hi> us to accept his Love: All which are very <hi>powerful</hi> Considerations to engage us to return him <hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:59595:192"/>1. He <hi>began</hi> in Love to us. Had he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged himself to <hi>re-love</hi> us whensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we began to love him, and in the mean Time remained <hi>indifferent</hi> in his Affection towards us, this would have been a <hi>mighty endearing</hi> Obligation. For the <hi>great Majesty</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> to take Notice of the Loves of such <hi>poor</hi> Worms as we, and much more to engage himself to repay them with a <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondent</hi> Affection, is in it self a <hi>noble</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of his <hi>great</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> Goodness; but that he should not only take Notice of, and return our Love, but <hi>forestal</hi> and <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate</hi> it; that he should condescend to make the <hi>first</hi> Address and Tender of Love to us, is such an Expression of Goodness as is sufficient to inflame the most <hi>stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> Soul. For he that loves <hi>another</hi> lays an Obligation upon him, and renders him extreamly beholding; he lends him his Heart and Soul which are much more <hi>valuable</hi> than Money, and he becomes his Creditor and acquires a <hi>just</hi> Claim to be repaid with <hi>mutual</hi> Affection: For not to repay Love for Love, is equally <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>ungrateful.</hi> He therefore that begins to love, doth thereby render the Person <hi>beloved</hi> his Debtor, and acquires a <hi>just</hi> Right to be Beloved by him again, though he should have no <hi>other</hi> Pretence to, or Interest in his
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:59595:193"/>
Affections, especially if he be one who is much our <hi>Superiour</hi> in all <hi>endearing</hi> Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Accomplishments; because this must needs render his Love more <hi>valuable,</hi> and consequently <hi>augment</hi> our Obligation to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love him. When therefore the <hi>great God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self shall begin to love us, who doth so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely <hi>excel</hi> us in all Manner of <hi>amiable</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, how deeply are we obliged and beholding to him? What <hi>infinite</hi> Sums of Love must we owe him? If he had laid no <hi>other</hi> Obligation upon us, had neither <hi>made,</hi> nor <hi>fed,</hi> nor <hi>clothed,</hi> nor <hi>provided</hi> for us; if he had no <hi>other</hi> Claim to our Love but only this, that he <hi>first</hi> loved us; yet this is such as we cannot frustrate without being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly <hi>unjust</hi> and <hi>ungrateful.</hi> For he is so much afore-hand in Kindness with us, hath so much gotten the start of us in Love, that we shall never be able to <hi>overtake</hi> him. He loved us long before we had a Being, when we existed only in <hi>his own</hi> Decree to make us Men, and to provide for our Happiness; so that now we are so far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind-hand in <hi>Arrears</hi> of Love to him, that we shall need, as well as have an <hi>Eternity</hi> to discharge them; and should we from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth every Moment love him <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> to the <hi>longest imaginary</hi> Period of Duration, yet we shall still owe him all that <hi>Eternity</hi> of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:59595:193"/>
Love that was due before we began to love him. And shall we grudg to pay him a <hi>Mite</hi> to whom we are indebted <hi>Millions?</hi> And is it not <hi>high</hi> Time for us to begin to love him <hi>now,</hi> who hath loved us so long already for nothing without the <hi>least</hi> Shadow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> He <hi>began</hi> to love us before we could any ways deserve it. For it is <hi>impossible</hi> for a Creature that ows all to <hi>God,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of its Being, to deserve any Thing at his Hands; because he hath every Thing from him, and so can render him nothing but what is <hi>his own</hi> already by an <hi>unaliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> Propriety. But the <hi>noblest</hi> and most <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> Sacrifice that we are able to render unto <hi>God</hi> is our <hi>hearty</hi> and <hi>unfeigned</hi> Love; and if it were possible for us any way to deserve his Love, who is so much <hi>above</hi> us, and hath such an <hi>absolute</hi> Dominion over us, it would doubtless be Offering up our Souls to him <hi>inflamed</hi> with Love and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; for tis this alone that <hi>consecrates</hi> all our Services, and renders them <hi>valuable</hi> in the Eyes of God. If Love, like an <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> Soul, be not diffused throughout all our <hi>Religion,</hi> and doth not <hi>act</hi> and <hi>animate</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Part of it, in God's Account all our <hi>demure</hi> Pretences are nothing but the <hi>life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Puppits and Images of <hi>true Religion</hi>;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:59595:194"/>
which though they may <hi>speak</hi> and <hi>move</hi> and <hi>act</hi> like that which they represent and imitate, yet want that <hi>inward</hi> Form and Principle that gives it Life and Motion; and to have nothing of <hi>Religion</hi> but merely the <hi>Shape</hi> and <hi>Outside,</hi> is as <hi>bad,</hi> at least in God's Account, as to have none at all. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis Love that gives Worth and Value to all our <hi>other</hi> Services, and renders them <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable</hi> to <hi>God</hi>; it hence necessarily follows, that it self is the most <hi>grateful</hi> Thing we can render to him, and that when <hi>this</hi> is wanting, we are so far from being <hi>capable</hi> of deserving his Love, that nothing we do can be <hi>pleasing</hi> or <hi>acceptable</hi> in his Eyes. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore since he loved us before we loved him, it is plain that it was not our Desert, but <hi>his own</hi> Goodness that first <hi>endeared</hi> him to us; for when we did not love him, we could have neither <hi>Form</hi> nor <hi>Comliness</hi> to attract his Love; our Love to him being the only Beauty that can render us <hi>amiable</hi> in his Eyes: So that he could have no <hi>other</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to incline him to love us, but only the <hi>immense</hi> Benevolence of his own Nature. Since therefore he hath loved me without any Desert of mine, can I forbear to love him who hath deserved so <hi>well</hi> of me? If he had never expressed any Kindness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, yet I have <hi>infinite</hi> Reason to love
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:59595:194"/>
him, because of the <hi>infinite</hi> Loveliness of his Nature; but when I add to this the <hi>unspeakable</hi> Love he bore me when I had neither Beauty to <hi>endear,</hi> nor Desert to <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi> him; what a <hi>tender</hi> Care he took of my Welfare, and how <hi>big</hi> his Thoughts were with Designs of Kindness to me; I am not able to reflect upon my Coldness and Indifference towards him without the <hi>greatest</hi> Shame and Confusion; especially considering,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> That he <hi>began</hi> to <hi>love</hi> us when we deserved his <hi>Hatred.</hi> And indeed if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>wretched</hi> Condition in which his Love found us when it first <hi>addressed</hi> to us, and cast its <hi>gracious</hi> Eyes upon us; we shall find <hi>sufficient</hi> Reason to wonder that it did not immediately convert into <hi>implacable</hi> Fury. For when it first looked down on us from the <hi>Battlements</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held us <hi>wallowing</hi> in our Blood, all <hi>polluted</hi> and <hi>distained</hi> with the <hi>foulest</hi> Treasons and Rebellions. It saw us unanimously engaged in an <hi>unnatural</hi> Conspiracy against the <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Author of our Beings, converting those very Faculties he bestowed upon us into <hi>Weapons</hi> of Rebellion against him, and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Effects of his Bounty against his <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> Authority. It beheld our Natures all <hi>depraved</hi> and <hi>vitiated,</hi> our Faculties all
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:59595:195"/>
               <hi>disordered</hi> and <hi>confused,</hi> our Minds <hi>surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with <hi>Egyptian Darkness,</hi> our Wills <hi>byassed</hi> with <hi>wild</hi> and <hi>irregular</hi> Inclinations, our Affections <hi>overgrown</hi> with <hi>monstrous</hi> and <hi>preternatural</hi> Lusts, and all the <hi>beautiful</hi> Structure of our Natures most miserably <hi>disfigured</hi> and <hi>deformed</hi>; and certainly one would have thought that such a <hi>loathsome</hi> Spectacle as this might have been <hi>sufficient</hi> to extinguish his Love <hi>for ever,</hi> and stifle all his <hi>tender</hi> Resentments towards us. But so <hi>invincible</hi> was his Kindness to us, that all the Deformities we had <hi>superinduced</hi> upon our Natures, all our Unworthiness to be <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> by him, all the <hi>rude</hi> Affronts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities we had offered, were not able so much as for <hi>one</hi> Moment to stop or divert the <hi>impetuous</hi> Current of his Goodness. But in the midst of so many Reasons that he had to <hi>hate</hi> us, he fixed his Love upon us; and notwithstanding the Continuance of those Reasons doth still persist to love us; and while we are <hi>abusing</hi> of his Kindness, <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honouring</hi> his Name, and <hi>trampling</hi> on his Laws and Authority, he is continually <hi>mindful</hi> and <hi>active</hi> to do us <hi>good,</hi> and doth incessantly imploy his <hi>restless</hi> Thoughts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his <hi>watchful</hi> Eye, and exert his <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> Arm to contrive, promote and procure our Happiness; as if he were resolved to be
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:59595:195"/>
as <hi>obstinate</hi> in Love, as we are in Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to contend with us for Victory, and, if it be possible, to vanquish us with the Charms of an <hi>invincible</hi> Kindness. And now methinks it should be impossible for any one that hath but the Reason of a Man to be so <hi>base</hi> and <hi>disingenuous,</hi> as not to be endeared by such a <hi>victorious</hi> Love. O <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God!</hi> dost thou <hi>love</hi> me who have so many ways deserved thy <hi>Hatred,</hi> and can I <hi>hate</hi> thee who hast so infinitely <hi>merited</hi> my Love? Have I not been <hi>long</hi> enough thine Enemy already, and hast thou not been <hi>long</hi> enough my Friend at last to thaw my <hi>obdurate</hi> Enmity, and melt me into a <hi>reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal</hi> Kindness? <hi>Barbarous Heart!</hi> Canst thou still withstand these <hi>puissant</hi> Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Almighty</hi> Love, that hath so long repay'd thee <hi>Smiles</hi> for <hi>Affronts,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thee <hi>Favours</hi> for <hi>Provocations?</hi> For shame, if thou hast any Sense of Gratitude or Modesty in thee, be at last persuaded to hearken to the Love of thy <hi>Maker,</hi> and to return him <hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> He <hi>began to love us</hi> when he could never reap the <hi>least</hi> Advantage to himself by it. Had we been <hi>capable</hi> either of <hi>benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> or <hi>injuring</hi> him, of <hi>adding</hi> to, or <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting</hi> from his Happiness, his <hi>own</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest might have obliged him to love us, or
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:59595:196"/>
at least to have pretended Kindness to us, that so he might the better obtain his Ends upon us, and engage us to contribute more <hi>freely</hi> to his Happiness. But such a <hi>poor</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, as this, is <hi>inconsistent</hi> with the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Divinity,</hi> which implies <hi>infinite</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and consequently <hi>infinite</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and for him who is infinitely <hi>happy,</hi> to design a Contribution of Happiness from his Creatures, implies a Contradiction; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the very designing of a <hi>farther</hi> Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness implies a <hi>present</hi> Want and Insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which can have no Place in a Being that is infinitely <hi>happy</hi> already. The Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of <hi>God</hi> therefore being so <hi>immense</hi> and <hi>secure</hi> that nothing can be added to, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from it, it is impossible he should love us, for any <hi>Self-interest</hi> or Advantage, it being out of the Reach of any Power whatsoever, either to <hi>benefit</hi> or <hi>injure</hi> him; and his Love to us can have no <hi>other</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign but only our Happiness and Welfare. He his infinitely <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> in himself, and consequently cannot be supposed to love us for <hi>his own</hi> Advantage, it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that he who is infinitely <hi>happy</hi> in himself should be <hi>capable</hi> of receiving any Advantage from any Thing <hi>without</hi> him; so that there can be no <hi>other</hi> End of his Love, but only to render us <hi>like himself</hi>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:59595:196"/>
compleatly <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>happy.</hi> For when he <hi>first</hi> set his Heart upon us, and chose us for his Favourites, he knew his <hi>own</hi> Happiness to be so <hi>immense</hi> and <hi>stable,</hi> as that he could never need our Love or Services, either to add more to it, or to <hi>continue</hi> and <hi>perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate</hi> it, which from <hi>Eternity</hi> to <hi>Eternity</hi> was, and is, and always will be <hi>commensurate</hi> to the <hi>boundless</hi> Capacity of his Nature. But such was his <hi>innate</hi> Goodness and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence as would not permit him to be <hi>happy</hi> alone, to content himself in a <hi>solitary</hi> Frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own <hi>essential</hi> Beatitudes; but to gratify the <hi>benign</hi> Inclinations of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he must have Companions in Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, upon whom he may diffuse his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and imprint his own Bliss and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: And 'twas only this <hi>frank</hi> and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Motive that first obliged him to cast an Eye of Love towards us. When we had neither <hi>Worth</hi> to <hi>deserve,</hi> nor <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite</hi> his Kindness, then did his <hi>own</hi> Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity incline his Heart to love us, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite and receive us into a Participation of his Happiness. He knew well enough that the most we were <hi>capable</hi> to do for him was only to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> to <hi>praise</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>adore</hi> him; and that when we had done all this, it would be impossible for him to reap the least Advantage by it;
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:59595:197"/>
that if we did <hi>love</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him, the Profit would all redound to our selves, and that if we did not, our selves only would fare the <hi>worse</hi> for it; so that whether we did or no, it would be all one to him; his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness would be still the same, without the <hi>least</hi> Addition or Substraction. And yet when Things were in this Posture, when he had no <hi>Self-interest</hi> to serve upon us, no Motive but his <hi>own</hi> Benignity to <hi>endear</hi> him to us, then did he <hi>begin</hi> to love us, and to express the Earnings of his Heart and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els towards us. And now how can we think of this, and not be affected with it? How can we any longer avoid being <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated</hi> with the Thoughts of such a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Kindness? Consider, O <hi>my Soul,</hi> thy <hi>God</hi> gains nothing by all his Love to thee, but thou gainest <hi>infinitely</hi> by thy Love to him; by loving him thou <hi>glorifiest</hi> thy self, and <hi>crownest</hi> thy <hi>own</hi> Desires with Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But he is not one <hi>jot</hi> the <hi>better</hi> for loving, nor would he have been one <hi>jot</hi> the <hi>worse</hi> if he had never loved thee at all; and yet out of <hi>pure generous</hi> Goodness he loves thee a <hi>thousand</hi> times more than thou lovest thy self, or art ever able to love him; and canst thou be such a <hi>wretched</hi> Thing, so <hi>lost</hi> to all that is <hi>ingenuous</hi> and <hi>modest</hi> as not to return him Love for Love?</p>

               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:59595:197"/>5<hi>thly.</hi> He <hi>began</hi> to love us to such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, as to think nothing <hi>too dear,</hi> or <hi>too good</hi> for us. Considering how <hi>little</hi> we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his <hi>Love,</hi> how <hi>much</hi> we have deserved his <hi>Hatred,</hi> and how <hi>uncapable</hi> we are to make him any <hi>valuable</hi> Requital; it is <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient</hi> Matter of Wonder that ever he could prevail with himself to love us in the <hi>least</hi> Degree; but that in the midst of so many Reasons to the contrary he should not only <hi>begin</hi> to love, but to be so <hi>liberal</hi> of his Kindness to us, is Matter of <hi>just</hi> Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was a <hi>mighty</hi> Kindness in him to create us what we are, and make such a <hi>plentiful</hi> Provision for our <hi>comfortable</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence here; for wheresoever we direct our Eyes, whether we reflect them <hi>inwards</hi> upon our selves, we behold his Goodness to occupy and <hi>penetrate</hi> the Root and Center of our Beings, and discern the <hi>lively</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of his Love in the <hi>incomparable</hi> Frame and Structure of our Natures; or whether we extend them <hi>abroad</hi> towards the things about us, we may perceive our selves like <hi>Fortunate Islands</hi> surrounded with an <hi>Ocean</hi> of Blessings, containing whatsoever is <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary</hi> for our Sustenance, <hi>convenient</hi> for our Use, and <hi>pleasant</hi> for our Enjoyment. And is it not <hi>wondrous</hi> Love in him to make such <hi>liberal</hi> Provisions for such <hi>undeserving</hi>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:59595:198"/>
Guests? But this is the <hi>smallest</hi> Part of his Kindness; for he hath inspired us with <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> Minds, and Stamp'd them with the most <hi>fair</hi> Impresses of his own <hi>Divinity,</hi> viz. a <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Truth, and a <hi>Love</hi> of Goodness, and a <hi>forward Capacity</hi> of the <hi>highest</hi> Perfection, and <hi>purest</hi> Happiness; and to fill and gratify these our <hi>noble</hi> Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Capacities he hath prepared for us a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>immortal</hi> Joys, and furnished it with all the Delights that this our <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven-born</hi> Mind is <hi>capable</hi> of; and lest we should fall short of it, he hath sent his <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Son</hi> from <hi>Heaven,</hi> to reveal it to us, and shew us the Way thither; to die for our Sins, and obtain and <hi>ratify</hi> the Promise of our Pardon, thereby to encourage us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to our Duty and Allegiance, without which we are <hi>incapable</hi> of ever enjoying that <hi>beatifical</hi> State. And lest all this should not be <hi>sufficient,</hi> he is always <hi>present</hi> with us to promote our Happiness; <hi>present,</hi> by his <hi>Providence</hi> to <hi>reclaim,</hi> by his <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit</hi> us, and by his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to <hi>excite</hi> and <hi>co-operate</hi> with our Endeavours: So extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>careful</hi> is he, not to be defeated of his <hi>kind</hi> Intentions, to make us <hi>everlastingly</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. <hi>O Blessed God!</hi> To what a Degree must thou love us, who thinkest none of these Things <hi>too dear</hi> and <hi>good</hi> for us? That dost
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:59595:198"/>
not think thy <hi>Son too good</hi> to redeem us, thy <hi>Spirit</hi> to Sanctify, thy <hi>everlasting Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to Crown and Reward us? And now can our Hearts hold when we think of this? Can we be <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>indifferent</hi> in the midst of such a <hi>vigorous</hi> Flame? <hi>Good God!</hi> What are we made of? What <hi>senseless, stony, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi> Souls do we carry about us, that can be <hi>Love-proof</hi> against so <hi>many</hi> Charms and Endearments; that can listen to so <hi>many</hi> Wonders of Love with such <hi>unconcerned,</hi> such <hi>unaffected</hi> Minds? Methinks if we had but the <hi>common</hi> Sense and Ingenuity of Men in us, it would be impossible for us in the midst of so much Love, not to be melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a <hi>reciprocal</hi> Kindness.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>thly</hi> And lastly, He so <hi>began</hi> to love us, as to condescend by all the Arts of Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to <hi>court</hi> us to accept of his Love. That notwithstanding all our Unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he should begin to love us, and that to so <hi>strange</hi> a Degree, is a most <hi>amazing</hi> Instance of the <hi>infinite</hi> Benevolence of his Nature; but that he should condescend to <hi>address</hi> himself to us, to <hi>court</hi> and <hi>woo</hi> us as he doth to accept of his Love, and to be as <hi>happy</hi> as he would have us, is enough to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish the most <hi>insensible</hi> Soul, and even to dissolve a Heart of <hi>Rock</hi> into Love. For thus the <hi>Scripture</hi> in the most <hi>pathetick</hi>
               <pb n="390" facs="tcp:59595:199"/>
Strains describes the Addresses of this <hi>great</hi> Lover of Souls, borrowing <hi>Metaphors</hi> to express his Love to us, from all that is <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>loving</hi> in the Creation; even from the most <hi>melting</hi> Passions in Mankind; from the <hi>Relentings</hi> of Fathers, and <hi>Yearnings</hi> of Mothers Bowels towards their <hi>dearest</hi> Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring. It paints him in all the <hi>charming</hi> Postures of an <hi>imploring, beseeching,</hi> and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate</hi> Lover, wooing and intreating us to be <hi>happy,</hi> even with <hi>Tears</hi> of Pity in his Eyes, with <hi>Charms</hi> of Love in his Mouth, and <hi>Tenders</hi> of Mercy in his Hands. And when with all the <hi>Rhetorick</hi> of his Love he can't prevail with us to live, it represents him <hi>weeping</hi> at our <hi>Funerals,</hi> and like a <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hearted</hi> Judge pronouncing our <hi>Sentence</hi> with the Tears in his Eyes. By which <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorical</hi> Descriptions he represents to us his <hi>infinite</hi> Concern for our Happiness; how much his Heart is set upon it; and how hardly he can bear a Defeat in his <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Intentions towards us. For what but an <hi>infinite</hi> Love could ever have made the King of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to stoop so low to his <hi>rebellious</hi> Subjects, as to beseech them to lay down their Weapons of <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> with which they can injure none but themselves, and to listen to his Terms of Mercy, and accept of his Crowns and <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting</hi>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:59595:199"/>
Preferments? One would have thought it had been enough for him barely to have told us how he loved us, how willing he was to <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Advance</hi> us; and that this had been enough <hi>for ever</hi> to recommend him to the <hi>dearest</hi> Affections of his Creatures; but that he should more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over condescend to <hi>supplicate</hi> our Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to <hi>beseech</hi> us not to spurn his Love, and <hi>frustrate</hi> its Designs of Mercy to us; <hi>Lord,</hi> how can we think of this without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all <hi>inflamed</hi> with Love to thee! 'Tis true, he doth not come in Person to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are not able to bear the <hi>immediate</hi> Approaches of his Glory; but many a Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Love he hath sent us transcribed from his very Heart. He sent his <hi>Son</hi> from <hi>Heaven</hi> to us, and clothed him in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that therein we might be <hi>capable</hi> of conversing freely with him; and all his Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand was to deliver a Message of Love to the World, and to <hi>court</hi> and <hi>importune</hi> them to listen to, and comply with it. And when he returned again to his Father, he insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted an <hi>Order of Men</hi> to supply his Room, and in his Stead, to <hi>woo</hi> the World to be <hi>happy.</hi> For <hi>we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: We pray you in Christ</hi>'s <hi>stead, be ye reconciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.20. So that you are set upon the
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:59595:200"/>
Throne, and not only Men, but <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self lies <hi>prostrate</hi> before your <hi>Foot-stool</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching you to lay down your Arms, and to be reconciled to your <hi>best</hi> Friend that never did you the <hi>least</hi> Injury, unless that be one that he hath loved you <hi>better</hi> by a <hi>Thousand</hi> Degrees than ever you loved your selves. And can we be such <hi>barbarous</hi> Wretches as not to listen to him when he thus <hi>humbles</hi> himself before us, and even comes upon his Knees to us for Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? How justly may the <hi>whole</hi> Creation be astonished to see the <hi>great</hi> Majesty of <hi>Heaven</hi> condescend so <hi>low</hi> as to <hi>beseech</hi> and <hi>entreat</hi> a Company of <hi>rude, disdainful</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, whom he could every Moment <hi>frown</hi> into Nothing, to accept of his Love, and at last comply with Terms of Friendship? Who would ever imagine, (but that <hi>sad</hi> Experience evinces the contrary,) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings there should be found such <hi>Monsters of Ingratitude,</hi> as to persist in Enmity to <hi>God</hi> after he hath thus <hi>humbled</hi> himself, and made so many <hi>lowly</hi> Addresses only to <hi>court</hi> and <hi>woo</hi> us to be <hi>happy?</hi> And thus you see how many <hi>puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant</hi> Motives to Love are comprehended in these <hi>few</hi> Words, <hi>because he first loved us</hi>; which are such as nothing can ever be able to resist but a Heart that is <hi>steeled</hi> with
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:59595:200"/>
               <hi>Impudence</hi> and <hi>Ingratitude.</hi> So that if after all these Obligations which <hi>God</hi> hath laid upon us we do not at last surrender <hi>up</hi> our Hearts unto him, our <hi>Baseness</hi> and <hi>Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> is such as nothing but our <hi>eternal</hi> Ruine will be able to expiate. For when with all the Endearments of his <hi>Loving kindness</hi> he finds he cannnot prevail on us to love him, the very Consideration how <hi>much</hi> he hath obliged us, and what <hi>unworthy</hi> Requitals we have made him, will but incense him the more against us, till it hath converted his Kindness into <hi>implacable</hi> Fury; and when once the Heats of <hi>wronged</hi> Love take Fire, and <hi>kindle</hi> into Wrath, it will be a <hi>quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Flame and <hi>everlasting</hi> Burning. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Name of <hi>God,</hi> Sirs, let us endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to affect our Souls with the Sense of this <hi>dear</hi> Love, to warm our Affections at this <hi>heavenly</hi> Fire till it hath <hi>insinuated</hi> it self into them, and converted them into its <hi>own</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And that we may be <hi>succesful</hi> herein, let us take with us these <hi>following</hi> Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us season our Minds with <hi>good</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of God: For since 'tis his Goodness that is the most <hi>immediate</hi> Object of our Love to him, whatsoever Opinions do reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>that,</hi> or any way tend to <hi>cloud</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace</hi> it, must necessarily <hi>Damp</hi> our Affection towards him. Whilst therefore we look
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:59595:201"/>
upon <hi>God</hi> as a <hi>mere arbitrary</hi> Being, as one that conducts all his Actions by a <hi>blind Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent</hi> Self-will, and governs the World and dispenses <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> to his Creatures according to a <hi>certain fatal</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, which he made without Foresight or Consideration; as one that exacts Impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities of his Subjects, commands the <hi>Lame</hi> to <hi>run,</hi> the <hi>Blind</hi> to <hi>see,</hi> and without ever enabling them thereunto is resolved to <hi>damn</hi> them <hi>forever</hi> for <hi>Non-performance</hi>: Whilst, I say, we look upon <hi>God</hi> through such <hi>false</hi> Opticks as these, they must needs represent him exceeding <hi>unlovely</hi> in our Eyes. For though I doubt not but there are <hi>many</hi> Men that love God heartily, notwithstanding they have entertained these <hi>sower</hi> and <hi>gastly</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of him; yet I must seriously profess had I such <hi>black</hi> Opinions of him, I should never be able heartily to love him, though I were sure to be damned <hi>for ever</hi> for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it. Wherefore, if we would kindle in our Souls the Love of <hi>God,</hi> let us take Care, as much as in us lies, to purge our Thoughts of all <hi>ill</hi> Opinions of him, and to represent him fairly to our Minds what he truly is, and what the <hi>Scripture</hi> represents him to be, <hi>viz.</hi> a most <hi>bountiful</hi> Benefactor unto all his Creation, and an <hi>universal</hi> Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Souls of Men; one that heartily
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:59595:201"/>
desires our Welfare, and is always ready to contribute to us whatsoever is <hi>necessary</hi> thereunto. Let us firmly persuade our selves that he desires not our Ruine, but would <hi>have all Men to be saved, and come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth</hi>; that when he finally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys any <hi>particular</hi> Offender, it is in <hi>great</hi> Mercy to the <hi>Publick</hi>; that he loves not Punishment for its <hi>own</hi> Sake, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts it but for some <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> End. These are such Thoughts of <hi>God</hi> as are truly <hi>worthy</hi> of him, and infinitely apt to <hi>endear</hi> him to all <hi>considering</hi> Minds.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Let us frequently consider and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in our Minds the <hi>numerous</hi> Reasons and Engagements that we have to love him. For all Virtue whatsoever begins in Consideration, and it being a <hi>rational</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, cannot be otherwise acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red but only by <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> that is, by considering the Reasons and pressing our selves with the Arguments upon which it is founded. And thus we must do in the Case before us; if ever we would attain to a <hi>hearty</hi> Love of <hi>God,</hi> we must be often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining our Thoughts with the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of those <hi>great</hi> Obligations he hath laid upon us to love him; how deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are engaged by all the Ties of <hi>Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> and <hi>Ingenuity</hi> to repay him in his <hi>own</hi>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:59595:202"/>
Coin, and to return him <hi>Love</hi> for <hi>Love.</hi> Nor will it be <hi>sufficient</hi> to affect our Hearts with the Sense of those Obligations, now and then to reflect a <hi>few slight</hi> and <hi>transient</hi> Thoughts on them, but with <hi>holy David</hi> we must muse on till the Fire Kindles; we must fix and stay our Thoughts upon the Consideration of God's <hi>endearing</hi> Love to us, urge and press them <hi>again</hi> and <hi>again</hi> till we have wrought and chafed them into our Souls, and a <hi>heavenly</hi> Warmth diffuses from them and <hi>enflames</hi> our Hearts with a <hi>divine</hi> Affection. Wherefore let us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently revolve such Thoughts as these in our Minds; <hi>O my Soul! How infinitely art thou obliged to love thy God, who hath been such a tender Friend and liberal Benefactor to thee, who loved thee before ever thou wast ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thinking a Thought of Love towards him; yea, and when thou didst most justly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be excommunicated from his Favour for ever, and who had no other Aim in loving thee, but to do thee good, and make thee happy, and thought nothing too good for thee that could either promote or compleat thy Happiness; but is so importunately concerned for thee as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech and intreat thee not to reject his Favours? And canst thou be cold and insensible in the midst of so many prevailing Endearments? Suppose that thy Fellow-creature had done for
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:59595:202"/>
thee but a thousandth Part of what thy God hath done, and thou hadst repayed his Kindness with nothing but Affronts and Indignities; wouldst thou not call thy self a thousand ungrateful Wretches, and acknowledge thy self infinitely unworthy of his Favours? And is it less crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to be ungrateful to God, than to thy Fellow-creature? Suppose thou hadst a Friend that began to love thee as soon as thou wast born, and had persisted to love thee, notwithstanding thou hadst offered him a thousand Provocations to the contrary; that had done thee all the good he was able, and constantly repaid thy Injuries with Favours: Would not thy Conscience fly in thy Face, and all that is humane in thee upbraid thy monstrous Baseness? And hath not thy God obliged thee infinitely more than the best Friend in the World? How then canst thou excuse thy Coldness and Indifference to him? Consider, O my Soul, the Eyes of all the spiritual World are upon thee; Angels and Saints are looking down from their Thrones of Glory to see how thou wilt acquit thy self under all these mighty Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations, which if any mortal Friend had laid them upon thee, and thou shouldst have so ill requited him, all the World would have hissed at thee for a Monster of Ingratitude. And is it less infamous to be an ungrateful Wretch to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, than towards a mortal Friend? With what Confidence then wilt thou lift up
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:59595:203"/>
thy head among those blessed Spirits who have been Spectators of thy Actions, who have seen thy foul Ingratitude towards thy best Friend, and must therefore brand thee for an inglorious Wretch abandoned of the common Sense and Modesty of humane Nature?</hi> And if after you have pressed you Souls with all this <hi>mighty</hi> Weight of Love, you should be still to learn to <hi>re-love</hi> the <hi>blessed</hi> Author of it, I know no <hi>other</hi> Expedient but to send you to the <hi>Brutes</hi> to be their <hi>Scholars</hi>; to call for your <hi>Spaniels</hi> and bid them teach you, and by their <hi>kind</hi> Returns of your Favours instruct your <hi>cold ungrateful</hi> Hearts, to make <hi>proportionate</hi> Returns of Love to your <hi>dearest</hi> Lord and Master. Thus let us fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently argue with our selves, and repeat these Considerations upon our Minds; and certainly if we have any Sense of Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they cannot fail of <hi>warming</hi> and <hi>affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> our Hearts.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Let us endeavour so much as in us lies to <hi>moderate</hi> our Affections to the World. <hi>Love not the World,</hi> saith St. <hi>John, neither the things that are in the World. If any Man love the World, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Epist. ii.15. that is, if we <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately</hi> love and dote upon the World, if we suffer its <hi>Pleasures, Profits,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> to creep into, to hamper and inveagle
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:59595:203"/>
our Affections into an <hi>excessive</hi> Delight and Complacency in them, that will so forestal and prepossess us, that we shall find no Room for the Love of <hi>God</hi> in our Souls: Our Hearts will be so <hi>soaked</hi> and <hi>moistened</hi> with <hi>sensual</hi> Desires and Complacencies, that the <hi>pure</hi> Flame of <hi>divine</hi> Love will never be able to take hold of, or kindle upon them. For whilst we immoderately dote upon the World, <hi>that</hi> will so <hi>ingross</hi> our Thoughts, so perpetually <hi>importune</hi> our Desires, that no Friend from <hi>Heaven</hi> will ever be able to come at us; no <hi>good</hi> Thought or Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that comes to <hi>court</hi> and <hi>woo</hi> our Souls for <hi>God</hi> will ever find Admittance to them; or if <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> they obtrude upon us, and force themselves into our Minds, the World will be so <hi>buisy</hi> about us that we shall not be long at Leasure to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them; but whilst they are addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to us and importuning our Affections, we shall feel a thousand <hi>Rival Thoughts</hi> swarming and buzzing about us, and <hi>this</hi> will be holding, <hi>that</hi> pulling, the <hi>other</hi> clasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self about us and <hi>wooing</hi> us not to leave and forsake them. And though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween these Competitors for our Love, our Hearts may <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> be a little <hi>waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>irresolute</hi>; yet our <hi>fond</hi> Partiality to the World will so vehemently incline
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:59595:204"/>
and <hi>biass</hi> us, that we shall soon reject those <hi>divine</hi> Thoughts that would so fain court us to a <hi>contrary</hi> Affection. Wherefore, if ever we would acquire this <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Virtue of <hi>divine</hi> Love, we must endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour as much as in us lies to <hi>wean</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our selves from the World; to rescue our selves from under it's Tyranny and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, into <hi>our own</hi> Power, that so we may be able to dispose of our Time, our Thoughts and Hearts, as shall seem to us most <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reasonable.</hi> For till we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered our Hearts from the World into <hi>our own</hi> Disposal, how can we resign them to <hi>God?</hi> Before we can give him our selves, we must be in <hi>our own</hi> Power, which no Man can be, so long as he is <hi>inthralled</hi> to the World. Wherefore, if we would become <hi>hearty</hi> Lovers of <hi>God,</hi> we must labour so much as in us lies to get such a <hi>Sovereignty</hi> over our <hi>earthly</hi> Desires and Affections, as that whensoever we are minded to retire from the World and converse with <hi>God,</hi> we may be able to keep them <hi>off</hi> at such a Distance as that they may not be able to intrude upon us, to mingle themselves with our Contemplations, and divert our Eyes from the <hi>endearing</hi> Prospect of his <hi>infinite</hi> Love and Loveliness. And then our Thoughts will stay and dwell upon this <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing</hi>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:59595:204"/>
Theme like <hi>Bees</hi> upon a <hi>sweet</hi> Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and never rise till they have extracted thence the <hi>Honey</hi> of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the <hi>delicious</hi> Sweets of <hi>heavenly</hi> Love and Complacency; then we shall muse on till the Fire burns, and never take <hi>off</hi> our Eyes from <hi>God</hi> till we have <hi>gazed</hi> our selves into Captivity to his Love and Beauty.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> If we would attain to the Love of <hi>God,</hi> we must endeavour, by the <hi>constant</hi> Practice of what is <hi>agreeable</hi> to his Nature, to reconcile our Minds and Tempers to it. For whilst our Minds are <hi>averse</hi> to the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Nature, to the <hi>Justice, Purity,</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of it, the most <hi>powerful</hi> Motives of his Love and Benevolence will never be able to beget in us an <hi>hearty</hi> Complacencey in him. We may admire his Love to us, and be sometimes moved by the consideration of it into <hi>mighty</hi> Transports of <hi>sensitive</hi> Passion; but 'tis impossible we should ever attain to a <hi>fix'd</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> Delight in him till we are reconciled to his Nature. For all <hi>true</hi> and <hi>constant</hi> Love is founded in a Likeness of Natures; and therefore till we are in some Measure <hi>god-like,</hi> till we are <hi>pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure, just</hi> as he is <hi>just, good</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> as he is <hi>good</hi> and <hi>merciful,</hi> we have not as yet so much as laid the Foundation of <hi>divine</hi> Love; nay we are so far from <hi>that,</hi> that we

are under a <hi>prevalent</hi> Repugnancy and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy to the <hi>divine</hi> Nature. Wherefore if ever we would be <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>hearty</hi> Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>God,</hi> we must resolve to betake our selves to the <hi>constant</hi> Practice of all those <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Laws of Goodness that are founded in his <hi>blessed</hi> Nature; which if we do, and persist in our Resolution, we shall find the Practice of them will by Degrees render them first <hi>tollerable,</hi> then <hi>easie,</hi> then <hi>delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> then <hi>natural</hi> to us. And when once the Laws of God's Nature are thus <hi>transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed</hi> and <hi>copyed</hi> into ours, when our Hearts and his stand bent the <hi>same</hi> Way, and are for the <hi>main</hi> alike <hi>inclined</hi> and <hi>disposed</hi>; then we are prepared for <hi>divine</hi> Love, made <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>convenient</hi> Fuel to receive that <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly</hi> Flame. For as when <hi>God</hi> sees <hi>himself</hi> in us, his <hi>Goodness, Purity</hi> and <hi>Holiness</hi> stampt and impressed upon our Natures, he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined by his own <hi>Self-love</hi> to be pleased with, and take Complacency in us; so when we come to see <hi>our</hi> selves in <hi>God,</hi> to see all that in him for which we value our selves, and to see it all in the <hi>utmost</hi> Perfection in him which is yet so <hi>imperfect</hi> in our selves; <hi>our own</hi> Self-love will <hi>endear</hi> him to us and <hi>wing</hi> our Souls with an <hi>active vigorous</hi> Love to him. Wherefore, if we would love <hi>God,</hi> let us live in the Practice
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:59595:205"/>
of all <hi>god-like</hi> Virtues till by accustoming our selves thereunto we have conquered <hi>our own</hi> Repugnancies and Antipathies to his <hi>blessed</hi> Nature; and then our Hearts will stand <hi>open</hi> to his Love, and we shall feel it enter into us, and insinuate it self into our Wills and Affections, like a <hi>sprightful</hi> and <hi>active</hi> Flame, till it hath all <hi>inflamed</hi> them with Love, and <hi>converted</hi> them into its <hi>own</hi> Substance.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly, If we would acquire this <hi>heavenly</hi> Virtue, to all the <hi>foregoing</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, we must add <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>earnest</hi> Prayer to <hi>God</hi> For when we have done all, it is most certain that without the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of this Grace we cannot love him; but if we do all, and then implore and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate his Assistance, we have as much As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of it, as the Promise of Truth it self can give us. If therefore we have a <hi>hearty</hi> Mind to love him, we shall both do <hi>our own</hi> Part towards it, and earnestly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore him to do <hi>his.</hi> For so when we petition for our <hi>daily</hi> Bread, we do not say our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and then sit down with our Hands in our Bosoms, expecting that <hi>Bread</hi> should drop from <hi>Heaven</hi> into our Mouths; but we presently betake our selves to some <hi>honest</hi> Imployment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in diligently endeavour to obtain what we
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:59595:206"/>
pray for. And the same Course we shall take if we desire to love <hi>God</hi> with the same Sincerity as we desire Food: We shall <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>endeavour,</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> and <hi>pray</hi>; we should be diligent in doing what is in <hi>our</hi> Power, and be <hi>importunate</hi> with <hi>God</hi> to do what is only in <hi>his.</hi> And certainly did we but know the Worth of this <hi>heavenly</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, this <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of all other Graces, we should count <hi>no</hi> Prayers, <hi>no</hi> Tears, <hi>no</hi> Endeavours <hi>too</hi> much to purchase and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it. Did we but consider how <hi>useful</hi> and <hi>delightful</hi> it is, how at once it entices and inlivens Men, what a <hi>powerful</hi> Byass it claps upon their Hearts to incline them to their Duty, and with what Joy and Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness it carries them through the <hi>greatest</hi> Difficulties, and turns their Toils into Recreations; how it <hi>clears</hi> and <hi>smooths</hi> their Countenance, <hi>revives</hi> and <hi>elevates</hi> their Hearts: Did Men, I say, but consider this, they would give neither themselves nor <hi>Heaven</hi> Rest till they felt their <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Souls inspired and animated with it. Wherefore to all our Endeavours after it, let us joyn our <hi>earnest</hi> Prayers to <hi>God</hi> that he would kindle our <hi>stupid</hi> Hearts, and touch our <hi>cold</hi> Affections with an <hi>outstretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Ray from himself; that he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer our Repugnance to him, and represent
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:59595:206"/>
his Love and Beauty to our Souls in such <hi>affecting</hi> and <hi>attractive</hi> Forms as may not fail to captivate our Hearts, and subdue our obstinate Wills that have so long held out against all the Storms and Batteries of his <hi>endearing</hi> Goodness. And if we thus <hi>pray,</hi> and thus <hi>endeavour,</hi> and persevere in <hi>both,</hi> we shall at length most certainly feel this <hi>heavenly</hi> Grace springing up within us, and growing on to Maturity by <hi>insensible</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till at last it hath gotten an <hi>entire</hi> Possession of our Souls, and subdued all our Powers and Affections to it's <hi>sweet</hi> and <hi>bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> Empire; And then we shall feel our selves acted in <hi>Religion</hi> by a <hi>new</hi> Soul, and carried on through all its <hi>weary</hi> Stages with an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable</hi> Life and Vigour; then all our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be <hi>naturalized</hi> to us, and we shall do God's Will upon <hi>Earth</hi> with almost the same Chearfulness and Alacrity, as it is done by our <hi>blessed</hi> Brethren in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Which <hi>God</hi> of his <hi>infinite</hi> Mercy grant: To whom be Honour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>BY <hi>Righteousness</hi> here some <hi>Expositors</hi> understand the Righteousness of <hi>Punishment</hi>; because in the <hi>forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Verse it is said, <hi>upon the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he shall rain snares, Fire and Brimstone,</hi> &amp;c. and then it follows why he shall do it; <hi>for the Righteous Lord loveth Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi> But considering the whole; I rather believe that by <hi>Righteousness</hi> here is meant Righteousness of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi>: For it seems more <hi>probable</hi> that the Text is a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>two former</hi> Verses, than of that immediately foregoing; but the whole that is asserted is this, <hi>the Lord tryeth the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but the wicked and him that loveth Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, his Soul hateth. Vpon the wicked he shall rain snares,</hi> &amp;c. As if he should have said; there is a <hi>vast</hi> Difference between Gods dealing with the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked</hi>; for though sometimes he afflicts the <hi>Righteous,</hi> yet 'tis only to prove and try them, and to render their Virtue more
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:59595:207"/>
               <hi>exemplary</hi> and <hi>illustrious</hi>; but as for the <hi>Wicked,</hi> when he rains down Punishments on them, it is out of a <hi>just</hi> Hatred and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against them. And the Reason why he is thus differently affected towards these <hi>different</hi> Persons is, because of the <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> Affection he bears towards their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> Qualifications; he loves the <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness</hi> of the Righteous, and that makes him chasten them in love, and for <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>merciful</hi> Ends and Purposes; but he hates the <hi>Wickedness</hi> of the Wicked, and that makes him proceed against them with so much Wrath and Severity. So that by <hi>Righteousness</hi> here he means that Goodness and Virtue which is <hi>inherent</hi> in <hi>righteous</hi> Persons, is evident from what follows; <hi>the righteous Lord loveth righteousness, his countenance doth behold the upright</hi>; that is, he looks upon them with a most <hi>gracious</hi> and <hi>benevolent</hi> Aspect; which <hi>latter</hi> Words being only a <hi>fuller</hi> Exemplification of the <hi>former,</hi> plainly shew that by the <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> mentioned in them is meant the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of <hi>righteous</hi> Persons, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it doth not signify the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of <hi>Punishment,</hi> but the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Manners:</hi> By which we are not to understand that <hi>single</hi> Virtue of <hi>Honesty</hi> or <hi>Justice,</hi> but all the Virtues, or Virtue in
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:59595:208"/>
the general in its <hi>utmost</hi> Compass and Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. For so in the <hi>sacred Dialect</hi> it is very <hi>usual</hi> to express the <hi>whole</hi> Duty of Man by Righteousness. So <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.34. <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness exalteh a Nation, but Sin is a reproach to any People</hi>; where the Opposition plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implies that by <hi>Righteousness</hi> we are to understand all that is <hi>contrary</hi> to Sin; that is, all that is contained within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of our Duty. So also <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.9. <hi>thou hast loved Righteousness, and hated Iniquity</hi>; where <hi>Righteousness</hi> being opposed to <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Transgression of the Law in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, must according to the Rule of Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition be understood in the <hi>same</hi> Latitude to signify all Obedience to the Law in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. And indeed all our Duty being a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Due, either to <hi>God,</hi> our <hi>Neighbour,</hi> or our <hi>selves,</hi> the whole may very well be expressed by <hi>Righteousness,</hi> the Performance of every one of them being an Act of <hi>strict</hi> Justice, the Payment of a <hi>due</hi> Debt, either to <hi>our selves</hi> or <hi>others.</hi> The Meaning therefore of the Words is this; <hi>God,</hi> who himself is infinitely <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> is a <hi>constant hearty</hi> Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> in others where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he sees or finds it.

            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> God loves Righteousness, or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as it is an <hi>essential</hi> Perfection of his <hi>own</hi> Nature. For supposing <hi>God</hi> to be a <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Being, as all acknowledge him to be who acknowledge him at all, he must be in all Respects most perfectly <hi>reasonable,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise he would be <hi>deficient</hi> of that <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Perfection which the very Notion and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:59595:209"/>
               <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>God</hi> implies; and if he be perfectly <hi>reasonable,</hi> he must be supposed to govern himself, his <hi>Choices, Motions</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> by the <hi>truest, best,</hi> and <hi>purest</hi> Reason: And herein consists the <hi>perfect</hi> Holiness and Righteousness which the <hi>Essence</hi> and Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>God</hi> implies, in a <hi>perfect</hi> Conformity of all his Choices and Actions to the <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> Reason of his own Mind, in <hi>chusing</hi> to do every thing which <hi>right</hi> Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son requires, and <hi>refusing</hi> to do any thing which it forbids. And this is so <hi>essential</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> that to exclude it out of the Notion of him is in Effect to deny his Being, or which is worse, to fancy him an <hi>Almighty blind Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyphemus,</hi> that hath an Arm of <hi>infinite</hi> Force, but no Eye in his Head to guid or direct it. When therefore we submit all our <hi>Choices</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> to the Conduct and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>right</hi> Reason, we <hi>stear</hi> our Course by Gods <hi>Compass,</hi> and live and move by the self-same Rule whereby he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns himself, and all his Motions. And when we do what <hi>God</hi> would have us, we are sure to do what <hi>right</hi> Reason requires, because we are sure he would have us do nothing but what is <hi>agreeable</hi> with the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> Reason of his <hi>own</hi> Mind. When therefore we submit our Wills to God's, our Wills and his are governed by the <hi>self-same</hi>
               <pb n="411" facs="tcp:59595:209"/>
Reason, even by the most <hi>perfect</hi> Reason of his <hi>All-comprehending</hi> Mind, which never can deceive or be deceived. And when our <hi>Wills, Affections</hi> and <hi>Inclinations</hi> are once reduced under the Government of God's Reason, we are of the <hi>same</hi> Temper with <hi>God,</hi> because we are formed and tempered by the <hi>same</hi> Reason; we are affected and inclined as he his, and are made Partakers of his <hi>divine</hi> Nature; we are <hi>pure</hi> as he is <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> as he is <hi>holy,</hi> and do commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate with him in all that Righteousness and Goodness which is the <hi>essential</hi> Glory and Perfection of his <hi>own</hi> Nature. So that Holiness and Righteousness in <hi>us</hi> being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>Ray</hi> and <hi>Representation</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> it is no more Wonder that he loves it than that he loves himself, it being nothing but <hi>himself</hi> derived, his <hi>own</hi> Perfection copyed out and transcribed into our Temper and Natures. Were the <hi>Sun</hi> a <hi>living</hi> Being, we cannot imagine but as he would be infinitely pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own <hi>inherent</hi> Brightness, so he would be greatly delighted to behold that <hi>vast</hi> Sphere of Light which he diffuses round about him; to see his own <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stretch'd</hi> Rays shining through this <hi>Spacious</hi> World, and glorifying with their <hi>quick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections all those <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>opaque</hi> Bodies that are continually moving round about him.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:59595:210"/>
How then can we imagine that the <hi>living God,</hi> who is infinitely <hi>glorious</hi> in Holiness himself, and loves himself infinitely for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, can without <hi>vast</hi> Delight and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction behold his <hi>own</hi> Beauty, Light, and Purity, shining on the Face of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; that he should not be <hi>enamoured</hi> with the Reflexions of that which is the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his <hi>own</hi> Being, and take <hi>infinite</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency when he looks down from his Throne, and beholds his Creatures <hi>gilded</hi> with his Rays, and glorifyed with his <hi>own</hi> Glory? For if <hi>God</hi> love himself, he must love what is <hi>suitable</hi> to himself; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently since himself is <hi>Righteous,</hi> he must love Righteousness, or quarrel with the Perfection of his <hi>own</hi> Nature. And this Reason of his Love of Righteousness is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the very Words, <hi>The righteous Lord loveth righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> He loves Righteousness and <hi>true</hi> Goodness, as it is the <hi>main</hi> Principle and Foundation of his <hi>own</hi> Happiness. For if he were not <hi>just,</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> he would be a <hi>miserable</hi> Being, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his Power and Knowledge; for though by these he might defend himself from all <hi>foreign</hi> Hurt or Injury, yet could he not secure his <hi>own</hi> Content by them, or enjoy himself with any Peace or Pleasure.
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:59595:210"/>
For <hi>perfect</hi> Holiness, as I have shewed you, consists in an <hi>exact</hi> Conformity of Actions to the <hi>eternal</hi> Rules of Reason; but <hi>God</hi> having a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> Comprehension of the <hi>eternal</hi> Reasons of Things, could never be satisfied with himself if he should <hi>act</hi> Unreasonably, because his Reason would condemn his Practice, and his <hi>own</hi> Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge would <hi>libel</hi> and <hi>upbraid</hi> him. For whenever he reflected on himself, his own <hi>All-seeing</hi> Eye would detect him, and by unmasking the Deformity of his Actions would render him an <hi>inglorious</hi> Spectacle to himself. How then could he enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, whilst in the Glass of his <hi>own</hi> Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he beheld himself so odiously Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented? What Content could he take in his <hi>own</hi> Choices and Actions, whilst his own <hi>infallible</hi> Reason disapproved them, and their Unreasonablness exposed them to the <hi>just</hi> Reproaches of his <hi>own</hi> Mind? No certainly, should he any ways swerve in his <hi>own</hi> Choices, Affections, or Actions from the <hi>eternal</hi> Reason of his <hi>own</hi> Mind, he would be so far from being pleased with himself, that he would be his own <hi>eternal</hi> Torment; and that <hi>infinite</hi> Reason which he himself cannot deceive or impose on, would so Expose and Shame him, that whensoever he reviewed himself he would
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:59595:211"/>
be sure to appear a most <hi>gastly</hi> Spectacle in his <hi>own</hi> Eyes. That therefore which renders him so infinitely <hi>happy</hi> in himself, is not so much the Power he hath to defend himself from <hi>foreign</hi> Hurts and Injuries, as the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi> Agreement of all his Motions and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the <hi>all-comprehending</hi> Reason of his <hi>own</hi> Mind. He always sees what is <hi>best,</hi> and what he so sees he always <hi>chuses</hi> and <hi>affects</hi>; and this makes him perfectly satisfied with himself, and fills him with <hi>infinite</hi> Joy and Complacency. When e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he surveys himself in the <hi>glorious</hi> Mirror of his <hi>own</hi> Mind, he discerns nothing in himself but what is infinitely <hi>lovely</hi> and <hi>ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> nothing but what exactly corresponds with the <hi>fairest</hi> Idea of his own <hi>infinite</hi> Reason; every Thing in him is as it should be, every Motion and every Action so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>good</hi> and exactly <hi>reasonable,</hi> that his own <hi>all-seeing</hi> Eye can discern no possible Degree of Perfection wanting in them; and this makes him <hi>infinitely</hi> pleased with himself, <hi>infinitely</hi> joyed and contented in the Prospect of his <hi>own</hi> Beauty and Glory. So that God's <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Righteousness,</hi> or which is the same Thing, the <hi>exact</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his <hi>Choices</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> with the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible</hi> Reason of his <hi>own</hi> Mind, being the Principle and <hi>eternal</hi> Spring of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:59595:211"/>
it is no Wonder if he loves it where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he finds it; for how should he forbear being <hi>pleased</hi> and <hi>delighted</hi> with it, when he hath such a <hi>continued</hi> Experiment of the <hi>blessed</hi> Effects of it in his <hi>own</hi> Bosom; when he feels himself made <hi>happy</hi> by it, and hath every Moment a <hi>fresh</hi> Relish of the Joys and Pleasures which result from it? Can he be so <hi>insensible</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Happiness as not to be enamoured with the <hi>blessed</hi> Cause of it? Or can the Tree be <hi>indifferent</hi> to him, when the Fruit of it is so infinitely <hi>grateful?</hi> No certainly, it is impossible but that the <hi>eternal</hi> Sense he hath in himself of the <hi>Joy,</hi> the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> the <hi>Bliss</hi> of being <hi>holy,</hi> should infinitely <hi>endear</hi> Holiness to him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage his Soul in an <hi>everlasting</hi> Love of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> God loves Righteousness as it is an <hi>Improvement</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures into his <hi>own</hi> Likeness and Resemblance. Every Being that loves it self, naturally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, so far as it is able, to <hi>derive</hi> it self, to beget its <hi>own</hi> Image and propagate its <hi>own</hi> Likeness and Resemblance; which is an <hi>immediate</hi> Consequence of that Principle of Self-love that is in us, which inclines us to <hi>encrease</hi> and <hi>multiply</hi> our selves, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse and spread <hi>our own</hi> Tempers and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And no Wonder then that <hi>God,</hi> who is the <hi>best</hi> of Beings, and whose Love
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:59595:212"/>
to himself is as <hi>infinite</hi> as his <hi>own</hi> Beauties and Perfections, should affect to <hi>derive</hi> and <hi>communicate</hi> himself, to <hi>beget</hi> and <hi>propagate</hi> his own most <hi>amiable</hi> Image in his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The <hi>infinite</hi> Love which he bears to himself cannot but engage him to <hi>like</hi> and approve his <hi>own</hi> Likeness; and what he <hi>likes</hi> he must needs be inclined to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce where it is not, and to love where it is. But now Righteousness, being that <hi>moral</hi> Attribute which comprises all those Perfections of his Nature, wherein the Beauty and Glory of it consists, is the only Accomplishment that can render a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>like</hi> him in that which renders him so infinitely <hi>lovely</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> Eyes. As for <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, Omniscence, Eternity,</hi> and <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence,</hi> they are <hi>amiable</hi> only as they are crowned with <hi>infinite</hi> Righteousness and Goodness, and abstracted from these they have nothing of Form or Comeliness in them. That therefore which moulds us into a Resemblance of <hi>God,</hi> and renders us <hi>like</hi> him in that which is the Beauty of all his <hi>other</hi> Attributes, is Righteousness; and therefore this he must love if he love himself, because tis his <hi>own</hi> Image: As for <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> and <hi>length of Duration,</hi> though we should partake of them with him to the <hi>highest</hi> Degree that is possible for Creatures,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:59595:212"/>
yet we may be infinitely <hi>unlike</hi> him; for so the <hi>Devils</hi> are, who yet are liberally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with these <hi>natural Perfections</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi>; but the more they imploy their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Knowledge</hi> to <hi>unrighteous</hi> Purposes, the more <hi>ungodlike</hi> they are for being <hi>power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi>; and then only are <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>Power god-like</hi> Perfections, when Righteousness and Goodness is their Scope and Rule; for without these they are only the Perfections of <hi>Devils</hi>; but <hi>good</hi> and <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> Devils are Contradictions in Terms. Since therefore 'tis Righteousness only that can stamp us <hi>god-like</hi> Creatures, <hi>God</hi> must needs love it out of that <hi>natural</hi> Inclination which he and all <hi>other</hi> Beings have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate his <hi>own</hi> Likeness. For without Righteousness no Creature can resemble him; and therefore if he love to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, as he must needs do, because he loves himself, he must love <hi>that</hi> which gives the Resemblance; and <hi>this,</hi> and <hi>this</hi> only is Righteousness and <hi>true</hi> Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> And lastly. <hi>God</hi> loves Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as it is the Spring or Cause from whence the <hi>highest</hi> Happiness of his Creatures is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. For he loves Beings <hi>more or less</hi> according to their <hi>intrinsick</hi> Worth and Value; and doubtless of all Orders of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:59595:213"/>
there are none so <hi>valuable</hi> as the <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>; and therefore if he love these most, he cannot but be desirous of their Happiness; and if he be, he cannot but love that which is the Spring and Cause of it, and this is <hi>universal</hi> Righteousness. For the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Happiness must necessarily be laid in the Perfection of our Natures, and our Natures being <hi>rational</hi> the Perfection of them must consist in a <hi>perfect</hi> Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all their Powers and Faculties with the <hi>eternal</hi> Rules of Reason, which is all one with <hi>universal</hi> Righteousness. For doubtless the <hi>highest</hi> Perfection of <hi>reasonable</hi> Faculties is to act most reasonably, and then they act most reasonably when they govern themselves by the <hi>unchangable</hi> Laws of Righteousness. Righteousness therefore being our Perfection as we are <hi>reasonable</hi> Beings must necessarily be the Spring and Principle of our Happiness, and 'tis as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for us to be <hi>happy</hi> without it as 'tis to be <hi>well</hi> in Sickness, or at Ease under Pain. For to the Happiness of every Nature that is <hi>capable</hi> of being happy <hi>two</hi> Things are requisite; First, that there be no disorder within it self; that its <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> be not distempered, nor their <hi>Vigour</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> lessened and abated: Secondly, that all it's <hi>Faculties</hi> be imployed and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:59595:213"/>
about such Objects as are most <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>suitable</hi> to their Natures; upon both which Accounts Righteousness is most <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> to the Happiness of every <hi>reasonable.</hi> Nature. For in the <hi>first</hi> Place, 'tis Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness that rectifies all their Disorders, and reduces them to their <hi>native</hi> and most <hi>genuine</hi> Temper. No <hi>reasonable</hi> Nature is <hi>well,</hi> and in Health, so long as it acts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonably and unrighteously; it's Pulse beats disorderly while it beats either <hi>faster</hi> or <hi>slower</hi> than <hi>Right</hi> Reason prescribes, while it acts either on this side or beyond the <hi>Medium,</hi> in the <hi>Defect,</hi> or <hi>Excess</hi> of Virtue; and whilst 'tis thus <hi>sick</hi> and <hi>distempered,</hi> 'tis impossible it should be <hi>happy.</hi> But now by acting righteously it revives and grows <hi>well</hi> again; it throws <hi>off</hi> those <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and consequently <hi>unnatural</hi> Inclinations that clogg'd and obstructed all its <hi>regular</hi> Motions, and by Degrees recovers to the <hi>native</hi> Temper and Complection of a <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Nature; and when once it hath perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discharged it self of all those <hi>unreasonable</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> Humours that disordered it, it will then live in <hi>perfect</hi> Health and Ease, and all its <hi>languishing</hi> Faculties be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their <hi>natural</hi> Vigour and Activity. And then <hi>secondly,</hi> as Righteousness reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers us from all the Distempers of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:59595:214"/>
so it imploys and exercises our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties about such Objects as are most <hi>grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>suitable</hi> to them. For Truth and <hi>true</hi> Goodness are the <hi>only</hi> Objects that can gratify a <hi>reasonable</hi> Nature acting reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; and about these doth Righteousness naturally dispose our Faculties to imploy and exercise themselves; it disposes our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi> to <hi>contemplate</hi> upon, and our <hi>Wills</hi> to <hi>embrace</hi> and <hi>chuse</hi> that <hi>God</hi> who is the Fountain of all Truth and Goodness: For every Thing loves its <hi>own like,</hi> and what it loves, it is inclined to think on. So that when we are <hi>righteous,</hi> as <hi>God</hi> is, we shall naturally love him, because he is <hi>like</hi> us; and then our Love to him will still in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our Thoughts to the Contemplation of his Beauty and Glories, and so the more <hi>righteous</hi> we grow the <hi>more</hi> we shall love him, and the <hi>more</hi> we love him the <hi>more</hi> our Understandings will be enclined to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate upon him, and so <hi>more</hi> and <hi>more</hi> till we arrive at that <hi>City of Vision</hi> where we shall see him Face to Face, and be <hi>eternally</hi> ravished with the Love and Contemplation of him. Thus Righteousness you see is the Spring and Cause of our Happiness, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, he must needs love it, who above all things desires and sollicits our Welfare: For he being perfectly <hi>happy</hi> from himself,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:59595:214"/>
cannot need our Misery to augment his Happiness; and therefore cannot desire it; but on the contrary, he must desire our Happiness out of that <hi>infinite</hi> Complacency and Delight which he takes in <hi>his own,</hi> it being impossible that he whose Delight and Love is always founded on the same Motives should delight in <hi>contrary</hi> Objects, in <hi>different</hi> Subjects, in <hi>Happiness</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and <hi>Misery</hi> in his Creatures: And if he desire our Happiness, as most certainly he doth, how can he forbear to love and take Complacency in that which contributes so much to it? Thus you see upon what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Principles it is that <hi>God</hi> is so <hi>firm</hi> a Lover of Righteousness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I now proceed in the Second Place to shew you what Indications he hath given the World of his <hi>steady</hi> Affection and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will to Righteousness. Now these, though they are many and almost <hi>infinite,</hi> may be reduced to Two <hi>general</hi> Heads. 1<hi>st.</hi> The <hi>natural</hi> Indications; 2<hi>dly.</hi> The <hi>Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ones: Of both which I shall endeavour to give you some brief Account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God hath given us Sundry <hi>natural</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications of his Love of Righteousness; all which I shall reduce to these Four Heads:
<list>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:59595:215"/>
                  <item>1. He hath <hi>imprinted</hi> a Law upon our Natures which approves of <hi>righteous</hi> Actions, and condemns their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</item>
                  <item>2. He hath <hi>endued</hi> our Minds with a <hi>grateful</hi> Sense of <hi>righteous</hi> Actions, and a <hi>natural</hi> Horror of their contraries.</item>
                  <item>3. He hath <hi>coupled good</hi> Effects to all <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> Actions, and <hi>bad</hi> ones to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries.</item>
                  <item>4. He hath <hi>implanted</hi> in us <hi>natural</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodings of the <hi>future</hi> Reward of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> Actions, and the <hi>future</hi> Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their contraries.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st.</hi> One Indication of God's Love of Righteousness is his <hi>imprinting</hi> a Law up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Natures which approves all <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Actions, and disapproves their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and this Law is that <hi>natural</hi> Reason which is either <hi>connate</hi> with our Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, or doth immediately result from the <hi>righteous</hi> Use and Exercise of it. For such is the Frame of our Understandings that whensoever we impartially <hi>reason</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Things, we are forced to distinguish between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering <hi>infinite</hi> Violence to our Faculties we can never persuade our selves, that to <hi>blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme God,</hi> or to <hi>reverence</hi> him, to <hi>lie</hi> or <hi>speak</hi> Truth, to <hi>honour</hi> our Parents, or to
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:59595:215"/>
               <hi>scorn</hi> or despitefully <hi>use</hi> them, are <hi>indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> Things; for as soon as we open the Eye of our Reason, we immediately dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern such an <hi>essential</hi> Difference between them, as forces us to condemn the One, and approve the Other: And hence we see that as for the <hi>great</hi> Strokes of Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, they have as much the <hi>universal</hi> Judgment of our Reason against them, as any <hi>false</hi> Conclusion in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi>; whereas the Goodness of their <hi>contrary</hi> Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues is as universally Acknowledged by us as the Truth of any <hi>first Principle</hi> of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.</hi> God therefore having created us with such a Faculty as doth so necessarily pass such a <hi>contrary</hi> Judgment upon <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> Actions, we must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther say that he hath made us judge falsely or else acknowledge this Judgment to be his as well as the Faculty that made it; and if it be, then 'tis a <hi>sufficient</hi> Indication of his Love of Righteousness, that he hath so framed our Faculties, that without <hi>apparent</hi> Violence they cannot but approve of it. For whatsoever our Faculties do naturally Speak, they are made to speak from the Author of Nature; they only speak what he hath Dictated to them, and so what they say <hi>he</hi> says, who hath put his <hi>Word</hi> into their Mouths, and hath made them speak
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:59595:216"/>
it. Our Faculties therefore being God's <hi>Oracles,</hi> whatsoever they freely and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally pronounce is as much his <hi>Words</hi> as any <hi>outward</hi> Revelation. Since therefore they so unanimously pronounce their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Righteousness, it is as <hi>plain</hi> a Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of God's Love and Approbation of it, as if he himself should immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it by a Voice from <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>ly.</hi> Another Indication of God's Love of Righteousness, is his <hi>enduing</hi> our Minds with a <hi>grateful</hi> Sense of <hi>righteous</hi> Actions, and a <hi>natural</hi> Horror of their Contraries. We find that antecedently to all our <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning</hi> and <hi>Discourse,</hi> there is something in our Natures to which Virtue is a <hi>grateful</hi> Thing, and its Contraries very <hi>nauseous</hi> and <hi>loathsome</hi>; for thus before we are <hi>capable</hi> of Reasoning our selves into any <hi>Pleasure</hi> or <hi>Displeasure,</hi> our Nature is rejoyced at a <hi>kind</hi> or a <hi>just</hi> Action, either in <hi>our selves</hi> or <hi>others,</hi> before we can speak, or are <hi>capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of being <hi>allured</hi> by Hope, or <hi>awed</hi> by Correction. We are sensibly pleased when we see we have pleasured those that have obliged us, and as sensibly grieved when we are <hi>conscious</hi> of having Grieved and Offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. We love to see those fare <hi>well</hi> whom we have seen deserve <hi>well,</hi> and when any <hi>unjust</hi> Violence is offered them our
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:59595:216"/>
Nature shrinks at and abhors it. We pity and compassionate the <hi>Miserable,</hi> when we know not why, and are ready to offer at their Relief, when we can give no Reason for it; which is a <hi>plain</hi> Evidence that these Things proceed not merely either from our Education, or <hi>deliberate</hi> Choices, but from some <hi>natural</hi> Instinct <hi>antecedent</hi> to both, and that in the very Frame of our Nature there is implanted by the Author of it a <hi>Sympathy</hi> with Virtue and an <hi>Antipathy</hi> to Vice. And hence it is, that in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Sin our Nature is so <hi>shy</hi> of an <hi>evil</hi> Action, and doth so <hi>startle</hi> and <hi>boggle</hi> at it; that it approaches it with such a <hi>modest</hi> Coyness, and goes blushing to it like a Virgin to an <hi>Adulterers</hi> Bed; that it passes into Sin with such <hi>Regret</hi> and <hi>Reluctancy,</hi> and looks back upon it with such <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Confusion</hi>; which in our <hi>tender</hi> Years, when we are not as yet arrived to the Exercise of our Understandings, cannot be supposed to proceed from Reason or Conscience, but from some <hi>secret</hi> Instinct of Nature, which by these and such like Indications declares it self violated and offended. And this plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shews the <hi>mighty</hi> Respect that <hi>God</hi> hath to Righteousness, that he hath woven into our Beings such a <hi>grateful</hi> Sense of it, and such a Horror of its Contraries. For this
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:59595:217"/>
               <hi>natural</hi> Sense was doubtless intended by <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>first</hi> Guide of <hi>humane</hi> Nature, that so when as yet 'tis not <hi>capable</hi> of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reason and Conscience, it might be led on to Righteousness by its own <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> Instincts; that these might dispose us to our Duty, and keep us out of all <hi>wicked</hi> Prejudices, till we come under the Conduct of our Reason; that so this may then lead us forward with more Ease and Facility in the Paths of Righteousness. What a <hi>plain</hi> Indication therefore is this of God's Love of Righteousness, that he hath taken so much Care to incline our Natures to it, that he hath not only given us <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> Faculties that do naturally direct us to Righteousness, but hath also taken so much Care to lead us to it by Instinct, till we are grown up to the Exercise of those Faculties, and are <hi>capable</hi> of being guided by them?</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>ly.</hi> Another Indication of God's Love of Righteousness is his coupling <hi>good</hi> Effects to <hi>righteous</hi> Actions, and <hi>bad</hi> ones to their Contraries. For if we consult the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of <hi>humane</hi> Actions, we shall gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally find that all <hi>moral Good</hi> resolves into <hi>natural,</hi> in the <hi>Health</hi> and the <hi>Pleasure,</hi> the <hi>Credit</hi> and <hi>Tranquility</hi> of those that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it. For so the first <hi>Great Mover</hi> in
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:59595:217"/>
that Course and Series of Things which he hath established in the World, hath order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and disposed it, that every Action which is <hi>morally Good,</hi> should ordinarily tend to, and determine in some <hi>natural</hi> Benefit and Advantage; that the <hi>good</hi> Government of every Passion should tend to the Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our Minds, and the <hi>due</hi> Regulation of every Appetite center in the Health and Pleasure of our Bodies; that <hi>Abstinence</hi> and <hi>Humility, Honesty</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> should have <hi>happy</hi> Effects chained to them, that they should contribute to our <hi>Good</hi> both <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick</hi>; and that their contrary Vices should be always pregnant with some <hi>mischievous</hi> Inconvenience; that they should either untune the <hi>Organs</hi> of our Reason, or <hi>impair</hi> the Vigour and Activity of our Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, or <hi>imbroil</hi> the Peace and Tranquility of our Minds, or <hi>invade</hi> the <hi>Common-weal</hi> of Societies, which includes the Interest of each <hi>particular</hi> Member. Such <hi>contrary</hi> Effects as these are as necessary to <hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>vicious</hi> Actions in that Course of Things which <hi>God</hi> hath established, as <hi>Light</hi> is to the <hi>Sun,</hi> or <hi>Heat</hi> to the <hi>Fire</hi>; by which he hath plainly <hi>demonstrated</hi> how contrarily he is affected to those <hi>contrary</hi> Causes. For by those <hi>natural Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi> which are appendent to <hi>humane</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:59595:218"/>
he hath plainly <hi>distinguished</hi> them into <hi>moral Goods</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi>; and those <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad</hi> Effects which he hath annexed to them are most <hi>sensible</hi> Marks of his Love of the <hi>one,</hi> and his Hatred of the <hi>other.</hi> For to be sure he would never have made Righteousness the Cause of so much <hi>good</hi> to us, if he had not loved it; nor Wickedness the Spring of so many Mischiefs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences, if he had not hated and abhorred it. The Effects of Righteousness are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily a <hi>Reward,</hi> and the Consequents of Sin a <hi>Punishment</hi> to it self, and this by God's <hi>own</hi> Order and Disposal; and pray by what Significations can a <hi>Law-giver</hi> more effectually declare his Love and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Actions than by rewarding and punishing them?</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly. Another Indication of God's Love of Righteousness, is the <hi>natural</hi> Presages and Abodings which he hath implanted in our Natures of the <hi>future</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>righteous</hi> Actions, and the <hi>future</hi> Punishment of their Contraries. That there are such Abodings as these in <hi>humane</hi> Nature is apparent by this, that antecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all <hi>divine</hi> Revelation, Men of all <hi>Ages, Nations</hi> and <hi>Religions</hi> have felt and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced them; yea, and that it hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced not only among the <hi>politer</hi> and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:59595:218"/>
more <hi>learned</hi> Nations, who may be suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be persuaded of a <hi>future</hi> State by the <hi>probable</hi> Arguments of <hi>Philosophy</hi>; but also among the most <hi>barbarous</hi> and <hi>uncultivated,</hi> who cannot be supposed to have believed it upon Principles of Reason: For though some of them have been so <hi>rude</hi> as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Society, and live like <hi>Beasts</hi> without Laws and Government; yet have they not been able to extinguish these their <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Hopes and Fears of <hi>future</hi> Rewards and Puishments; which is an <hi>unanswerable</hi> Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence how deeply the Sense of <hi>another</hi> World is imprinted upon <hi>humane</hi> Nature. And as we have such a <hi>natural</hi> Sense of a <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> State as we cannot easily stifle, so our Minds do naturally abode that we shall fare <hi>well</hi> or <hi>ill</hi> in it according as we behave <hi>our selves</hi> righteously or unrighteously in this Life. When we do well and reflect upon it, it leaves a <hi>delicious</hi> Farwel on our Minds; our Conscience smiles and promises <hi>glorious</hi> Things that we shall reap from it, most <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Fruits in the <hi>other</hi> World. And as the Sense of doing <hi>well</hi> doth naturally suggest to us the most <hi>ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Hopes and <hi>blisful</hi> Expectations, so the sense of doing <hi>ill</hi> fills our Minds with <hi>sad</hi> and <hi>dire</hi> Presages; our Conscience abodes us a <hi>black</hi> and <hi>woful Eternity</hi> wherein we shall
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:59595:219"/>
dearly pay for our <hi>sinful</hi> Delights and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. And though for the <hi>present</hi> we can divert and stifle this <hi>troublesome</hi> sense of our Natures, yet <hi>Naturam expellas</hi>— is true in this also; <hi>though we thrust off Nature with a Fork, yet 'twill return again upon us</hi>; and a <hi>Fit</hi> of Sickness, a <hi>sudden</hi> Calamity, or a <hi>serious</hi> Thought will soon awake and revive in it these <hi>black</hi> Prognosticks of our <hi>future</hi> Torment. And hence we generally find that <hi>bad</hi> Men are <hi>most</hi> afraid of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> when they are <hi>nearest</hi> to it, their Fear like all other <hi>natural</hi> Motions being <hi>swiftest</hi> when 'tis <hi>nearest</hi> it's Center. For so <hi>Plato</hi> hath observ'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>When Men are near Death, or suppose themselves near it, there arises in them great Fear and Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of a future State, which before they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of.</hi> And that this springs not from Superstition but from Nature is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this, that <hi>Atheists</hi> themselves who are most <hi>remote</hi> from Superstition, when they come to die are rarely able to suppress this <hi>ominous</hi> Dread and Fear of <hi>another</hi> World, but in despight of themselves are forced into those <hi>dismal</hi> Expectations which before they laughed at: A <hi>clear</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration that these <hi>ill</hi> Abodings spring from something within them that they cannot conquer, and that what their Minds now
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:59595:219"/>
speak is not so much the Sense of their Opini<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on as their Nature. And this Language of Nature is a <hi>clear</hi> Expression of God's Love of Righteousness; for the Voice of Nature is only the Voice of the <hi>God</hi> of Nature <hi>eccho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>rebounded</hi>; and to be sure whatever he imprints upon our Natures is the Sense and Meaning of <hi>his own</hi> Heart, since his Veracity will not permit him to print any Falshood there. And since by these our <hi>natural</hi> Abodings the <hi>God</hi> of Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses to us a <hi>future</hi> Reward if we are <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> and a <hi>future</hi> Punishment if we are wicked, he hath hereby as certainly declared to us how much he <hi>loves</hi> Righteousness and <hi>hates</hi> the Contrary, as he can possibly do by the most <hi>express</hi> Promise which he hath made to reward the <hi>one,</hi> or Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to punish the <hi>other.</hi> And thus you see what <hi>natural</hi> Indications and Discoveries <hi>God</hi> hath made of his <hi>unfeigned</hi> Love of Righteousness, which are such as without any <hi>additional</hi> Revelation are sufficient to convince considering Men that <hi>God</hi> is a most <hi>sincere</hi> and <hi>affectionate</hi> Lover of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and <hi>righteous</hi> Men, and that if we will but unfeignedly submit our selves to the <hi>eternal</hi> Laws of Goodness we shall thereby make our selves the <hi>best</hi> Friend who is a <hi>never-failing</hi> Fountain of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:59595:220"/>
and who will do us more <hi>good</hi> than all the Beings in the World, should they conspire to be our Benefactors; and that on the Contrary, if we persist in Sin and Unrighteousness we shall most certainly provoke him to be our <hi>mortal</hi> Enemy, and render our selves <hi>eternally</hi> odious and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his Eyes; that his <hi>incensed</hi> Wrath will <hi>sooner</hi> or <hi>later</hi> break forth upon us and prosecute us with <hi>eternal</hi> Vengeance, and that we can expect nothing but <hi>black</hi> and <hi>dismal</hi> Issues while we are hated by him who is the Fountain of all Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. All this we may be sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of by seriously attending to those <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Discoveries which <hi>God</hi> hath made of his Love of Righteousness. But yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw Mankind so <hi>unattentive</hi> to the Voice of their Natures, so <hi>unobservant</hi> of it's Language and Meaning as to run head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long on, notwithstanding all it's Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, into the <hi>greatest</hi> Impiety and Wickedness; he hath been graciously pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to add to these <hi>natural</hi> Discoveries of his Love of Righteousness sundry <hi>great</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent supernatural</hi> ones; such as one would think were <hi>sufficient</hi> to rouze and awake the most <hi>stupid</hi> and <hi>insensible</hi> Creatures into a <hi>serious</hi> Attention to them; all which are reducible to these <hi>following</hi> Heads.</p>

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:59595:221"/>
for which they were bestowed and infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. For how many <hi>famous</hi> Instances have we of the <hi>miraculous</hi> Deliverances of <hi>Righteous</hi> Persons, who by an <hi>invisible</hi> Hand have been rescued from the <hi>greatest</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, when in all <hi>outward</hi> Appearance their Condition was <hi>hopeless</hi> and <hi>desperate</hi>; and of <hi>wonderful</hi> Blessings that have happened to them, not only <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>contrary</hi> to all <hi>secondary</hi> Causes?

with those very <hi>Judgments</hi> which they have imprecated on themselves in Justification of a Falshood?

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:59595:222"/>2<hi>dly.</hi> Another <hi>Supernatural</hi> Indication of God's Love of Righteousness is his making so many <hi>Revelations</hi> to the World for the promoting of Righteousness and discounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of Sin. That <hi>God</hi> hath made <hi>sundry</hi> Revelations to the World is evident in Fact, because there are <hi>sundry</hi> Revelations which have been sufficiently demonstrated by those <hi>miraculous</hi> Effects of the <hi>divine</hi> Power which have accompanied the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of them; such are those contained in the <hi>five Books</hi> of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which have been almost amply confirmed both by the Miracles which were wrought by the <hi>inspired</hi> Authors of them; and by the <hi>exact</hi> Accomplishments of the <hi>several</hi> Predictions contained in them; and such is also that <hi>last</hi> and <hi>best</hi> Revelation contained in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which both by the <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Predictions</hi> contained in the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and by the <hi>infinite</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by <hi>Jesus</hi> and his <hi>Followers,</hi> who were the <hi>immediate</hi> Ministers of it; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with its own <hi>inherent</hi> Goodness; is so effectually demonstrated <hi>divine,</hi> that no Man who weighs the Proof of it can suspect it, unless he be infinitely prejudiced against it. Now if you consult these several <hi>divine</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, you will plainly perceive that the main Drift and Design of them is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:59595:223"/>
Righteousness, and suppress whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contrary to it; that the several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations made to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were all but one <hi>repeated Covenant of</hi> Righteousness; that the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted partly of <hi>ceremonious</hi> Rights, which were either intended for <hi>divine Hieroglyphicks</hi> to instruct the <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>stupid</hi> Jews in the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>inward</hi> Purity and Goodness, or else for <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>sacred Figures</hi> of the <hi>holy</hi> Mysteries of the <hi>Gospel</hi>; partly of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>moral</hi> Righteousness, together with some <hi>few prudential</hi> ones that were <hi>suitable</hi> to the Genius and Polity of that People; and partly of such <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Threats</hi> as were most apt to oblige them to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of those <hi>righteous</hi> Precepts. As for the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the Substance of their Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was either Reprehensions of Sin, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>severe</hi> Denunciations against it; or Invitations to Righteousness, together with <hi>gracious</hi> Promises of Rewards to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it; or Predictions of the <hi>Messias,</hi> and that <hi>everlasting</hi> Righteousness which should be introduced by him. And then as for the <hi>Gospel,</hi> all the Duties of it consist either in Instances or Means of Righteousness; and all the Doctrines of it are nothing else but <hi>powerful</hi> Arguments and Motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade us to the Practice of those Duties.
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:59595:223"/>
Thus Righteousness you see is the <hi>main</hi> Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to which all <hi>true</hi> Revelation tends, the Mark at which the <hi>righteous Lord</hi> hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually levelled and directed it. What a <hi>plain</hi> Demonstration therefore is this of the <hi>unfeigned</hi> Love and Respect he bears it, that he did not think it sufficient to imprint a <hi>Law of Righteousness</hi> upon our Natures, and stamp upon our Beings so <hi>many Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> of his Love to it, but seeing us <hi>swerve</hi> and <hi>deviate</hi> from it hath from time to time by so many <hi>loud</hi> and <hi>reiterated</hi> Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from <hi>Heaven</hi> invited and called us back again; so that if he be <hi>cordial</hi> and <hi>sincere</hi> in what he says, (as it would be <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>impious</hi> to suspect the contrary,) we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doubt but he heartily loves that which by so many <hi>immediate</hi> Revelations he hath so earnestly importuned us to embrace.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Another <hi>supernatural</hi> Indication of God's Love of Righteousness is his send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>his own Son</hi> into the World to transact such <hi>mighty</hi> Things for the Encouragement of it, and persuading Men to it. For to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Righteousness was the <hi>main</hi> Design of all those <hi>mighty</hi> Things which the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> did and suffered in this World; the Design of all that <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>innocent</hi> Life which he led was to propose to our Imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>perfect</hi> Example of Righteousness, that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:59595:224"/>
so treading our Way before us we might have not only the Line of his Precepts, but also the Print of his Foot-steps to direct us, and that by beholding so <hi>fair</hi> a Draught of Righteousness drawn so exquisitely to the Life, and in every Part so exactly answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>sweetest</hi> and most <hi>amiable</hi> Ideas of it, we might be both invited and instructed to <hi>copy</hi> and <hi>imitate</hi> it in our Actions. For what he saith of that <hi>illustrious</hi> Act of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Humility,</hi> his washing his Disciples Feet, is truly applicable to the whole Course of his Actions; For <hi>I have given you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that you should do as I have done unto you,</hi> Joh. xiii.15. And as his Life was an Example of Righteousness, so his Death was a most <hi>urgent</hi> Motive to it; for hereby he made Expiation for our Sins and obtained an Act of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Indemnity</hi> for every Rebel that would lay down his Arms and return to his Duty and Allegiance; and by obtaining this he hath given us <hi>infinite</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to return, since if we do so, we have most <hi>ample</hi> Assurance that we shall be received into Grace and Favour. And though I cannot deny but if <hi>God</hi> had pleased he might have granted such an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to us without the Consideration of <hi>Christ's Death and Sacrifice</hi>; yet I am sure, if he had, it could never have been such an
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:59595:224"/>
               <hi>effectual</hi> Motive as it was to oblige us to Righteousness for the <hi>future.</hi> For should he have granted us Pardon merely upon our Repentance without any <hi>other</hi> Motive or Consideration, he would have discovered so much <hi>seeming</hi> Easiness and Indulgence in such a Procedure, as would have very much imboldened such <hi>disingenuous</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as we to presume upon his Lenity, and turn his Grace into Wantonness. And if to prevent our presuming upon his Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it was necessary that he should have some <hi>other</hi> Motive to pardon us besides <hi>that</hi> of our Repentance, then it was no less <hi>necessary</hi> that this <hi>other</hi> Motive should be such as did clearly argue and evince his <hi>righteous</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity; for otherwise it would have no Force in it to prevent our Presumption. And what Motive of Pardon could better evince his Severity than the Suffering of some <hi>other</hi> in our Room, especially the Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of <hi>his own</hi> Son, the <hi>greatest</hi> and <hi>dearest</hi> Person in the whole Creation? For not to be moved to grant a <hi>publick</hi> Pardon to us upon our <hi>hearty</hi> Repentance unless this <hi>blessed</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son would engage to die for us, whose <hi>infinite</hi> Greatness gave such an <hi>inestimable</hi> Value to his Sufferings as rendred them <hi>adequate</hi> to what we had deserved to suffer, was as <hi>great</hi> an Argument of his <hi>inflexible</hi> Severity
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:59595:225"/>
against Sin, as if he should have destroyed at one Blow the whole World of Sinners. So that as he hath expressed an <hi>infinite</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to us in admitting <hi>his own</hi> Son to die for us, so in refusing to pardon us upon any <hi>less</hi> Motive than his <hi>precious</hi> Death, he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed an <hi>infinite</hi> Hatred to our Sins; and so that very <hi>Death</hi> which moved <hi>God</hi> to pardon us, moves us to stand in Awe of his Severity, the Death of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we are pardoned being the most <hi>terrible</hi> Instance that ever was of the Desert of our Sin, and God's Displeasure against it. Thus our <hi>blessed Lord</hi> hath not only given us the <hi>greatest</hi> Encouragement by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our Pardon to return from our Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, but by procuring it in such a <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable</hi> way he hath given us the most <hi>dreadful</hi> Warning of God's Severity against them. So that now we cannot think upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for which our <hi>past</hi> Offences are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, without being vehemently moved to <hi>future</hi> Obedience. And thus the <hi>main</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, you see, both of Christs <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> was to recal us from Sin to the Practice of Righteousness: And hence he is said to have <hi>given himself for us, to redeem us from all Iniquity, and to purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit. ii.14. And then he arose again from the Dead to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:59595:225"/>
that <hi>righteous</hi> Doctrine which he had revealed to the World, and visibly ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Heaven</hi> to give us an <hi>ocular</hi> Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the <hi>heavenly</hi> Rewards of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness; and there he now sits at the <hi>right Hand</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> to assure us, that if we persevere in Righteousness, we shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually befriended in the Court of <hi>Heaven</hi> through his <hi>all-powerful</hi> Intercession; and hath assured us that at the End of the World he will come to <hi>Judgment,</hi> and faithfully di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute those <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Punishments</hi> which here he promised and threatned to <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> Persons. Thus the <hi>main</hi> Drift, you see, of all these <hi>great</hi> Transactions of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> was to advance the Interest of Righteousness and <hi>true</hi> Goodness. What a <hi>mighty</hi> Evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this of God's <hi>great</hi> Love of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, that he should send <hi>his own</hi> most <hi>blessed</hi> Son upon its Errand, to transact such <hi>mighty</hi> Things on its Behalf? For by sending <hi>Christ</hi> into the World, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to Misery for Righteousness Sake, he did in Effect declare that he valued the Interest of Righteousness more than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Happiness and Enjoyment of his most <hi>dearly beloved</hi> and <hi>only begotten Son</hi>; and we may most certainly conclude, that had not Righteousness been infinitely <hi>dear</hi> to him, he
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:59595:226"/>
would never have <hi>authorized</hi> his <hi>dearest</hi> Son to take such <hi>infinite</hi> Pains to promote it.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Another <hi>supernatural</hi> Indication of God's Love of Righteousness is his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing such <hi>vast</hi> Rewards to us upon it, and denouncing such <hi>fearful</hi> Punishments against us if we despise and neglect it. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides all those <hi>temporal</hi> Rewards he hath proposed to us if we <hi>seek the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteousness thereof,</hi> he hath erected a <hi>Heaven</hi> of <hi>immortal</hi> Joys and Felicities to crown and entertan it; a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> that contains in it all the Beatitudes that <hi>humane</hi> Nature is capable of, all that <hi>Truth</hi> that the most <hi>capacious</hi> Mind can compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and all that <hi>Good</hi> that the <hi>vastest</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections can either crave or contain: In a word, a <hi>Heaven</hi> whose Blisses are all as <hi>large</hi> as our <hi>immense</hi> Desires, and all as <hi>lasting</hi> as our <hi>immortal</hi> Beings: For 'tis a <hi>Heaven</hi> which consists in an <hi>eternal</hi> Fruition of the Fountain of <hi>infinite</hi> Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, whose <hi>everflowing</hi> Streams are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly sufficient to quench the Thirst, and make glad the Heart of every Being that understands and loves. How much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God</hi> loves Righteousness you may easily guess by these <hi>vast</hi> Preparations he hath made to entertain it. For he built <hi>Heaven</hi> on purpose to lodge <hi>righteous</hi> Souls, and that
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:59595:226"/>
they may see he thinks nothing <hi>too dear</hi> for them, he is himself their Feast <hi>there</hi> as well as their Entertainer. He feeds them with <hi>his own</hi> Perfections, and they live <hi>for ever</hi> as happily as their Hearts can wish upon the <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Imitation</hi> of his Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. So vehemently is his Heart set upon Righteousness, that he will have every <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> Soul dwell with him and live upon him, and partake of all those <hi>heavenly</hi> Joys in which <hi>his own</hi> Beatitude consists. But as for <hi>Vnrighteousness,</hi> how much his Soul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors it is evident by those <hi>dire</hi> Punishments he hath denounced against it, by those <hi>dark</hi> and <hi>dismal</hi> Abodes which he hath condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>unrighteous</hi> Souls to, to languish out a <hi>woful</hi> Eternity, to <hi>burn</hi> in Flames there that <hi>never</hi> consume, and be <hi>gnawn</hi> with Worms which <hi>never</hi> devour them; to be <hi>scared</hi> and <hi>haunted</hi> with <hi>Devils without</hi> and <hi>Furies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</hi> and perpetually worried Day and Night without any Ease or Intermission with all the <hi>Horrors, Griefs,</hi> and <hi>Vexations</hi> that an <hi>everlasting</hi> Hell imports. O thou <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Father</hi> of Beings! How couldst thou have found in thy Heart to condemn thy Creatures to so <hi>wretched</hi> a State, had not their <hi>unrighteous</hi> Practices been infinitely <hi>odious</hi> in thine Eyes? No certainly; the <hi>good God</hi> would never have made <hi>Hell</hi> for
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:59595:227"/>
a Trifle, for the sake of any Thing that his Nature could have endured or dispensed with; nor would he ever have cast any <hi>unrighteous</hi> Creature into it, were it not for the <hi>implacable</hi> Abhorrence he hath to all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness: And therefore since he hath not only made <hi>Hell,</hi> but warns us of, and threatens us with it, we may be sure he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely abominates <hi>that</hi> for which he made and threatens it; and consequently that he is infinitely concerned for the Cause and Interest of Righteousness.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly. Another <hi>supernatural</hi> Indicaton of God's Love of Righteousness is his granting his <hi>blessed Spirit</hi> to us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to, and assist us in our Endeavours after Righteousness. First he sent his <hi>Son</hi> to propagate Righteousness by his <hi>Ministry,</hi> his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death</hi>; and upon his Return to <hi>Heaven</hi> he sent his <hi>Spirit</hi> to supply his Room, and carry on that <hi>dear</hi> Design, of which his <hi>Son</hi> had already laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For in Christ's <hi>personal</hi> Absence his <hi>Spirit</hi> acts in his Stead, and was sent down from the Father by Virtue of his <hi>Intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in the World, to promote and inlarge his <hi>heavenly</hi> Kingdom, to conquer our Hearts, and subdue our <hi>stubborn</hi> Wills to the Obedience of his most <hi>righteous</hi> Laws. So that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
               <pb n="447" facs="tcp:59595:227"/>
doth now preside in the <hi>Church</hi> as the <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> Minister and <hi>vicarous</hi> Power of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and is continually imployed even as our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself was whilst he abode upon Earth in driving on the Interest of Righteousness; for hitherto tend all his <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret</hi> Operations on the Minds of Men; this is the Reason why he suggests so many <hi>good</hi> Thoughts, and by repeating them thick upon us, keeps our Minds so fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that so if possible he may recollect our <hi>dispersed</hi> Minds that are continually wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <hi>to</hi> and <hi>fro</hi> in this <hi>infinite</hi> Maze of <hi>sensual</hi> Vanities, and engage them to attend to such Motives of Righteousness as are most <hi>apt</hi> to excite them to <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions. So that as in the Beginnings of <hi>Christianity</hi> before <hi>Christian</hi> Motives to Righteousness were believed, the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> did operate more visibly and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to confirm and demonstrate the Truth of them; so now they being believed, and thereupon the Necessity of such <hi>miraculous</hi> Operations superseded, his <hi>great</hi> Work is to <hi>object</hi> and <hi>present</hi> them to our Minds, and fix our Thoughts upon them till they have effected in us those <hi>good</hi> Resolutions for which they were designed and intended: And how diligently he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues this Work our own Experience certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:59595:228"/>
and informs us: For how often do we find <hi>good</hi> Thoughts and Motions injected to us we know not how nor whence; and how many times do these <hi>unexpected</hi> Thoughts kindle <hi>holy</hi> Desires in us before we are aware? Which Desires being fed by a <hi>fresh</hi> Supply of <hi>holy</hi> Motions and Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions are many times nourished into <hi>good</hi> Resolutions, and these being still back'd with those <hi>repeated</hi> Motions which do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently press with <hi>strong</hi> Importunity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, are at last perfected into <hi>firm</hi> and <hi>last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Principles of Action. Thus does the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> continually knock at the Door of our Souls, and sollicit us with the <hi>greatest</hi> Earnestness to <hi>sober</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this is his <hi>constant</hi> Imployment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, and will be so to the End of the World; till <hi>Jesus,</hi> whose <hi>Vicegerent</hi> he is, and whose Absence he supplies, returns in Person from <hi>Heaven</hi> to keep his <hi>last</hi> and <hi>general Assizes</hi> upon Earth. And can we imagin that <hi>God</hi> would have all this while imployed his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> in the Service of Righteousness, to drive on its Interest and sollicit its Cause, if it had not been infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>dearer</hi> to him? No certainly, he sets a <hi>greater</hi> Value on the Pains of his <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> than to busy them about a Trifle, to imploy them so industriously as he has
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:59595:228"/>
done in an Affair which he had <hi>little</hi> or no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for. If his Heart had not been extremely set upon it, he would have found out some <hi>other</hi> Imployment for those <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious</hi> Persons, and not have engaged them so everlastingly as he hath done in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Ministry of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>Having thus explained and proved the Proposition, <hi>That the Righteous Lord loveth Righteousness,</hi> I shall conclude with some <hi>few</hi> Inferences drawn from the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence I infer that no <hi>Religion,</hi> or Proposition of <hi>Religion</hi> can be <hi>true,</hi> that either directly or by <hi>true</hi> Consequence is an Enemy to Righteousness. For all <hi>true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> is from <hi>God</hi>; and therefore to be sure <hi>that</hi> cannot be <hi>true</hi> which either directly or indirectly opposes that which <hi>God</hi> so dearly loves. This therefore is a <hi>plain</hi> Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>notorious</hi> Falshood and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of <hi>Popery,</hi> that in all those Doctrins it hath superinduced upon the <hi>common</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of <hi>Christianity,</hi> it is an <hi>open</hi> Enemy to Righteousness. As for Instance, it is a <hi>common</hi> Principle of <hi>Christianity</hi> that <hi>God</hi> alone is to be worshiped as the <hi>supream</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Fountain of our Beings, upon which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> hath superstructed the <hi>Invocation of Saints and Angels,</hi> which
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:59595:229"/>
they perform in the <hi>same</hi> Words and with the <hi>same</hi> Address as they do the Invocation of <hi>God</hi> himself. For though they pretend to pray to them only for their Prayers, yet in their <hi>Publick Offices</hi> they do not only beg their Prayers to <hi>God</hi> for them, but also invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them as <hi>sovereign</hi> Gods and <hi>independent</hi> Disposers of the Mercies they pray for. Thus in the <hi>Hours of Sarum</hi> they implore the <hi>Angels</hi> to direct their Thoughts and Words and Actions in the way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that so they may be able to fill up the Number of the <hi>Angelical Orders,</hi> which by the Fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> was diminished; to protect them from the <hi>Devils,</hi> and comfort them when they are dying. Particularly, St. <hi>Michael</hi> they beseech to be their <hi>Coat of Mail,</hi> St. <hi>Gabriel</hi> to be their <hi>Helmet,</hi> St. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> to be their <hi>Shield,</hi> St. <hi>Vriel</hi> to be their <hi>Defender,</hi> St. <hi>Cherubim</hi> to be their <hi>Health,</hi> St. <hi>Seraphim</hi> to be their <hi>Truth</hi>; and all the <hi>holy Angels</hi> and <hi>Arch-angels</hi> to keep, protect and defend them, and bring them to <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life.</hi> And as for <hi>Raphael,</hi> to whom they seem to bear a more <hi>particular</hi> Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they stile him the <hi>best Physitian</hi> both of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul,</hi> and pray him to inlighten both their <hi>spiritual</hi> and <hi>carnal</hi> Eyes. And then as for the <hi>Saints,</hi> they do as immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly address to them in their <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:59595:229"/>
for <hi>Sanctification, Pardon, temporal</hi> and <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Blessings, as they can possibly do to <hi>God</hi> himself; particularly the <hi>Blessed Virgin</hi> they adorn with the most <hi>glorious</hi> Titles of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>in her Psalter</hi> address to her in the same Forms of Invocation which <hi>David</hi> uses <hi>in his Psalms</hi> to <hi>God</hi>; they stile <hi>Her</hi> the <hi>Lady Almighty,</hi> the <hi>Author of Mercy,</hi> the <hi>Queen of infinite Majesty,</hi> and the <hi>Hope of all the World</hi>; praying that her <hi>Mercy</hi> may lighten upon them, as they do put their trust in her; and a great deal more to this Purpose. And as for <hi>Joseph her Husband</hi> they stile him the <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> of their Lives, and the <hi>Pillar</hi> of the World; beseeching him with his <hi>Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Ax</hi> (a Tool <hi>fit</hi> only to work upon such <hi>wooden</hi> Souls) to hew down their Sins, that they may be <hi>adopted</hi> Timber for the <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>Heaven.</hi> In a word, in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>Breviary</hi> they implore St. <hi>Peter</hi> to loose them by his Word from the Bonds of Sin, and supplicate the <hi>Apostles,</hi> who by their Word (if the <hi>Prayer</hi> lies not) do <hi>lock</hi> and <hi>unlock</hi> the <hi>Gates</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> to loose them from all Sin by their Command. They humbly intreat St. <hi>Genovesa</hi> to have pity on those that hope in Her, to blot out their Sins, and send them Relief and Comfort; and implore St. <hi>Sebastian</hi> to preserve their <hi>Country</hi> from the Plague, to preserve their
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:59595:230"/>
Bodies, and heal their Minds; and to win him thereunto, assure him that <hi>all</hi> their Hope is in him. These and several <hi>other</hi> such like Instances there are of their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both to <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> in which they do as immediately invoke them both for <hi>temporal, spiritual</hi> and <hi>eternal</hi> Blessings as they can do <hi>God</hi> himself, who is the <hi>sole</hi> Disposer of them. And is not this most <hi>palpable</hi> Unrighteousness towards <hi>God,</hi> to strip him thus of his <hi>divine</hi> Prerogatives, and clothe his Creatures in them before his Face? But against this <hi>black</hi> Charge <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi> hath a very <hi>quaint Salvo: When we say,</hi> says he, <hi>St. Peter have mercy upon me, or so; we supply the Sense with this mental Construction, procure Mercy for me by thy Prayers or Merits</hi>; which is a <hi>plain</hi> Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the Words are <hi>unwholsome</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and cannot be safely used without being corrected by a more <hi>honest</hi> meaning; and that if the <hi>Votaries</hi> of <hi>that Church</hi> do not take Care to mend their <hi>Publick Prayesr</hi> with their <hi>private</hi> Meanings, they incur the Guilt, or at least the Danger of Idolatry. For we cannot address more immediately in any Form of Words to <hi>God</hi> for any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than they do in these to the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi>; and therefore if they do not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally address to them as Gods, 'tis because
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:59595:230"/>
they construe those Forms into a <hi>different</hi> Sense from their most <hi>obvious</hi> meaning. For when they say, <hi>Lord have mercy upon me,</hi> they may mean, with as little Force to the Words, <hi>Procure me Mercy, O Lord, from St.</hi> Peter <hi>by thy Prayers and Merits,</hi> as they do when they say, St. <hi>Peter</hi> have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon me, <hi>Procure me Mercy from God, O St.</hi> Peter, <hi>by thy Prayers and Merits.</hi> And what a <hi>dreadful</hi> Prophanation is it of the <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> Majesty to use such Forms of Address to <hi>God</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> as do leave our Minds <hi>indifferent</hi> either to pray to St. <hi>Peter</hi> to pray to <hi>God</hi> for us, or to pray to <hi>God</hi> to pray to St. <hi>Peter</hi> for us? Again, 'tis a <hi>common</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of <hi>Christianity,</hi> that our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath instituted the <hi>holy Eucharist</hi> to be a <hi>Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> of his Sufferings, and a Seal of that <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant</hi> which he purchased by them; upon which the <hi>Roman Church</hi> hath superstructed that <hi>monstrous</hi> Doctrin of <hi>Transubstantiation</hi>; which, besides the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace it doth to our <hi>holy Religion</hi> by Reason of those <hi>ridiculous</hi> Absurdities and <hi>gross</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions it fastens upon it; it puts such an <hi>extravagant</hi> sense upon the <hi>first</hi> Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>holy mystery,</hi> that if our <hi>Saviour</hi> had really meant it, 'twould have been enough to expose him to the <hi>general</hi> Scorn and Derision of Mankind. For if when he
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:59595:231"/>
               <hi>first</hi> instituted it, he had really pretended to convert the <hi>Sacramental Elements</hi> into the Substance of <hi>his own Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> this must have been the Sense of his Words and Actions; these <hi>outward</hi> Elements which but just now were made <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> are now by my <hi>Almighty</hi> Benediction convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Substance of my <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>; this very <hi>Body</hi> which sits here at the <hi>upper</hi> End of the Table, lies <hi>there</hi> under those Species of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> which you see upon it. My <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> and every Part of me, are all intirely within every Crumb of <hi>that unleavened Bread</hi>; and yet those <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral</hi> Crumbs, which do <hi>each</hi> contain my whole Body, contain not <hi>several</hi> Bodies; and if you divide them into <hi>ten thousand</hi> Crumbs, and distribute them into <hi>ten thousand</hi> different Places, yet in all those <hi>different</hi> Places I am the same <hi>intire</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided</hi> Body. And though as I sit <hi>here,</hi> you see I am at least a Foot <hi>broad,</hi> and <hi>five</hi> or <hi>six</hi> Foot <hi>long,</hi> yet in those <hi>little</hi> Crumbs that lie before you I am no <hi>bigger</hi> than a Pin's Head; and yet upon my <hi>honest</hi> Word I am in all my Parts and Dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under the <hi>outward</hi> Species of every <hi>one</hi> of them, and so am every whit as <hi>broad</hi> and <hi>thick</hi> and <hi>long</hi> in them, as I do now appear in this <hi>visible</hi> Body. And as for
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:59595:231"/>
my <hi>Blood</hi> which is at least <hi>two Gallons,</hi> though it is all contained within the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Vessels</hi> of <hi>this Body,</hi> yet it is all at the same Time within <hi>that Cup,</hi> which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess is hardly large enough to contain the <hi>eighth Part</hi> of it: And though <hi>you Twelve</hi> shall every <hi>one</hi> drink his share of it, yet every <hi>one</hi> shall drink it all, that is, out of this <hi>one Cup</hi> of <hi>my Blood,</hi> which at most contains but a <hi>Quart, each</hi> Man of you <hi>Twelve</hi> shall drink the <hi>whole two</hi> Gallons. But let not these Things astonish you, for now I am doing yet <hi>stranger</hi> Things than these, and <hi>first</hi> I take my self (it being sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed both by <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> himself <hi>first</hi> eat and drank those <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> Elements) that is, I take my <hi>Hands</hi> into <hi>my own</hi> Hands, and put my <hi>Mouth</hi> into <hi>my own</hi> Mouth, and swallow down my <hi>Hands,</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> and <hi>Throat,</hi> and <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> through <hi>my own</hi> Throat into <hi>my own</hi> Stomach; so that now my whole Body is intirely within my Stomach, though the whole you see, except my Stomach, is still intirely without it. And having thus eaten and drank up my self, in the <hi>next</hi> Place I give my self to be eat and drank by <hi>every one</hi> of you. And now while I am wholly buried within <hi>each</hi> of your Stomachs and <hi>my own,</hi> I shall begin a <hi>sacred Hymn,</hi> and
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:59595:232"/>
conclude with my <hi>Farewel</hi> Sermon. This, supposing our <hi>Saviour</hi> had intended a <hi>real Transubstantiation,</hi> had been the <hi>natural</hi> Sense, or rather Nonsense of his Words and Actions in the <hi>first</hi> Institution of this <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Mystery.</hi> And what a most <hi>shameful</hi> Disgrace is it to the most <hi>righteous Religion</hi> that ever was, to fasten such <hi>wild</hi> Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies upon its <hi>great</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Author? Certainly had Men set their Wits at work to <hi>burlesque</hi> the most <hi>sacred</hi> Thing, and dress it up for Laughter and Derision, they could never have invented a more <hi>ridiculous</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise for it than this of <hi>Transubstantiation:</hi> Besides all which, it introduces <hi>two notorious</hi> Pieces of Unrighteousness; the <hi>first</hi> of which is a most <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>barbarous</hi> Piece of Idolatry, <hi>viz.</hi> their adoring the <hi>consecrated Bread</hi> with the <hi>highest</hi> Species of <hi>divine</hi> Worship; which if it be not <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi> into the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> as we are sure it is not, unless our Senses lie, and Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions be true; they themselves confess is as <hi>gross</hi> Idoatry as the <hi>Laplander</hi>'s wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiping a <hi>red Cloth</hi> hung upon the Top of a Spear. Now what <hi>monstrous</hi> Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness is this, for Men to rob <hi>God</hi> of his Honour, and vest a <hi>senseless</hi> Piece of Bread with it; to advance the Workmanship of a <hi>Baker</hi> into an Equality with <hi>God,</hi> and
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:59595:232"/>
then <hi>adore,</hi> and then <hi>devour</hi> it? The <hi>second</hi> Piece of Unrighteousness which this <hi>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous</hi> Figment introduces, is the <hi>Half-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> in which the <hi>Christian World</hi> is most unjustly robbed of one <hi>half</hi> of that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy which <hi>Christ</hi> bequeathed to us in his <hi>last</hi> Will and Testament; which as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> tells us was done out of Reverence to the <hi>Transubstantiated Wine,</hi> lest any Drop of it sticking upon <hi>Lay-mens</hi> Beards should be spilt and prophaned. But this Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, by the <hi>Cardinal's</hi> Leave, might have otherwise been easily prevented by prohibiting all <hi>Lay-men,</hi> as they do their <hi>Priests,</hi> to receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> with their Beards on. For I am apt to think there is no <hi>good Christian</hi> but would have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contented to lose <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Beard</hi> than <hi>half</hi> the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> So that this Doctrin of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> you see, hath a most <hi>unrighteous</hi> Tendency both as it disgraces the most <hi>righteous Religion,</hi> and introduces the most <hi>gross</hi> Unrighteousness. Again, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis a <hi>common</hi> Principle of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> that <hi>true</hi> Repentance is indispensably <hi>necessary</hi> to the Salvation of Sinners; upon which they have superstructed their <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Pennance,</hi> which joyned with <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> is of such <hi>Sovereign</hi> Virtue as to <hi>Transubstantiate</hi> a Sorrow proceeding from
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:59595:233"/>
the Fear of <hi>Hell,</hi> into <hi>true</hi> and <hi>saving</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: By which Doctrin they have most directly superseded all the Obligations of Righteousness. For what need I put my self to the Trouble of a <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> Life, when for allarming my self before I go to <hi>Confession</hi> into some <hi>frightful</hi> Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of <hi>Hell,</hi> I can be <hi>dubbed</hi> a <hi>true</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, and receive the Remission of my Sins? For now my <hi>old</hi> Score being all wiped <hi>off,</hi> I may Sin on merrily on a <hi>new</hi> Account, and when I make my <hi>next</hi> Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning, 'tis but being afraid of <hi>Hell</hi> again, and I am sure to receive a <hi>new</hi> Acquittance <hi>in full</hi> of all Demands and Dues. And when I have spent all my Life in this <hi>Round</hi> and <hi>Circle</hi> of Unrighteousnss, 'tis but send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a <hi>Priest</hi> at my <hi>last Breath, confessing</hi> my Sins, and <hi>dreading</hi> the Punishment of them, and with a <hi>few magical</hi> Words he shall immediately <hi>conjure</hi> me to <hi>Heaven,</hi> or at least out of Danger of <hi>Hell.</hi> Once more; it is a <hi>common</hi> Principle of <hi>Christianity</hi> that the <hi>Wages of Sin</hi> is <hi>eternal Death</hi>; upon which they have introduced their Doctrins of <hi>Purgatory</hi> and <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> which, like <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> Brethren in Iniquity, do <hi>both</hi> conspire to render Righteousness a <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less</hi> Thing. For by the <hi>Sacrament of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance</hi> the <hi>eternal</hi> Punishment of <hi>Hell</hi> is
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:59595:233"/>
changed into the <hi>temporary</hi> one of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> and by <hi>Indulgencies,</hi> especially <hi>plenary ones,</hi> the <hi>temporary</hi> Punishment of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> is wholly remitted, and extinguished; so that the <hi>first</hi> lessens the Punishment of Sin, and the <hi>last</hi> annihilates it: And by this Means are Sinners mightily imboldened to go on, being assured that upon the <hi>Sacrament of Pennance</hi> they shall commute <hi>Hell</hi> for <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> and that upon <hi>plenary Indulgence</hi> they shall exchange <hi>Purgatory</hi> for <hi>Heaven.</hi> Many other Instances of this Nature might be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but it would be endless to enumerate all those <hi>unrighteous</hi> Principles with which their <hi>Casuistical Divinity</hi> abounds; the <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Falsifications,</hi> the <hi>Treasons</hi> and <hi>Murders,</hi> the <hi>Slanders</hi> and <hi>Perjuries,</hi> which their <hi>Guides of Conscience</hi> do not only tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate but commend; For I will maintain that there is scarce any Villany in Nature so <hi>notorious</hi> which by the Principles of <hi>some</hi> or <hi>other</hi> of their <hi>allowed Casuists</hi> may not be wholly vindicated, or at least extenuated into <hi>venial</hi> Crimes. So that considering the whole Frame and Structure of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religion,</hi> I do most seriously believe it to be <hi>one</hi> of the most <hi>effectual</hi> Engins to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine and tear <hi>up</hi> the Foundations of Righteousness that ever the <hi>Devil</hi> forged or made use of; and were it not for those
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:59595:234"/>
               <hi>common</hi> Principles of <hi>Christianity</hi> that are intermingled with it, and do allay, and sometimes I hope overpower the Venom of it, I am verily persuaded that the <hi>Religion</hi> of <hi>Heathens</hi> would sooner make Men <hi>righteous</hi> than that of <hi>Papists.</hi> For I do affirm that there is not <hi>one</hi> Principle of <hi>pure Popery</hi> that is either a <hi>Rule</hi> of Righteousness or a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to it, but contrariwise that the most of its Principles seem to have been purposely calculated to <hi>affront</hi> Men's Reason, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch</hi> their Manners; and if so, then we may easily guess whether this be a <hi>true Religion</hi> or no, which in all its Parts is so repugnant to that which <hi>God</hi> most dearly loves.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Hence I infer upon what Terms a Man may safely conclude that he is <hi>beloved</hi> of <hi>God</hi>; for if he hath that <hi>amiable Quality</hi> within him which is the <hi>eternal</hi> Reason of God's Love, he may be sure he is <hi>beloved</hi> of him. If our Souls be adorned with <hi>that</hi> Righteousness which the <hi>righteous Lord</hi> loves, we may safely conclude that we are his <hi>Favourites,</hi> and shall never cease to be so whilst we continue so adorned. For 'tis as impossible for <hi>God</hi> not to love <hi>righteous</hi> Souls, as not to be <hi>righteous</hi> himself; for whilst he continues so, <hi>his own</hi> Nature must needs incline him to love all those in whom he finds <hi>his own</hi> most <hi>amiable</hi> Image and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:59595:234"/>
Resemblance. Let us not therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade our selves that we are <hi>beloved</hi> of <hi>God</hi> either upon any <hi>inward Whispers</hi> and <hi>Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions,</hi> or upon any <hi>particular Marks</hi> and <hi>Signs of Grace</hi>; for <hi>both</hi> these may abuse and deceive us, and flatter our Minds into <hi>false</hi> and <hi>groundless</hi> Assurances. We may think 'tis the <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>God</hi> that whispers to us when all of a suddain we feel our selves surprized with <hi>joyous</hi> and <hi>comfortable</hi> Thoughts, and yet this may be nothing else but a Frisk of melancholy Vapors <hi>heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>fermented</hi> by a <hi>feverish</hi> Humour. For those suddain Joys and Dejections, which are so often interpreted the <hi>Incomes</hi> and <hi>Withdrawings</hi> of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> do commonly proceed from no <hi>higher</hi> Cause than the <hi>Shiverings</hi> and <hi>Burnings</hi> of an <hi>Ague</hi>; and I am very sure that <hi>Histerical Fits</hi> are very often mistaken for <hi>spiritual Experiences</hi>; and that when Men have most confidently believed themselves <hi>overshadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> their Fancies have been only <hi>hagged</hi> and <hi>ridden</hi> with the <hi>Enthusiastick</hi> Vapours of their own <hi>Spleen.</hi> And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I make no doubt but this <hi>suddain</hi> Flush of <hi>joyous</hi> Thoughts proceeds from a <hi>worse</hi> Cause, even from the Suggestion of the <hi>Devil</hi>; who, though he hath no <hi>immediate</hi> Access to the Minds of Men, can yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:59595:235"/>
act upon our <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Humours,</hi> and by their Means figure our Fancies into <hi>spritely</hi> Ideas, and tickle our Hearts into a Rapture; And this Power of <hi>his</hi> we may reasonably suppose he is ready enough to exert upon any <hi>mischievous</hi> Occasion, when he finds Men willing to be deceived, and to rely upon <hi>ungrounded</hi> Confidences. Let us not therefore build our Hopes of the <hi>divine</hi> Favour upon any such <hi>uncertain</hi> Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but impartially examin our selves whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are really <hi>righteous</hi>; for unless we are so, it is not more <hi>certain</hi> that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,</hi> than that these our <hi>pretended spiritual Incomes</hi> and <hi>Inundations</hi> of Joy and Comfort, are either the <hi>Freaks</hi> of <hi>our own</hi> Temper, or else the <hi>Injections</hi> of the <hi>Devil.</hi> For how can you imagin that the <hi>God</hi> of all Righteousness and Truth can, without <hi>infinite</hi> Violence to <hi>his own</hi> Nature, either love or pretend Love to an <hi>unrighteous</hi> Soul? But then you will say, by what <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Tokens</hi> shall we know whether we are <hi>righteous</hi> or no? To which I answer, that there is nothing can be a <hi>true</hi> Sign and Token of Righteousness, which is <hi>distinct</hi> from Righteousness it self: For Righteousness is its <hi>own</hi> Sign; and if any Man judges himself <hi>righteous</hi> by any Mark which is not an Act or Instance of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, he deceives and abuses <hi>his own</hi> Soul.
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:59595:235"/>
But then we must have a Care that we do not argue from any one <hi>particular</hi> Mark or Instance of Righteousness to our being <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> in <hi>general.</hi> For you may as well argue that you are not <hi>blind</hi> because you <hi>hear well,</hi> or that you are not <hi>deaf</hi> because you <hi>taste well,</hi> or that you have <hi>all</hi> your Senses, because you have <hi>one</hi>; as that you are <hi>righteous</hi> in the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> because you are so in <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi>; and you may as reasonably conclude your self in a <hi>State of Health,</hi> because you have a <hi>fresh</hi> Colour, as that you are in a <hi>State of Grace,</hi> because you have <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Sign of it. Well, but then how shall we resolve our selves in this most <hi>material</hi> Enquiry? Why do but consider what it is to be <hi>righteous,</hi> and then reflect upon <hi>your own</hi> Motions, and you will quickly feel whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are <hi>righteous</hi> or no. Now to be <hi>righteous,</hi> is in the <hi>general</hi> to intend righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, and to act accordingly. If you ask again how you shall know whether you <hi>so</hi> intend and act? I shall only answer, that 'tis an <hi>unreasonable</hi> Question, and that you might as well ask me whether you are <hi>hungry</hi> or <hi>thirsty</hi>; for you do as naturally feel the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your <hi>Souls</hi> as you do the Motions of your <hi>Bodies</hi>; and for you to ask <hi>another</hi> Man what <hi>your own</hi> Intentions are, is to make him a <hi>Conjurer</hi> instead of a <hi>Casuist.</hi> Would it not
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:59595:236"/>
look extreamly <hi>ridiculous</hi> for a Man to ask his <hi>Creditor,</hi> or <hi>Customer, good Sir,</hi> how shall I know whether I intend to pay my Debts, or am sincerely resolved not to over-reach you? Should any Man ask me <hi>such</hi> a Question, I should only bid him consult himself; and if then he suspected <hi>his own</hi> Honesty, I should shrewdly suspect he had <hi>too</hi> much Reason for it. If you <hi>intend</hi> righteously, you <hi>intend</hi> it <hi>knowingly</hi>; and if you <hi>knowingly intend</hi> it, you cannot but <hi>know</hi> that you <hi>intend</hi> it. If you cannot know whether you <hi>intend</hi> and <hi>act</hi> righteously, you cannot know how to do it; and if you cannot know how to do it, you are not Subjects <hi>capable</hi> of Morality; but must of Necessity <hi>live</hi> and <hi>act</hi> at Random, and blunder on like <hi>Travellers in the dark,</hi> without being able to determin whether you go <hi>backward</hi> or <hi>forward.</hi> If therefore you would know whether you are <hi>righteous</hi> Men or no, do not go about to perplex and intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle your selves in the Wilderness of <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Tokens</hi>; for if you had a <hi>thousand</hi> Signs of <hi>Grace,</hi> you can never safely conclude you are <hi>righteous,</hi> till upon an <hi>impartial</hi> Review of your selves you do feel that you <hi>intend</hi> and <hi>act</hi> righteously; and then, and not till then, you may build upon it that <hi>God</hi> loves you. For God's Love is a <hi>constant</hi> and <hi>immutable</hi> Thing; and in this the Constancy of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists;
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:59595:236"/>
not that it is always <hi>fixt</hi> upon the same <hi>Person,</hi> but that 'tis unchangeably determined to the same <hi>Motive,</hi> and this Motive is Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness. So that if he find this <hi>Motive</hi> in us, he will be sure to love us so long as it continues; but if from <hi>Righteous</hi> we become <hi>Vnrighteous,</hi> he must either change in his Affection, or else cease to love us. For should he still love on when the Reason is ceased for which he loved us, he must either love us for no Reason, or for a Reason that is directly contrary to that for which he loved us first; and consequently his Love must either be a <hi>blind</hi> Fondness, or else a <hi>fickle</hi> and <hi>inconstant</hi> Passion. If therefore Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness be the Reason that moves the <hi>righteous Lord</hi> to love, we grossly flatter and abuse our selves if we presume that he loves us while we are <hi>unrighteous.</hi> Wherefore as we would not ruin our selves with relying upon <hi>vain</hi> Hopes, Hopes that will sink underneath us, and leave us eternally <hi>desperate</hi> and <hi>miserable</hi>; let us ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conclude that we are <hi>beloved of God</hi> till up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an <hi>impartial</hi> Tryal of our selves we can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we are sincerely <hi>righteous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> From hence I infer what <hi>grand</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement we have to be <hi>righteous,</hi> for that <hi>God</hi> loves Righteousness is a <hi>plain</hi> Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that 'tis the most <hi>amiable</hi> thing in the World; and that it best deserves the Affections of all <hi>rational</hi> Beings, since it hath won his, who never loves but upon the <hi>best</hi> Reason. And what a most <hi>glorious</hi> thing is it to be adorned with the
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:59595:237"/>
               <hi>best</hi> of Beauties, which by such an <hi>invincible</hi> Charm endears the Heart of the most <hi>glorious</hi> Being in the World? If there be so much Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour paid to a Beauty that can smite and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slave an <hi>earthly Potentate,</hi> what is there due to <hi>that</hi> that can constrain the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to fall in love with us? For what <hi>higher</hi> Mark can our Ambition aim at, than that of being beloved by the <hi>greatest</hi> and most <hi>lovely</hi> Being? Doubtless to be God's Favourite and Image is the <hi>highest</hi> Advancement that any Creature can aspire to; and were I born <hi>King</hi> of <hi>all</hi> the Kings of the Earth, and had all their <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Scepters</hi> at my Feet, I am sure my Reason would tell me that to be <hi>beloved of God</hi> would be a <hi>greater</hi> Glory to me than to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Pole</hi> to <hi>Pole</hi>; and should I entertain a Thought of exchanging the Honour of being a <hi>God-like</hi> Creature and the Favourite of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> for the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> of the World, my Conscience would tell me that I degraded my self, and prostituted <hi>my own</hi> Glory; for next to that of being a <hi>God</hi> my self, the <hi>highest</hi> Glory I can think of is to be a Friend to <hi>God,</hi> and this I am sure to be as soon as ever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence a <hi>righteous Man.</hi> And shall I stand so much in <hi>my own</hi> Light, O <hi>foolish Creature that I am,</hi> as to refuse his Friendship when I may have it on such <hi>reasonable</hi> Terms, and shall need no <hi>other</hi> Endearment to introduce me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Favour but only that of Righteousness? <hi>O thou most excellent Beauty, with whose Charms
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:59595:237"/>
the God of Heaven is inflamed! What shall I do to make thee mine! How shall I obtain to be adorned with thy heavenly Luster! I will go to the blessed Fountain from whence thou art derived, and with a Heart hungring and thirsting after thee, beseech him to infuse thy Streams into my Soul. I'll shun whatsoever is contrary to thee, and do whatsoever thou commandest me, and never cease Writing after thy fair Copies till I have transcribed thee into my Nature.</hi> And who would not, that sets any Value upon the Glory of being <hi>dear</hi> to <hi>God?</hi> For besides the Honour of being his Favourites, what an <hi>infinite</hi> Advantage may we expect to reap from it? For what may we not promise our selves from the Grace and Favour of the <hi>great Sovereign</hi> of Beings, who doth whatsoever pleases him in both Worlds, and hath the <hi>absolute</hi> Disposal of all the Blessings that either <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Earth</hi> affords? Doubtless we may safely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise our selves every Thing both from <hi>below</hi> and <hi>above</hi> that can either do us good <hi>here,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to our Happiness <hi>hereafter.</hi> For so the <hi>Psalmist</hi> tells us, that such is his Love of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness that he <hi>will give both Grace and Glory, and that no good Thing will he with-hold from them that walk uprightly,</hi> Psal. lxxxiv.11. Who would not then be tempted to Righteousness upon the Prospect of being a Favourite of <hi>God,</hi> and of the <hi>infinite</hi> Glory and Advantage which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds from thence?</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And lastly. From hence I infer how <hi>inexcusable</hi> we are if we persist in Sin after the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:59595:238"/>
many Discoveries which <hi>God</hi> hath made to us of his Love of Righteousness. Had we any Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to suppose that <hi>God</hi> is indifferently <hi>affected</hi> towards <hi>Righteousness</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> it would be a <hi>fair</hi> Excuse for <hi>unrighteous</hi> Persons; for what <hi>great</hi> Matter would it be which of the <hi>two</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries we chose, if both were <hi>indifferent</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> who best understands the Worth and Value of Things? But now when <hi>God</hi> hath discovered such a <hi>zealous</hi> Concern for Righteousness, and such an Abhorrence of its <hi>contrary,</hi> by so many <hi>clear</hi> Indications both <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>supernatural,</hi> there is no Ground or Colour for any such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse. For now no Man can be excusably <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> which way God's Heart is inclined, and we must wilfully shut our Eyes if we do not discern which of the <hi>two</hi> Contraries he would have us pursue; and therefore if notwithstanding this we still persist in <hi>unrighteousness,</hi> we do in Effect declare that we regard not <hi>God,</hi> and that we will <hi>do</hi> what we list let him <hi>will</hi> what he pleases; that in the Conduct of our Actions we will have the <hi>sole</hi> Disposal of our selves, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved that <hi>God</hi> shall have nothing to do with us, and that we will not concern our selves in any of our <hi>Choices</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi> whether he be pleased or displeased with them: this is the <hi>plain</hi> Sense of our Perseverance in Unrighteousness under all those <hi>clear</hi> Discoveries, which <hi>God</hi> hath made of his Aversion to it. Now how <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable</hi> is this, for a Creature to behave it self so insolently towards the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Owner</hi> of
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:59595:238"/>
its Being; to make him stand for a <hi>Cypher</hi> in <hi>his own</hi> Creation, and to take no more Notice of him than if he were the most <hi>impertinent</hi> and <hi>insignificant</hi> Being in the World? For now it's plain that our <hi>unrighteous Doings</hi> proceed from our <hi>rude</hi> Contempt and Regardlesness of his <hi>heavenly</hi> Will; we know well enough what he would have us do, but either we do not think him worth the minding, or if we do, we are resolv'd to behave our selves as if we did not. 'Tis true, he hath not made as <hi>full</hi> a Discovery of his Will to <hi>some</hi> as he hath to <hi>others</hi>; but yet it is plain he hath so sufficiently discovered it to all, that none can pretend to the Excuse of Ignorance. For, as for the <hi>Heathens,</hi> though they have no <hi>revealed</hi> Discoveries of it without them, yet they have a <hi>Bible</hi> within them, the <hi>large</hi> and <hi>legible Bible</hi> of Nature which lies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually open before them, and proposes to their View in <hi>fair</hi> and <hi>distinct</hi> Characters the Notion of <hi>God,</hi> the Distinctions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and the <hi>eternal</hi> Laws of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and therefore if notwithstanding this they will be so regardless of its <hi>great</hi> and <hi>blessed</hi> Author, as either not to attend to, or not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with these <hi>natural</hi> Discoveries of his Will, what Excuse can they make why they should not perish in <hi>their own</hi> Obstinacy? For as the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us, though <hi>they have not the Law,</hi> i. e. the revealed Law, <hi>yet they did</hi> (or at least might have done) <hi>by nature the things contained in the Law</hi>; and therefore <hi>as many</hi> of them <hi>as have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
               <pb n="470" facs="tcp:59595:239"/>
without this <hi>revealed</hi> Law, shall also perish without it, that is, by the Sentence of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> Rom. 2.12, 14. And then as for the <hi>Jews,</hi> besides those <hi>natural</hi> Indications of God's Love of Righteousness which they had in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the <hi>Heathen,</hi> they had sundry <hi>superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> ones; they had sundry <hi>great</hi> and <hi>notorious</hi> Examples of God's rewarding <hi>righteous,</hi> and punishing <hi>wicked</hi> Men; and the <hi>outward</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> Part of which was a <hi>new</hi> Edition of the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> and did contain within the <hi>Rine</hi> and <hi>Letter</hi> of it, the most <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>spiritual</hi> Precepts of Righteousness; and the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Part of which was, (though an <hi>obscure</hi>) yet <hi>intelligible</hi> Representation of all those <hi>spiritual</hi> Motives to Righteousness which <hi>Christianity</hi> contains. So that would they but have attended either to the <hi>spiritual</hi> Sense of their Law, or to the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> of their <hi>Prophets</hi> which very much cleared and explained it, they could not have been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant either of any Part of their Duty, or of any <hi>considerable</hi> Motive that was needful to press and ingage them to it. If therefore notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this they were so <hi>regardless</hi> of <hi>God</hi> as to take no Notice of those many <hi>sensible</hi> Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which his Providence had made between <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>unrighteous</hi> Men, in blessing the <hi>one</hi> and punishing the <hi>other,</hi> of which he gave them so many <hi>signal</hi> Examples; if they had so <hi>little</hi> Reverence for his Authority, as neither to mind his Law <hi>within,</hi> nor his Law <hi>without</hi> them,
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:59595:239"/>
or if they minding the <hi>later,</hi> were so extreamly heedless as to rest in a <hi>mere</hi> Conformity to the Letter of it, without ever attending to its <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Sense and Meaning; upon what <hi>reasonable</hi> Pretence can their Stupidity be excused? But then lastly, as for us <hi>Christians,</hi> we have not only all those <hi>natural</hi> Indications of God's Love of Righteousness which the <hi>Heathens</hi> had, and all those <hi>supernatural</hi> ones which the <hi>Jews</hi> had; but we have all these <hi>later</hi> with much <hi>greater</hi> Advantage than the <hi>Jews</hi>; for they are all set before us in a <hi>clearer</hi> Light, and presented much more <hi>naked</hi> to our View. For as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to us, they are neither wrapt <hi>up</hi> in <hi>mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Senses, nor clouded over with <hi>typical</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations; but laid before us in the most <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> Propositions. The <hi>literal</hi> Sense of our <hi>Precepts</hi> of Righteousness, and of all our <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Threats,</hi> is the <hi>mystical</hi> Sense of theirs; and all those <hi>Christian Motives</hi> to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which were delivered to them in <hi>dark</hi> Riddles and <hi>obscure</hi> and <hi>typical</hi> Adumbrations, are brought forth to us from behind the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and proposed in <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>popular</hi> Articles of Faith: So that if we still continue in Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, we are of all Men in the World the most <hi>inexcusable.</hi> The <hi>Heathens</hi> may plead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Jews</hi> that their <hi>Law of Nature</hi> was not so <hi>clear</hi> in its <hi>Precepts,</hi> nor yet so <hi>cogent</hi> in its <hi>Motives</hi> as the <hi>Law of Moses</hi> was. The <hi>Jews</hi> may plead against us <hi>Christians</hi> that their <hi>Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was neither so <hi>express</hi> in its <hi>Precepts,</hi> nor yet
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:59595:240"/>
so <hi>intelligible</hi> in its <hi>best</hi> and most <hi>powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>; but as for us <hi>Christians</hi> we have nothing at all to plead, but, by <hi>our own</hi> Obstinacy against the <hi>clearest</hi> Discoveries both of our Dury and the Motives which oblige us to it, are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>everlasting</hi> Silence. So that when at the <hi>last Tribunal</hi> it shall appear that we have persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in Unrighteousness, we must expect the Reproaches of all the <hi>reasonable</hi> World; to be <hi>exploded</hi> and <hi>hissed</hi> at, not only by the <hi>universal Choir</hi> of <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> but by <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and by the <hi>Devils</hi> themselves; who will all conspire with <hi>our own</hi> Consciences to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond that <hi>dreadful</hi> Sentence which shall then pass upon us, with the <hi>general</hi> Acclamation of <hi>just and righteous art thou, O Lord, in all thy Ways.</hi> Wherefore as we would not perish <hi>for ever</hi> without Pity or Excuse, let us be persuaded to abandon all <hi>Vnrighteousness and worldly Lusts, and to live soberly and righteously, and godly in this present World</hi>; and then we may assure our selves that the <hi>righteous Lord</hi> who loves Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness will love us also for the sake of it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his Love to us in <hi>blessing</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> us <hi>here,</hi> and crowning us with Glory and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness <hi>hereafter.</hi> And this we beseech thee to grant, <hi>O thou immutable Lover of Righteousness,</hi> even for <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> his sake; To whom with thy self and thy <hi>eternal Spirit</hi> be ascribed by us, and all the World; all Honour and Glory and Power from this time forth, and for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
