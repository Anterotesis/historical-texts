            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Oble and mighty Lords, I preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Lordſhips a little Book; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it preſents it ſelfe, which though the quantity thereof
<pb facs="tcp:114771:4"/>
bee very ſmall, yet being of a great quality, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appropiate unto your Lordſhips; for it maintaineth your command, your Right and Soveraignty. The ſcope and drift thereof is to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and prove, (as it were curſively, and running over the times paſt, even from the beginning of this ſo famous Nation, unto this very preſent day) how that the chief So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty of the publike af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, hath ever had place in the principall of the two States, which were then the <hi>Battavers;</hi> but now are the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the Weſt <hi>Freiſes.</hi> The which So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty through a long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall
<pb facs="tcp:114771:4"/>
conſequent Succeſſion, is now at this preſent eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in your Lordſhips.</p>
            <p>This Soveraignty and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the States hath been the foundation of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, the harbour of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect moderated equity, and the bridle of the Principalities prodigality.</p>
            <p>This power in former times hath been a terror, and for feare thereof, even the chiefeſt Commanders, and thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the State of the Land, have willingly ſubmitted their magnifience thereunto; yea, whether they were Kings, or Generals, or thoſe which in theſe lateſt times were
<pb facs="tcp:114771:5"/>
called the Earles thereof.</p>
            <p>The very Lawes and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thereof, which are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unviolable, have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe alſo continually been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſafely in the cuſtody and poſſeſſion, and as it were in the boſome of the States.</p>
            <p>By the reſolutions of their Lordſhips, is that Liberty, (which in former times the <hi>Hollanders</hi> have had, and is now againe ſo farre famous) ſailed through thoſe mighty raging tempeſts, even unto theſe happy dayes and times.</p>
            <p>For what greater dangers could have hapned to any for their Liberty, then that which hath hapned unto them? as
<pb facs="tcp:114771:5"/>
firſt, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> power, and afterwards that of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> power, which is the next unto the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> or elſe according unto their own opinion farre greater then the <hi>Romiſh,</hi> power it ſelf was.</p>
            <p>Yet nevertheleſſe, that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty hath wreſtled and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it ſelf through both of thoſe hideous dangers; and when they were enforced to take Arms, They firſt oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violence of their Oppreſſors, the reaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their Cauſe, a good politick Order, and an invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage.</p>
            <p>The happy event thereof hath declared it ſelf at two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb facs="tcp:114771:6"/>
times unto the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Nations, upon the face of the Earth, and with the Warre is the fame and power thereof encreaſed, even as it pleaſeth the wiſedome of God, commonly firſt to prove and aſſay thoſe with great travels and dangers, whom hee will afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to great honours.</p>
            <p>Under the condition of thoſe ſame Lords and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, hath ever appeared that great fidelity of the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> which was never leſſe then the valiantneſſe of their deeds in Warre; which fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the <hi>Romans</hi> can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifie of, in the times
<pb facs="tcp:114771:6"/>
of your Lordſhips Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors: And the Neighbouring Kings doe now acknowledge the ſame in your Lordſhips: And not only they, but alſo even thoſe which are our <hi>Antipodes,</hi> and which behold another Firmament and Stars.</p>
            <p>The recitation of all which things according unto their deſerts, would be matter for the furniſhing of a great Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory.</p>
            <p>It may ſuffice for this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhortly and ſummarily to relate the Antiquity of this Government which hapned under the Government of the Nobles or States, the labour whereof I doubt not but it
<pb facs="tcp:114771:7"/>
will be profitable for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and very acceptable unto Strangers; for although it be very true, that which in old time was reported of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades</hi> and alſo <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> which is, That a good Subject is bound to defend the preſent eſtate of the Common-wealth, and to ſeek for no Alteration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet nevertheleſſe, we deſire and more earneſtly affect ſuch a kinde of Government, as we our ſelves enjoy, and beſides we perceive hath been pleaſing to our fore-fathers, whether it be as the beſt in it ſelf, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be that which is moſt convenient for them, the which our Fathers have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb facs="tcp:114771:7"/>
and defended even with their deareſt lives, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving left the ſame as their own proper inheritance unto their ſucceeding poſterity.</p>
            <p>Hereunto may alſo be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that in all matters Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is much reſpected, and of great worth; yea, ſo much eſteemed, that they of <hi>Marſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illes,</hi> whoſe Common-wealth is anciently reported to be ſo exceeding famous, and for which they are ſo highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, that they even from the firſt foundation of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have themſelves uſed the ſword for the execution of Juſtice upon Malefactors; ſhewing thereby, that alſo
<pb facs="tcp:114771:8"/>
even in the ſmalleſt matters, all the leaſt points of Ancient Cuſtome ought to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: for Antiquity in ſome reſpects commeth neareſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, by way of reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that it hath with Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>From whence alſo it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, that in our hearts, there is bred a reverentneſſe and reſpect unto Antiquity; which Antiquity in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth ought much more to bee had in eſtimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then in the perſons of men, in regard that in the perſons of men, which are mortall, their Antiquity or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientneſſe is a ſign of their
<pb facs="tcp:114771:8"/>
approaching Death: But An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth being once ſettled and grounded upon hope of never to die, doth beget from time her vertue and force, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the more old the more able; for continuance is an infallible demonſtration of a well framed policy: from hence proceedeth an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and affection unto the Government, even from the very hearts of the Inhabitants. And this is the very principall occaſion of the continuance and ſtanding of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, becauſe that in former times it ſo continued.</p>
            <p>It was alſo reaſon that I had
<pb facs="tcp:114771:9"/>
ſome reſpect unto Strangers, to the end that thoſe which are exceeding deſirous to be informed of the ſtate of this Common-wealth, by reaſon of the greatneſſe of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Acts atchieved by the ſame, might not only know the eſtate thereof as it is at this preſent, but alſo in what eſtate the ſame hath been in times paſt.</p>
            <p>Alſo taking away an abuſe which oftentimes proceedeth from names that are alike, in matters that are differing; for the Princes themſelves were not alwayes alike, nor yet the States neither; for ſometimes the Chief Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
<pb facs="tcp:114771:9"/>
was in the perſon of one man; but then the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and advice for the effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of buſineſſes was in the perſons of many. At other times the Soveraigntie was in many, but the Adminiſtration in the perſon of one man. At ſome times the Lawes were ſubject to the Prince; at other times the Prince ſubject to the Lawes: All which, if a man will deliberately ponder, hee ſhall eaſily find, that that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth which is at this preſent among us, hath not had its begining now of late, but that the very ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth that in former times hath been, is now made
<pb facs="tcp:114771:10"/>
more manifeſt, and appeareth more cleare and evidenter then ever before. For like as a houſe may continue ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing though ſome parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be altered and changed: but if the foundation bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, it cannot continue ſtanding; Even ſo, the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and changing of names and Offices of ſome Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, doth not make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently another Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, in regard that the principall Power and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and as it were the very ſoule of that whole body which hath its being, moveth and keepeth together, and doth remain and continue one
<pb facs="tcp:114771:10"/>
and the very ſelf-ſame.</p>
            <p>It remaineth then, (Noble and moſt worthy Lords) that we pray unto the Lord God, who is the eſtabliſher and maintainer of this State, That it will pleaſe him to defend and maintaine that Liberty, the which is not ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by your eſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the worthy va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the Burgeſſes and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, as it hath been hitherto, and is yet defended by his heavenly aſſiſtance, and may yet extend it ſelfe for many yeeres to come; and GOD grant, that it may continue among us, and be made our owne, even all theſe bleſſings
<pb facs="tcp:114771:11"/>

            <head>The firſt Chapter. What a Principality is in a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Nobles; And what they be that are called States.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LI Nations are governed, either by the Common People, or elſe by the Nobles, or elſe by one Man only. The Government of the Nobles is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114771:12"/>
either with a Principality, or elſe without a Principality: I call that a Principality, which is a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eminent Authority in the perſon of one man only, being limited by the Power and Laws of others: By which markes this is different from that which is called properly a Regall Authority. And for this occaſion, it is that <hi>Tacitus</hi> maketh mention, how that <hi>Piſo</hi> had reported of <hi>Germanicus,</hi> that hee was the ſonne of a Prince of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and not of a King of the <hi>Parthians.</hi> And <hi>Suetonius</hi> reporteth of <hi>Caligula,</hi> that it wanted but a very little, but that he had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the ſhape or frame of the Principality into a Regall Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; even as <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo reporteth of the Father of <hi>Vercingetorix,</hi> that he being a Prince of the <hi>Walloons,</hi> for divers Conſiderations ſuing to have brought the ſame to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114771:12"/>
Authority, was made away by the Burgeſſes. And <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Trajan,</hi> reporteth that hee poſſeſſed the Seat of the Prince, becauſe that there ſhould bee no place for a Lord: Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, the Principality being impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpoken, is called a Regall Authority. And in like manner (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> it was in the dayes of the Worthies, that the Regall Authority had his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall beginning, and that when as the People having gotten and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any exceeding great beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from them, their Parents or Anceſtors, as for example; By whom they had gotten and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained good Lawes, or by whom in time of Warre they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and defended, them they gave the ful Authority of the War, with the power of judging of the Affaires: which Regall Authority
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114771:13"/>
hee reporteth to bee over them that voluntarily conſented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and were alſo limited with Lawes: The ſame alſo reporteth <hi>Thucidides,</hi> that amongſt the <hi>Greeks</hi> the Authority of the Kings is the moſt Ancient, the which deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the Parents unto the Children by Succeſſion, being clad with certain Titles of Honour.</p>
            <p>From whence then appeareth, that in the Government of the Nobles, the Principalities were diſtributed according to the order of the kindred; from whence we have an excellent example from them of <hi>Lacedemonia:</hi> Moreover, the Nobles in whom the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty conſiſteth, doe give their voyces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either each of them apart, like as the <hi>Venetians</hi> doe, or elſe in the behalf of any Society; which Societies are either of one, or elſe of divers ſorts: Thoſe that were of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114771:13"/>
one ſort, were like unto thoſe of <hi>Achaia,</hi> whoſe Convocation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of the Deputies of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The other which were of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſorts, were of the Burgeſſes, and of the Societies conſiſting of the Burgeſſes, ariſing from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities of the Qualities, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unto the which, ſome of them were ordained to the Government, ſome by one meanes, and ſome by an other meanes: And for this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, thoſe ſame Qualities; and alſo thoſe Societies themſelves were called by the Latins, <hi>Ordines;</hi> which in Common Language wee doe uſually call the <hi>States:</hi> Which States <hi>Hippodamus</hi> made of three ſorts, as, of the Artificers, the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and the Souldiers. <hi>Plato</hi> made, the Survayers, the Souldiers, and the Husbandmen: The <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> made the Prieſts, the Souldiers, and the Tradeſmen: The old <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:114771:14"/>
made, the Druides, the Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the common People. So that oftentimes the Nobles then were different, and apart, in reſpect of the States: Thoſe that have then the chief ſway in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wee call a Government of States: Like as at this preſent in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the chiefeſt ſway conſiſteth together in the Princes Electors, the Princes &amp; the Cities. If in caſe then that this Authority of the Nobles, being united to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the States, whereunto alſo appertained a lawfull Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, then ſuch a Government muſt bee eſteemed for the moſt choyſe and beſt tempered Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. For, ſince in all matters mediocrity is moſt commended; and that mediocrity is nominated ſometimes from that which is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from both the Ends, and ſometimes from that which is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114771:14"/>
of both the Ends; ſo that then it appeareth, that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in ſuch manner, is placed between the Regall Authority, and the Authority of the Common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſo that it avoideth the evils of both of them, and draweth unto it ſelfe from, them all which is good after it. For firſt of all, ſince that it tolerateth not all things, neither only one man to govern, which is ſubject to many errours, not yet the Common People who are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; ſo that by this meanes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt much danger is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyded.</p>
            <p>Again, in regard that a Regall Authority is commended, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the exceeding Majeſty and Dignity thereof: And the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Common People com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, in reſpect of the equall Liberty: Yet the Government of the Nobles, obtaineth that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114771:15"/>
Majeſty and Dignity by the Principality; and alſo giveth as much equall Liberty as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, when as they (unto every one that ſhall endeavour himſelfe thereunto, of what ſtate ſoever he be, by his good parts &amp; demeanors, and by making themſelves a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune thereunto) doe beſtow upon ſuch, both the higheſt Offices, and alſo the partnerſhip of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Authority.</p>
            <p>This then being ſet down as a Preface, to the end, that that which followeth and ſhall bee ſpoken hereafter, bee not mangled and ſpoyled; there remaineth now, that wee diligently make enquiry, in what ſtate the Government of the <hi>Battavers</hi> hath been, even from the very beginning of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth, to this very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>And in the doing whereof, if in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114771:15"/>
caſe my arguments bee not ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely perfect, as if I were in handling the Hiſtory of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> or of the <hi>Romans:</hi> yet let no man marvell thereat, ſince that the ancienteſt Antiquities of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> are not known unto us no otherwiſe, but by the Writings of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who took very little care in the Regiſtring of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires of Strangers: And that alſo even after the fall of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, the Acts of our Nation, like as alſo the greateſt part of all others, of thoſe times, are ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding obſcure, and alſo very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſo involved in many untruths and mear fables: And alſo that for a long time after, and even untill now, very lately, is there riſen up but few of good underſtanding that have endevoured to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Fame of the Acts of the proceedings unto Poſterity: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114771:16"/>
alſo, becauſe that for a long time, the very Charters and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords doe make no report of any thing unto us: And for this occaſion, the Reader muſt take in good part, and be content with that rough hewen and unpol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed portraiture of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is deſcribed; and not expect a perfect, curious, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed repreſentation thereof: and muſt doe in this, that which a Judge ought to doe in matters that exceed memory; as namely, that he ſhall not ſo curiouſly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely urge teſtimony from every moment of time to time, but the beginning and the end being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, hee muſt imagine with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that the time betwixt both was conformed unto the ends, if the contrary doe not appeare.</p>

            <head>The ſecond Chapter. In what Eſtate the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> was at the Originall beginning of this People.</head>
            <p>IT is then certain, that the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> which before were a part of the people then called <hi>Catches,</hi> which now are called <hi>Heſſens,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> teſtifieth; As alſo, the coherence of the names of the <hi>Battavers</hi> with the <hi>Heſſens,</hi> and the names of the <hi>Catches</hi> with the <hi>Battavers,</hi> is an infallible mark and token thereof: And that long before the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> yea, peradventure ſome hundred years before, they being removed and come unto the place which they now inhabite, that is, into an Iland
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114771:17"/>
which was invironed about with the great Sea, and the River <hi>Ryne;</hi> and the next place unto their ſhore upon this ſide of the <hi>Ryne,</hi> was that which is called the River <hi>Wall,</hi> or the <hi>Belgian</hi> border: And that then theſe places (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth) being unhabited, and then by them taken in and poſſeſſed, appertained moſt juſtly and rightly unto them, according to the moſt reaſonable Law of Nature, even like as thoſe goods which have no Poſſeſſors, doe properly appertain unto thoſe which are the firſt Poſſeſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. So is this then the very firſt and abſolute perfect beginning of a free Government, as being eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a people of a free ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall beginning in a free Land.</p>
            <p>What manner of Government they then uſed, <hi>Strabo</hi> ſheweth, who ſayth, that the <hi>Celtes</hi> were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addicted to the Goverment of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114771:17"/>
the Nobles; for when as the <hi>Greeks</hi> call them <hi>Celies,</hi> they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend therein as well the <hi>Walloons,</hi> which were then Neighbours unto the <hi>Battavers,</hi> as the <hi>Germans,</hi> whereof the <hi>Battavers</hi> were the moſt famous, if wee will credit <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Plinius.</hi> And as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Walloons, Ambiorix</hi> ſheweth what manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they had before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of the <hi>Romans,</hi> where hee ſayth, That the command of the Prince in that place was ſuch, that the multitude had no leſſe ſway over him, then he had over the Multitude; now in this place, the word <hi>multitude</hi> is not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood for the baſe Commonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but for the aſſembly of the choyceſt of each Nation; even as we finde many Examples thereof in <hi>Caeſar:</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf ſheweth, where he ſayth, that the Common
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114771:18"/>
People amongſt the <hi>Walloons</hi> were of no reſpect nor account, and that they were never admitted to come into any Councell; but that all their Authority was in their Druides and Horſemen. That alſo the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> from all Antiquity, did not live under the Authority of one only perſon, but of many perſons. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſheweth the ſame in that place, where he ſpeaketh of the Ancient Warlike Expeditions of the <hi>Germans;</hi> ſaying, That the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were more furious, and more earneſt to maintaine their own Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty then the Kings of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> were.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Lucanus</hi> maketh mention of them, they complayning after this manner, in theſe words:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Our Liberty is gone,</l>
               <l>So farre out of our hands;</l>
               <l>And got beyond the Doane,</l>
               <l>Into th' over Ryniſh Lands:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114771:18"/>
And though we ſeek it ſhould,</l>
               <l>And hazard life and blood:</l>
               <l>The <hi>Dutch,</hi> and <hi>Tartar</hi> bould,</l>
               <l>Doe keep it as their good.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Whereafter alſo this followed:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Much People now abroad,</l>
               <l>That for themſelves make Kings;</l>
               <l>But wee have got a load,</l>
               <l>Our Liberty that ſtings.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>In which places, what is meant by this word <hi>Liberty;</hi> the proper expoſition of the word <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Regall Authority</hi> doth ſufficiently expreſſe, as that which is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto Liberty: like as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals in the beginning doe affirm, ſaying, The City of <hi>Rome</hi> at the firſt beginning, was governed by Kings; But <hi>Lucius Brutus</hi> brought in both Liberty and Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:114771:19"/>
And like as theſe things general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did concern the <hi>Germans,</hi> even ſo <hi>Civilis,</hi> who was a <hi>Battaver</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, doth approve that only theſe did properly appertain to the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers:</hi> And in his Oration which he made, exhorting the <hi>Walloons</hi> to their Liberty, <hi>viz.</hi> where he ſayed, Let them of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the Eaſterlings be in ſubjection, which are accuſtomed unto Kings; whereby hee ſheweth ſufficiently, and gave them to underſtand, That like as the Eaſterlings are much addicted to have Kings, that by that meanes the <hi>Battavers</hi> might have a loathing of ſuch a manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Yet ſome men may think that this contradicts that ſame which is ſpoken of <hi>Civilis</hi> in another place, who was himſelfe of the Royall blood. Whereunto may be added, that which <hi>Strabo</hi> reports of one <hi>Veromerus,</hi> who had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114771:19"/>
been a King of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> like as alſo <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> who alſo makes mention of other Kings of the <hi>Battavers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more certain, but that theſe Kings, ſuch as the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> had, only Kings in Name, not in very deed, were no other but the chiefeſt amongſt their Nobles. This <hi>Tacitus</hi> plainly proveth, where he ſayth, That the <hi>Germane</hi> Kings had not a free and unlimited power; and ſayth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in their Convocations they were heard more with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Counſell, then with power to Command. In like manner ſpeaking of the <hi>Frieſes</hi> who were an Antient Neighbouring Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> when he had ſayd that they had <hi>Verritum</hi> and <hi>Malorigem</hi> to their Kings, added very diſcreetly thereunto, for as much as the <hi>Germans</hi> were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114771:20"/>
after a Kingly manner. Alſo where he deſcribeth the <hi>Goaths,</hi> he ſaith, That they were governed more neare unto a Kingly manner, then all the other Nations of the <hi>Germans;</hi> Yet nevertheleſſe, not exceeding their Liberty: And ſhewing that they of <hi>Sweathen</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving altogether another nature of Government, otherwiſe then the <hi>Germans</hi> have, he ſaith, So that one man only hath the Authority over them without any exception, and that they, <hi>Volens, Nolens,</hi> muſt obey him.</p>
            <p>And alſo the <hi>Germans</hi> had not all of them, nor yet at all times, ſuch like Kings, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times onely Generalls. <hi>Tacitus</hi> maketh a plain and evident diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between theſe two, ſaying, That they made them Kings that were of the higheſt deſcent of the Nobility; but the Generals, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114771:20"/>
to their valour and vertue. <hi>Caeſar</hi> alſo ſaith, that the <hi>Germans</hi> in the time of peace, had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Generall; but that they were choſen, that ſhould be their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in Warre after ſuch a manner, that their Authority had the Power of puniſhing with life and death: So that ſometimes (though ſeldom) there have been Kings, but oftentimes Generals, the which were choſen for every expedition; like as <hi>Civilis</hi> himſelf was choſen by the <hi>Battavers;</hi> and before his time <hi>Cariovalda,</hi> and afterwards others.</p>
            <p>The Authority of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals was of no force, but in the Warres; But the Authority of the Kings had a farther extent, of rather was herein greater, that it ſtill continued: And yet each and both of theſe Authorities were neither of them infinite nor unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114771:21"/>
from whence followeth neceſſarily, that they were both of them bound in with certaine limits and reſtrictions.</p>
            <p>This limitation proceeded ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Law, or from ſome other Authority: The Law hath his certaine exceptions, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſo cals it; but the Authority of many joyned thereunto, doth make that that one hath his Authority only by toleration, and not by his own right.</p>
            <p>The Lawes were not contained in writings, but were kept and maintained (as being holy) by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and cuſtome, like as it was accuſtomed among the <hi>Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in what manner, or how farre, or after what ſort, thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of the <hi>Battavers</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in Limiting the Authority of their Kings and Generals, it would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114771:21"/>
bee very heard to repeat: Yet it is credible, that the very ſame was not much different from that which hereafter in the ſequell we ſhall heare, was uſed in the dayes of the Earls, the which but of late years was begun to be regiſtred. And to produce proofes, that the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers</hi> deſcended from the <hi>Heſſens,</hi> which was the moſt provident Nation of the <hi>Germans;</hi> and who did excell in the knowledge of commanding and obeying; which <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirmeth in theſe words, ſaying, They ſet over them, him, whom they had elected, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed him whom they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I never heard or found, that any one Nation either in private or publique matters, did ſo conſtantly hold and ſtick together in maintaining the Laws and Cuſtoms of their Anceſtors,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114771:22"/>
in ſuch ſort that it may juſtly bee ſayd of them, That good Cuſtoms were of greater force there amongſt them, then in other places good Laws were unto others: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample thereof, take the Cuſtome of the <hi>Heſſens,</hi> when as they did weare the hair of their heads and beards ſo long, and binding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with an Oath, not to change the deformity thereof, before they had overthrown their Enemies. For the remembrance and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of which Cuſtome, take <hi>Civilis</hi> himſelf who was a <hi>Battaver,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, who firſt cut of his long golden yellow coloured hair, when as he had defeated the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions: And it is manifeſt, that there have been ſuch in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of theſe laſt Warres which lately ended, that uſed the very ſame, maintaining the Cuſtome in that particular, which they had from their Anceſtors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:114771:22"/>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies and Squadrons were not erected and made by Chance, as taking whom they could get, but it was by kindreds of Conſanguinity, and Alliance. There is yet to bee found in many Cities of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> even in theſe dayes, ſuch Companies and Squadrons, conſiſting of Friends and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, being a Cuſtome exceeding all memory.</p>
            <p>By the old <hi>Germans,</hi> the women as ſoone as they were married, were exhorted and inſtructed, that they were come thither to be as Companion to their Husbands, in all paines, and in all dangers; and that ſhee muſt endure and ſuffer all things with her Husband, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver happened, whether it were in time of Peace or Warre: from hence it proceedeth that the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> even to this very preſent
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114771:23"/>
day, doe hold their goods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon between bed-fellows, that is man and wife.</p>
            <p>They doe make their drink of Malt, which is made of Corn, very like unto Wine: They do weare very ſtreight Cloathes girded to their loynes.</p>
            <p>They doe make their habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the fields; and every man his own Poſſeſſion hedged in, which are altogether old tokens of the <hi>Germans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which <hi>Tacitus</hi> reporteth of thoſe deadly feuds, which were once begun amongſt any of the kindreds by any other, that the reconciliation was to be made even unto that whole kindred: And that the parties were to bee reconciled ſitting and eating toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one Table; and that one part of the Reconciliation-money ſhould be payed to their Lords, or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114771:23"/>
put into the common Purſe, and the other part ſhould bee payed unto him that was injured, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his friends. Which Cuſtoms have been continued, and yet ſtill doe continue, excepting that above a hundred, or two hundred years ſince, thoſe deadly feuds which were amongſt the kindreds, were proſecuted more furiouſly and more openly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſayth, that amongſt this People was a Cuſtome, That every man for his own part, man for man, brought ſome of their own Cattell unto their Prince, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of them as a gratuity, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame for his proper uſe, from hence did the Tythes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, their manner of chuſing their Generals, is expreſſed by the example of the <hi>Kennemers,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> did after
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114771:24"/>
this manner elect one <hi>Brinio,</hi> being very nobly, deſcended for their Generall; as namely, They ſet him upon a Shield, and according to the Cuſtome of their Nation, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, They lifted him up, and carryed him upon their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. That the very ſame manner continued amongſt the <hi>Battavers</hi> and their Neighbouring Nations, even untill the dayes of the Earls, appeareth in many old pieces, which doe manifeſtly teſtifie, that before the Battell which happened between the <hi>Freiſes</hi> and Earle <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> the laſt of the Houſe of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault:</hi> that there was a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held; and the <hi>Freiſes</hi> did this reverence unto their Earl: four of the chiefe of the Nobles of the <hi>Freiſes,</hi> did ſet their Earle upon a Shield, and ſo carryed him upon their ſhoulders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, ſaying: This is the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114771:24"/>
Magnificence of <hi>Frieſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſons wherefore that theſe old Cuſtoms were ſo ſtrictly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by theſe People, as well in particular, as alſo in publick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which tend more to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew, then to any powerfull effect of Government; I could eaſily perſwade my ſelfe, that even of old time, they have had ſuch Lawes concerning the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Cuſtome of ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times hath declared.</p>
            <p>Yet muſt wee make enquiry, in whom was this higheſt power or Soveraignty, beſides in the Kings and Generals. I finde that by the <hi>Germans,</hi> excepting the Clergy, that there was two ſorts of States amongſt them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Princes, and the Comonalty; now when I ſpeak of Princes, I do not underſtand, nor mean thoſe, that each of them had their Authority over a whole
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114771:25"/>
Nation; like as that name is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed, for ſuch Princes were the Kings and the Generals them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whereof we have already ſpoken: But they were ſuch, as that each of them took care for one part of the Nation, which parts being great, were called Quarters, and being little, were called Villages; of which <hi>Caeſar</hi> thus ſpeaketh, They have no common Magiſtrate, but the Princes of the Countreys, and of the Quarters, doe miniſter Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice unto them which are under them, and doe decide the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that thoſe Princes doe miniſter Juſtice, both in the Quarters and in the Villages. <hi>Tacitus</hi> alſo ſheweth unto us, that thoſe Princes were uſually choſen, where he ſaith, <hi>In that Convocation were alſo the Princes choſen:</hi> But they went ſo to work, that ever after they had regard unto thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114771:25"/>
that were nobly born, and of the choyceſt of the Nobility, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the meritorious deeds of their Predeceſſors being applyed even to their young Youths, did afford them that worthineſſe to bee Princes. From whence I believe is come, that thoſe Juriſdictions, both of Quarters and Villages, having long continued in the Houſes of the Nobility, are at laſt become hereditary: By reaſon whereof, thoſe Princes by the worthineſſe of their Offices; their enſuing Poſterity afterwards were thoſe which were called Barrons and Nobles: yet the Government was not ſo much in their perſons, that the Common People were held as Slaves, like as the <hi>Walloons</hi> were in the time of <hi>Caeſar:</hi> But unto each Prince, (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> teſtifieth) were adjoyned a hundred men, which were choſen out of the Comonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114771:26"/>
to be as their Companions, ſerving for Counſell and Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thoſe were the Princes that <hi>Caeſar</hi> reporteth, who together with the Officers, divided the Lands into Portions and Paſtures: So then were thoſe ſame Regions governed partly by thoſe which were choſen out of the Common People, and partly by thoſe Princes of each Common-Wealth. And they in this manner governed each of them their Quarters, having (being altogether,) the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole Common-wealth, and that by a form of Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that of all the ſmall matters, the Princes did conſult upon, but the great Affairs were diſpatched by the Princes in generall; yet in ſuch a manner, that whatſoever was decreed by the generall Princes, the Comonalty
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114771:26"/>
was acquainted withall. He ſaith, that the Convocations of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> was of two ſorts, whereof the one was little, in the which, the daily Affairs which often hapned, were decided, and this Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſiſted only of the Princes: And the other was greater, in whom was the power of deciding even of the moſt higheſt and weightieſt Affairs; and this conſiſted of both the States: For whereas <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith (in generall) that ſame is not ſo to be underſtood, as if every one ſhould come thither, like as it uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hapned upon the Aſſemblies of the <hi>Romans,</hi> in ſuch manner, that every man ſhould leave his houſe and home; for ſuch could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently be amongſt ſo great a popularity; eſpecially, like as the <hi>Battavers</hi> were, among whom <hi>Pliny</hi> reckoneth up ſeven Nations, as, the <hi>Battavers,</hi> which were properly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114771:27"/>
ſo called, the <hi>Kennemers,</hi> the little <hi>Freiſes,</hi> the <hi>Frieſiabonds,</hi> the little <hi>Cauches,</hi> the <hi>Tuſians,</hi> and the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacians:</hi> Now theſe altogether were called the Convocation it ſelf, whereunto ſome perſons were ſent from each Region and State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tacitus</hi> expoundeth that ſame, where hee ſpeaking of the <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomes,</hi> ſaith, that all the people of one diſcent aſſembled together at appointed times, by thoſe that were deputed thereunto, in a wood, the which was ſanctified by the old Devotion and Prophecies of their Anceſtors. And of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> in generall, hee ſaith thus, that they aſſembled upon certaine days, unleſſe that accidentally any thing happened which required haſte, and was ſome extraordinary matter. And there after he ſaith thus, This abuſe proceeded of their liberty, that they did not aſſemble
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114771:27"/>
altogether, nor yet when as they were commanded or warned; but oftentimes they let paſſe two or three dayes before they did aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo that then the Soveraignty was in the perſons of this Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of both the Eſtates: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ſaith thus, Before this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, was any man to be accuſed and challenged upon life and death. Againe hee ſaith, In this ſame Aſſembly the Princes were elected, and alſo thoſe hundred men which were choſen out of the Commons, and adjoyned as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions unto them. The Kings themſelves and the Generals were heard in this Aſſembly, (as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid) more with Authority to counſell, then with any power to command. And although this was common unto all the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> and not appertaining unto the <hi>Battavers,</hi> as being not able to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114771:28"/>
attaine thereunto; Yet the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Civilis</hi> approveth that the <hi>Battavers</hi> had this manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the end that the wars might orderly be decreed againſt the oppreſſion of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> for that end (ſaith he) hee aſſembled together the Princes of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ableſt of the common people. Wherein appeareth then that the <hi>Battavers</hi> uſed the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nobles, and yet in ſuch ſort, that there was a Principality annexed thereunto, which was either continually under the name of a King, or temporally under the name of a Generall: That alſo the Nobles were of two ſorts, that is, of the Princes, the which were called the firſt and the greateſt: and thoſe that were elected out of the Common people; theſe two being conjoyntly in the Aſſembly, had the Soveraignty of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114771:28"/>
matters; but in regard that this ſame Aſſembly did ſeldome meet, the matters were commonly diſpatched by the Kings, according to the advice of the Princes.</p>
            <p>That alſo the Government of each quarter was in ſuch manner in each of theſe Princes which had their owne Juriſdiction, as in thoſe Magiſtrates which were choſen out of the ſecond State; the which in ſuch a wonderfull muſicall conſort doth expreſſe that Government which <hi>Plato</hi> ſo much commendeth, in which the Nobles together with the mutuall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Common People, had the Soveraignty: Yet this muſt be added hereunto, That in one matter the <hi>Battavers</hi> doe ſeeme to differ from other <hi>Germans;</hi> as namely, That the <hi>Germans</hi> dwelt all in open Villages, and had no fenced Cities nor walled Towns: On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114771:29"/>
part, it is apparent, that the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> (as ſoon as they had Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Iland) made fenced Cities, to the end, that they (not like as other People) might ſettle their aboad for a ſhort time, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and that in one place: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, becauſe of the convenient and eaſie acceſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for all commodities, which abundantly might be brought in thither.</p>
            <p>For firſt of all, the great Sea opened a free paſſage for their trafficque into <hi>Great Brittain,</hi> and to the Seacoaſts of <hi>Germany.</hi> And ſecondly, the <hi>Ryne,</hi> the <hi>Maes,</hi> and <hi>Scheld</hi> opened them paſſages for trafficque into the heart of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and to a great part of the <hi>Walloones</hi> Countrey. Adding here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that in the time of <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> there were very many walled Townes in the <hi>Walloones</hi> Country,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114771:29"/>
which was a neere neighbouring example for the <hi>Battavers.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the nethermoſt part of the Iland giveth ſufficient teſtimony thereof, which was called <hi>Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Battavorum,</hi> which now is called <hi>Leyden,</hi> and the higher quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called <hi>Battavodurum,</hi> which is now called <hi>Wyckterduerſtede,</hi> being both the old names of famous fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Cities, beſides ſome other leſſer Cities, as <hi>Grinnes, Vada, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranacum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and other, whereof <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> and <hi>Pentingerus</hi> in their Maps do make mention.</p>
            <p>All which if it be ſo, it is manifeſtly apparent, that like as theſe fenced Cities could not conſiſt without Magiſtrates, that thoſe Magiſtrates next unto the Princes had very great Authority in their publike Aſſemblies: And that the ſimple common people buſied themſelves, ſome with til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114771:30"/>
of the Land, others with feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cattle, and others with fiſhing, and with Merchandize, and other occupations belonging thereunto, that they very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed the charge of the Government unto the Magiſtrates, whereof we now have ſpoken.</p>

            <head>The third Chapter. In what eſtate the Common-wealth of the <hi>Battavers</hi> was in the flouriſhing time of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Monarchy.</head>
            <p>WE have already heard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> was at the very Originall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of that people: But in regard that the Magnificence of the <hi>Romanes</hi> did oppreſſe ſo many other Nations, that they made free Commonwealths to be their Tributary; Provinces. And that they uſed the very Kings themſelvs as inſtruments of ſlavery, as ſome Writers affirm: So peradventure may ſome think that theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lords the <hi>Battavers</hi> were uſed
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114771:31"/>
after the ſame manner alſo; and that the rather, becauſe we read in <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> That the <hi>Battavers</hi> leaving the land of <hi>Heſſen</hi> to dwell in a place where they ſhould be a part of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy. But after what manner that is to be underſtood, the Authors owne words preſently following doe declare, where hee ſaith, that the <hi>Mattiacks</hi> being neer neighbors unto the <hi>Battavers</hi> were in the very ſame cuſtome with the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that is, to pleaſure them; which word doth not apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine unto a ſubject, but unto a friend: Adding yet further there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, That it ſo farre extended it ſelfe, not unto the Monarchy, but to the homage of the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt that there are two ſorts of tolerations; one ſort that is equall, and another ſort that is unequall: The unequall is, when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114771:31"/>
one Nation is ſubject under the authority of another; The equall is when as each of theſe Nations doe continue in their owne privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, notwithſtanding though one Nation oftentimes be more mightie then the other, although their priviledges bee both alike. Yet oftentimes it commeth ſo to paſſe, that thoſe that have the leaſt might, although the toleration be equall, yet nevertheleſſe very willingly doe certain homage unto thoſe that are the more mightie, and doe endeavour to pleaſe them: And in this caſe it is credible, that the <hi>Battavers</hi> have done homage unto the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and yet have not beene ſubject under their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</p>
            <p>The word Society ſheweth the very ſame, the which <hi>Tacitus</hi> uſeth in the ſame place, which Society was alſo honourable; for ſaith he,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114771:32"/>
they held their reputation, and the tokens of the old Society; for the Society betokeneth an equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of each others priviledges; and ſo much the more, when as the word of Reputation is added ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in a Nation which ſubmit themſelves unto another, either by yielding, or by an unequall tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet in another place <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> ſpeaketh more clearly of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> where hee ſaith, That they being in the Society of ſuch as were more mightie then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were nowhit diſmayed at the Magnificence of the <hi>Romanes;</hi> for as commonly amongſt thoſe that are ſo unequall, there conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth no Society, but rather ſuch a one as the Lion made, whereof the Fables make report, who urged all to that point, that the ſtrongeſt ſhould have all; wherein he clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114771:32"/>
proveth, that the <hi>Battavers</hi> had obtained this by their undaunted courage and fidelity, that they maintained the Society, that is an equality of priviledge, not onely in words, but in very deeds alſo.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this point yet after this manner, The Nations that were under the <hi>Romanes,</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they were ſubject under them by theſe three tokens; Firſt, that they were under the command of the <hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrates; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they were Tributa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and thirdly, that they payed Toll.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the <hi>Romane</hi> Magiſtrates, they were never in the Iland of the <hi>Battavers;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Civilis</hi> in his Oration unto his Countrey men, ſaith, That there never came ſo much as a Legate of the <hi>Romans</hi> unto the <hi>Battavers,</hi> but they governed their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114771:33"/>
wealth by their owne Lawes, and their owne Magiſtrates; and in this reſpect they were never reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among the number of the conquered Provinces: For often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Tacitus</hi> maketh mention of the Nation of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> of the Convocations of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> of the Citizens of the <hi>Battavers;</hi> by which words he meaneth no other thing, then that which we now a dayes call a Free Government; like as <hi>Caeſar</hi> called the Citizens of of the <hi>Swiſers</hi> that is, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of the <hi>Swiſers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now concerning the Tributes and Tolls, from which almoſt no Nation is free, although it had bin for no other end and purpoſe in them, but for this reſpect, That they enjoyed yet ſtill their owne Lawes as a benefit from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> yet for all this the <hi>Battavers</hi> payed nothing at all, neither the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114771:33"/>
one, nor the other. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, they were not upbraided with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, nor oppreſt with the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Toll. And preſently thereafter he ſaith that they were free and exempt from all Charges and Contributions. <hi>Civilis</hi> in his Oration unto the <hi>Walloons,</hi> ſaith of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> That they were free from Tributes. And the <hi>Battavers</hi> themſelves ſpeaking of themſelvs doe ſay, that they were not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with any Tributes. What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Articles there were concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the tolleration, it were folly to make further enquiry then of thoſe that are manifeſt, and which the <hi>Romanes</hi> and the <hi>Battavers</hi> agreed upon, as, That they ſhould mutually aſſiſt each other with men; and for this cauſe the <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> which were continually jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with their Neighbours about their limits, had the leſſe need to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114771:34"/>
fear them, becauſe they learned of the Magnificence of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> And againe, the <hi>Romanes</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the <hi>Battavers</hi> would be a great aſſiſtance unto them againſt the <hi>Belgians,</hi> the <hi>Germans, Brittains,</hi> yea even againſt the whole world, as being ſuch who were the moſt excellently valo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of all other Nations round about them: and no leſſe famous for their Horſmen, Footmen, and Mariners, and aptneſſe for all ſorts of warre; therefore like as at this inſtant the <hi>Swiſers</hi> are ſerviceable to many Kings; even ſo did the <hi>Battavers</hi> unto the <hi>Romans</hi> in thoſe daies, furniſhing them with Troops and Companies, the which as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> ſaith, were governed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their old Cuſtomes by the nobleſt of their owne Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: This was a great token of their equality, which ſeldome
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114771:34"/>
hapned in the Monarchy of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that the <hi>Battavers</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves appointed thoſe that ſhould be the Generall, and the Officers of thoſe that were ſent to aſſiſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and received none from the <hi>Romanes:</hi> This is that which <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, That the <hi>Battavers</hi> brought onely Men and Armes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Monarchy. And in another place he ſaith, That they were of purpoſe kept and preſerved as a refuge to be chiefly uſed in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes, and were preſerved for the warre as Armes and Ammunition. Beſides the aſſiſtance of men, the <hi>Romanes</hi> had another as great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> as namely, the uſe of the Iland, wherein they had not onely certain Garriſons, but alſo a Fleet upon their Sea oaſts, and all other things that were neceſſary for the proviſion of their Warre againſt the <hi>Germanes,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:114771:35"/>
or the <hi>Brittaines.</hi> It is without all doubt, but that <hi>Caius Iulius Caeſar,</hi> was the firſt of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> that invaded theſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, by whom they were firſt brought unto this Societie and Alliance with the <hi>Battavers;</hi> for he maketh mention himſelfe of the Iland of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> and how that he was come ſo farre where the <hi>Ryne</hi> and the <hi>Maes</hi> ranne into one ſtreame, and that he in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition had the <hi>Battavers</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him; the which <hi>Lucanus</hi> plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſeth unto us. Hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alſo writeth, that hee had with him <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſemen, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards alſo certaine light armed Footmen, which whether they were <hi>Battavers</hi> themſelves, or were among them; and that the rather becauſe that all the reſt of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> had a deteſtable hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romanes:</hi> And <hi>Caeſar</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:114771:35"/>
writeth, that thoſe ſame Horſe and Footmen, were levied out of the Common-Wealths, the which hee himſelf had pacified.</p>
            <p>Theſe were they by whoſe valour principally <hi>Caeſar</hi> conquered the <hi>Walloons,</hi> as <hi>Oroſius</hi> writeth.</p>
            <p>Theſe were they whoſe ſhock the <hi>Walloons</hi> by <hi>Noyon</hi> could not reſiſt: for this occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is that <hi>Civilis</hi> boaſteth himſelfe that the <hi>Burgondians</hi> and the <hi>Averginans</hi> were daunted by the Horſemen of the <hi>Battavers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were they that beat back the <hi>Walloons,</hi> when they Charged <hi>Caeſar</hi> at the Borders of <hi>Langres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe were they that in two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Battels conquered the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by <hi>Auſſeis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the valour of theſe were they of <hi>Beauvois</hi> put to flight: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards concerning the Victory of the <hi>Pharſalians, Caeſar</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

before, that no other ſhould have the firſt onſet thereof, and the event and ſucceſſe ſheweth the ſame, as <hi>Florus</hi> and <hi>Dion</hi> doe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the very ſame <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> whoſe Horſemen had that Quality of ſwimming over Rivers on Horſe-back, which no other could doe, and put to flight <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and the <hi>Alexandrians,</hi> when they charged <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for which great examples of Courage and fidelity, <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> took the <hi>Battavers</hi> to bee his perſonall Guard, as now many Kings doe the <hi>Swiſers,</hi> which alſo the ſucceeding Emperours have Imitated: Of this mentioneth <hi>Dion, Suetonius, Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and others.</p>

the valour of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> like as it is clearly proved by the example of the Generall <hi>Cariovalda,</hi> in the Raigne of the Emperour <hi>Claudius,</hi> when <hi>Plautius</hi> was ſent into Great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> That then a great part of that Iland was Conquered by the wonderfull and admirable Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems of the <hi>Battavers</hi> as <hi>Dion</hi> teſtifieth.</p>
            <p>Againe, under the Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> when <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Great <hi>Brittaine</hi> by many ſtrategems, was the reputation of the <hi>Battavers</hi> exceedingly augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Shortly thereafter, followed the Civill Warres of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> whoſe good or bad ſucceſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended moſt of all upon the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114771:37"/>
member of their Army, the ableſt men, old Souldiers, Conquerors in many Battels: <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, That the Regiments of the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> were a great motive unto what ſide ſoever they inclined, whether they were with them or againſt them: And for this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the <hi>Vitellians</hi> durſt not put to death <hi>Civilis;</hi> leaſt that for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of one man, who was ſo mighty amonſt the <hi>Battavers,</hi> they might loſe the hearts of ſo valiant a Nation. And <hi>Martial</hi> ſpeaking of a <hi>Battaver,</hi> uſeth the words:
<q>
                  <l>This face which I doe ſhew thee here,</l>
                  <l>Did make your Fathers moſt to feare.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now ſith that the benefits were ſo many and ſo great, which the <hi>Battavers</hi> had ſhewed unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114771:37"/>
and unto the Monarchy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> as that they had ſuch profit by that Iland: That they were ſo exceeding valorous, and that the fame was ſo ſpread abroad of the great ayd that they had received from them, ſo that it was no marvell that for the ſpace of a hundred and twenty years (for ſo many years is the reckoning from <hi>Caius Iulius Caeſar,</hi> unto the raign of the Emperour <hi>Veſpaſian)</hi> the <hi>Battavers</hi> ſtill kept their repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and their abſolute perfect Priviledges of the Society. But when the time came, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the <hi>Romans</hi> turned into an inforcing Taxation, and they not only proſecuted the ſame with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greedineſſe, but alſo ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the ſame with moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable and reproachfull Raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; the which was in no wiſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for a free people to endure:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114771:38"/>
Then did the <hi>Battavers</hi> that which was lawfull for ſuch worthy men to doe, in taking of Armes, whereby they might defend their Liberty and unſpotted Chaſtity: The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion whereof, <hi>Civilis</hi> reporteth, ſaying, That they were not Eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed now as Companions, like as in former time they had been, but as Slaves; That they for theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, had juſtly taken Armes againſt the publick Lords: That Liberty naturally was given, even to the very brute beaſts: From the Hiſtory of which Warre doth appear what love the <hi>Battavers</hi> had to keep their Liberty; for the which, they feared not to challenge the <hi>Romans</hi> power, and the fifteen Legions that were quartered round about them: Therefore like as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, the very name of the <hi>Romans</hi> was expelled out of the Iland of the <hi>Battavers;</hi> and they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114771:38"/>
were exceedingly had in great eſtimation throughout all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and the <hi>Walloons</hi> Countrey, as being the Authors of Liberty. This is alſo to be conſidered in the time of that War, that when as the <hi>Walloons</hi> had generally taken Armes, and were alſo bound by Oath unto the Legions of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi> That neither <hi>Civilis</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor yet any of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> were bound with Oath as the <hi>Walloons</hi> were: That is, becauſe it was not convenient that ſuch a free Nation, and ſuch as fought for their Liberty, ſhould give their Oath unto any other.</p>
            <p>What ſucceſſe and event that Warre had, which the <hi>Battavers</hi> undertook by the Reſolution of both the States, under the conduct of <hi>Civilis,</hi> againſt the Tyrannicall domineering of the <hi>Romans,</hi> is not very manifeſt, becauſe that <hi>Tacitus</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:114771:39"/>
in his Hiſtory maketh no mention thereof. But in regard that <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Cerialis</hi> did offer pardon unto <hi>Civilis,</hi> and peace unto the <hi>Battavers;</hi> And that <hi>Ioſephus</hi> the Jewiſh Writer ſaith, This Warre ended by concluding of a peace; ſo that I make no queſtion, but that the <hi>Battavers</hi> were re-eſtabliſhed in the former ſtate of the Society: And ſo much the rather, becauſe that <hi>Tacitus</hi> writing of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the <hi>Germans</hi> in the time of <hi>Trajanus</hi> who was twice Conſul, ſaith, That the <hi>Battavers</hi> kept their old reputation, and their tokens of the old Society: And in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quell thereof, ſheweth manifeſtly enough, that after that Warre they were neither oppreſt with Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, nor yet with Toll; but that they kept their Priviledge, only with this Condition, that they ſhould ſend ayd unto the <hi>Romans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:114771:39"/>
And for a certainty, before that time, in the Reign of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Domitian, Agricola</hi> being aſſiſted by the <hi>Battavers,</hi> effected ſtrange buſineſſes in <hi>Brittaine:</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when as <hi>Adrianus</hi> was with his Army by the <hi>Danow,</hi> that alſo then was there great Service performed by the <hi>Battaviſh</hi> Souldiers.</p>
            <p>After thoſe times, the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the <hi>Battavers</hi> were ſo farre from being diminiſhed, that their Reputation was the rather augmented, the which, certain old Titles and Inſcriptions, which are yet extant and found amongſt us, doe ſufficiently teſtifie; whereof ſome produce the time of <hi>Severus;</hi> and others, of <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Geta;</hi> for they doe not name the Nation of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> and the Citizens of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> not Companions, like as formerly they were called: but call them Brethren and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114771:40"/>
Friends, as well of the people, as of the Monarchy of the <hi>Romans;</hi> from which name, a certaine <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyrick</hi> Writer, ſaith, appeareth as well the fellowſhip as the equality of their worthineſſe.</p>
            <p>After theſe times, the <hi>Francks</hi> began to be known about the <hi>Ryne,</hi> againſt whom the <hi>Battavers</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> had continuall Warres: Oftentimes the <hi>Francks</hi> invaded the Iland of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were repulſed. And laſtly, in the Raign of <hi>Conſtantius</hi> the Emperour, the <hi>Francks</hi> trailing the <hi>Almans</hi> along with them, and the <hi>Saxons</hi> who were in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with them, ſwarming up and down farre and neare, that then <hi>Iulianus</hi> did ſo pepper them in a great Battell by <hi>Straesburch;</hi> for the Victory of which Battell, as <hi>Ammianus</hi> ſaith, they may princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally thank the valour of the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers;</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:114771:40"/>
for the Horſemen of the <hi>Romans</hi> being all fled, and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my beginning with their ſwords to fall to the Execution of their confuſed Battell; the <hi>Battavers</hi> came to ſecond and to relieve them in their greateſt neceſſity, they being as <hi>Ammianus</hi> ſaith, a terrible multitude of people, they came with their Kings with them: from whence is concluded, that at that very time remained yet the ſame manner of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Battavers,</hi> which they had had of old, excepting that they by reaſon of the continuing Wars, did more uſe the perpetuall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Kings, then the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Command of the Generals. Moreover, that for the time that the Monarchy of the <hi>Romans</hi> was ambitiouſly climbing or had any trouble, they never diminiſhed nor detained any Priviledges from
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114771:41"/>
thoſe that were their ableſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, not in the leaſt degree, as mear reaſon can ſufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame.</p>
            <p>And undoubtedly, the cruell Wars with the <hi>Francks,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually endured from the Raign of <hi>Valerian,</hi> even unto the Monarchy of <hi>Iulianus,</hi> being a hundred years, gave ſuch a ſhrowd pul-down unto the People of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> that by reaſon thereof, it hapned that the <hi>Salians</hi> who were one of the principall Nations of the <hi>Francks,</hi> firſt invaded a part of the Iland of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> as I think, that part which is neareſt unto <hi>Over-Iſell,</hi> and with the conſent of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> and of the <hi>Battavers</hi> kept the ſame: But when the <hi>Quades</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Nation of the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſtrove to drive them out of their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Then did the Emperour <hi>Iulia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> firſt by Arms defend his new
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114771:41"/>
friends the <hi>Salians,</hi> and afterwards made Peace in ſuch a manner, that he united the <hi>Quades</hi> and the <hi>Sali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> being the valianteſt, the one Nation of the <hi>Francks,</hi> and the other of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> into one Corporation and name of <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi> And hereupon, were certain Legions levied out of theſe people of the <hi>Quades, Salians,</hi> and <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> to ayd the <hi>Romans,</hi> who (as we may underſtand by <hi>Zoſimus)</hi> were all called by the name of <hi>Battavers:</hi> whence appeareth, That the <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> being augmented by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of other Nations, did main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the Priviledges of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty undiminiſhed. But eſpecially about this time, the State of the <hi>Romans</hi> in great <hi>Brittain</hi> being very weak and in great danger, they were held up and ſupported by the <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers,</hi> by whoſe aſſiſtance recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>London, Civilis</hi> who was a <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taver</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:114771:42"/>
and of Royall blood, was then made Governour of great <hi>Brittain,</hi> as in my opinion, the very name imports ſo much, being deſcended from that famous Generall which was in the Raigne of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi>

            <p>FRom theſe times untill the firſt inſtalling of the Earls, which was about five hundred years after, the Hiſtories are very defective: And in the meane time, as on the one ſide, The <hi>Saxons,</hi> the the <hi>Wiltons,</hi> the <hi>Slavens,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after they of <hi>Norway</hi> and the <hi>Danes,</hi> by Invaſions and Robberies had done them very much harm; ſo on the other part it is probable, that while they defended their lives and goods, and amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny loſſes, the valour of the <hi>Battavers</hi> increaſed; but all the reſt is very
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114771:43"/>
obſcure. Alſo at this time they did begin to change their names, and the name of <hi>Battavia</hi> or <hi>Betow,</hi> being ſhut up in the higheſt part of the Iland, kept ſtill that name: And the <hi>Battavers</hi> whoſe dwellings were lower in the Iland, began to be called <hi>Freiſes;</hi> the which is not to be marvelled at, in regard that in <hi>Pliny</hi> his time, one part of the <hi>Battavers</hi> were called little <hi>Freiſes</hi> or <hi>Friſiabons;</hi> and the very ſame may appeare in the old Superſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, That amongſt theſe <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> which were the Guards of the Emperours, were certaine <hi>Friſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it appeared well, that the name of <hi>Freiſes</hi> pleaſed them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe that ſame word in that Language is very neare unto Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or Liberty; or elſe, becauſe that the <hi>Freiſes</hi> being invironed about with great Lakes and Pooles
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114771:43"/>
were not very acceſſible the reunto, and being the more invincible, were a Refuge unto all other <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> which lay more open to the Invaſions of the barbarous Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And you ſhall ever finde, that the firſt Earls were called by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Title, but of the <hi>Freiſes,</hi> before that ever the name of the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> was known: Like as <hi>Tacitus</hi> at this time, and in former times, makes mention of the Kings and Generals. And <hi>Ammianus</hi> a little before theſe times, makes mention of the <hi>Battavian</hi> Kings; in like manner alſo it is that the Antient Writers of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Hiſtories, about this time do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate certain Kings of the <hi>Freiſes,</hi> which have held hard War againſt the <hi>Francks;</hi> and amongſt others, the name of <hi>Radbond</hi> is very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, whoſe head is to be ſeen in the Caſtle at <hi>Medenblick;</hi> after the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:114771:44"/>
Kings, you ſhall finde certain Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals expreſſed by their names; theſe were they which were called Potentates.</p>
            <p>It is ſomewhat ſtrange, that which wee read in <hi>Procopius,</hi> That in the great Sea, about the mouths of the <hi>Ryne,</hi> that there ſhould be an Iland called <hi>Britton,</hi> lying oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite againſt Great <hi>Brittain:</hi> That the ſame Iland was inhabited by three Nations, whoſe names were the <hi>Britons, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Frieſes;</hi> from whence yearly, many people went to inhabite the unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Countreys of the <hi>Francks:</hi> And that for this occaſion, the <hi>Francks,</hi> although they had no other Intereſt in that Iland, the which alſo was governed by their own Kings, yet nevertheleſſe they endeavoured that it ſhould be ſaid and be believed, that it was ſubject under them: And hereupon, the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114771:44"/>
King of the <hi>Francks</hi> ſending an Embaſſador unto <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Emperour <hi>Iuſtinianus,</hi> did therewithall ſend ſome of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the fore-ſaid Iland, that by that meanes he might have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Authority over that Iland.</p>
            <p>That this <hi>Britton</hi> was <hi>Battavia,</hi> or elſe a part of <hi>Battavia,</hi> bordering upon the Sea, may with ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the truth be ſpoken, becauſe there is no other Iland in the Sea, that hath the mouthes of the <hi>Ryne</hi> in it. And moreover and above, it appeareth that upon the Sea ſhore of <hi>Battavia</hi> upon the middle mouth of the <hi>Ryne,</hi> there ſtood a Houſe called <hi>Britton,</hi> whereof yet even in theſe dayes the remaining Foundations are yet ſeen; and it is no marvell then that either the Houſe took this name from the Iland, or elſe the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114771:45"/>
Iland took its name from the houſe. In the like manner, as with us here in <hi>Holland</hi> the name of the River hath of old been called the <hi>Flie;</hi> then after, the Houſe ſtanding ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon got the ſame name, ſo that even now the whole Iland is called <hi>Flieland;</hi> which if this bee true, then was there yet two other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which inhabited that Iland, beſides thoſe that were born in the Iland, which we have ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were called <hi>Frieſes, viz.</hi> the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which were an old <hi>Germane</hi> people, and the <hi>Britons</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure were inforced by the violence of the <hi>Picks</hi> and men of <hi>Norway</hi> to leave their native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to ſeek them a place of a more ſtrong refuge and retreat. It is therefore without all doubt, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the Sea Coaſts which were the neareſt unto the <hi>Battavers,</hi> and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114771:45"/>
that they divers times ſayled from thence into <hi>Brittaine</hi> which is now called <hi>England.</hi> It is alſo manifeſt that <hi>Willebord</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man came hither out of <hi>England</hi> and preached the truth of the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto our fore-fathers in the ſame language that was then ſpoken in <hi>England.</hi> It is alſo credible, that the <hi>Britons</hi> betook themſelves for their refuge, as well unto the mooriſh parts of our Countrey as unto the Sea Coaſt of <hi>France,</hi> which is now called little <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</hi> But that the <hi>Francks</hi> ſtriving for the Reputation of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, doe affirme that it ſhould have extended ſo farre, who indeed had no Command over this Iland, or at leaſt, not below <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the which ſome doe affirm to be the period of the Kingdome of the <hi>Francks,</hi> then called <hi>Austraſians,</hi> which doe very well approve the

Liberty of the Sea-bordering <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavers;</hi> from whence it is credible, that they were multiplyed from time to time, by the encreaſe of new Nations.

            <p>I Will paſſe by what others have reported of the inſtitution of this Earldome, who therein have followed the Authority of a certaine report but lately riſen up, the ſame being founded upon cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain writings, which doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confute it ſelfe: And will only ſpeak of that which concerns my purpoſe, and as I think is the truth, &amp; that with no ſmall reaſons: It is thus then, That before the time of <hi>Dederick,</hi> who was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the firſt of the Earls of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> there were in <hi>Holland</hi> many Princes that had their Authority
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114771:47"/>
not over the whole Nation, but each of them over ſome one part thereof: As thoſe had whereof <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> doe make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of: Theſe Princes were called by the names of <hi>Graven</hi> or <hi>Grafio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> which we in <hi>Engliſh</hi> call <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and now the Dutch <hi>Graven,</hi> that is Earls, which is often found in the <hi>Germane</hi> Lawes: which to ſpeak properly, is nothing elſe but Judges, from whence we call thoſe that are the Officers and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the Cauſies and of thoſe Bancks that doe check the Rivers and the Sea, we call them <hi>Dyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,</hi> that is Cauſie-Judges or Cauſie Earls. And with good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were thoſe Princes ſo called, becauſe that their Principall Office was as is aforeſaid to adminiſter the Law: Now wherefore that theſe Earles or Judges in former igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant times, by thoſe that ſpoke
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114771:47"/>
Latine, were called <hi>Comites,</hi> or Companions, I can finde no great reaſon for it, unleſſe peradventure, becauſe that they together among themſelves were all alike of one eſtimation, reſpect, and worthineſs. And from hence it is, that thoſe Regions, which in old time were called <hi>Pagi,</hi> that is, great Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughes or Villages, got the name of Counties or Earldomes. And ſuch an Earldome <hi>Walcheren</hi> which is an Iland in <hi>Zealand</hi> hath bin: And likewiſe, ſuch have been <hi>Maeſland, Kennemerland,</hi> and <hi>Texell,</hi> being all Regions in <hi>Holland,</hi> each of them hath been Earldoms of themſelves, the which both Hiſtory and antient Writings teſtifie. Such alſo were the fore-fathers of the Seigneors of <hi>Waſſenar,</hi> who were called <hi>Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven,</hi> that is Caſtle or Burrough-Earls, who were the Judges of that Caſtle or Burrough (as it is very

credible) in which place is now the old City then called <hi>Lugdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Battavorum,</hi> now called <hi>Leyden</hi> (which was then deſtroyed by the People of <hi>Norway)</hi> and alſo of ſome part of the Countrey there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, which <hi>Seigneors</hi> being the Survayers of the Dams &amp; Sluces of the River <hi>Ryne,</hi> there hath anciently been paid unto them certain Tolls; the which is continued yet to their poſterity. At the ſame time were there certain Cities or Townes in this Land, as <hi>Schaffnaburgenſis</hi> an old Writer nameth <hi>Flaording</hi> and <hi>Rynsburch</hi> to be very ſtrong Towns in <hi>Freiſland;</hi> whereunto may bee added <hi>Froonley</hi> in former times the chiefe City of the Northren Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>Dordrecht</hi> and <hi>Haerlem</hi> are of no little Antiquity.

as was not employed any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes then in the chiefeſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Authority, but entituled him by that accuſtomed and uſuall name or Title of <hi>Gravii,</hi> that is Judge or Earl, yet with this difference, that he was not called Earl with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any Quarter thereunto, but ſimply, as being Judge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe over the other Judges. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this command (out of all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion) he was choſen that was the very principall, both for Nobility and power amongſt all other Princes: This was <hi>Dederick</hi> who in the old Records was called the <hi>Freiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that theſe <hi>Battavers</hi> which dwelt upon the Sea-ſide were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Freiſes,</hi> we have ſhewed already, and the ſame is manifeſtly proved with the afore-ſaid place of <hi>Schaff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naburgenſis.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Iohn Vander Does</hi> the Father,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114771:49"/>
Seigneor of <hi>Noortwick,</hi> a man as exceedingly well known amongſt his own people by reaſon of his Nobility, as alſo to all others by reaſon of his Learning, manifeſtly ſheweth (in his books, wherewith hee hath perpetually obliged his Native Countrey by an everlaſting benefit unto him) out of <hi>Regino</hi> an old Writer, that this <hi>Dederick</hi> had a Brother whoſe name was <hi>Walgar,</hi> and that this <hi>Walgars</hi> and <hi>Dedericks</hi> Father was one <hi>Gerloffe,</hi> whom <hi>Regino</hi> a very faithful <hi>French</hi> Hiſtoriographer affirmeth to have been an Earl of the <hi>Frieſes. Dederick</hi> was then before an Earl, and an Earls ſonne, but Earl of ſome one certain Quarter, and not of the whole Nation, which honour is beſtowed upon him principally through the favour and good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection (as may bee well ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) of the Lords and the People
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114771:50"/>
of the Towns. And alſo becauſe that in the Maps of <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> there is mention of a Region or Quarter called <hi>Holland;</hi> ſo peradventure it is likely to be true, that this ſame Region was the Earldom of <hi>Dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> and his Predeceſſors: And that thereafter, the whole body of the Common-wealth being concredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto him, grew into a Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the ſame name, to this end, that thoſe <hi>Freiſes</hi> which dwelt upon this ſide of the River <hi>Flie,</hi> ſhould properly be called the great <hi>Freiſes,</hi> only to make a difference between thoſe <hi>Freiſes</hi> which dwelt on the other ſide of the <hi>Flie;</hi> yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that part which is next unto the <hi>Flie,</hi> even to this preſent day is called Weſt <hi>Freiſland,</hi> the which with <hi>Holland</hi> maketh a Common-wealth. Vnto this is very conform that which the States of <hi>Holland</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in that famous Controverſie
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114771:50"/>
which was diſputed upon by them and the <hi>Brabanders</hi> before the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, Prince of the Netherlands, where the <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banders</hi> affirmed, that the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the Fourth had granted them a certain Priviledge, that they out of their own Countrey might not be ſued at the Law, maintaining therewithall, that it was not lawfull for the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Brabanders</hi> by manner of Arreſt after the <hi>Hollanders</hi> manner. Whereupon the States of <hi>Holland</hi> ſhewed to the contrary, That that Priviledge did not concern them, in regard that they and their Earles from all Antiquity had the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty &amp; all manner of Juridiſcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without giving any manner of acknowledgement unto any other; And that ſince the time that <hi>Dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> the Firſt, recovered the Land of <hi>Holland</hi> from the Barbarous
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114771:51"/>
Nations, the which was then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject under the power of no King, that the ſame Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> at all times ever had the like Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their own Earldoms, as the Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> or of <hi>Italy</hi> had in their Empire, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound or beholden to any by manner (of <hi>Leen,)</hi> that is either Free forme or Coppy-hold.</p>
            <p>The which may be gathered even from that ſucceſſion, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had in the Earldom; And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from hence, That the Earls have ſet out great parts of the Earldom, as the Lordſhips of <hi>Foirne, Arckel,</hi> and <hi>Putten</hi> and others, and that even to hereditary Free-farme, or Coppy-hold, without the Conſent of any other Forraign Power: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the Ordinances of the <hi>Germane</hi> Empire, with what generall Title ſoever they might be written or Regiſtred, were never
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114771:51"/>
ſo much as once publiſhed in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> neither were they in any one point obedient thereunto, the which they alſo proved with a very memorable late Example; for whereas the <hi>Germanes</hi> had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very many Lawes for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſucceſſion without teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even to the derogation of all cuſtomes to the contrary; yet nevertheleſſe the Heritages in <hi>Holland</hi> were never aſſigned by no other Law then by their owne cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes to that very day; that alſo the affaires neither of the Earles nor of the States were never ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced by the <hi>Germaine</hi> Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</p>
            <p>The which being thus alledged and proved by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the Declaration followed, that that priviledge which was given unto the <hi>Brabanders,</hi> was of no force in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:114771:52"/>
Beſides this, <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> writing a Book of the Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at what time as the firſt <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> of <hi>Byeren</hi> governed <hi>Holland,</hi> and dedicated the ſame Book unto his Prince, he then profeſſing the Law in <hi>France,</hi> ſaith often in the ſame Book, That the Earle of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is Emperour in his Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>Wee know that the <hi>Germane</hi> Emperours, and alſo the <hi>Francks,</hi> as it is before reported out of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius,</hi> uſually pretended that not onely the Earles of <hi>Holland,</hi> and other Princes, but even the Kings themſelves were their Vaſſals; the which although it were granted unto them, yet in that reſpect the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were nevertheleſſe free. In ſuch like manner, as <hi>Proculus</hi> an ancient Lawyer proveth very well; The particulars which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by others, doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114771:52"/>
loſe their freedome, becauſe they are not of equall worth with their protectors: And in like manner, the freedome of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not diminiſhed, becauſe in their Covenant there is contained that they with all courtefie ſhould reſpect the Soveraignty of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whence alſo the name of free Leenen (that is, as Free Copy-holders) hath its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall. But nevertheleſſe this ſame Covenant of free Leen, or after what ſort or manner the ſame might or could be termed, the Earles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver conſented unto, as eaſily may be underſtood by that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been ſaid, as alſo out of the Hiſtory of the Warres with the firſt Earles; and namely, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> the fourth, (for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of their reputation and worthineſſe) undertook with good ſucceſſe againſt the Emperours.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:114771:53"/>
And put the caſe that any of thoſe Earles, either in time of neceſſity, or for ſome certaine conſideration, were brought thereunto, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the Emperours have deſired their protection, which ſo happening without the conſent of the States, the ſame could neither prejudice the priviledge of the Common-wealth, nor yet of the ſucceeding Princes. In every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect we are certainly aſſured that neither thoſe Earles of the houſe of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> nor yet thoſe Earles of the houſe of <hi>Austria,</hi> the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory whereof is yet unfallible, that they never in reſpect of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have done any homage unto the Emperours: And that <hi>Holland</hi> never was ſubject neither to the Lawes nor Cuſtomes of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, nor of the Empire, which is the very principall point of all; and that the <hi>Germanes</hi> themſelves
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114771:53"/>
doe confeſſe; from whence it is manifeſt, that the principall Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty over the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hath been among themſelves, and never depended upon any forraigne Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>It remaineth now that we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the other, that is, what privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and authority the Princes had in the Common-wealth, and what was the Authority of the States; the which we ſhould very particularly know, if in caſe thoſe Lawes were to bee found, which concerning the Authority were given unto <hi>Dederick.</hi> But beſides that which formerly hath beene ſpoken, that by the <hi>Germans</hi> books aſwell of publike as of particular matters but very lately began to be regiſtred, ſo is alſo the memory of all thoſe times, (excepting only of ſome certaine Warres, and of ſome other matters which do not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:114771:54"/>
concerne this purpoſe,) utterly loſt: Yet even before theſe times there was not given ſo great a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as there was authority unto the Kings of the <hi>Battavers,</hi> the which even in our fathers dayes hath been regiſtred up by forraigne Writers, That the command of the Princes of theſe Lands was as well limited with Lawes, as it was moderated by the reſolution of the States; from whence we may aſſuredly col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that the Government of the time, which was betwixt them both, hath been the very ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as was received from our Anceſtors, and left againe unto poſterity: Neither is it lightly to be credited, that thoſe worthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the Inhabitants that were ſo noble and ſo mighty as we have ſhewn to have been in thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, did fall from that equality of power whereunto they
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114771:54"/>
were accuſtomed, unto ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine unequality: And on the contrary part, it is manifeſt, that afterwards when as the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Earles by the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of other Principalities there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto greatly increaſed, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Houſe of <hi>Bourgondy</hi> and of <hi>Austria,</hi> that then the freedom or liberty rather decreaſed then increaſed. Theſe were then the principall Lawes of the Governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Counteſſe ſhould marry unto any man, but with the conſent and good liking of the States.</p>
            <p>That none of the Officers, as of the Counſell, and Rent-maſters, and Pretorſhip ſhould be confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other but unto thoſe that were born within the Land.</p>
            <p>That the States ſhall have liberty to aſſemble upon the affaires of the Land and State, and that as often
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114771:55"/>
as it ſhal pleaſe them, without need to have conſent of the Earle for that end.</p>
            <p>That no new Tolls might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, neither any man freed from thoſe that formerly were ordained, but by conſent of the States.</p>
            <p>That the Prince ſhould under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take no warre, neither defenſive, nor offenſive, otherwiſe then by the conſent of the States.</p>
            <p>That the Princes ſhould in all their writings uſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>That the Coine ſhould be alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and appointed by the Prince, according as the States find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</p>
            <p>That the Prince might not make away any part of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality.</p>
            <p>That the States may not bee warned to aſſemble upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation out of the Provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:114771:55"/>
That when as the Prince ſhall have need of any impoſitions or collections, that he himſelfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, and not by the mediation of his Lieutenant, ſhall make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion unto the States, without exacting any thing otherwiſe then by a willing and voluntary free conſent.</p>
            <p>That he exerciſe and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Juſtice and Law by the hands of ordinary Juſtices.</p>
            <p>That the ancient Lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, being holy, ſhould be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olably obſerved; and if the Prince ſhould ordaine any thing contrary the reunto, that no man is bound to obſerve the ſame.</p>
            <p>Theſe Lawes having been long maintained by meer cuſtome, were afterwards regiſtred into Articles, and ſubſigned by the Princes from time to time, to this end that the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114771:56"/>
natures of the ſame Princes might not be infected by the evill incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of flattering Courtiers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hope of an unlawfull domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: And at the laſt, in regard that the States made complaint of their grievances, that moſt of the fundamentall points of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Government were overthrowne by innovations; even then was there a collection made of all theſe aforeſaid Lawes; and ſo by ſome others before, but chiefly by <hi>Mary</hi> Counteſſe of <hi>Bourgondy,</hi> they were ſealed up for an everlaſting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
            <p>And although the <hi>Hollanders</hi> now in the ſucceſſion of the Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome followed the order of lineall diſcent; yet nevertheleſſe, to the end they might ſhew that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and authority did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a fatherly inheritance, but from the conſents of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114771:56"/>
that is, of the States, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they never eſteemed any for their Prince, before that they had bound themſelves by an oath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the States, to maintaine the Lawes and Cuſtomes of the Land; the which being thus performed, they promiſed againe to him fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and obedience in whatſoever the Lawes ſhould command them. Wherefore in regard that thoſe Lawes being conditions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contracts, are connexed unto the Authority, then hereby is manifeſt, that thoſe Princes had no power of themſelves to looſe or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence themſelves from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Lawes, as it hath been very much diſcourſed and concluded upon by thoſe that have written much of Government: From whence it followeth, that ſince the chiefe Power or Soveraignty cannot be in ſuch a one as is bound
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114771:57"/>
unto any Civill Lawes or inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, like as moſt of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Princes be, that even alſo the Earle of <hi>Holland</hi> being bound unto ſo many Lawes, hath not had the right of the Soveraign power onely in himſelfe.</p>
            <p>All that which we now have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared from the words of the Laws or from other Covenants, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, even all them, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points of no leſſe conſequence are all approved by very old ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</p>
            <p>For whereas <hi>Arnoulffe</hi> the third of the Princes had two ſonnes, the eldeſt who was called <hi>Sifrid,</hi> and of ſome <hi>Sicco,</hi> for ſome certaine fault, was denied the command; and the Principality (by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the States) was conferred upon the yonger, whoſe name was <hi>Dederick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dederick</hi> the fourth dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114771:57"/>
iſſue, although there were as yet no example of a brotherly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, the States proclaimed <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> the brother of the deceaſed to be Prince.</p>
            <p>The Wardſhip of <hi>Dederick</hi> the fift of that name (whoſe yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yet unfit for government) the States conferred upon his Mother the Lady <hi>Geertright,</hi> and alſo mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her unto <hi>Robert</hi> the ſonne of an Earle of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who hereby got the ſurname of the <hi>Frieſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he governed the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who at that time were yet called the <hi>Freiſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ada</hi> the daughter of <hi>Dederick</hi> the ſeventh, becauſe that ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Earle of <hi>Loen</hi> againſt the States will, was depoſed from the Principality, and in her place ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>William</hi> the brother of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> the ſixth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Florence</hi> the fourth, being yet
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114771:58"/>
but young, his Unckle <hi>Florence</hi> was ordained Protector, after whoſe death becauſe that <hi>Alidt</hi> his Aunt adminiſtred in the Protectorſhip, not according to the counſell of the States, but after her owne will, the Government was committed unto <hi>Otto</hi> Earle of <hi>Gelder,</hi> who was the neereſt (though very farre) of kindred unto the young Earle.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Principality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing void by the death of <hi>Florence</hi> the fourth, the Common-wealth was governed by the Nobles and the Cities, untill that <hi>Iohn</hi> the ſon of <hi>Florence,</hi> who (travelling abroad) returned out of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Wardſhip was concredited unto <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of <hi>Avennes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards, the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> becauſe it ſeemed that ſhe was not fit for government, was depoſed, and in her place they accepted her ſonne Duke <hi>William</hi> for their Earl,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114771:58"/>
who afterwards being mad, the charge of the Common-wealth was committed unto Duke <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brecht</hi> his Brother, as Steward, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding that he ſhould govern the Common-wealth by the Counſell of the Barons, Lords, Knights and Squires (which are degrees of the Nobility) and of good Townes. This <hi>Albrechts</hi> ſonne, Duke <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> perceiving that he ſhould dye without leaving any Heire-male after him, aſſembled a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Nobles and of the Cities, and there intreated and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the ſucceſſion of the Earledome might be granted unto his Daughter the Lady <hi>Iacobey;</hi> but in regard that this <hi>Iacobey</hi> abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelfe, by marrying without the conſent of the States, ſhe was reputed unworthy of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that in her life time ſhee muſt endure to ſee the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114771:59"/>
of <hi>Holland</hi> tranſported unto Duke <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Bourgondy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Philip</hi> his ſonnes daughter the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> was married unto <hi>Maximilian,</hi> Archduke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria;</hi> which <hi>Maximilian</hi> after his wives death, deſiring to keep the agreement in his hands, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring in the ſame, not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adminiſtrator and Protector of his ſonne <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond of that name, nor yet according to the good liking of the States, but after a kingly manner; then the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and of the adjoyning Provinces valiantly reſiſted the ſame.</p>
            <p>The ſame States of the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh</hi> Provinces appointed the Protectors unto the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth of that name when he was but young, and came firſt to the Principality.</p>
            <p>The ſame <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114771:59"/>
having in an Aſſembly of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall States reſigned his Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, recommended very earneſtly his Son <hi>Philip</hi> unto the fidelity of the ſaid States.</p>
            <p>All theſe are tokens that the Princely Authority, like as it had the originall beginning from the States, that even ſo it returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine unto them, as often as there was no Prince to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we ſhall not finde any Act or Condition of any of the old Earls of any importance, but that it was Authorized and ratified by the conſent of the Barrons and Nobles, who ſealed and gave vertue unto the ſame; for theſe were the Ancienteſt Councell of the Earls, like as it was alſo in former times of the <hi>Germane</hi> Kings.</p>
            <p>Now concerning the Cities, their number, and with the number their worthineſſe is from time to time
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:114771:60"/>
augmented; for even of old time each City had their own Councell of Senators; &amp; one of thoſe Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors dying, the place was ſupplied by another of the ableſt and wealthieſt of the Burgeſſes: And in ſome places, that ſame Councell ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the principall Magiſtrates which are called the Burgh-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: And in ſome other places, they preſent the names of the ſame Burgh-Maſters, and alſo of the Jurats, which ſit to doe Juſtice, unto the Prince for the electing of them, yet in ſuch a manner, that they have the nomination of as many more as are choſen, which the Prince may not exceed, the which is no little aſſurance of their Liberty.</p>
            <p>It appeareth alſo by very many examples, that not only the great Cities, as now in theſe latter times hath happened, but even the little
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114771:60"/>
ones alſo, doe take their turns at the Convocations and Aſſemblies of the States. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Leyden</hi> before named making often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Nobles and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Cities, calleth them the great ones of their native Countrey, ſaying, that their care was (the Prince neglecting the ſame) to ſee that the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſhould ſuffer no wrong. I finde alſo that in the dayes of <hi>William</hi> the Fourth, who was the laſt of the Houſe of <hi>Henault,</hi> about two hundred and thirty years ago, That at <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> there was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great Convocation, of the three Nations of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Henault,</hi> where the Deputies of the Cities, being very many, were Aſſembled about the <hi>Toles:</hi> And this Aſſembly was called the High Councell. Moreover, no Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons nor Contributions were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114771:61"/>
without the conſent of the States, as appeareth by all thoſe reckonings which are found in the Courts, whereof the conſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto of the ſame was alwayes open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly publiſhed.</p>
            <p>And from hence it proceedeth, that even of old and from all times, the afore-ſaid Contributions and Impoſitions, were called nothing elſe but the Intreaties, the which name is often found in <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> in regard that they (as hath been ſhewed already) were granted at the intreaties of the Princes. The ſame being alſo a ſufficient demonſtration how the Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt ſtrike ſaile unto the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the States: Yea, even in <hi>Philip</hi> himſelfe who was the laſt Earle, and maintaining Warres in <hi>France,</hi> thoſe nine years Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not conſented unto by the States no otherwayes, but by the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114771:61"/>
preſcription of certain Laws, and amongſt others this, That the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhould be at the diſpoſition of ſuch perſons that ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed thereunto by the States. Like as it is manifeſt, that the States have held and maintained that Priviledge, that they may aſſemble at their own pleaſures, even in the very lateſt times that were before the Warres.</p>
            <p>From all that which hitherto hath been ſpoken, appeareth, that the Earles of <hi>Holland</hi> have differed almoſt nothing at all from the old Kings, but that they only uſed a name which was not ſo eminent, nor yet ſo ſuſpitious for the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as the Kingly Title was. Moreover, that the ſame Earles were elected according to the ſucceſſion of blood, as the ſame is uſed by many free Nations; but yet nevertheleſſe, the Authority
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114771:62"/>
was not given unto them without exception, in regard that there were Lawes appointed thereunto, and were confirmed by Oath. That herewithall, the Authority of the Earls was not ſo extenuated, but that the power of the States was ſuch, and that in divers matters, and eſpecially concerning the Coyne, which is the ſinnews and ſtrength of a Common-Weath. And that may wee truly ſay of the Earles, which in former times was ſaid of the <hi>Germane</hi> Kings, that they had Authority, but it was by entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or permiſſion. If in caſe I ſhould ſeek for a Forraign example to this purpoſe, I can finde none more like hereunto, then in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth of the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the which by <hi>Plato, Polybius</hi> and very many wiſemen, yea, by <hi>Apollo</hi> himſelfe is affirmed ſo to be, and is by them commended before all
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114771:62"/>
other; for in theſe, the Kings ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded one after another, by the order of their Conſanguinity, in ſo much that in place of the Kings, thoſe that were the Protectors or Dictators, which they called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicos,</hi> had the Authority in their hands: But the Kings were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Authority before they had taken their Oath to uſe their Authority according to the Cuſtome of the Lawes of the Land. Now the Kings had power over each one, but above the Kings were the Survayers or <hi>Ephori,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Councell.</p>
            <p>The Ancient Fathers doe very much commend a notable Speech of <hi>Theopompus</hi> King of the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians,</hi> who being diſdainfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his own wife, becauſe that hee had diminiſhed his own Highneſſe by the Inſtitution of the Office of the Survayers; hee
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114771:63"/>
Anſwered thereunto, <hi>That he ſhould leave unto his Children a leſſer, but yet a more permanent Authority:</hi> For of a truth, it is even ſo as the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers uſed truly to report, That every Common-wealth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in a certain melody or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort, the which being once broken, all cometh to naught: which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody in my opinion conſiſteth not in any ſound or in ſtrings, but in the well tempered unity of the Prince with the People, and of the People with the Prince; or of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall States, the one with the other. In this melody have the Princes, the Nobility, and the Comonalty long time flouriſhed, when as each one reſpected the Prince, and the Prince himſelf reſpected the Laws and the common Aſſemblies; and whilſt the Nobility kept their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and the Comonalty their Liberty: From hence iſſued the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114771:63"/>
good ſucceſſe of Warre; from hence it proceeded that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like as in former times they were Confederates with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> even ſo thereafter, though being little, have ſought unto great Alliances. Hereof the Treatiſes of the Confederacies do plainly ſhew; for preſently at the very birth (as it were) of the Principality there were two <hi>Dedericks,</hi> as it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed, who were Brothers in-law unto the Kings of <hi>France. Arnolffe</hi> the third Earl, had to wife a daughter of the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe ſiſter was marryed unto the Emperour of <hi>Germany.</hi> Divers others that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, were marryed unto the Houſe of <hi>Saxon,</hi> who then poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Empire. <hi>Florence</hi> the third, was marryed unto the Houſe of the King of <hi>Scotland; William</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of that name, Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:114771:64"/>
was elected Emperour of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and as I think, for no other cauſe, but for that he was uſed in his own Countrey unto ſuch a moderate Government. This mans Sonne <hi>Florence</hi> the Fourth, was earneſtly ſolicited unto, on the one ſide, by the King of <hi>England,</hi> and on the other ſide, by the King of <hi>France,</hi> for his Confederacy with the preſentation of each of their Daughters in marriage with great gifts. But <hi>Iohn</hi> his Son with the advice of the chiefeſt Nobles of the Land marryed the daughter of <hi>England:</hi> And preſently after <hi>William</hi> the Sixth, marryed the daughter of the King of <hi>France.</hi> Again, the daughters of the Earls were beſtowed into very great Houſes, as the Lady <hi>Margarite</hi> the daughter of <hi>William</hi> the Fourth, unto an Emperour of the Houſe of <hi>Beyeren: Iacoby</hi> unto a <hi>Dolphin</hi> of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114771:64"/>
               <hi>France:</hi> And all theſe whilſt they were but only Earls of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> and ſome of <hi>Henault:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that by the daughter of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brecht,</hi> who was marryed unto one of the houſe of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> did <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> obtain the ſame Prince, who was before Prince of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and many other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And by this meanes were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Nations, not differing in manners, Lawes, and Cuſtomes from each other, being at a ſpeciall unity, and under one publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, thereby the more forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Thereafter the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> had by her Husband the Arch-Duke of <hi>Austria,</hi> a Sonne, unto whom befell for his marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good, the greateſt part of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and with <hi>Spaine</hi> the expectation of <hi>Terra nova</hi> and many other Titles which are ſpread far and wide over divers Countreys. But from this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114771:65"/>
great Magnificence of the Prince, proceeded a great alteration in the Government, the which I will briefly touch.</p>

            <head>The ſixth Chapter. How that the intended Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government, was the occaſion of the Warres.</head>
            <p>THe nature of man is much addicted, and is eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to domination; from whence (according to the ſaying of <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> proceedeth Tyrannicall Government; eſpecially, when as the Prince tranſgreſſeth the limits of the Laws of the Land: And it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom hapneth, but that men attempt the taking of more in hand, then they are able to perform, unleſs the very hope of the performance of that which is deſired be utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed: Therefore thoſe anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Princes whoſe hope and repoſe depended altogether upon their Native Countrey, as having no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114771:66"/>
of Forraign power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie upon, were obedient unto the Lawes, were lovers of equity, were reſpecters of the States, as well knowing upon whoſe power and meanes both their honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation conſiſted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Burgondians</hi> deſcended of Royall Progeny, were the firſt that climbed up the firſt ſtep unto domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, yet very ſecretly; the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty continuing never the leſſe, not only in outward ſhew, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the greateſt part thereof in her full face.</p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Charls</hi> being Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and King of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys, was not therewithall well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that herewithall he ſhould be called but a Prince: But yet he for affection and ſome certaine reſpects was reſtrained, in regard that he was born and brought up here in the Countrey; and beſides,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114771:66"/>
did exceedingly reſpect this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as being very convenient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the enterpriſing of any great exploit; and ſuch as were of themſelves very faithfull, but yet very ſoon diſpleaſed, and exceeding powerfull, when as their Liberty ſhould be but once toucht.</p>
            <p>Now the Church of God at that time being overwhelmed and poyſoned with palpable Hereſies, and longing for a wholſome medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine to purge the ſame: yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving by violence to maintaine that which was in uſe amongſt them, ſent his bloody Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that whoſoever ſhould bee found to be of any other Religion, ſhould bee puniſhed with death, never reſpecting nor enquiring what was the meaning and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the States in ſo weighty a buſineſſe.</p>
            <p>But his Son <hi>Philip</hi> being of that
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114771:67"/>
unſatiable nature, that was content with nothing elſe but with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, envied all Nations that would preſcribe a Law unto their Prince: The which the People of <hi>Aragon</hi> to their great ruine have proved. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who had the Education of King <hi>Philip</hi> in his youth, took hold of this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion very earneſtly, to proſecute the ſame againſt the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> and the reſt of the Netherlanders; ſince which time, there hath been a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall jealouſie and contention betwixt them, which of them ſhould bee beſt in the Princes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; whereupon they ſought to make the Liberty of the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands very hatefull: And on the contrary, to demonſtrate how that the Cities in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in ſuch and ſuch manner were kept in ſubjection with their Garriſons,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114771:67"/>
and that there was an abſolute obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience without any limitation.</p>
            <p>At what time as the warres in <hi>France</hi> ending, and King <hi>Philip</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requeſted in behalfe of the States, that hee would draw the Garriſons of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of the Countrey; which reaſonable requeſt of theirs, hee took very hainouſly, and in ill part; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned againe into <hi>Spaine,</hi> from that time for the moſt part after never permitted the publike affaires of <hi>Holland,</hi> nor of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands</hi> to be governed by the Lords that were the Inhabitants, and borne in the Countrey, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of according to old cuſtome, the principall and permanent Councel of the State of this Land did ever conſiſt, but by the reſolutions which were concluded in <hi>Spaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> leaving heere the Cardinall <hi>Granvell</hi> to bee the executioner
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114771:68"/>
of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Precepts.</p>
            <p>The matters concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were brought to that paſſe, that although it had bin a matter of great offence to have beleeved any otherwiſe then the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould thinke convenient, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe a good Prince ſhould not have atempted to have puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame, in regard of the great multitudes of thoſe that might be accuſed therewithall, from whoſe conſciences that Religion of what ſort ſoever it might be, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by no feare have been extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, or qualified.</p>
            <p>For this occaſion the principall Lords, and alſo the chiefeſt Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Provinces made their Declaration, that neither their traffique, nor yet the common tranquillity of the Land could bee maintained, unleſſe thoſe corriſive Commiſſions concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114771:68"/>
were lenified and mitigated; the which was ſo farre contrary to his minde, that King <hi>Philip</hi> ſhould follow their counſell therein, that hee contrary thereunto ordained that ſuch a ſearch and inquiſition ſhould be made, even to the very ſecret motions and cogitations of the heart, and that after a very new, ſtrange, and unuſuall manner of proceeding, the like whereof was never heard before, in ſuch manner as if it had been againſt thoſe Jews, or Mahumetiſts which ſhelter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly in ſome parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and is practiſed in <hi>Spaine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this end and purpoſe were there here and there new Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rickes erected and diſtributed with great contradicting and in deſpite of the States, without whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in former time the Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might not bee augmented; conſidering now that all this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114771:69"/>
all doubt tended to the great confuſion of the publike affaires, and firſt of all, thoſe Lords that were in the Councell of State, and afterwards a great number of noble perſonages aſſembling to this end and purpoſe, under whom alſo was the Lord of <hi>Brederode,</hi> deſcended of the Family of the Princes of <hi>Holland,</hi> who did both counſel and entreat, that they ſhould proceed unto that remedy, the which in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times was very often uſed in matters of leſſe moment, <hi>viz.</hi> to a Convocation of the Generall States, although King <hi>Philip</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his departure, and at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, had exceſſively comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to hinder the ſame, that there might be no Convocation of the Generall States; from hence there aroſe an uprore, not by any common conſent, but by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe of ſome certaine particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114771:69"/>
perſons of the pooreſt and common people, about the taking away of the Images out of the Churches, in regard that it was a high treſpaſſe and ſinne to make ſupplication and interceſſion unto them. And after that this uprore was pacified by the authority of the principall Lords, it pleaſed the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> under the pretext of this one inconſiderate particular, contrary to all right and reaſon, to charge the whole Nation generally with the offence of Rebellion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> was ſent with a very rigorous Commiſſion, to take poſſeſſion of the abſolute Soveraignty, being naturally a very rigorous man, as all <hi>Germany</hi> can teſtifie; he very openly publiſhed that both the States, Cities, and People of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very perſon in particular had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114771:70"/>
all their priviledges, and that from hence forward they were to expect no other Lawes but what it pleaſed the King to command, whereof he himſelfe was a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent teſtimony that the Lawes were aboliſhed; he being a ſtranger, and none of the Princes blood, and yet nevertheleſſe againſt all right and cuſtome was ſent to poſſeſſe the generall Government. The judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of matters was alſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from the lawfull and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Colledges, and by the erection of a new Judgement Seat, or Bench, where the matter of <hi>Leſae Majeſtatis,</hi> or the abuſing of His Highneſſe, ſhould be decided by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſuch as made themſelves ſlaves unto the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> having gotten under their power, not only the lives, but alſo the goods of all the inhabitants, whereof not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114771:70"/>
onely many thouſands of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people were executed, but alſo the very Earles themſelves of <hi>Egmond</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> being condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by falſe accuſations, were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to preſent their necks to the violent ſtroak of the Hangman. <hi>William</hi> Earle of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> being one of the chiefeſt Lords of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> with divers others, were baniſhed; of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> perſons, <hi>Egmond</hi> had his Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Governour of <hi>Holland.</hi> The Marqueſſe of <hi>Berghen,</hi> and the Lord of <hi>Montignie,</hi> who had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Requeſts and Remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people and of the States into <hi>Spaine,</hi> were both made away, the one being openly exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to common report, poyſoned.</p>
            <p>Thereafter, according to the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114771:71"/>
cuſtome of all thoſe that will bee Dominators, the Cities were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſons, or elſe Cittadels and Caſtles built there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Moreover and above, to the end that this Nation, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this preſent time had been a free people, might the more openly publiſh their ſlavery, by maintaining and providing for themſelves food and rayment, they were inforced at that time by the terrible threatnings of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, to bring up the twentieth penny at the ſale of every houſe or parcell of Land, and every tenth penny of all Moveables, which their Princes themſelves in former times were accuſtomed to.</p>
            <p>Then the Fidelitie and the Liberty of thoſe people were long contending with each other;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114771:71"/>
but in regard it was not poſſible to endure any longer the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of their Lawes: and they ſetting at nought of the States, and the Governement which had continued ſo many hundred yeeres; and that the Libertie of their poſteritie could not longer bee maintained: then the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> unto whom appertained the protection, as well both of the Lawes, as alſo of the generall, and their owne particular Rights, in the yeere 1572. upon the 19. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> in the Aſſembly at <hi>Dordrecht,</hi> conſiſting of certaine Nobles, and of the Deputies of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the Cities, according to the example of their Fore fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who tooke up Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Romanes,</hi> when as they preſſed to bee Dominators, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took

            <p>The Reputation of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth is yet augmented, ſince that Kings have accepted the ſame into confederacy with themſelves. For in the yeer, 1597. was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy agreed upon betwixt the King of <hi>France,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the <hi>States</hi> of the united <hi>Netherlandiſh</hi> Provinces: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114771:75"/>
the <hi>States</hi> did ſo reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence their depoſed Prince, that whilſt King <hi>Philip</hi> lived, the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of theſe Lands contained themſelves within the neceſſity of their owne defence; but after his death was the Warre more openly manifeſted, and that warre was ſent back againe into <hi>Spaine,</hi> which firſt came from themſelves: Yea, and even unto the very fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt parts of <hi>India</hi> is our Trafficque ſailed, being defended with Armes: And in thoſe places alſo by the occaſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, and by the known va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and fidelity of the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> is there occaſioned both friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and Confederacies with Kings and Nations, ſo that the Lords the States have been ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Embaſſadours comming ſo farre as out of the other world.</p>
            <p>Hitherto hath the warres conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued:
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114771:75"/>
There hath been often deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for peace, both whilſt King <hi>Philip</hi> lived, as ſince his death. As alſo, when as the Netherlands were reſigned unto his daughter and ſon in-law: But ever the States diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe conditions, whereby ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their Liberty, or that lawfull reſolution, which they had juſtly decreed and pronounced againſt King <hi>Philips</hi> Authority, might any way be impeached or toucht; like unto the example of the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> who never eſteemed any Peace ſo highly, that they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would receive in again the baniſhed <hi>Tarquins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, when as the Archduke <hi>Albertus,</hi> and <hi>Iſabel,</hi> and King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the Second, <hi>Philips</hi> Son, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to be ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowldge the freedome and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the States; then through the Interceſſion of the Kings of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114771:76"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> of Great <hi>Britaine,</hi> and of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and of ſome other Princes did begin a communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And in regard that many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties hindred the Peace, there was laſtly in the year 1609 a Truce concluded upon for the ſpace of 12 years, with a formall Declaration of the Archduke, both in their own names, as alſo in the name of King <hi>Philip,</hi> from whom to that very end, they had received Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and procuration, that they ſhould make Truce with the Lords the States Generall of the United Provinces, as reſpecting and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to be in quality of free States of their Lands, Provinces, and Cities, where over they have nothing to pretend.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Relation beginning long before the time of <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> and ending at theſe times, ſheweth, that continually during
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114771:76"/>
more then 1700 years, the <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> which now are called the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> have uſed the ſame Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the Soveraignty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hath alwayes remained in the States hands, and ſo is it at this preſent. So that nevertheleſſe, a Principality hath belonged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, ſometimes in a greater, and ſometimes in a leſſer manner of adminiſtration. In former time comming thereunto by Succeſſion, but very often and at this preſent by voyces, being ever ſubject under the Laws. This then is the ſhape or rather to ſay, the face of the whole Government.</p>
            <p>Now if any man would know all the particular members thereof; They are theſe as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Holland</hi> is very populous, and exceedingly well ſtored with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Villages. The eſpeciall care of the Cities is committed
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:114771:77"/>
to the Senators and Magiſtrates of each City, unto whom it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted within their own Liberties, to make certain Laws and Forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and to ordain certain Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions for the Cities neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. The Senators are perpetuall, The Magiſtrates are yearly, having very little or no allowance at all therefore.</p>
            <p>Their chiefe Burgh-maſters have their Authority from the higher Magiſtrates, for to maintaine the good of the Cities, and of the common Burgeſſes.</p>
            <p>The Jurats which are called Schepens, are ordained for the Law, as well over Civill as over criminall matters, whereof the Baliffs and Scoutes by one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, doe ſerve in that pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Office of Plaintiffs or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers.</p>
            <p>The Magiſtrates have in their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:114771:77"/>
Councell, learned Lawyers, called <hi>Penſionaires.</hi> The Juriſdiction of the Villages, both as well in the High Lordſhips called <hi>Hooghe Heerlyecheyden,</hi> as alſo in the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bachs Heerlycheden,</hi> is partly, either in the Common-wealth, or in the Principality; and partly, in the chiefe of the Nobility who have received the ſame from their fore-Fathers: The affairs of the <hi>Ambachs Heerleycheden,</hi> are commonly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the <hi>Schouts</hi> and the <hi>Schepens,</hi> The <hi>Hooghe Heer lycheyden</hi> by the <hi>Baliffs</hi> and the Tenants, or elſe by the Gentility.</p>
            <p>Moreover and above, there is the Forreſters and the Rangers of the Woods and Wilderneſſes; and the Stewards of Noblemens houſes have each one their own Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Hunting &amp;c. and their own fellow ſervants: And the <hi>Dyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves</hi> and <hi>Heemraden,</hi> thoſe that
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:114771:78"/>
have the Authority over the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dykes, and the River bancks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in conſiſteth the ſpeciall preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Holland,</hi> from all theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences (excepting in criminall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whereof the condemned very ſeldome is granted any appeale) they make their appeale unto the Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> the which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo acknowledged by <hi>Zealand.</hi> The controverſies of Cities and other matters of great importance are alſo decided there.</p>
            <p>In this Councell according to ancient Cuſtome, doth ſit certain of the Nobility, with certaine Lawyers and men experienced in all Cuſtomes: The chief head of this Councell is the <hi>Stadthouder,</hi> or the Governour of <hi>Holland</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; who moreover and above hath the power to command over the Garriſons, To elect the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates of the Cities after a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114771:78"/>
nomination thereof; and alſo, to give remiſſion and pardon to Malefactors; all which are tokens of an exceeding high Authority. There is alſo a Counting Houſe of the Principalities own proper Rents and Revenews which is governed by the Rent-Maſters.</p>
            <p>The Convocation of the States (the chiefe power whereof they of <hi>Holland</hi> have) hapneth three or four times yearly, or as often as is required.</p>
            <p>The State of the Nobility, and of the Gentility is repreſented, by ſome certain, who are the chief thereof, as well in reſpect of their noble deſcent, as of the Lordſhips which they poſſeſſe, being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber about twelve, whereof one of them dying, they chuſe another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to themſelves. The Cities that commonly ſend their Deputies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Convocation being warned
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114771:79"/>
thereunto, are theſe. <hi>Dordrecht, Haerlem, Delffe, Leyden, Amſterdam, Goude, Rotterdam, Gorchum, Schie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Schoonhoven, Breill, Alckmaer, Horne Enckhuyſen, Edam, Monicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Medenblick, Purmerendt.</hi> Thoſe that are deputed are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Burgh-Maſters, now and then accompanied with ſome of the Senators, or elſe penſionary.</p>
            <p>The Nobility gives their voice firſt, then the Cities every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their turnes: All this is even now as it was in the dayes of the Earls, excepting that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the publike mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which formerly the Earls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, is now inherent in the States and in the Governor.</p>
            <p>From the aforeſaid Court of <hi>Holland,</hi> there was wont to have been appealed unto the great Councell of <hi>Mechlen,</hi> which Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in former time, the States of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114771:79"/>
the ſeverall Provinces at the requeſt of the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Bourgondy</hi> had condeſcended unto, to abide unto that common Law: Inſtead of this Councel, they of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Zealand,</hi> about eight and twenty years ſince, have ordained the high Councel conſiſting of certain famous learned perſons, from whoſe ſentence there can be no appeale, but yet there may be a ſupplication preſented unto the States, to th'end that certain other Lawyers, Judges or Reviſers, might be added unto that Colledge which might dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and conſiderately peruſe and examine whether in that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there might be any errour or fault.</p>
            <p>Moreover ſince the warres, both the charges, and alſo the buſineſſes are very much encreaſed, that in reſpect thereof, there is yet another Colledge inſtituted, to have the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114771:80"/>
ſurvey of the common Treaſure of <hi>Holland;</hi> and to decide all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies ariſing thence. This Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge conſiſteth of perſons which are deputed thereunto by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, and by each ſeverall City, and are now and then changed. Theſe doe warn the States to aſſemble as need requireth, and doe execute that which the States doe decree. There are yet other Deputies ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the ſurveying of theſe, which have the hearing of the reckonings of the Receivers of the common Treaſure.</p>
            <p>Now ſince <hi>Utrecht</hi> continuing ſtill in the union with the other Provinces, which are <hi>Gelderland, Holland, Zealand, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht, Frieſland, Over-Iſell</hi> and <hi>Groning,</hi> who in former time were all called by the names of the <hi>Battavers, Mattiacks,</hi> and <hi>Frieſes,</hi> there hath bin a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity or Fellowſhip both of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114771:80"/>
Warre, Peace and forraign Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and Confederacies, as alſo of all other affairs, they have been alike partakers with each other. Theſe ſame Provinces are alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſend their Deputies for the conſultation of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good of the Lands. This aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſeldome ſeparateth, and are called the general States. By theſe, the points that fall into Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie betwixt the Provinces, are diſputed and decided. The next unto theſe, and by the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, the Councell of State hath the ſurvey of the affairs of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Government of the Souldiers, and of the Military buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. This Councell is come inſtead of the Councell of State, which in the time of the Earls, had the ſurvey of all the affairs of all the Netherlands.</p>
            <p>The Councellors being a certain
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114771:81"/>
number, are choſen by the States of each Province, and alſo ſometimes changed; they give their voyces not by the Provinces as in the Convocation, but man for man: The heads of this Councell are the Governors of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>Moreover there is divided in <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> and in <hi>Freiſland,</hi> certaine Colledges of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, that look unto the affaires of the Sea, and of the Cuſtoms and Commodities that come out of the Sea; They have their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the generall States; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Province ſends their Deputies thither; and now and then chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them.</p>
            <p>The Admirall-ſhip (which is the higheſt command at Sea) hath Prince<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Maurice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reckonings of the Cantoor of the generality, are looked unto
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:114771:81"/>
by certain perſons deputed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being ſufficiently known to the Inhabitants, I have handled the ſame more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the uſe of ſtrangers, not doubting when they ſhall have nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly looked into theſe matters, but that they ſhall very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the formes and frames of the Government of this Common-wealth; for if wee would but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge reaſon hereunto; reaſon teacheth us that Authority is beſt of all there, where it is conferred upon the principall beſt men. If we look about us concerning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, That Government which conſiſteth of the Nobles hath in commendation thereof the wiſeſt in former times. If we look after examples, wee have ſuch as were very worthy and very famous. As of <hi>Candy, Lacedemon, Carthage,</hi>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:114771:82"/>
               <hi>Rhodes, Marſelles, Theſſaly Achaia, Samos, Cnydos, Chio, Corfu,</hi> and as many think even the <hi>Romans</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at ſuch time as they moſt flouriſhed in Vertues: Yea, and that which is more, it ſufficiently appeareth that the Common-wealth of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (even as it was ordained of God before that the people deſired a King) was governed by the Nobles: Neither wanteth hereunto any freſh examples, as of <hi>Raguſa, Luca, Genua, Geneva,</hi> and the principall <hi>Cantons</hi> of the <hi>Swiſers,</hi> and of <hi>Venice,</hi> which teſtifie their ſtability by the continuance of a thouſand yeares. Hereunto may be added the whole corporation of the <hi>Germane</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, being full of majeſty and eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; and many of the Northen Kingdoms, which though they be called Kingdoms, are in very deed Principalities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:114771:82"/>
If in caſe, yet we will proſecute examples that are more neare home, The Soveraignty of the aſſembly of the States was in uſe by the ancienteſt Nation of the <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons</hi> and of the <hi>Brittons;</hi> and is yet at this preſent uſed in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſo much as concerns the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment which is adminiſtred by the Cities, we therein agree very well with them of <hi>Achaia, Etolia,</hi> and <hi>Licia,</hi> whoſe Common-wealth conſiſting of certain Cities con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned together, have governed the ſame by their Aſſemblies and by Deputies, whereof that of <hi>Achaia</hi> is ſet as a pattern, and commended by <hi>Polybius, Strabo,</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> to bee the beſt repreſentation of an abſolute uniforme Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>Alſo that unto the power of the Nobles be added a Principality,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114771:83"/>
limited with Lawes, that very ſame is common unto us as it was unto the ancient <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the days of the Judges, &amp; unto the <hi>Lacedemoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the people of <hi>Achaia,</hi> and unto the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and unto the <hi>Germane</hi> Empire, and unto the Northerne Kingdomes, as wee have ſaid before, and unto many others. The aſſembling of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall States, with the Councell of State, by whom is diſpatched or decided the common affaires, which concerne the union (ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Soveraignty of each Province aſide) agreeth very well with the <hi>Amphictiones</hi> Aſſembly by whoſe bond the Common-wealths of <hi>Grecia,</hi> being knit up together, did for a long time beat back the <hi>Medes</hi> and all other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne powers.</p>
            <p>In like manner alſo have they of <hi>Ionia</hi> with 13 Common-wealthes:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114771:83"/>
Thoſe of <hi>Hetruria</hi> with twelve, the old <hi>Latines</hi> with eight and fortie Commonwealths. And in former time many of the Nations of <hi>Germany,</hi> of the <hi>Walloons,</hi> and of the <hi>Brittaines,</hi> have had their generall Aſſemblies by vertue of their Confederacie; and the very like have the <hi>Swiſers</hi> and <hi>Griſons</hi> to this very day in uſe.</p>
            <p>Now whereas we do very much commend this manner of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet we may nor will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend nor ſpeak againſt that which is uſed by another; for wee muſt confeſſe, that all manner of things are not convenient for all ſorts of people, and that there are many Nations, which ſerve farre better to be under an abſolute Kingly Power, then to be left to their owne liberty; in regard whereof, it was more profitable
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114771:84"/>
for the people of <hi>Aſia</hi> to have Kings; and on the contrary, the <hi>Grecians</hi> could endure no Kings. Now that this manner whereof wee have beene ſpeaking, is the moſt convenienteſt for us, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſo many hundred years hath teſtified the ſame. As long as this continued, all things went well; but when the contrary was ſought, then preſently hath there Commotions and troubles ariſen, neither were, or could they by any meanes be remedied, untill that the Government was ſuited againe into her old habit.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that have very diligently looked into the ſeverall diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, natures, and manners of people, have perceived that thoſe people lying Northward, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially adjoyning unto the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſts (among whom we are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned)
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114771:84"/>
have ever had an antipathy of the abſolute authority of one man onely, and have a greater pleaſure in their owne Liberty. Alſo there are ſome that approve, that great Lands and Kingdomes are beſt governed by Kings, the leſſer Lands by the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but that thoſe Nations which are of an indifferent greatneſſe, and in ſpeciall doe know how to keep that which they have well and warily, and not coveting that which is anothers, are beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Government of the Nobles. Moreover, there muſt be had great regard unto the uſe and cuſtomes; for that which is commonly ſaid of all Lawes, is moſt commonly true in theſe Lawes, wherein the principall point of the Government con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth, that is, That it is better
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114771:85"/>
to uſe ſuch Lawes which are of themſelves not the beſt, then to change and alter thoſe which are received and have beene long practiſed.</p>
            <p>For it is with Lawes even as it is with the Plants, there muſt be of neceſſity time for the eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and faſtning of the Roots; and contrarily, if they be often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, they loſe their vertue, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and efficacy.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe are wee very much bound unto our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who have left unto us a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that is very good of it ſelfe, and exceeding well agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto our nature and manner of life, having re-obtained the ſame by Warre, and preſerved the ſame in time of peace.</p>
            <p>And this ought to bee our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, if wee will neither
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114771:85"/>
prove unthankfull, nor unprovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that wee conſtantly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Common-wealth where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto wee are counſelled by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> approved by <hi>Experience,</hi> and recommended by <hi>Antiquity.</hi>
