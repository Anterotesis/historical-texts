            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>OH, that your visards were vnmasked, that your wayes might be discovered, that the state might see your aime, whereas now it is so much disturbed to rove to find out your seduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by conjectures! Now you are a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer of the Chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by and by a child of our Church, and in difficult and unsettled times betwixt both, and stand out for neither. And sure <hi>Rome</hi> scarce dare trust you, lest you will not leave us, and we are fearefull, lest you will fly to them, your own consciences can testifie that you affect both, yet are you entire to neither, give me leave to speake plainly, because you are firme to neither, you are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome to both. To be too zealous in a pretended good worke is ill, and so is it to sit still and be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ignorance, but worst of all to know both, and he firme to neither, will you still abide amongst us, and yet not be of us, and will you still cast your eyes on <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet ahide with us, are you ignorant, or unconstant; that you still stand on doubts, know
<pb facs="tcp:53693:3"/>
your selves, that we may know you: either abide with us with whom you speake, and cut your wings, or else betake you to your wings, and speake at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not so trouble us both. Either speake to us in the light, or abide with them who worke in the darke. Remember death, and let the thought thereof cause your wavering to cease, and be firme in your resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Will you not yet resolve? If you meane to chuse, when shall it be, why not now, let your learning disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to you the dangers of delay, it makes you misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in what you want, &amp; doubtfull in what you have, and trouble us to know what you are: why will you looke to heaven with one eye, and on <hi>Romes</hi> pompe with the other? God cals you if you will sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for him: then take a resolution, to cast this <hi>Iezebell</hi> out of the Windowes of our Churches, this Whore of <hi>Rome</hi> that hath thus adva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced her pride, &amp; bewitched you, is their not just cause for what I cry? Yet if you will still remaine unconstant, who shall make you firme? If you love to stagger, yet aquaint us why you wi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> thus be unconstant? Surely you waver, because you speake not plainly to us, your words are one thing and your aime another. Methinkes I see your silence with a blush to answer this conjecture, as if thereby you granted, this to be the cause? Are you offended? I am grieved, and have I not cause, since civill jarres have beene by you so lamentable: will nothing please you but the glory of your owne partaking, and the quietnesse of your owne ful-bellied peace? Thinke you to finde more glory in them then in our Churches, wee have one Christ; labour not
<pb facs="tcp:53693:3"/>
then for those who divide his Garments: nay, his very body and blood. If you will bee to vs like <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi> yet bee not to vs like <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> to <hi>Peter.</hi> Other Churches have complained of these distractions as well as we; yet our greatest gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance is in your vnsetlednesse. Thinke you the glory of <hi>Rome</hi> to be so famous for you, amongst whom are severall hundreds of Contrarieties amongst her selfe, which will distract you more then you expect, though their Dissentions are smothered by their subtleties; have not you learned of them to fight closly within doores, without noise, which endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I had almost said begun frayes in the field? Surely the more you labour for their policie, the more you runne with them into want of Peace, and if you bee not either partiall, or incredulous, you may easily perceive the mischiefe of their secret Differences. Will you Rule the Church alone? alas! how full is such rule of contradiction and purposes repugnant to <hi>Christ</hi> her head! If you alone lay claime to the Church as yours; why doe you chide with her best members, &amp; disturbe them; why doe you fight with your selfe; will you looke for Peace, and not from GOD; indeed much pompe, and glory <hi>Romes</hi> Churches sonnes receive, but it is better to be content with what estate <hi>Christ</hi> bequeaths to his Church. Will you rather let your Soule, and the Soules of all your Flockes want their food, then you be taken from your Palaces? Is nothing worth your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect but earthly peace? But if you love your peace and glory so dearely that you will not leaue it; take
<pb facs="tcp:53693:4"/>
your peace and pompe to your selves; let us have truth: yet if it may bee Peace too; If you love your safety, and the Churches, seeke rather grounds whereon to rest, then excuses for your abode in trouble, seeke Peace and follow Truth, forsake <hi>Rome,</hi> and follow <hi>CHRIST:</hi> except you will rather abide in earthly pompe then come to <hi>Christ.</hi>

            <head>The Argument.</head>
            <p>THat institution which is from men, and <note place="margin">The Argument</note> not from the Word of God, is not of divine right, but humane. But the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Lordly Bishops is not from God, but of men; therefore such Lordly predominancy of the <note place="margin">Conclusion.</note>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53693:5"/>
Bishops, is not <hi>de jure divino,</hi> by divine right, but meerely humane.</p>
            <p n="1">I. To prove that such institution as is from men, and not from the word of God, is not of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, but humaine which I shall cleare brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 3. wayes, by Reason, by Scripture, and by the testimony of former Ages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Reason it selfe is forced to confesse that such institutions, as there is no warrant for in GODS Word, but are onely forged by the inventions of men, can no wayes be said to be from God, seeing the word of God expresseth not the same, except we will goe about to make humane mortals di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, or exalt them as Gods, or else adde to those things which God hath written, and so bring those heavie plagues upon us, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22. 18. that which is from God is divine, but what is onely from man, must needs be humane.</p>
            <p>If the glory of all the wisedomes in the world, were in one assembly, and should conclude of some particular not exprest in holy writ, such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, though never so approved by men, yet is it notwithstanding humane, because instituted by men onely, and having no warrant from Gods holy word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The holy Scripture so expresseth it; which, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah</hi> saith, is vanity, <hi>to speake the visions of a mans owne heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord. Ier.</hi> 23. 16.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:53693:5"/>

            <p>Surely by this time I hope any reasonableman may be well satisfied concerning the first propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, for the eyes of any may here behold how cleere this is laid downe, and proved, that such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution as is from men, and not from the Word of God, is not of divine right, but meerely hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That institution onely which is from the word of God, that alone is of divine right, and not the institutions or acts of the inventions of after Ages, being from themselves alone. Doth the scripture confirme it, then it must needes be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine; Is it onely from man? Oh fond Age, wilt thou maintaine such things as divine, which the holy writ doth not: then may many Caterpillers more plead free priviledges in Gods garden, and many wolves nest themselves amongst Gods sheepe. Have not some preferred playes before the Word of God, who have protested that the spirit of GOD hath more wrought upon their hearts at the conceit of some shadowed Tragedy, then being present at a Sermon? The Vsurer can pleade that God is honoured by his doing good. The Papists can pretend their Zeale before their Crosses, and Crucifixes, and all these, and many more can claime Antiquity, and pleade
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53693:6"/>
as much for themselves as any Prelate: but all this while they are but humane, and permitted by men, as the Prelates are; they are not permitted by Gods holy word: nor no such vaine inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which caused holy <hi>David</hi> to take up this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <hi>I hate, saith he, vaine inventions, but thy Law doe I love. Psal.</hi> 119. 113. And though our Lordly Bishops would prove themselves to be the Lords Bishops from divine right, yet let them but consider that saying of St. AUSTIN, for as much (saith he) as Christ hath not revealed these <note place="margin">in his 49 trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p n="3">III. To prove that the Lordly government of Bishops is from men and not from God, and that shall be first from a briefe survey of history how they have received their institution from men; &amp; secondly by a briefe Catalogue of some particular places of Scripture, in every booke through the whole Bible, to prove that they are not permitted thus to stand by the word of God.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

            <p>Let no man thinke to find any warrant in the word of God for Lordly predominasie of church men, a Minister of Christ, must not there expect to find a warrant for prelasie, for it is not of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution, no it is no custome of the church of Christ, it is the custome of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to have dominion, and to exercise authority over their brethren, but saith Christ to the Apostles: <hi>It shall not be so amongst you saith he. Mat. 20. 25, 26. Mark. 10. 42, 43. Luk.</hi> 22. 25, 26. Christ gave them charge from time to time, to take heed of lifting themselves up by pride, warning them to take heed of Lordly predominasie: Christ sends them to be his servants, and to preach to the people in humility, and that by the example of himselfe, he sends them forth as Embassidours of his word, preaching it humbly, as he did, and warning them not to looke for greater glory and pompe in the world, then he himselfe received, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Peter</hi> he practises this lesson, who spake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">not my Lord or right reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend father, &amp;c</note> the rest of the Apostles, and Elders, <hi>men and brethren, saith he, know that God chose out mee to preach the Gospell, that the Gentiles might heare the word out of my mouth, &amp; he preached to them and the people beleeved, and received the holy Ghost, saith be, and there was no difference betwixt vs &amp;c.</hi> as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth them not to bee high minded, but to make themselves equall to them of the lower sort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 16.</p>

And let the lofty Prelates blush at that his modest taunt, now ye are full (saith he) now yee are made rich, ye raigne as Kings, but we are made a gasing stocke, ye are honourable, but we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, but saith he afterwards, <hi>I pray you be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mee,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Oh! ye Prelates will not these so plain testimonies of your pride convince you!</p>
            <p>Looke upon <hi>Paul</hi> a little further, and you shall see that he was so farre from being a Lordly Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, that he gloried in being a servant to preach <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5. <hi>who never expected to receive titles of temporall honour,</hi> but as <hi>Iames Cephas,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> the right hand of fellow-ship with the rest. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 6. 21.</p>
            <p>And those Bishops and Deacons, which were amongst the Saints at <hi>Philippi,</hi> as it is <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. there were no prelasie amongst them, because of the fellowship which they had in the Gospell, <hi>verse 5. Col.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 2.</p>
            <p>Oh! how great and greevous a sinne is it for the Ministers of the Church of God, to sit in glory as Lords of the Temple of God! 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>In all the whole Bible we can find no warrant for prelasie, or Lordly government for Pastors of the Church to lay claime to, onely a Bishop or Pastor, or Elder, which you will, for they are all one, and a Deacon, the next degree immediately after them; and that onely in ordination, &amp;c. Not in Lordly predominasie. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2.</p>

And when there were any such amongst them, as had betaken themselves to worldly honour, and glory, the Apostles did reckon them forsaken, 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
            <p>And we may so plainly in that place, where St. <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Titus</hi> concerning the ordaining of Elders, as he first calls them, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 5. to be so, &amp; so qualified, he gives the reason of it in the 7. <hi>v.</hi> for saith he, a Bishop must be unreproveable, so that the very same which he first calleth Elder, he afterwards calleth Bishop, as it is plaine to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in that place.</p>
            <p>They were all brethren, there were none of them set up or appointed by them to Lord it over the rest, as the Prelates doe over the rest of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, but taught as brethren. <hi>Philemon v.</hi> 1.
