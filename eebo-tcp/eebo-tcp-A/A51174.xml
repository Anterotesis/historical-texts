            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

TO HIS
Son JOHN.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Son,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Custom of Dedicating Books hath been ancient, and
they have been usually dedicated either to Great Persons,
for protection or remuneration; or to Familiars, out of
friendship and affection; or to Children, in respect of nature
and for admonition. And to this end it is, that to you I
commend the reading of the Discourse following; that so
beholding the 18 years War by Sea, which for want of
years you could not then remember; and comparing them with the 18 years
of Peace, in which you have lived, you may consider three things. First,
that after so many pains and perils God hath lent Life to your Father to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your Education. Secondly, what proportion his recompence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
have had to his Services. Lastly, what just cause you have to abandon
the thoughts of such dangerous and uncertain courses; and that you may
follow the ensuing Precepts, which I commend to your often perusal.</p>
            <p>And in the first place, I will put you in mind of the small Means and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
I shall leave, that you may rate your Expences accordingly; and yet as
little as it is, 'tis great to me, in respect I attained to it by my own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
and dangers, and therefore no body can challenge Interest in it but my
self, though your Carriage may promise the best possibility.</p>
            <p>Beware you presume not so much upon it, as thereby to grow disobedient
to your Parents; for what you can pretend to, is but the privilege of two
years of age above your younger Brother; and in such cases Fathers are like
Judges, that can and will distinguish of offences and deserts according to
truth, and will reward and punish as they shall see cause.</p>
            <p>And because you shall know it is no rare or new thing for a man to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of his own, I will lay before you a Precedent of your own House, that
so often as you think of it, you may remember it with fear, and prevent it
with care.</p>
            <p>The Great Grandfather of your Grandfather was a Knight by Title, and
<hi>John</hi> by name, which name we desire to retain to our eldest Sons; God
blessed him with many earthly Benefits, as Wealth, Children, and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
his eldest Son was called <hi>John</hi> after his Father, and his second <hi>William</hi>
like to yourself and Brother; but upon what displeasure I know not, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
we must judge the Son gave the occasion) his Father left him the
least part of his Fortune, though sufficient to equal the best Gentleman of
his Shire, and particularly the ancient House called after his name. His other
Son <hi>William</hi> he invested with what your Uncle now enjoys. Both the Sons
whilest they lived carried the port and estimation of their Fathers Children,
though afterwards it fell out that the Son of <hi>John,</hi> and Nephew to <hi>William,</hi>
became disobedient, negligent, and prodigal, and spent all his Patrimony;
so that in conclusion he and his Son extinguished their House, and there now
remains no memory of them. As for the second Line and Race, of whom
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55770:3"/>
your Uncle and I descended, we live as you see, though our Estates be not
great, and of the two mine much the least; which notwithstanding is the
greater to me in respect I atchieved it with the peril and danger of my Life;
and you will make my contentment in the enjoyment of it the greater, if it
be accompanied with that comfort I hope to receive from you.</p>
            <p>The next thing I will handle shall be Arms. Know that Wars by Land
or Sea are always accompanied with infinite dangers and disasters, and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
rewarded according to Merit: For one Souldier that lives to enjoy
that Preferment which becomes his right by Antiquity of Service, ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
fall by the Sword and other casualties: And if you compare that of a
Souldier with any other Calling or Profession, you will find much differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
both in the reward and danger</p>
            <p>Although Arms have been esteemed in all Ages, and the more as there was
greater occasion to use them; yet you shall find they have been always sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to jealousies and envy; Jealousies from the State, if the General or other
Officer grow great and popular; subject to envy from Inferiors, who through
their perverse and ill dispositions malign other mens Merits.</p>
            <p>The Advancement of Souldiers is commonly made by Councellors at
home, whose eyes cannot witness the Services performed abroad; but a man
is advanced as he is befriended, which makes the Souldiers Preferment as
uncertain as his Life is casual.</p>
            <p>Compare the estate and advancement of Souldiers of our time but with
the mean and mercenary Lawyer, and you shall find so great a difference,
that I had rather you should become Apprentice to the one, than make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of the other.</p>
            <p>A Captain that will seek to get the love of his Souldiers. as his greatest
praise and felicity, of all other vices must detest and abandon Covetousness;
he must live by spending as the Miser doth by sparing; insomuch as few of
them can obtain by War wherewith to maintain themselves in peace, and where
Wealth wants Preferment fails.</p>
            <p>Souldiers that live in peaceable Islands, as in <hi>England,</hi> their Profession is
undervalued, because we see not those dangers which make the Souldiers
necessary, as others do where Wars are practised. And the good success in
our Wars hath been such as makes us attribute our Victories, not so much to
Valour as to Chance.</p>
            <p>I confess the base and ill behaviour of some Souldiers, hath made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
and their Callings the less esteemed; for the name of a Captain, which
was ever wont to be honourable, is now became a word of reproach and
disdain.</p>
            <p>Souldiers may have Reputation, but little Credit; Reputation enough
to defend their Honours, but little Trust in Commerce of the World; and
not without cause, for their security is the worse, by how much the danger
of death is the greater.</p>
            <p>Learning is as much to be preferred before War, as the trade of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
before that of the Factor. By Learning you are made sensible of the
difference betwixt Men and other Creatures, and will be able to judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the good and the bad, and how to walk accordingly. By Learning
you attain to the knowledge of Heavenly Mysteries, and you may frame
your Life accordingly, as God shall give you grace. By Learning you are
made capable of Preferment, if it concur with Virtue and Discretion; and
the rather because you are a Gentleman by birth, and of good Alliance,
which I observe next to Money in this Golden Age is the second step to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:55770:3"/>
For one that is preferred by Arms, there are twenty by Learning; and
indeed the Souldier is but a Servant to the Learned, for after his many fought
Battels, and as many dangers of his Life, he must yield account of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and be judged, corrected, and advanced as it shall please the other.</p>
            <p>You may wonder to hear me extoll Learning so highly above my own
Profession, considering the poor Fortune I shall leave was atchieved by
Arms; it is enough therefore to persuade you what I say is not conjectural
but approved: for if I did not find this difference, the natural affection of a
Father to a Son would make me discover it to you, that you may follow that
which is most probable and profitable.</p>
            <p>Good Son, love Souldiers for your Countries sake, who are the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of it; for my sake, who have made Profession of it; but shun the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it as you will do Brawls, Quarrels, and Suits, which bring with them
perplexities, and dangers.</p>
            <p>There are many things to be shunned, as being perillous both to Body
and Soul; as Quarrels and occasions of them, which happen through the
enormities and abuses of our Age. Esteem Valour as a special virtue, but
shun Quarrelling as a most detestable vice. Of two evils it were better to
keep company with a Coward than a Quarreller; the one is commonly socia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and friendly, the other dangerous in his Acquaintance, and offensive to
Standers by. He is never free from peril, that is conversant with a Quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
either for offence given to himself, or to others wherein he may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged.</p>
            <p>A true valiant man shall have enough to do to defend his own Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
without engaging for others: nor are all valiant that will fight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
Discretion makes a difference betwixt Valour and Desperateness. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
can happen more unfortunate to a Gentleman, than to have a Quarrel,
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> yet nothing so ordinary as to give offence; it draweth with it many
mischiefs both to Body and Soul: being slain he is danger of damnation, and
no less if he kill the other without great repentance. He shall perpetually
live in danger of revenge from the Friends of the Party killed, and fall into
the mercy of the Prince and Law where he liveth, but if for fear and base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
he avoid and shun a Quarrel, he is more odious living than he would be
unhappy in dying.</p>
            <p>Drinking is the foundation of other vices, it is the cause of Quarrels,
and then follows Murders. It occasions Swearing, Whoredom, and many other
vices depend upon it.</p>
            <p>When you behold a Drunkard, imagine you see a Beast in the shape of a
Man. It is a humour that for the time pleaseth the Party drunk, and so
bereaves him of sence, that he thinketh all he doth delighteth the Beholders;
but the day following he buys his shame with repentance, and perhaps gives
that offence in his drunkenness, that makes him hazard both Life and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in a Quarrel. You have no man that will brag or boast so much of
the word Reputation as a Drunkard, when indeed there is nothing more to a
mans imputation than to be drunk.</p>
            <p>A Drunkard is in the condition of an excommunicated person, whose Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
betwixt Party and Party is of no validity. Avoid (good Son) the
company of a Drunkard, and occasions of drinking, then shall you live free
without fear, and enjoy your own without hazard.</p>
            <p>Whoredom is an incident to Drunkenness, though on the contrary all
Whoremasters are not Drunkards. It is a sin not washed away without the
vengeance of God to the third and fourth generation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:55770:4"/>
Besides the offence to God, it giveth a disreputation to the party and his
Of-spring, it occasioneth a breach betwixt Man and Wife, encourageth the
Wife oftentimes to follow the ill example of her Husband, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth
Dislike, Divorce, Disinheriting of Children, Suits in Law, and Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of Estates.</p>
            <p>The next and worst sin I would have you shun is Swearing. I do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
you like a Puritan, that ties a man more to the observing of Sundays,
and from taking the Name of God in vain, than to all the rest of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:
but I wish you to avoid it for the greatness of the sin it self,
for the Plague of God hangeth over the House of the Blasphemer. Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is odious to the Hearers, it giveth little credit to the words of him that
useth it, it affordeth no pleasure as other sins do, nor yieldeth any profit to
the party; Custom begetteth it, and Custom must make one leave it.</p>
            <p>For your Exercises let them be of two kinds, the one of Mind, the other
of Body; that of the Mind must consist of Prayer, Meditation, and your
Book; let your Prayers be twice a day, howsoever you dispose of your self
the rest of the time; Prayers work a great effect in a contrite and penitent
Heart.</p>
            <p>By this I do not seek to persuade you from such Exercises and Delights of
body as are lawful and allowable in a Gentleman; for such increase health
and agility of body, make a man sociable in company, and draw good Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintants;
many times they bring a man into favour with a Prince, and
prove an occasion of preferment in his Marriage; they are often times a safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
to a mans Life, as in vaulting suddenly upon a Horse to escape an
Enemy.</p>
            <p>I will especially commend unto you such pleasures as bring delight and
content without charge; for others are fitter for greater men than one of your
Fortune to follow.</p>
            <p>Hawking and Hunting, if they be moderately used, are like Tobacco, in
some cases wholesom for the Body, but in the common use both laboursom
and loathsom; they alike bring one discommodity, (as comonly Vices do)
that they are not so easily left as entertained.</p>
            <p>Tobacco is hot and hurtful to young Bodies and Stomachs, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the heat of the Liver, which naturally you are subject to. It is offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to company, especially the Breath of him that takes it; it drieth the
Brain, and many become Fools with the continual use thereof.</p>
            <p>Let your Apparel be handsom and decent, not curious nor costly. A
wise man is more esteemed in his plain Cloth than gay Clothing. It is more
commendable to be able to buy a rich Suit than to wear one. A wise man
esteems more of a mans Vertues and Valour than of his Vesture; but seeing
this Age is fantastical and changeable, you must fashion your self to it, but in
so mean and moderate a manner, as to be rather praised for Frugality, than
derided for Prodigality.</p>
            <p>He that delights in curious Cloaths is an Imitator of a Player, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
his Apparel by the part he acts. And as Players appear upon the Stage
to be seen of the Spectators, so do the Gallants proclaim their Braveries in
open Assemblies.</p>
            <p>Whilest I live and you not marry, I shall temper this Expence; but when I
die remember what I say, seek Advancement rather by your carriage; the
curiousness, the reputation you gain by that will be lasting, when this will
appear but like a Flower sading.</p>
            <p>Frame your Course of Life to the Country and not to the Court; and
yet make not your self such a stranger to great persons, as in Assemblies they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55770:4"/>
should ask others who you are. I confess the greatest and suddenest rising is by
the Court; yet the Court is like a hopeful and forward Spring, that is taken
with a sharp and cold Frost, which nips and blasts a whole Orchard except
2 or 3 Trees; for after that proportion commonly Courtiers are preferr'd.
And he that will thrive at Court must make his dependency upon some great
person, in whose Ship he must imbarque all his hopes; aud how unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
such great persons are oftentimes themselves, and how unthankful to
their Followers, we want not Precedents.</p>
            <p>He that settles his Service upon one of them shall fall into the disfavour of
another; for a Court is like an Army ever in War, striving by stratagems to
circumvent and kick up one anothers heels, You are not ignorant of the
aptness of this Comparison by what you know of me, whose case will serve
you for a Prospective-glass, wherein to behold your danger afar off, the
better to prevent it. Yet reverence Lords because they are Noble, and one
more than another, as he is more notable in virtue.</p>
            <p>Be choice of your Company; for as a man makes election of them he is
censured: Man lives by Reputation, and that failing he becomes a Monster.
Let your Company consist of your own rank, rather better than worse; for
hold it for a Maxim, The better Gentleman the more gentle in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Beware they be not accused of Crimes, for so it may touch you in Credit;
and if you lose your Reputation in the bud of your Youth, you shall scarce
recover it in the whole course of your Life. Let them be civil in carriage,
for commonly such men are sensible above all; let them be learned, for
Learning is a Fountain from whence springs another Life; let them be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
in Diet and Expence, so shall you learn to live in health, and increase
in wealth.</p>
            <p>Beware they be not cholerick in disposition, or arrogant in Opinion; for
so you shall become a Slave to their Humours, and base by suffering. A
cholerick man of all others is the worst Companion, for he cannot temper his
rage, but on any slight occasion of a Friend becomes an Enemy. Value
true Friendship next to Marriage, which nothing but Death can dissolve;
for the sickleness of Friendship is oftentimes the ruine of ones Fortune.</p>
            <p>Beware of Gaming, for it causes great vexation of Mind. If you lose, it
begets in you that humour, that out of hope of regaining your losses, you
will endanger the loss of all. Do not presume too much of your skill in
Play, or making wagers as if you were excellent above others, or have For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
at command; for she is like a Whore variable and inconstant, and when
she disfavours you, it is with more loss at once than she recompenceth at
twice.</p>
            <p>Love your Brother and Sisters for their own sakes, as you are bound by
Nature, but especially for mine whose they are. Remember you are all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
to me, but that God chose you from the rest to be a strength and
stay to them; think you cannot honour your Father more being dead, than
in shewing affection to them he dearly loved; and nothing will more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
you to be mine, than love and kindness amongst your selves. You
owe somewhat more to me than that I am your Father, in that I seek your
Advancement above theirs, of which Obligation I will acquit you conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
you perform what you ought to them. For because Man cannot
himself live ever, he desires to live in his Posterity; and if I had an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Sons, my greatest hope must depend upon you as you are my eldest,
and seeing my care is of you above the rest, do not make my Memory so
unhappy, as to give the World an occasion to say, I left an unnatural Son.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55770:5"/>
The onely request I make is, be kind and loving to them, who I know by
their disposition will give you no cause of offence. A discourtesie from you
will be as sharp to them as a Razor from another.</p>
            <p>Be courteous and friendly to all, for men are esteemed according to ther
carriage. There is an old Proverb, <hi>The courtesie of the mouth is of great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
and costs little.</hi> A proud man is envied of his Equals, hated by his Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
and scorned by his Superiours; so that betwixt Envy, Hate, and Scorn
he is friendless.</p>
            <p>Many times a man is condemned to death out of presumption, especially
when it concurrs with an opinion of his former ill carriage: how much
therefore doth it concern a man in the times of his Prosperity to lay up a stock
of Love and Reputation?</p>
            <p>There cannot be a greater Honour than to gain a mans Enemy by a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie;
it far exceeds the kindness that is done to another, and doubly obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
him that receiveth it. Love is a thing desired by a King from his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
by a General from his Souldiers, and by a Master from his Servants; he
that hath it is rich by it, it maintains peace in time of peace, and is a safe
Bulwork in time of war.</p>
            <p>Do not buy this Love with the ruine of your Estate, as many do with
prodigal Expences, and then are requited with pity and derision. Let
your Expence be agreeable to the wearing of your Cloaths, better or worse
according to Company; or the journying your Horse, the less way you go
to day, you may travel the further to morrow; but if you go every day a
long and wearisom Journey, your Horse will fail, and you be enforc'd to go
on foot. And so will it be in your Expences, if you do not moderate them
according to Days and Companies, your Horse and you may travel faintly
together.</p>
            <p>If you are prodigal in any thing, let it be in Hospitality, as most agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the will of God, you shall feed the hungry, relieve the poor, and
get the love of the rich. What you spend among your Neighbours is not
lost, but procures their loves and helps when you have need, and thereby
you shall find Friendship in the Country as available as Favour at Court.</p>
            <p>If you are called to any place of Magistracy, do justice with pity, revenge
not your self of your Enemy under colour of Authority, for that shews
baseness, and will procure you hatred. In Money matters favour your
Country, if it be not against the present profit of the King, for many times
his Name is used for the gain of other men.</p>
            <p>Study the Laws, not to make a mercenary practice of them, but onely
for your own use, the good of your Neighbours, and the Government of
your Country. Hold the Laws in reverence next to the King; for that
Kingdom is well governed where the King is ruled by the Laws, not the Laws
by the King.</p>
            <p>Be not presumptuous in your Command, yet seek to be obeyed as you
desire to obey; for as you are above others, others are above you. Give
your mind to accommodate Controversies among your Neighbours, and you
shall gain their Love, which will more avail you than the hate of the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
can hurt you.</p>
            <p>Punish Idleness and other vices, as well for that they are such, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
sake. Gain love by doing Justice, and hate doing wrong, though it
were to your immediate profit.</p>
            <p>If you marry after my death, chuse a Wife as near as you can suitable to
your Calling, Years, and Condition; for such Marriages are made in Heaven,
though celebrated on Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:55770:5"/>
If your Estate were great, your choice might be the freer; but where the
preferment of your Sisters must depend upon your Wives Portion, let not
your Fancy overrule your Necessity. It is an old Saying, <hi>He that marrieth
for love hath evil days and good nights:</hi> Consider if you marry for Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
how long you will be raising Portions for your Sisters, and the misery
you shall live in all the days of your life; for the greatest Fortune that a
man can expect is in his Marriage. A wise man is known by his actions, but
where Passion and Affection sway, that man is deprived of sence and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>It is not the Poverty or Meanness of her that's married that makes her the
better Wife, for commonly such Women grow elevated, and are no more
mindful of what they have been, than a Mariner is of his escape from a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
at Sea when it is past. You must set your Wife a good example by your
own carriage, for a wise and discreet Husband usually makes an obedient
and dutiful Wife. Beware of Jealousie, for it causeth great vexation of
mind, and scorn and laughter from your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Many times it is occasioned by the behaviour of the Husband towards
other Women: in that case do like the Physician, take away the cause of the
infirmity, if not you are worthy to feel the smart of it. Jealousie is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon conceit and imagination, proceeds from a weak; idle, and distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
Brain; and the unworthy carriage of him that is jealous, many times
maketh a Woman do what otherwise she would not.</p>
            <p>If God be pleased to give you Children, love them with that discretion
that they discern it not, lest they too much presume upon it. Encourage
them in things that are good, and correct them if they offend. The love of
God to Man cannot be better expressed, than by that of a Father to his
Children. Comforts of Crosses they prove to their Parents, and herein Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is a great help to Nature.</p>
            <p>Let your Children make you to disrelish and abandon all other delights
and pleasures of the world, in respect of the comfort and joy you receive by
them. Make account then that Somer is past, and the melancholy Winter
approacheth; for a careful and provident Father cannot take delight in the
world and provide for his Children.</p>
            <p>For a conclusion I will recommend two principal Virtues to you, the one
is Secrecy, the other Patience. Secrecy is necessarily required in all, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
publick persons, for many times they are trusted with things, the reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof may cost them their lives, and hinder the designs of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
It is a folly to trust any man with a secret, that can give no assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in the business he is trusted with. Councellors of State and Generals,
of Armies, of all other ought to be most secret, for their designs being once
discovered, their Enterprizes fail. Silence was so much esteemed among the
<hi>Persians,</hi> that she was adored for a Goddess. The <hi>Romans</hi> kept their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions
so secret, as that alone was a principal cause of their Victories.
But of all others trust not Women with a Secret, for the weakness of their
Sex makes them unsecret. Be patient after the example of <hi>Job,</hi> and you
shall become a true Servant of God. Patience deserveth to be painted with
a Sword in her hand, for she conquers and subdues all difficulties. If you
will take advantage of your Enemy, make him cholerick, and by patience
you shall overcome him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> being both Emperour and Philosopher confessed, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
not the Empire by Philosophy but by Patience. What man in the
world was ever so patient as our Saviour himself, by following whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
his Ministers have converted more by their words, then all the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55770:6"/>
Emperours could deferr by rigour or cruelty of Laws. The impatient
man contests with God himself, who giveth and taketh away at his good will
and pleasure.</p>
            <p>Let me (good Son) be your Patern of Patience, for you can witness with
me, that the Disgraces I have unjustly suffered, (my Estate being through
my misfortunes ruined, my Health by imprisonments decayed, and my Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
undervalued and unrecompensed) have not bred the least distaste or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
in me, or altered my resolution from my infancy; that is, I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so base as to insinuate into any mans favour, who was favoured by the
times. I was never so ambitious as to seek or crave Imployment, or to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any that was not put upon me. My great and onely comfort is, that
I served my Princes both faithfully and fortunately; but seeing my Services
have been no better accepted, I can as well content my self in being a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator,
as if I were an Actor in the world.</p>
            <p>Before I treat of the Sea I will shew what Laws <hi>Richard</hi> the First esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
in his Expedition by Sea, which in some points are observed to this
day.</p>

               <p>UPon the knowledge of the Imbargo made by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in
<hi>Anno</hi> 1585, of the English Ships, Men, and Goods found in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
Her Majesty having no means to help or relieve her Subjects by friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Treaty, authorized such as sustained loss by the said Arrest, to repair
themselves upon the Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and to that end gave
them Letters of Reprisal, to take and arrest all Ships and Merchandizes that
they should find at Sea, or elsewhere, belonging to the Vassals of the said
King.</p>
               <p>Her Majesty at the same time to revenge the wrongs offered her, and to
resist the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Preparations made against her equipped a Fleet of 25
Sail of Ships, and imployed them under the command of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi>
as the fittest man by reason of his Experience and Success in sundry Actions.</p>
               <p>It is not my intent to set down all the particulars of the Voyages treated of,
but the Services done, and the Escapes and Oversights past, as a warning to
those that shall read them, and to prevent the like Errors hereafter.</p>
               <p>This Voyage of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> being the first undertaking on either
side, (for it ensued immediately after the Arrest of our Ships and Goods in
<hi>Spain</hi>) I will deliver my Opinion of it, before I proceed any further.</p>
               <p>One impediment to the Voyage was, that to which the ill success of divers
others that after followed, is to be imputed, <hi>viz,</hi> the want of Victuals and
other necessaries fit for so great an Expedition; for had not the Fleet by
chance met with a Ship laden with Fish, that came from <hi>New found Land,</hi> which
relieved their necessities, they would have found themselves reduced to great
extremity.</p>
               <p>The Service that was performed in this Action, was the taking and sacking
<hi>Sancta Domingo in Hispaniola, Cartagena</hi> in <hi>Terra firma,</hi> and the <hi>Fonta aqua</hi>
in <hi>Florida;</hi> three Towns of great importance in the <hi>West Indies.</hi> This Fleet
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55770:7"/>
was the greatest of any Nation but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that had been ever seen
in those Seas since the first discovery of them; and if it had been as well
considered of before their going from home, as it was happily performed by
the Valour of the Undertakers, it had more annoyed the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> than
all other Actions that ensued during the time of the War.</p>
               <p>But it seems our long Peace made us uncapable of advice in War; for had
we kept and defended those places being in our possession, and provided to
have been relieved and succoured out of <hi>England,</hi> we had diverted the war
from this part of <hi>Europe:</hi> for at that time there was no comparison betwixt
the strength of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>England</hi> by Sea by means whereof we might have
better defended them, and with more ease incroached upon the rest of the
<hi>Indies,</hi> than the King of <hi>Spain</hi> could have aided or succoured them.</p>
               <p>But now we see and find by experience, that those places which were
then weak and unfortified, are since so strengthened, as it is bootless to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
any Action to annoy the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his <hi>West Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though this Voyage proved both fortunate and victorious, yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
it was rather an awakening than a weakning of him, it had been far
better to have wholly declined it, than to have undertaken it upon such slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
grounds, and with so inconsiderable Forces.</p>

               <p>HER Majesty having received several Advertisements, that while the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> was silent, not seeking revenge for the injuries the Ships
of Reprisal did him daily upon his Coasts, he was preparing an invincible
Army to invade her at home. She thereupon sought to frustrate his designs,
by intercepting his Provisions before they should come to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which was
their place of Rendezvouz, and sent away Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> with a Fleet
of 30 Sail great and small, 4 whereof were her own Ships.</p>
               <p>The chief Adventure in this Voyage (besides those 4 Ships of Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties)
was made by the Merchants of <hi>London,</hi> who sought their private gain
more than the advancement of the Service; neither were they deceived of

for, by destroying all such Ships as he found in Harbour, as well of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
as other Nations that were hired by them; and by these means he
utterly defeated their mighty Preparations which were intended against <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that year 1587.</p>
               <p>The second Service performed by him was, the assaulting the Castle of
<hi>Cape Sacre,</hi> upon the utmost Promontory of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and three other strong
Holds; all which he took some by force, and some by composition. From
thence he went to the mouth of the River of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where he anchored near
<hi>Caske Cadiz;</hi> which the Marquess of <hi>St. Cruze</hi> beholding durst not with his
Gallies approach so near as once to charge him.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> perceiving, that though he had done important Service
for the State by this fortunate Attempt of his, yet the same was not very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to the Merchants, who adventured onely in hope of Profit, and
preferred their private gain before the security of the Kingdom, or any other
respect. Therefore from <hi>Caske Cadiz</hi> he stood to the Islands of <hi>Tercera,</hi> to
expect the coming home of a <hi>Carreck,</hi> which he had intelligence wintered at
<hi>Mosambique,</hi> and consequently she was to be home in that moneth. And
though his Victuals grew scarce, and his Company importuned his return
home, yet with gentle Speeches he persuaded, and so much prevailed with
them, that they were willing to expect the issue some few days at the Islands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and by this time drawing near the Island of <hi>S. Michael,</hi> it was his good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to meet and take the <hi>Carrick</hi> he looked for; which added more Honour
to his former Service, and gave great content to the Merchants, to have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Return of their Adventure, which was the thing they principally
desired. This Voyage proceeded prosperously and without exception, for
there was both Honour and Wealth gained, and the Enemy greatly enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged.</p>

               <p>NOtwithstanding the great spoil and hurt Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> did the year
past in <hi>Cadiz</hi> Road, by intercepting some part of the Provisions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for this great Navy, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> used his utmost endeavours to
revenge himself this year, lest in taking longer time his Designs might be
prevented as before, and arrested all Ships, Men, and necessaries wanting for
his Fleet, and compell'd them per force to seave in this Action.</p>
               <p>He appointed for General the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia,</hi> a man imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rather for his Birth than Experience; for so many Dukes, Marquesses,
and Earls, voluntarily going, would have repined to have been
commanded by a man of less quality than themselves. They departed
from <hi>Lisbon</hi> the 19th. day of <hi>May</hi> 1588, with the greatest pride and glory,
and least doubt of Victory, that ever any Nation did; but God being angry
with their insolence, disposed of them contrary to their expectation.</p>
               <p>The directions from the King of <hi>Spvin</hi> to his General were, to repair as
wind and weather would give leave, to the Road of <hi>Callice</hi> in <hi>Piccardy,</hi> there
to abide the coming of the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> and his Army, and upon their
meeting to have opened a Letter directed to them both with further Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p>He was especially commanded to sail along the Coasts of <hi>Brittany</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy,</hi>
to avoid being discovered by us here; and if he met with the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Fleet, not to offer to fight, but onely seek to defend themselves. But
when he came athwart the North Cape, he was taken with a contrary wind
and foul weather and forced into the Harbour of the <hi>Groyne,</hi> where part
of his Fleet lay attending his coming. As he was ready to depart from
thence, they had intelligence by an <hi>English</hi> Fisherman, whom they took
Prisoner, of our Fleets late being at Sea, and putting back again, not expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their coming that year; insomuch that most part of the Men belonging
to our Ships were discharged.</p>
               <p>This Intelligence made the Duke alter his Resolution, and to break the
Directions given him by the King; yet this was not done without some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
for the Council was divided in their Opinions, some held it best to
observe the Kings Command, others not to lose the opportunity offered to
surprize our Fleet unawares, and burn and destroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diego Flores de Valdos,</hi> who had the command of the <hi>Andalusian</hi> Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
and on whom the Duke most relied, because of his experience and
judgment, was the main man that persuaded the Attempt of our Ships in
Harbour, and with that resolution they directed their course for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The first Land they fell with was the <hi>Lizard,</hi> the Southermost part of <hi>Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
which they took to be the <hi>Rams Head</hi> athwart <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and the
night being at hand they tacked off to Sea, making account in the morning
to make an Attempt upon our Ships in <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:55770:8"/>
But whilest they were thus deceived in the Land, they were in the mean
time discovered by Capt. <hi>Flemminge</hi> a Pyrat, who had been at Sea pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and upon view of them, knowing them to be the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
with all speed to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and gave warning and notice to our
Fleet, who were then riding at Anchor; whereupon my Lord Admiral hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with all possible expedition to get forth the Ships, and before the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
could draw near <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they were welcomed at Sea by my Lord
and his Navy, who continued fight with them untill he brought them to an
Anchor at <hi>Callice.</hi> The particulars of the Fight, and the Successes thereof,
being things so well known, I purposely omit.</p>
               <p>While this Armado was preparing, Her Majesty had from time to time
perfect intelligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Designs; and because she knew his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
was to invade her at Sea with a mighty Fleet from his own Coast, she fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out her Royal Navy under the Conduct of the Lord High Admiral of
<hi>England,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> as the likeliest place to attend their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
as you have heard.</p>
               <p>Then knowing that it was not the Fleet alone that could endanger her
safety, for that they were too weak for any Enterprize on Land, without
the assistance of the Prince of <hi>Parma,</hi> and his Army in <hi>Flanders;</hi> therefore
she appointed 30 Sail of <hi>Holland</hi> Ships to lie at an Anchor before the Town
of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> where the Prince was to imbarque in Flat-bottom'd Boats, made
purposely for the Expedition of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus had the Prince by the Queens Providence been prevented, if he had
attempted to put out of Harbour with his Boats; but in truth neither his
Vessels nor his Army were in readiness, which caused the King ever after to
be jealous of him, and as 'tis supposed to hasten his end.</p>
               <p>Her Majesty, notwithstanding this her vigilant care to foresee and prevent
all danger that might happen at Sea, would not hold her self too secure of
her Enemy, and therefore prepared a Royal Army to welcom him upon his
Landing; but it was not the will of God that he should set foot on <hi>English</hi>
ground, the Queen becoming Victorious over him at Sea, with little hazard
or bloudshed of her Subjects.</p>
               <p>Having shewed the Design of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and the course taken by Her
Majesty to prevent them; I will now collect the Errors committed as well
by the one as by the other, as I have promised in the beginning of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>As nothing could appear more rational and likely to take effect, after the
Duke had gotten intelligence of the state of our Navy, than his design to
surprize them unawares in Harbour, he well knowing that if he had taken
away our strength by Sea, he might have landed both when and where he
listed, which is a great advantage to an Invader; yet admitting it had took
that effect he designed, I see not how he was to be commended in breaking
the Instructions given him by the King, what blame then did he deserve,
when so ill an event followed by his rashness and disobedience?</p>
               <p>It was not the want of Experience in the Duke, or his laying the fault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Valdes,</hi> that excused him at his return; but he had smarted bitterly for it,
had it not been for his Wife, who obtained the Kings favour for him.</p>
               <p>Before th' Arrival of the Ships that escaped in this Voyage, it was known
in <hi>Spain,</hi> that <hi>Diego Flores de Valdes</hi> was he who persuaded the Duke to break
the Kings Instructions; whereupon the King gave commandment in all his
Ports, where the said <hi>Diego Flores de Valdes</hi> might arrive, to appreheud him;
which was accordingly executed, and he carried to the Castle of <hi>Sancta An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea,</hi>
and was never seen or heard of after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55770:9"/>
If the Kings Directions had been punctually followed, then had his Fleet
kept the Coast of <hi>France,</hi> and arrived in the Road of <hi>Callice</hi> before they had
been discovered by us, which might have endangered Her Majesty and the
Realm, our Ships being so far off as <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where then they lay; and
though the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> had not been presently ready, yet he had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
time sufficient by the absence of our Fleet to make himself ready.</p>
               <p>And whereas the Prince was kept in by the 30 Sail of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the Dukes Fleet might have been able to have put the <hi>Hollanders</hi> from
the Road of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and possest it themselves, and so have secured the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and Fleets meeting together; and then how easie it had been after their
joyning to have transported themselves for <hi>England?</hi> And what would have
ensued upon their Landing here may be well imagined.</p>
               <p>But it was the will of him that directs all men and their actions, that the
Fleets should meet, and the Enemy be beaten as they were, put from their
Anchorage in <hi>Callice</hi> Road, the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> beleaguered at Sea, and
their Navy driven about <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> with great hazard and loss;
which sheweth how God did marvellously defend us against their dangerous
Designs.</p>
               <p>And here was opportunity offered us to have followed the Victory upon
them; for after they were beaten from the Road at <hi>Callice,</hi> and all their
hopes and designs frustrated; if we had once more offered them fight, the
General by persuasion of his Confessor was determined to yield, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
'tis very likely would have made the rest to have done the like. But
this opportunity was lost, not through the negligence or backwardness of
the Lord Admiral, but merely through the want of Providence in those that
had the charge of furnishing and providing for the Fleet; for at that time of
so great advantage, when they came to examine their Provisions, they found
a general scarcity of Powder and Shot, for want whereof they were forced
to return home. Another opportunity was lost not much inferiour to the
other, by not sending part of our Fleet to the West of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> of necessity were to pass after so many dangers and disasters as they
had endured.</p>
               <p>If we had been so happy as to have followed this course, as it was both
thought and discoursed of; we had been absolutely victorious over this
great and formidable Navy, for they were brought to that necessity, that
they would willingly have yielded, as divers of them confess'd that were
shipwreck'd in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may see how weak and feeble the designs of Men are, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the Creator of Man, and how indifferently he dealt betwixt the two
Nations, sometimes giving one, sometimes the other, the advantage; and
yet so that he onely ordered the Battel.</p>

               <p>THE last overthrow of 1588 given to the Invincible Fleet, as they
termed themselves, did so encourage every man to the War, as happy
was he that could put himself into Action against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the Voluntiers that went in this Voyage; which the Queen
(considering the great loss the King of <hi>Spain</hi> received in the year past, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it was to be imagined how weakly he was provided at home) was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to countenance, though she undertook it not wholly her self, which
was the main cause of its ill success and overthrow.</p>
               <p>For whosoever he be of a Subject, that thinks to undertake so great an
Enterprise without a Prince's Purse, shall be deceived; and therefore these
two Generals in my opinion never overshot themselves more, than in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
so great a charge with so little means; for where there are Victuals and
Arms wanting, what hope is there of prevailing?</p>
               <p>The project of this Voyage was to restore a distressed King to his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
usurped as he pretended; and though the means for the setting forth
of this Voyage was not so great as was expedient; yet in the opinion of all
men, if they had directed their course whither they intended it, without
landing at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> they had performed the Service they went for, resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Don Antonio</hi> to the Crown of <hi>Portugal,</hi> dissevered it from <hi>Spain,</hi> and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it in League with <hi>England,</hi> which would have answered the present
charge, and have settled a continual Trade for us to the <hi>West Indies,</hi> and the
rest of the <hi>Portugals</hi> Dominions, for so we might easily have conditioned.</p>
               <p>But the Landing at the <hi>Groyne</hi> was an unnecessary lingering and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the other great and main design, a consuming of Victuals, a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the Army by the immoderate drinking of the Souldiers, which
brought a lamentable Sickness amongst them, a warning to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
strengthen <hi>Portugal,</hi> and (as great as all this) a discouragement to proceed
further being repulsed in the first Attempt.</p>
               <p>But notwithstanding the ill success at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> they departed from
thence towards <hi>Portugal,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Penech,</hi> a Maritine Town twelve
Leagus from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> where with a small resistance they took the Castle, after
the Captain understood <hi>Don Antonio</hi> to be in the Army.</p>
               <p>From thence General <hi>Norris</hi> marched with his Land Forces to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and
Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> with his Fleet sailed to <hi>Caske Cadiz,</hi> promising from thence
to pass with his Ships up the River to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> to meet with Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi>
which yet he did not perform, and therefore was much blamed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
consent of all men, the overthrow of the Action being imputed to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55770:10"/>
It will not excuse Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> for making such a Promise to
Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> though, on the other hand, I would have accused him of
great want of Discretion, if he had put the Fleet to so great an Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to so little purpose: For his being in the Harbor of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> signified
nothing to the Taking of the Castle, which was two Miles from thence;
and had the Castle been taken, the Town would have been taken of
course.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Ships could not furnish the Army with more Men or Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als:
wherefore I understand not in what Respect his going up was necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
and yet the Fleet must have endured many Hazards to this little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>For betwixt <hi>Cask Cadiz</hi> and <hi>Lisbon,</hi> there are three Castles, St. <hi>John,</hi>
St. <hi>Francis,</hi> and <hi>Bellin.</hi> The first of the three, I hold one of the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Forts to Sea-ward in <hi>Europe;</hi> and the Fleet was to pass within
Calliver Shot of this Fort; though I confess, the passing it, was not the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Dander: For with a reasonable Gale of Wind, any Fort is to be passed
with small Hazard.</p>
               <p>But at this time there was a General Want of Victuals; and being once
entred the Harbour, their coming out again was uncertain, the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
subject to contrary Winds: In the mean while, the better part of the
Victuals would have been consumed, and they would have remained there
in so desperate a Condition, as they would have been forced to have fired
one half of the Fleet, for the bringing home of the rest: for being as they
were, yet after the Army was imbarqued for <hi>England,</hi> many died of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
Homeward, and more would have done, if the Wind had took them
short; or, if by the Death of some of them, the rest who survived had not
been the bettr relieved.</p>
               <p>And besides all these Casualties and Dangers, the <hi>Adilantado</hi> was then in
<hi>Lisbon</hi> with the Gallies of <hi>Spain;</hi> and how easily he might have annoyed
our Fleet, by towing Fire-ships amongst us: We may suppose the Hurt we
did the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the Year before in <hi>Cadiz</hi> Road; and greater we had done
them, had we had the Help of Gallies.</p>
               <p>It was a wonder to observe every man's Opinion of this Voyage, as well
those that were Actors in it, as others that staid at Home; some imputing
the Overthrow of it, to the Landing at the <hi>Groyn;</hi> others to the <hi>Portugalls</hi>
failing us of those Helps and Assistances which were promised by <hi>Don An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio;</hi>
and others, to Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s not coming up the River with his
Fleet.</p>
               <p>Though any of these three Reasons may seem probable enough, and the
Landing at the <hi>Groyn,</hi> the chiefest of the three; yet if we weigh truly the
Defect, and where it was, it will appear, that the Action was overthrown
before their setting out from Home, they being too weakly provided of all
things needful for so great an Expedition.</p>
               <p>For when this Voyage was first treated of, the Number of Ships was
nothing equal to the Proportion of Men: Wherefore they were forced to
make Stay of divers <hi>Easterlings</hi> which they met with in our Channel, and
compelled to serve in this Action, for the Transportation of our Souldiers;
and though these Ships were an Ease to our Men, who would have been
otherwise much pestered for want of Room; yet their Victuals were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
augmented; but they were put aboard the Ships, like banished men,
to seek their Fortunes at Sea, it being confessed, that divers of the Ships
had not four days Victuals when they departed from <hi>Plymouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55770:10"/>
Another Impediment to the good Success of this Voyage, was, the want
of Field-Pieces; and this was the main Cause why we failed of taking <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon:</hi>
For the Enemies Strength consisting chiefly in the Castle, and we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
only an Army to countenance us, but no means for Battery, we were
the Loss of the Victory our selves: For it was apparent by Intelligence we
received, that if we had presented them with Battery, they were resolved
to parly, and by Consequence to yield; and this too was made use of by
the <hi>Portugalls,</hi> as a main Reason why they joyned not with us.</p>
               <p>And there is as much to be said on the <hi>Portugalls</hi> behalf, as an Evidence
of their good Will and Favor to us, that though they shewed themselves
forward upon this Occasion, to aid us, yet they opposed not themselves as
Enemies against us: Whereas if they had pursued us in our Retreat from
<hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Cask Cadiz,</hi> our Men being weak, sickly, and wanting Powder,
and Shot, and other Arms, they had in all probability put us to a great
Loss and Disgrace. And if ever <hi>England</hi> have the like Occasion to aid a
Competitor in <hi>Portugal,</hi> we shall questionless, find, that our fair Demean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
and Carriage in this Expedition towards the People of that Countrey,
have gained us great Reconciliation among them, and would be of singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Advantage to us: For the General strictly forbad the Rifling of their
Houses in the Country, and the Suburbs of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which he possess'd, and
commanded, just Payment to be made by the Souldiers for every thing they
took, without Compulsion, or rigorous Usage: And this hath made those
that stood but indifferently affected before, now ready upon the like Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to assist us.</p>

               <p>AS the Fleets of Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> and Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> returned from the
Voyage of <hi>Portugal,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> proceeded upon his, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that Coast,; and meeting with divers of that Fleet, relieved them
with Victuals, who otherwise had perished.</p>
               <p>This Voyage was undertaken at his and his Friends Charge, excepting
the <hi>Victory,</hi> a Ship Royal of the Queen's, which she adventured.</p>
               <p>The Service performed at Sea, was the taking of three <hi>French</hi> Ships of the
League in our Channel, and his encountring upon the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> with
Thirteen Hulks, who made some Resistance. Out of these he took to the
Value of 7000 <hi>l.</hi> in Spices belonging to <hi>Portugal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From thence he crossed over to the Island of <hi>Terceras,</hi> and coming to
<hi>St. Michaels,</hi> with Boats he fetched out two <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships from under the
Castle, which the same Night arrived out of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:55770:11"/>
In this Course, from thence to <hi>Flores,</hi> he took a <hi>Spanish</hi> Ship, laden with
Sugars and Sweet-meats that came from the <hi>Maderas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being at <hi>Flores,</hi> he received Intelligencence of divers <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, which
were in the Road of <hi>Fayal,</hi> whereupon he suddainly made from that Island,
where Captain <hi>Lister</hi> and Captain <hi>Monson</hi> gave a desperate Attempt in
their Boats upon the said Ships; and after along Fight possessed themselves
of one of them of 300 Tuns Burden, carrying Eighteen Pieces of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,
and Fifty Men. This Ship, with one other, came from the <hi>Indies,</hi>
two of the rest out of <hi>Guiney,</hi> and another was Laden with Woad which
that Island affords in great Plenty; who putting from thence to Sea, and
coming to the Island of <hi>Graciosa</hi> after two days Fight, yielded us by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
some Victuals: Off that Island we likewise took a <hi>French</hi> Ship of
the <hi>League,</hi> of 200 Tuns, that came from <hi>New-found-land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards, Sailing to the <hi>Eastward</hi> of the Road of <hi>Terceras,</hi> in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we
beheld 18 Tall Ships of the <hi>Indies,</hi> entring into the said Road, one where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
we after took in her Course to the Coast of <hi>Spain:</hi> She was laden with
Hides, Silver and Cochineal; but coming for <hi>England,</hi> she was cast away upon
the <hi>Monnts Bay</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> being valued at 100000 l.</p>
               <p>Two other Prizes of Sugar we took in our said Course to the Coast of
<hi>Spain,</hi> esteemed each Ship at 7000 l. and one from under the Castle of St.
<hi>Maries</hi> to the same Value.</p>
               <p>There was no Road about those Islands, that could defend their Ships
from our Attempts; yet in the last Assault we gave, which was upon a
Ship of Sugars, we found ill Success, being sharply resisted, and two parts
of our Men slain and hurt: Which Loss was occasioned by Captain <hi>Lister,</hi>
who would not be persuaded from Landing in the View of their
Forts.</p>
               <p>The Service performed by Land, was the taking of the Island of <hi>Fayall,</hi>
some months after the surprizing of those Ships formerly mentioned. The
Castle yielded us 45 Pieces of Ordinance, great and small: We sacked and
spoiled the Town, and after ransomed it, and so departed.</p>
               <p>These Summer Services, and Ships of Sugar, proved not so sweet and
pleasant as the Winter was afterwards sharp and painful: For in our Return
for <hi>England,</hi> we found the Calamity of Famine, the Hazard of Shipwrack,
and the Death of our Men so great, that the like befell not any other Fleet
during the time of the War. All which Disasters must be imputed to Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Lister</hi>'s Rashness, upon whom my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> chiefly relyed,
wanting Experience himself.</p>
               <p>He was the man that advised the sending the Ships of Wine for <hi>England,</hi>
otherwise we had not known the Want of Drink; he was as earnest in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suading
our Landing in the Face of the Fortifications of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> against
all Reason and Sence. As he was rash, so was he valiant; but paid dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for his unadvised Counsel: For he was one of the first hurt, and that
cruelly, in the Attempt of St. <hi>Maries,</hi> and afterward drowned in the Rich
Ship, cast away at <hi>Mounts Bay.</hi>

               <p>FRom the Yeear 1585. untill this present Year 1590. there was the
greatest possibility imaginable of enriching our Nation, by Actions at
Sea, had they been well followed; the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was grown so weak
in Shipping, by the Overthrow he had in 1588, that he could no longer
secure the Trade of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Her Majesty now finding how necessary it was for her to maintain a
Fleet upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coast, as well to hinder the Preparations he might
make against Her, to repair the Disgrace he received in 1588. as also to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept
his Fleets from the <hi>Indies,</hi> by which he grew Great and Migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>She sent this Year 1590. Ten Ships of her own, in two Squadrons; the
one to be Commanded by Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> the other by Sir <hi>Martin For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisher,</hi>
two Gentlemen of tried Experience.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> understanding of this Preparation of hers, sent forth
20 Sail of Ships, under the Command of <hi>Don Alonso de Bassan,</hi> Brother to
the late Famous Marquess of St. <hi>Cruz.</hi> His Charge was to secure home the
<hi>Indian</hi> Fleet and Carrecks.</p>
               <p>But after <hi>Don Alonso</hi> had put off to Sea, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> becoming
better advised, than to adventure 20 of his Ships to 10 of ours, sent for
<hi>Don Alonso</hi> back, and so frustrated the Expectation of our Fleet.</p>
               <p>He likewise made a Dispatch to the <hi>Indies,</hi> commanding the Fleets to
Winter there, rather than to run the hazard of coming Home that Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:
But this proved so great a Hind'rance and Loss to the Merchants of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to be so long without Return of their Goods, that it caused many
to become Bankrupts, in <hi>Sevil</hi> and other places; besides, which was so
great a weakening to their Ships, to Winter in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that many years
hardly sufficed to repair the Damage they received.</p>
               <p>Our Fleet being thus prevented, spent seven months in vain upon the
Coasts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Islands; but in that space, could not possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of one Ship of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and the Carrecks, upon which part of
their Hopes depended, came Home without Sight of the Islands, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
safe at <hi>Lisbon.</hi>

This Voyage was a bare Action at Sea, though they attempted Landing
at <hi>Fayal,</hi> which the Earl of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> the year before had taken and
quitted; but the Castle being re-fortified, they prevailed not in their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize:
And thence forwards the King of <hi>Spain</hi> endeavored to strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
his Coasts, and to encrease in Shipping, as may appear by the next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

               <p>HER Majesty understanding of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleets Wintering in the
<hi>Havana,</hi> and that Necessity would compell them home this Year
1591. she sent a Fleet to the Islands under the Command of the Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Howard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> perceiving her Drift, and being sensible how much
the safety of that Fleet concerned him, caused them to set out thence so
late in the Year, that it endangered the Shipwrack of them all; chosing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to hazard the perishing of Ships, Men and Goods, than their falling
into our Hands.</p>
               <p>He had two Designs in bringing home this Fleet so late: One was, he
thought the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> would have consumed his Victuals, and have
been forced Home. The other, that he might in the mean time furnish
out the great Fleet he was preparing, little inferior to that of 1588. In
the first he found himself deceived: For my Lord was supplied both with
Ships and Victuals out of <hi>England;</hi> and in the second, he was as much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented:
For my Lord of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> who then lay upon the Coast of
<hi>Spain,</hi> had Intelligence of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> putting out to Sea, and adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> thereof, the very Night before they arrived at <hi>Flores,</hi>
where my Lord lay.</p>
               <p>The day after this Intelligence, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was discovered by my
Lord <hi>Thomas,</hi> whom he knew by their Number and Greatness, to be the
Ships of which he had warning; and by that means escaped the Danger
that Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> his Vice-admiral rashly ran into. Upon View
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which were 55 Sail, the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> warily, and like a
discreet General, weighed Anchor, and made Signs to the rest of his Fleet
to do the like, with a purpose to get the Wind of them; but Sir <hi>Richard
Greenvile,</hi> being a stubborn man, and imagining this Fleet to come from
the <hi>Indies,</hi> and not to be the <hi>Armado</hi> of which they were informed, would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55770:12"/>
by no means be persuaded by his Master, or Company to cut his main Sail,
to follow his Admiral; nay, so head-strong and rash he was, that he offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
violence to those that councelled him thereto.</p>
               <p>But the Old Saying, that a wilful man is the Cause of his own Woe, could
not be more truly verified than in him: For when the <hi>Armado</hi> approached
him, and he beheld the Greatness of the Ships, he began to see and repent
of his Folly; and when it was too late, would have freed himself of them,
but in vain: For he was left a Prey to the Enemy, every Ship striving to
be the first should board him.</p>
               <p>This wilful Rashness of Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> made the <hi>Spaniards</hi> triumph as much as
if they had obtained a Signal Victory; it being the first Ship that ever they
took of Her Majesties, and commended to them by some English Fugitives
to be the very best she had; but their Joy continued not long. For they
enjoyed her but five days before she was cast away with many <hi>Spaniards</hi> in
her, upon the Islands of <hi>Tercera.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Commonly one Misfortune is accompanied with another: For the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
Fleet, which my Lord had waited for the whole Summer, the day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this mishap, fell into the Company of this <hi>Spanish Armado:</hi> who, if they
had staid but one day longer, or the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet had come home but one
day sooner, we had possest both them and many millions of Treasure, which
the Sea afterward devoured: For from the time they met with the Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
and before they could recover home, nigh an hundred of them suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Shipwrack, besides the <hi>Ascention</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and the double Fly-boat, that
were sunk by the side of the <hi>Revenge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which was occasioned by their Wintering in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and the late
Disambogueing from thence: For the Worm which that Country, is subject
to, weakens and consumes their Ships.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding this cross and perverse Fortune, which happened by means
of Sir <hi>Richard Greenvile,</hi> the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> would not be dismayed or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
but kept the Sea so long as he had Victuals; and by such Ships
as himself and the rest of the Fleet took, defrayed the better part of the
Charge of the whole Action.</p>

               <p>THE Earl of <hi>Cumberland</hi> keeping the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> as you have
heard, while the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> remained at the Islands, and both to
one end, <hi>viz.</hi> to annoy and damnifie the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though in two several
Fleets, the Earl found Fortune in a sort, as much to frown upon him, as
it had done upon the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:55770:13"/>
In his Course from <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coast, he encountred with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Ships of <hi>Holland,</hi> which came from <hi>Lisbon,</hi> wherein he found a great
quantity of Spices belonging to the <hi>Portugalls:</hi> So greatly were we abused
by that Nation of <hi>Holland,</hi> who, though they were the first that engaged us
in the War with <hi>Spain,</hi> yet still maintained their own Trade into those parts,
and supplied the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with Munition, Victuals Shipping and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
against us.</p>
               <p>Upon my Lord's Arrival on the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> it was his hap to take
three Ships at several times, one with Wine, which he unladed into his
own; and two with Sugars, which he enjoyed not long: no more did he
the Spices, which he took out of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For one of the Ships of Sugar, by means of a Leak that sprung upon her,
was forced to be cast off, and the men, with much difficulty, recovered the
Shore, and saved their Lives.</p>
               <p>The other being sent for <hi>England,</hi> and tossed with contrary Winds, was
for want of Victuals forced into the <hi>Groyn,</hi> where they rend'red themselves
to the Enemies mercy.</p>
               <p>The Spices were determined to be sent for <hi>England,</hi> and a Ship appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for that purpose, with other Ships to guard her; and Captain <hi>Monson</hi>
was sent on Board her to the Islands of the <hi>Burlings,</hi> with a Charge to see
her dispatched for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the other Ships, not observing the Directions which were given them,
and the Night falling calm; early in the Morning, this scattered Ship
was set upon by six Gallies; and after a long and bloody Fight, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
and the Principallest men being slain, both Ship and Spices were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
but whether it was the respect they had to the Queen's Ship which
was Admiral of that Fleet, or Honor to my Lord that commanded it; or
Hope, by good Usage of our men, to receive the like again, I know not;
but true it is, that the ordinary men were treated with more Courtesie than
they had been from the beginning of the Wars.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi> considering the Disasters that thus befell him,
and knowing the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet's readiness to put out of Harbor; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
finding his Ship but ill of Sail, it being the first Voyage she ever went
to Sea, he durst not abide the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> but thought it more Discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to return for <hi>England,</hi> having (as you have heard) sent a Pinnace to
my Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> with the Intelligence aforesaid.</p>

SIR <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> who had tasted abundantly of the Queen's Love,
and found it now began to decline, put himself upon a Voyage at Sea,
and drew unto him divers friends of great Quality, and others, thinking
to have attempted some place in the <hi>West Indies;</hi> and with this resolution
he put out of Harbour; but spending two or three days in fowl Weather,
Her Majesty was pleased to command his Return, and to commit the Charge
of the Ships to Sir <hi>Martin Forbisher,</hi> who was sent down for that purpose;
but with an express Command, not to follow the Design of the <hi>West In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This suddain Alteration being known unto the rest of the Captains,
for the present made some Confusion, as commonly it happens in all vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Actions. Their General leaving them, they thought themselves
free in point of Reputation, and at liberty to take what course they pleased:
Few of them therefore did submit themselves to the Command of Sir <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
Forbisher,</hi> but chose rather each one to take his particular Fortune and
Adventure at Sea.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Martin,</hi> with two or three other Ships, repaired to the Coast of
<hi>Spain,</hi> where he took a <hi>Spaniard</hi> laden with Iron, and a <hi>Portugal</hi> with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:
He remained there not without some danger, his Ship being ill of Sail,
and the Enemy having a Fleet at Sea.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>John Boroughs,</hi> Captain <hi>Cross,</hi> and another, stood to the Islands where
they met with as many Ships of my Lord of <hi>Cumberland</hi>'s, with whom
they consorted. After some time spent thereabouts, they had sight of a
Carreck, which they chased; but she recovered the Island of <hi>Flores</hi> before
they could approach her; but the Carreck, seeing the Islands could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send
her from the Strength and Force of the English, chose rather, after
the men were got on Shore to fire her self, than we the Enemy should reap
Benefit by her.</p>
               <p>The Purser of her was taken, and by Threats compell'd to tell of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their Company behind, that had Order to fall with that Island;
and gave us such particular Advertisement, that indeed she fell to be ours.</p>
               <p>In the mean time <hi>Don Alonso de Bassan</hi> was furnishing at <hi>Lisbon</hi> 23 of those
Gallions, which the Year before he had when he took the <hi>Revenge;</hi> he was
directed with those Ships to go immediately to <hi>Flores,</hi> to expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Carrecks, who had order to fall with that Island, there to put
on Shore divers Ordnance for strength'ning the Town and Castle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Don Alonso</hi> breaking his Directions, unadvisedly made his repair first to
St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and there delivered his Ordnance before he arrived at <hi>Flores;</hi>
and in the mean time one of the Carrecks was burnt, and the other taken,
as you have heard.</p>
               <p>This he held to be such a Disreputation to him, and especially for that it
happened through his own Error and Default, that he became much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd,
and pursued the <hi>English</hi> 100 Leagues; but in vain, they being so
far a Head.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> being advertised of his two Carrecks mishap, and the
Error of <hi>Don Alonso,</hi> though he had much favored him before, in respect
of divers Actions he had been in with his Brother, the Marquess of St. <hi>Cruz,</hi>
and for what he had lately performed, by taking the <hi>Revenge:</hi> Yet—the
King held it for such a Blemish to his Honor, not to have his Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
obeyed; and observed, that he did not only take from <hi>Don Alonso</hi> his
Command; but he lived and died too in Disgrace; which, in my Opinion,
he worthily deserved.</p>
               <p>

The Queens Adventure in this Voyage, was only two Ships; one of
which, and the least of them too, was at the taking of the Carreck; which
title, joyned with her Regal Authority, she made such use of, that the
rest of the Adventurers were fain to submit themselves to her Pleasure, with
whom she dealt but indiffereutly.</p>

through the Negligence, or Unfaithfulness of those who were

the good Success he had the last year, obtained two of her Majesty's Ships,

them; and arriving upon the Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> He took two <hi>French</hi>
Ships of the <hi>League,</hi> which did more than treble the Expence of his Voyage.
My Lord, being one day severed from his Fleet, it was his hap to meet
with 12 Hulks, at the same place where Captain <hi>Monson</hi> was taken the
same day two years before: He required that Respect from them that was
due unto Her Majesties Ship, which they peremptorily refused, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
upon the Strength of their 12 Ships against one only; but they found
themselves deceived: For after two hours Fight he brought them to his
Mercy, and made them acknowledge their Error; and not only so, but
they willingly discovered, and delivered up to him a great quantity of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Munition, which they carried for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Service.</p>

               <p>ABout three years past, <hi>Anno</hi> 1591. the Queen sent Sir <hi>John Norris</hi>
with 3000 Souldiers, to joyn with the <hi>French</hi> King's Party in those
Parts. The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who upheld the Faction of the League, sent
<hi>Don Iohn de Aquila</hi> with the like Forces, to joyn with the Duke <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceur,</hi>
who was of the contrary side. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had fortified themselves
very strongly near the Town of <hi>Brest,</hi> expecting new Succors from <hi>Spain</hi>
by Sea; which the <hi>French</hi> King fearing, craved Assistance from the Queen,
which her Majesty was the more willing to grant, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
had gotten the Haven of <hi>Brest</hi> to entertain their Shipping in, and were like
to prove there very dangerous Neighbors: Wherefore she sent Sir <hi>Martin
Forbisher</hi> thither in this year, 1594, with four of her Ships: And upon his
Arrival there, Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> with his Forces, and Sir <hi>Martin</hi> with his
Seamen, assailed the Fort; and though it was as bravely defended as men
could do; yet in the end it was taken with the loss of divers Captains,
Sir <hi>Martin Forbisher</hi> being himself fore wounded, of which Hurt he died at
<hi>Plymouth</hi> after his return.</p>

               <p>THese two Generals, presuming much upon their own Experience and
Knowledge, used many Persuasions to the Queen, to undertake a
Voyage to the <hi>West Indies,</hi> giving much assurance to perform great Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and promising to engage themselves very deeply therein, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
of both Substance and Life. And as all Actions of this Nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55770:15"/>
fair, till they come to be performed, so did this the more, in the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all Men, in respect of the two Generals Experience.</p>
               <p>There were many Impediments and Letts to this Voyage, before they
could clear themselves of the Coast, which put them to greater Charge
than they expected; the chiefest cause of their Lingring, was a mistrust our
State had of an Invasion, and the Danger to spare so many good Ships
and men out of <hi>England</hi> as they carried with them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> with their usual subtilty, let slip no opportunity to put us
in amazement, thereby to dissolve the Action; and sent four Gallies to
<hi>Bleuret</hi> in <hi>Brittany,</hi> from thence to seize some part of our Coast, that so we
might apprehend a greater Force was to follow. These Gallies landed at
<hi>Pensants</hi> in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> where, finding the Town abandoned, they sack'd
and burnt it; but this Design of theirs took little effect; for the Voyage
proceeded notwithstanding.</p>
               <p>The Intent of the Voyage, was to land at <hi>Nombre de dois,</hi> and from thence
to march to <hi>Panuma,</hi> to possess the Treasure that comes from <hi>Peru;</hi> and if
they saw reason for it, to inhabite and keep it. A few days before their
going from <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they received Letters from her Majesty, of an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement
she had out of <hi>Spain,</hi> that the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet was arrived; and
that one of them, with loss of her Mast, was put room to the Island of
<hi>Porto Ricom.</hi> She commanded them, seeing there was so good an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
offered, as the readiness of this her Fleet, and the weakness of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ricom,</hi> to possess themselves of that Treasure; and the rather, for that
it was not much out of their way to <hi>Nombre de dois.</hi> It is neither Years,
nor Experience, that can foresee and prevent all mishaps; which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Proof, that God is the Guider and Disposer of Mens Actions: For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
could seem more probable to be effected, than this later Design, especially
considering the Ability and Wisdom of the two Generals; and yet was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
prevented, and failed in the Execution: For there being five Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
sent out of <hi>Spain,</hi> to fetch this Treasure from <hi>Porto Ricom,</hi> in their way
it was their hap to take a Pinnace of the English Fleet, by whom they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Secrets of the Voyage; and to prevent the Attempt of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Ricom,</hi> they hastened thither with all speed (whilst our Generals lingred
at <hi>Quadrupa,</hi> to set up their Boats) and at their Arrival, so strengthened
the Town with the Souldiers, brought in the Frigats, that when our Fleet
came thither, not expecting Resistance, they found themselves frustrate of
their Hopes, which indeed they themselves were the occasion of, in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their Design with no more Secresie. This Repulse bred so great a
Disconceit in Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> as it is thought to have hastened his days;
and being great and unexpected, did not a little discourage Sir <hi>Francis
Drake's</hi> great Mind, who yet proceeded upon his first resolved Design, for
<hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> though with no better Success: For the Enemy having
knowledge of their coming, fortified the Passage to <hi>Panuma,</hi> and forced
them to return with loss. Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> who was wont to rule For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
now finding his Error, and the difference between the present strength
of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and what it was when he first knew it, grew melancholly
upon this Disappointment, and suddenly, and I hope naturally, died at
<hi>Nombre de dios,</hi> where he got his first Reputation. The two Generals dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and all other Hopes being taken away by their Deaths, Sir <hi>Thomas
Baskervile</hi> succeeded them in their Command, and began now to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his return for <hi>England;</hi> but coming near <hi>Cuba,</hi> he met and fought with
a Fleet of <hi>Spain,</hi> though not long, by reason of the Sickness and Weakness
of his Men. This Fleet was sent to take the Advantage of ours in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55770:15"/>
thinking, as indeed it happened, that they should find them both weak,
and in want; but the swiftness of our Ships, in which we had the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> preserved us. You may observe, that from the year
the <hi>Revenge</hi> was taken, untill this present year 1595. there was no Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> furnished a Fleet for the guarding of his Coasts,
and securing of his Trade; and though there was little fear of any Fleet
from <hi>England</hi> to impeach him, besides this in the <hi>Indies;</hi> yet because he
would shew his greatness, and satisfie the <hi>Portugal</hi> of the care he had in
preserving their Carrecks; he sent the Count of <hi>Feria,</hi> a young Nobleman
of <hi>Portugal,</hi> who desired to gain Experience, with 20 Ships to the Islands;
but the Carrecks did, as they used to do in many other years, miss both
Islands and Fleets, and arrived at <hi>Lisbon</hi> safely. The other Fleets of the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> consisted of 24 Ships, their General <hi>Don Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardino
de Villa nova,</hi> an approved Coward, as it appeared when he came
to encounter the <hi>English</hi> Fleet; but his Defects were supplied by the Valor
of his Vice-admiral, who behaved himself much to his Honor: His Name
was <hi>John Garanay.</hi>

               <p>THE first of <hi>June</hi> 1596. we departed from <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and our Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was the more speedy, by reason of the great pains, care and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
of the 16 Captains, who in their own Persons, labored the Night
before, to get out some of their Ships, riding at <hi>Catwater,</hi> which otherwise
had not been easily effected. The Third, we set Sail from <hi>Cansom Bay,</hi> the
Wind, which when we weighed, was at <hi>West</hi> and by <hi>South,</hi> instantly cast
up to the <hi>North East,</hi> and so continued untill it brought us up as high as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55770:16"/>
the <hi>North Cape</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and this fortunate beginning put us in great hopes
of a lucky Success to ensue.</p>
               <p>We being now come upon our Enemies Coast, it behoved the Generals
to be vigilant in keeping them from Intelligence of us, who therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the <hi>Litness,</hi> the <hi>True Love,</hi> and the <hi>Lion's Whelp</hi> (the three chief
Sailors of our Fleet) to run a Head, suspecting the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had some Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
of Advice out, which they did usually send to discover at Sea, upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Rumor of a less Fleet than this, was made ready in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No Ship or Carvel escaped from us, which I hold a second Happiness to
our Voyage: For you shall understand hereafter, the Inconvenience that
might have happened upon our Discovery.</p>
               <p>The <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the said three Ships, took three Fly-Boats that came
from <hi>Cadiz</hi> 14 days before; by them we understood the State of the Town,
and that they had no suspition of us, which we looked on as a third <hi>Omen</hi> of
our good Fortune to come.</p>
               <p>The <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> a Ship of <hi>London,</hi> being commanded, as the
other three, to keep a good way off the Fleet, to prevent discovery, she
met with a Fly-boat, which made Resistance, and escaped from her. This
Fly-boat came from the <hi>Streights,</hi> bound Home, who discovering our Fleet,
and thinking to gain Reputation and Reward from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> shhaped
her Course for <hi>Lisbon;</hi> but she was luckily prevented by the <hi>John</hi> and
<hi>Francis,</hi> another Ship of <hi>London,</hi> commanded by Sir <hi>Marmaduke Darrel,</hi>
who took her within a League of the Shore; and this we may account a
fourth Happiness to our Voyage. The first (as hath been said) was for the
Wind to take us so suddainly, and to continue so long: For our Souldiers
being Shipped, and in Harbor, would have consumed their Victuals, and
have been so pester'd, that it would have endangered a Sickness amongst
them. The Second, was the taking all Ships that were seen, which kept
the Enemy from Intelligence. The Third, was the intercepting of the Fly-Boats
from <hi>Cadiz,</hi> whither we were bound, who assured us, our coming
was not suspected, which made us more careful to hail from the Coast than
otherwise we should have been: They told us likewise of the daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of the Gallions to come from St. <hi>Jacar</hi> to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and of the Merchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
that lay there, and were ready bound for the <hi>Indies.</hi> These Intelligences
were of great moment, and made the Generals presently to contrive their
business both by Sea and Land, which otherwise would have taken up a
longer time, after their coming thither, and whether all men would have
consented to attempt their Ships in Harbor, if they had not known the most
part of them to consist of Merchants, I hold very doubtful. The Fourth,
and fortunatest of all, was the taking of the Fly-boat by the <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi>
which the <hi>Swan</hi> let go: For if she had reached <hi>Lisbon,</hi> she had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make report of the number and greatness of our Ships, and might
have endangered the loss of the whole Design, she seeing the course we
bore, and that we had passed <hi>Lisbon,</hi> which was the place the Enemy most
suspected, and made there his greatest preparation for Defence: But had the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
been freed of that doubt, he had then no place to fear but <hi>Andulozia</hi>
and <hi>Cadiz</hi> above the rest, which upon the lest warning might have been
strengthned, and we put to great Hazard; he might also have secured his
Ships, by towing them out with Gallies; and howsoever the Wind had
been, might have sent them into the <hi>Streights,</hi> where it had been in vain
to have pursued them, or over the Bar of St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> where it had been in
vain to have attempted them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:55770:16"/>
And indeed, of the good and ill of Intelligence, we had had sufficient
experience formerly, Of the good in 1588. For how suddainly had we
been taken and surprized when it we lest suspected, had it not been for
Captain <hi>Flemming?</hi> Of the ill in the year before this, by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Barque of Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi>'s Fleet, which was the Occasion of the
Overthrow of himself and the whole Action?</p>
               <p>The <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> we came to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> earlier in the morning than the
Masters made reckoning of. Before our coming thither, it was determined
in Council, that we should land at St. <hi>Sebastians,</hi> the Westermost part of
the Land; and thither came all the Ships to an Anchor, every man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
to land as he was formerly directed; but the Wind being so great,
and the Sea so grown, and four Gallies lying too, to intercept our Boats,
there was no attempting to land there, without the hazard of all.</p>
               <p>This day was spent in vain, in returning Messengers from one General to
another; and in the end, they were forced to resolve upon a Course which
Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> Captain under my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> advised him to, the
same morning he discovered the Town; which was to surprize the Ships,
and to be possessors of the Harbor before they attempted landing.</p>
               <p>This being now resolved on, there arose a great Question, who should
have the Honor of the first going in? My Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> stood for himself;
but my Lord Admiral opposed it, knowing if he miscarried, it would ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
the Overthrow of the Action; besides, he was streightly charged by
Her Majesty, that the Earl should not expose himself to Danger, but upon
great necessity.</p>
               <p>When my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> could not prevail, the whole Council withstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him he sent Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> that night, on Board my Lord Admiral,
to resolve what Ships should be appointed the next day to undertake the
Service. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> had the <hi>Vaward</hi> given him, which my Lord
<hi>Thomas Howard</hi> hearing, challenged in right of his place of Vice-admiral,
and it was granted him; but Sir <hi>Walter</hi> having Order over night to ply in,
came first to an Anchor; but in that distance from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as he could
not annoy them: And he himself returned on Board the Lord General <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sex,</hi>
to excuse his coming to Anchor so far off, for want of Water to go
higher; which was thought strange, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which drew much
more Water, and had no more Advantage than he of Tide, could pass
where his could not: But Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> in the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to second him, passing by Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> his Ship, Sir <hi>Walter</hi>
the second time, weighed and went higher. The Lord General <hi>Essex,</hi> who
promised to keep in the midst of the Fleet, was told by Sir <hi>William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
that the greatest Service would depend upon three or four Ships; and
Sir <hi>William</hi> put him in mind of his Honor; for that many Eyes beheld
him.</p>
               <p>This made him forgetful of his Promise, and to use all means he could
to be formost in the Fight. My Lord <hi>Howard,</hi> who could not go up in his
own Ship, the <hi>Mere honor,</hi> betook himself to the <hi>Nonperil;</hi> and in respect
the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> the <hi>Repulse</hi> and <hi>Warspight,</hi> had taken up the best of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
by their first coming to an Anchor, to his grief he could not get high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
Here did every Ship strive to be the headmost; but such was the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowness
of the Channel, as neither the Lord Admiral, nor any other Ship
of the Queens could pass on. There was Commandment given, that no
Ship should shoot but the Queens, making account, that the Honor would
be the greater, if the Victory were obtained with so few. This Fight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
from Ten, till Four in the Afternoon: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> then set Sail,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55770:17"/>
thinking either to run higher up the River, or else to bring their other
Broad Sides to us, because of the heat of their Ordnance; but howsoever
it was, in their floating, they came a ground, and the men began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
the Ships: Whereupon there was Commandment given, that all the
Hoys, and Vessels that drew least Water should go unto them. Sir <hi>William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
was sent in the <hi>Repulse</hi> Boat, with like directions. We possess'd our selves of
the great Gallions, the <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the <hi>Andrew;</hi> but the <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi>
fired themselves, and were burnt down before they could be quenched.</p>
               <p>I must not omit to describe the manner of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships and Gallies,
riding in Harbor at our first coming to <hi>Cadiz.</hi> The four Gallions singled
themselves from out the Fleet, as Guards of their Merchants. The Gallies
were placed to flank us with their Prows before Entry; but when they
saw our Approach, the next morning the Merchants ran up the River, and
the Men of War of <hi>Port Royal</hi> to the Point of the River, brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into a good Order of Fight, moving their Ships a Head and a Stern,
to have their Broad Sides upon us. The Gallies then betook themselves to
the Guard of the Town, which we put them from before we attempted
the Ships.</p>
               <p>The Victory being obtained at Sea, the L. General <hi>Essex</hi> landed his men in
a Sandy Bay, which the Castle of <hi>Poyntull</hi> commanded; but they seeing the
Success of their Ships, and mistrusting their own strength, neither offered
to offend his Landing, nor to defend the Castle; but quitted it, and so
we became Possessors of it.</p>
               <p>After my Lord's peeceable Landing, he considered what was to be done;
and there being no place from whence the Enemy could annoy us, but the
Bridge of <hi>Swasoe,</hi> which leadeth over from the main Land to the Island; by
our making good of which Bridge, there would be no way left for the
Gallies to escape us. He sent three Regiments under the Command of Sir <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niers
Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Garret</hi> to the Bridge;
who at their first coming were encountred by the Enemy, but yet possess'd
themselves of it, with the loss of some men; but whether it was for want
of Victuals, or for what other reasons, our men quitted it, I know not,
and the Gallies breaking down divers Arches pass'd it, and by that means
escaped.</p>
               <p>My Lord dispatched a Messenger to my Lord Admiral, intreating him
to give Order to attempt the Merchants that rode in <hi>Port Royal,</hi> for that
it was dangerous to give them a Night's respite, lest they should convey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
their Wealth, or take example by the <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> to burn
themselves. This Message was delivered by Sir <hi>Anthony Ashley,</hi> and Sir
<hi>William Monson,</hi> as my Lord Admiral was in his Boat, ready with his Toops
of Seamen to land, fearing the Lord General <hi>Essex</hi> should be put to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
with his small Companies, which were but three Regiments, hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by all means to second him, and gave order to certain Ships the next
day to pursue him.</p>
               <p>Seeing I have undertaken to shew the Escapes committed in any of our
<hi>English</hi> Voyages, such as were committed here, shall without Fear or Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
appear to the Judicious Reader.</p>
               <p>Though the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> his Carriage and Forwardness merited much,
yet if it had been with more Advisement, and less Haste, it would have
succeeded better: And if he were now living, he would confess, Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Monson</hi> advised him, rather to seek to be Master to the Ships, than of
the Town; for it was that would afford both Wealth and Honor: For the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55770:17"/>
Riches in Ships could not be concealed, or conveyed away as in Towns
they might. And the Ships themselves being brought for <hi>England,</hi> would
be always before mens Eyes there, and put them in remembrance of the
greatness of the Exploit; as for the Town, perhaps it might be soon won,
but probably not long enjoyed, and so quickly forgotten: And to
speak indifferentiy, by the Earl's suddain Landing, without the
Lord Admirals Privity; and his giving Advice by a Message to attempt the
Ships, which should have been resolved of upon mature Deliberation, no
doubt, the Lord Admiral found his Honor a little Eclipsed, which perhaps
hastened his Landing for his Reputation sake, whenas he thought it more
advisable to have possess'd himself of their Fleet.</p>
               <p>Before the Lord Admiral could draw near the Town, the Earl of <hi>Essex</hi>
had entred it; and although the Houses were built in that manner, as that
every House served for a Platform; yet they were forc'd to quit them, and
to retire into the Castle.</p>
               <p>My Lord at last, in despite of the Enemy, gained the Market place, where
he found greatest Resistance from the Houses thereabouts; and where it
was that that Worthy Gentleman Sir <hi>John Wingfield</hi> was unluckily slain.
The Lord General <hi>Essex</hi> caused it to be proclaimed by Beat of Drum through
the Town, that all that would yield, should repair to the Town-House,
where they should have promise of Mercy, and those that would not, to
expect no Favor. The Castle desired Respite to consider untill the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
following; and then by one general Consent, they surrend'red them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the two Lord Generals Mercies. The Chief Prisoners, Men and
Women, were brought into the Castle, where they remained a little space,
and were sent away with Honorable Usage. The noble treating of the
Prisoners, hath gained an everlasting Honor to our Nation, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's
in particular.</p>
               <p>It cannot be supposed the Lord Generals had leisure to be idle the day
following, having so great business to consider of, as the securing the Town,
and enjoying the Merchants Ships: Wherefore, for the speedier dispatch,
they had Speech with the best men of the City, about the Ransom to be
given for their Town and Liberties, 120000 Duckets was the Summ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
on; and for Security thereof, many of them became Hostages. There
was likewise an Overture for the Ransom of their Ships and Goods, which
the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> hearing of, rather than we should reap any profit by
them, he caused them to be fired.</p>
               <p>We found by Experience, that the destroying of this Fleet (which did
amount to the value of six or seven Millions) was the general impoverishing
of the whole Country: For when the Pledges sent to <hi>Sevil,</hi> to take up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
for their Redemption; they were answered, that all the Town was not
able to raise such a Summ, their Loss was so great by the loss of their Fleet.
And to speak truth, <hi>Spain</hi> never received so great an Overthrow, so great a
Spoil, so great an Indignity at our Hands as this: For our Attempt was at
his own Home, in his Port, that he thought as safe as his Chamber, where
we took and destroy'd his Ships of War, burnt and consumed the Wealth
of his Merchants, sack'd his City, ransomed his Subjects, and entred his
Country without Impeachment.</p>
               <p>To write all Accidents of this Voyage, were too tedious, and would
weary the Reader; but he that would desire to know the Behavior of the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> as well as of us, many confer with divers <hi>English</hi> men that were
redeemed out the Gallies in exchange for others, and brought into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:55770:18"/>
After we had enjoyed the Town of <hi>Cadiz</hi> a Fortnight, and our men
were grown rich by the Spoil of it, the Generals imbarqued their Army,
with an intent to perform greater Services before their Return; but such
was the Covetousness of the better Sort, who were inriched there, and
the fear of Hunger in others, who complained for want of Victuals, as they
could not willingly be drawn to any farther Action, to gain more Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.
The only thing that was afterwards attempted, was <hi>Pharoah,</hi> a
Town of <hi>Algarula</hi> in <hi>Portugal,</hi> a place of no Resistance or Wealth, only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
by the Library of <hi>Osorius,</hi> who was Bishop of that place; which Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
was brought into <hi>England</hi> by us, and many of the Books bestowed
upon the new erected Library of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Prisoners were taken; but of small account, who told us, that the
greatest Strength of the Country was in <hi>Lawgust,</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Arga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula,</hi>
twelve miles distant from thence; because most part of the Gentlemen
thereabouts were gone thither, to make it good expecting our coming. This
News was acceptable to my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who preferred Honor before
Wealth: And having had his Will, and the Spoil of the Town of <hi>Pharoah</hi>
and Country thereabouts: He Shipped his Army, and took Council of the
Lord Admiral how to proceed. My Lord Admiral diverted his course for
<hi>Lawgust,</hi> alleadging the place was strong, of no Wealth, always held in the
nature of a Fisher-Town, belonging to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> who in their Hearts were
our Friends; that the winning of it, after so eminent a place as <hi>Cadiz,</hi>
could add no Honor; though it should be carried, yet it would be the
Loss of his best Troops and Gentlemen, who would rather to die, than
receive Indignity of a Repulse. My Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> much against his Will,
was forc'd to yield unto these Reasons, and desist from that Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise.</p>
               <p>About this time there was a general Complaint for want of Victuals;
which proceeded rather out of a desire that some had to be at home, than out
of any necessity: For Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> and Mr. <hi>Darrel,</hi> were appointed
to examine the Condition of every Ship, and found seven weeks Victuals
(Drink excepted) which might have been supplied from the Shore in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and this put the Generals in great hope to perform something more
than they had done. The only Service that was now to be thought on,
was to lie in wait for the Carrecks, which in all probability could not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape
us, though there were many Doubts to the contrary; but easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by men of Experience: But in truth, some mens desires home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
were so great, that no Reason could prevail with, or persuade
them.</p>
               <p>Coming into the height of the Rock, the Generals took Council once
again, and then the Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> offered
with great earnestness, to stay out the time our Victuals lasted; and desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to have but 12 Ships furnished out of the rest to stay with them; but
this would not be granted, though the Squadron of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
voluntarily to stay. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> alleadged the scarcity of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals,
and the Infection of his Men. My Lord General <hi>Essex,</hi> offered, in
the Greatness of his Mind, and the Desire he had to stay, to supply
his want of Men and Victuals, and to exchange Ships; but all Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
were in vain: For the Riches kept them that got much, from attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more; as if it had been otherwise pure want, though not Honor would
have enforced them to greater Enterprises.</p>
               <p>This being the last Hopes of the Voyage, and being generally withstood,
it was concluded to steer away for the <hi>North Cape,</hi> and afterwards, to view
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55770:18"/>
and search the Harbors of the <hi>Groyn</hi> and <hi>Ferrol;</hi> and if any of the King
of <hi>Spain's</hi> Ships chanced to be there, to give an Attempt upon them.</p>
               <p>The Lord Admiral sent a Carvel of our Fleet into these two Harbors,
and aparrelled the men in <hi>Spanish</hi> Cloaths, to avoid Suspicion. This Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
returned the next day, with a true Relation, that there were no Ships
in the Harbors: And now passing all places where there was any hope of
doing good, our Return for <hi>England</hi> was resolved upon; and the 8th. of
<hi>August,</hi> the Lord Admiral arrived in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> with the greatest part of
the Army: And the Lord General <hi>Essex,</hi> who staid to accompany the St.
<hi>Andrew,</hi> which was under his Charge, and reputed of his Squadron, two
days after us, the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> where he found the Army in that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Health, as the like hath not been seen, for so many to go out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to such great Enterprises, and so well to return home again.</p>
               <p>He himself rid up to the Court, to advise with her Majesty, about the
winning of <hi>Callis,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took the <hi>Easter</hi> before: Here was a
good opportunity, to have re-gained the Ancient Patrimony of <hi>England;</hi>
but the <hi>French</hi> King, thought he might with more ease re-gain it from the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> who was his Enemy, than recover it again from us, who were his
Friends.</p>
               <p>My Lord Admiral, with the Fleet, went to the <hi>Downs,</hi> where he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and left the Charge of the Navy, to Sir <hi>Robert Dudley,</hi> and Sir <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Monson.</hi> In going from thence to <hi>Chatham,</hi> they endured more foul
Weather, and contrary Winds, than in the whole Voyage besides.</p>

               <p>HER Majesty having Knowledge of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s drawing down
his Fleet and Army to the <hi>Groyn</hi> and <hi>Ferrol,</hi> with an intent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into some Action against Her; and that, notwithstanding the loss of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55770:19"/>
thirty six Sail of his Ships that were cast away upon the <hi>North Cape,</hi> in their
coming thither: He prepared with all possible means, to revenge the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces
we did him the year last past at <hi>Cadiz.</hi> Her Majesty likewise prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to defend her self, and fitted out the most part of her Ships for the Sea;
but at length, perceiving his Drift was more to afright than offend her,
though he gave it it out otherwise, because she should provide to resist him
at home, rather than to annoy him abroad. She was unwilling the great
Charges she had been at, should be bestowed in vain; and therefore turned
her Preparations another way, than that for which she first intended
them.</p>
               <p>The Project of this Voyage, was to assault the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Shipping
in the Harbor of <hi>Ferrol,</hi> which the Queen chiefly desired to do for her
own Security at home; and afterwards to go and take the Islands of <hi>Terce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi>
and there to expect the coming home of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet. But neither
of these two Designs took that effect which was expected: For in our set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth, the same day we put to Sea, we were taken with a most violent
Storm, and contrary Winds; and the General was seperated from the Fleet,
and one Ship from another, so that the one half of the Fleet were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to return home, and the rest that kept the Sea, having reached the
Coast of <hi>Spain,</hi> were commanded home, by order of the Lord General.</p>
               <p>Thus after their return, they were to advise upon a new Voyage, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by their Ships and Victuals, they were unable to perform the former:
Whereupon it was thought convenient all the Army should be discharged,
for the prolonging of the Victuals, except a thousand of the prime Souldiers
of the Low Countries, which were put into her Majesties Ships, that they
might be the better prepared, if they should chance to encounter the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Elect. Thus the second time they departed <hi>England,</hi> though not
without some danger of the Ships, by reason of the Winter's near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
               <p>The first Land in <hi>Spain</hi> we fell withal, was the <hi>North Cape,</hi> the place
whither our Directions led us, if we happened to lose Company; being
there descried from the Shore, and not above 12 Leagues from the <hi>Groyn,</hi>
where the <hi>Spanish Armado</hi> lay. We were in good hopes to have enticed
them out of the Harbor to fight us; but spending some time thereabouts,
and finding no such Disposition in them, it was thought fit no longer to
linger about that Coast, lest we should lose our opportunity upon the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Fleet; therefore every Captain received his Directions to stand his
Course into 36 Degrees, there to spread our selves <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a heighth that commonly the <hi>Spaniards</hi> sail in from the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At this time the Lord General complained of a Leak in his Ship; and
two days after, towards midnight, he brought himself upon the Lee to stop
it. Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and some other Ships, being a head the Fleet,
and it growing dark, they could not discern the Lord General's Working;
but stood their Course as before directed; and through this unadvised
working of my Lord, they lost him and his Fleet.</p>
               <p>The day following, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> was informed by a Pinnace he
met, that the great <hi>Armado,</hi> which we supposed to be in the <hi>Groyn</hi> and
<hi>Ferrol,</hi> was gone to the Islands, for the Guard of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet. This
Pinnace, with this Intelligence it gave us, Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sent to look out the General. My Lord had no sooner received this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
but at the very instant he directed his Course to the Islands, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
some small Vessels to Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> to inform him of the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
Alteration of his Course, upon the News received from him, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55770:19"/>
him with all Expedition, to repair to <hi>Flores,</hi> where he would not fail
to be at our Arrival. At the Islands we found this Intelligence utterly
False: For neither the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships were there, nor were expected there:
We met likewise with divers <hi>English</hi> men, that came out of the <hi>Indies;</hi> but
they could give us no assurance of the coming home of the Fleet; neither
could we recive any Advertisement from the Shore, which made us half in
despair of them.</p>
               <p>By that time we had watered our Ships, and refreshed our selves at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> arrived there, who was willed by the Lord Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
after he was furnished of such Wants as that poor Island afforded, to
make his repair to the Island of <hi>Fayal,</hi> which my Lord intended to take.
Here grew great Questions and Heart-burnings against Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh:</hi>
For he coming to <hi>Fayal,</hi> and missing the Lord General, and yet knowing
my Lord's Resolution to take the Island, he held it more advisable to land
with those Forces he had, than to expect the coming of my Lord: For in
that space the Island might be better provided: whereupon he landed, and
took it before my Lord's approach. This Act was held such an Indignity
to my Lord, and urged with that Vehemence, by those that hated Sir <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
that if my Lord, though naturally kind, and flexible, had not feared
how it would have been taken in <hi>England,</hi> I think Sir <hi>Walter</hi> had smarted
for it.</p>
               <p>From this Island we went to <hi>Graciosa,</hi> which did willingly relieve our
Wants, as far as it could; yet with humble intreaty to forbear landing with
our Army, especially, because they understood there was a Squadron of
<hi>Hollanders</hi> amongst us, who did not use to forbear Cruelty wherever they
came; and here it was that we met the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, which in manner
following, unluckily escaped us.</p>
               <p>The Lord General having sent some men of good Account into the Island,
to see there should be no Injury offered to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> he having passed
his word to the contrary; those men advertised him of four Sail of Ships
descried from the Shore, and one of them greater than the rest, seemed to
be a Carreck: My Lord received this News with great Joy, and divided
his Fleet into three Squadrons, to be commanded by himself, the Lord
<hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh.</hi> The next Ship to my Lord, of
the Queen's, was the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> went, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
direction from my Lord to steer away <hi>South</hi> that Night; and if he
should meet with any Fleet, to follow them, carrying Lights, or shooting
off his Ordnances or making any other Sign that he could; and if he met
with no Ships, to direct his Course the next day, to the Island of St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael;</hi>
but promising that Night to send 12 Ships after him. Sir <hi>William</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought
my Lord, by the Pinnace that brought him this Direction, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all things he should have a care to dispatch a Squadron to the Road
of <hi>Angra</hi> in the <hi>Tercera's:</hi> For it was certain, if they were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> thither
they would resort.</p>
               <p>Whilst my Lord was thus contriving his Business, and ordering his Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons,
a small Barque of his Fleet happened to come, to him, who assured
him, that those Ships discovered from the Land, were of his own Fleet;
and that they came in immediately from them. This made my Lord coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand
his former Direction; only Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> who was the next
Ship to him, and received the first Command, could not be recalled back.
Within three hours of his Departure from my Lord, which might be about
12 of the Clock, he fell in company of a Fleet of 25 Sail, which at the first
he could not assure himself to be <hi>Spaniards;</hi> because the day before, that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55770:20"/>
number of Ships was missing from our Fleet. Here he was in a <hi>Dilemma</hi>
and great perplexity with himself; for in making Signs, as he was directed,
if the Ships proved <hi>English,</hi> it were ridiculous, and he would be exposed
to scorn; and to respite it untill morning, were as dangerous, if they
were the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet: For then my Lord might be out of View, or of
the hearing of his Ordnance: Therefore he resolved rather to put his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
than his Ship in Peril. He commanded his Master to keep the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-Gage
of the Fleet, whatsoever should become of him; and it blowing
little Wind, he betook himself to his Boat, and rowed up with the Fleet,
demanding of whence they were: They answered, of <hi>Sevil</hi> in <hi>Spain;</hi> and
asked of whence he was? He told them of <hi>England;</hi> and that the Ship in
fight was a Gallion of the Queen's of <hi>England,</hi> single and alone, alleadging
the Honor they would get by winning her; his Drift being to draw and entice
them into the Wake of our Fleet, where they would be so entangled, as
they could not escape; they returned him some Shot, and ill Language;
but would not alter their Course to the <hi>Tercera's,</hi> whither they were bound,
and where they arrived to our misfortune. Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> returned
aboard his Ship, making Signs with Lights, and Report with his Ordnance;
but all in vain: For my Lord altering his Course, as you have heard, stood
that Night to St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and passed by the North side of <hi>Tercera,</hi> a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way, than if he had gone by the way of <hi>Augra,</hi> where he had met
the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet.</p>
               <p>When day appeared, and Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> was in hope to find the
12 Ships promised to be sent to him, he might discern the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet two
miles and a little more a Head him, and a Stern him a Gallion, and a Pinnace
betwixt them; which putting forth her Flaggs, he knew to be the Earl of
<hi>Southampton</hi> in the <hi>Garland:</hi> The Pinnace was a Frigat of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet,
who took the <hi>Garland</hi> and the <hi>Rainbow</hi> to be Gallions of theirs; but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Flag of the <hi>Garland,</hi> she found her Error, and sprang a loof, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ink
to escape; but the Earl pursued her with the loss of some Time, when
he should have followed the Fleet; and therefore was desired to desist
from that Chase by Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> who sent his Boat to him. By a
Shot from my Lord, this Frigat was surk; and while his Men were rifling
her, Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> and Sir <hi>William Brook</hi> came up in their two Ships, who
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have made us believe were two Gallions of theirs; and
so much did my Lord signifie to Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> wishing him to stay
their coming up: for that there would be greater hope of those two Ships,
which there was no doubt but we were able to Master, than of the Fleet,
for which we were too weak.</p>
               <p>But after Sir <hi>William</hi> had made the two Ships to be the Queen's, which
he ever suspected them to be, he began to pursue the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet afresh;
but by reason they were so far a Head of him, and had so little way to sail,
they recovered the Road of <hi>Tercera;</hi> but he and the rest of the Ships pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued
them, and himself led the way into the Harbor, where he found sharp
Resistance from the Castle; but yet so battered the Ships, that he might see the
Masts of some shot by the Board, and the men quit the Ships; so that there
wanted nothing but a Gale of Wind to enable him to cut the Cables of the
Hawsers, and to bring them off: Wherefore he sent to the other 3 great Ships
of ours, to desire them to attempt the cutting their Cables; but Sir <hi>Fra. Vere</hi>
rather wished his coming off, that they might take a Resolution what to do.
This must be rather imputed to want of Experience than Backwardness in
him: For Sir <hi>William</hi> sent him word, that if he quitted the Harbor, the
Ships would tow near the Castle; and as the Night drew on, the Wind
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55770:20"/>
would freshen, and come more off the Land, which indeed proved so, and
we above a League from the Road in the morning.</p>
               <p>We may say, and that truly, there was never that possibility to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
the State of <hi>Spain</hi> as now: For every Royal of Plate we had taken in
this Fleet, had been two to them, by our converting it by War upon
them.</p>
               <p>None of the Captains could be blamed in this Business: All is to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the want of Experience in my Lord, and his flexible Nature to
be over-ruled: For the first hour he anchored at <hi>Flores,</hi> and called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> advised him upon the reason following, after his
Watering, to run <hi>West,</hi> spreading his Fleet <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> so far as the
<hi>Eastern</hi> Wind that then blew would carry them; alleadging, that if the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi>
Fleet came home that Year, by computation of the last light Moon,
from which time their disimboguing in the <hi>Indies,</hi> must be reckoned, they
could not be above 200 Leagues short of that Island; and whensoever the
Wind should chop up <hi>Westernly,</hi> he bearing a slack Sail, they would, in a
few days overtake him.</p>
               <p>This Advice my Lord seemed to take, but was diverted by divers Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
who coming principally for Land Service, found themselves tired
by the tediousness of the Sea. Certain it is, if my Lord had followed his
Advice, within less than 40 hours, he had made the Queen owner of that
Fleet: For by the Pilot's Card, which was taken in the Frigat, the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Fleet was but 50 Leagues in traverse with that <hi>Eastern</hi> Wind, when my
Lord was at <hi>Flores,</hi> which made my Lord wish, the first time Sir <hi>William
Monson</hi> repaired to him, after the Escape of the Fleet, that he had lost his
Hand so he had been ruled by him.</p>
               <p>Being met Aboard Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> we consulted what to do, and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to acquaint my Lord with what had happened, desiring his Presence
with us, to see if there were any possibility to attempt the Shipping, or
surprize the Island, and so to possess the Treasure.</p>
               <p>My Lord received this Advertisement, just as he was ready with his
Troops to have landed in St. <hi>Michaels;</hi> but this Message diverted his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and made him presently cast about for the Islands of the <hi>Tercera's,</hi>
where we lay all this while expecting his coming. In his Course from St.
<hi>Michaels,</hi> it was his hap to to take three Ships that departed the <hi>Havana</hi>
the day after the Fleet: Which three Ships did more than countervail the
whole Voyage.</p>
               <p>At my Lord's meeting with us at <hi>Tercera,</hi> there was a Consultation how
the Enemies Ships might be fetched off, or destroyed as they lay; but all
men with one consent, agreed the impossibility of it. The attempting the
Island was propounded; but withstood for these reasons, the difficulty in
Landing, the strength of the Island, which was increased by fourteen or
fifteen Hundred Souldiers in the Ships, and our want of Victuals to abide
by the Siege. Seeing then we were frustrate of our Hopes at the <hi>Tercera,</hi>
we resolved upon landing in St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and arrived the day following at
<hi>Punta Delgada,</hi> the Chief City. Here my Lord imbarqued his small Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in Boats, with offer to Land; and having thereby drawn the Enemies
greatest Force thither to resist him, suddainly he rowed to <hi>Villa Franca,</hi>
three or four Leagues distant from thence; which, not being defended by
the Enemy, he took. The Ships had order to abide in the Road of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gada;</hi>
for that my Lord made account to march thither by Land; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on Shore at <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> he was informed that the March was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by reason of the high and craggy Mountains, which diverted his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55770:21"/>
Victuals now grew short with us, and my Lord General began discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to foresee the danger in abiding towards Winter upon these Coasts,
which could not afford him an Harbor, only open Roads that were subject
to <hi>Southern</hi> Winds; and upon every such Wind, he must put to Sea for
his safety. He considered, that if this should happen, when his Troops
were on Shore, and he not able to reach the Land in a Fortnight or more,
which is a thing ordinary, what a desperate case he should put himself into,
especially in so great a want of Victuals: And so concluding, that he had
seen the end of all his Hopes, by the Escape of the Fleet, he imbarqued
himself and Army, though with some difficulty, the Seas were now grown
so high.</p>
               <p>By this time the one half of the Fleet that rid in <hi>Punta Delgada,</hi> put
room for <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and those that remained behind, being thought by
a Ship of <hi>Brazile</hi> to be the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, she came in amongst them, and
so was betrayed: After her there followed a Carreck, who had been serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the like manner; but for the hasty and indiscreet weighing of a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi>
which made her run a Shore under the Castle; when the Wind
lessened Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> weighed with the <hi>Rainbow,</hi> thinking to give
an Attempt upon her, notwithstanding the Castle; which she perceiving,
as he drew near unto her, she set her self on fire, and burned down to the
very Keel. She was a Ship of 1400 Tuns Burden, that the year before
was not able to double the Cape of <hi>bona Esperansa,</hi> in her Voyage to the
<hi>East Indies;</hi> but put into <hi>Brazile,</hi> where she was laden with Sugars,
and afterwards thus destroyed. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who presumed more upon
their Advantages than Valors, though themselves in too weak a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to follow us to the Islands, and put their Fortunes upon a days Service,
but subtilly devised how to intercept ns as we came Home, when we had
least Thought or Suspicion of them; and their Fleet, that was all this while
in the <hi>Groyn</hi> and <hi>Ferrol,</hi> not daring to put forwards while they knew ours
to be upon the Coast, their General the <hi>Adelantada</hi> came for <hi>England,</hi> with a
Resolution to land at <hi>Falmouth,</hi> and fortifie it, and afterwards, with their
Ships, to keep the Sea, and expect our coming home scattered.</p>
               <p>Having thus cut off our Sea Forces, and possessing the Harbor of <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi>
they thought with a second supply of 37 <hi>Levantisco's</hi> Ships, which
the Marquess <hi>Arumbullo</hi> commanded, to have returned and gained a good
footing in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Designs of theirs were not foreseen by us: For we came Home
scattered, as they made reckoning, not 20 in number together.</p>
               <p>We may say, and that truly, that God fought for us: For the <hi>Adalan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tada</hi>
being within a few Leagues of the Island of <hi>Silly,</hi> he commanded all
his Captains on Board him to receive his Directions; but whilst they were
in Consultation, a violent Storm took them at <hi>East,</hi> insomuch that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
could hardly recover their Ships, but in no case were able to save
their Boats, the Storm continued so furious, and happy was he that could
recover home, seeing their Design thus overthrown by loss of their Boats,
whereby their means of Landing was taken away. Some who were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to stay, and receive the farther Commands of the General, kept the
Seas so long upon our Coast, that in the end they were taken; others put
themselves into our Harbors for Refuge and Succor; and it is certainly
known, that in this Voyage the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost eighteen Ships, the St. <hi>Luke,</hi>
and the St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> being two and in the rank of his best Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55770:21"/>
We must ascribe this Success to God only: For certainly the Enemies
Designs were dangerous, and not to be diverted by our Force; but by his
Will, who would not suffer the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in any of their Attempts, to set
footing in <hi>England,</hi> as we have done in all the Quarters of <hi>Spain, Portugal,</hi>
the Islands, and both the <hi>Indies.</hi>

               <p>I Cannot write of any thing done in this Year of 1599. For there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
greater Expectation of War, with less Performance. Whether it was
a Mistrust the one Nation had of the other, or a Policy held on both sides,
to make Peace with Sword in Hand, a Treaty being entertained by consent
of each Prince, I am not to examine; but sure I am, the Preparation was
on both sides very great, as if the one expected an Invasion from the other;
and yet it was generally conceived, not to be intended by either; but
that ours had only relation to my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> who was then in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
and had a Design to try his Friends in <hi>England,</hi> and to be revenged of his
Enemies, as he pretended, and as it proved afterwards by his Fall: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it was, the Charge was not so great as necessary: For it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known, that the <hi>Adalantada</hi> had drawn both his Ships and Gallies
to the <hi>Groyne;</hi> which was not usually done, but for some Action intended
upon <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> though he converted them after to another use,
as you shall hear.</p>
               <p>The Gallies were sent into the Low Countreys, and pass'd the Narrow
Seas, while our Ships lay there, and with the Fleet the <hi>Atalantada</hi> pursued
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to the Islands, whither he suspected they were gone. This
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55770:22"/>
Fleet of <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which consisted of 73 Sail, were the first Ships that
ever displayed their Colors in War-like sort against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in any
Action of their own: For how cruel soever the War seemed to be in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
they maintained a peaceable Trade in <hi>Spain,</hi> and abused us. This
first Action of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> at Sea proved not very successful: For after
the Spoil of a Town in the <hi>Canary's,</hi> and some Hurt done at the Island of
St. <hi>Ome,</hi> they kept the Sea for some seven or eight months, in which time
their General and most of their Men, sickned and died, and the rest return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Loss and Shame. Another Benefit which we received by this
Preparation, was, that our Men were now taught suddainly to Arme, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man knowing his Command, and how to be commanded, which before
they were ignorant of: and who knows not, that sudden and false Alarms
in an Army, are sometimes necessary? To say truth, the Expedition which
was then used in drawing together so great an Army by Land, and rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
so great and Royal a Navy to Sea in so little a space of Time, was so
admirable in other Countreys, that they received a Terror by it; and
many that came from beyond Sea, said, the Queen was never more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
abroad for any thing she ever did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>French-men</hi> that came Aboard our Ships, did wonder (as at a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible)
that her Majesty had rigged, victualled and furnished her Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Ships to Sea in 12 days time: And <hi>Spain,</hi> as an Enemy, had reason to
fear, and grieve to see this suddain Preparation; but more, when they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
how the Hearts of Her Majesty's Subjects joyned with their Hands,
being all ready to spend their dearest Blood for her and her Service. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
might likewise see, that if they became insolent, we could be assoon
provided as they; nor did they expect to find such celerity in any Nation
but themselves.</p>
               <p>It is probable too, that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Duke, were
hereby drawn to entertain Thoughts of Peace: For as soon as our Fleet
was at Sea, a Gentleman was sent from <hi>Brussells,</hi> with some Overtures, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
for that time they succeeded not. However, whether it was, that
the intended Invasion from <hi>Spain</hi> was diverted, or that her Majesty was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
satisfied of my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi> I know not; but so it was, that she
commanded the suddain Return of her Ships from Sea, after they had layn
three weeks or a month in the <hi>Downs.</hi>

               <p>THE last Year, as you have heard, put all men in expectation of War,
which yet came to nothing. This Summer gave us great hope of
Peace; but with the like effect: For by consent of the Queen, the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Duke, their Commissioners met at <hi>Bulloign</hi> in <hi>Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie,</hi>
to treat of Peace; a place chosen indifferently, the <hi>French</hi> King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55770:22"/>
in League and Friendship with them all. Whether this Treaty were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
but in shew only, or, that they were out of hopes, to come to any
conclusion; or, what else was the true and real cause of its breaking off
so suddenly, I know not; but the pretence was but slender, for there grew
a difference about Precedency, betwixt the two Crowns, though it was ever
due to <hi>England;</hi> and so the hopes of Peace were frustrated, though had it
been really intended, matters might easily have been accommodated.</p>
               <p>The Queen suspecting the Event hereof, before their meeting, and the
rather, because the <hi>Spaniards</hi> entertained her with the like Treaty, in 1588
when at the same instant, his Navy appeared upon her Coast to Invade her;
therefore, least she should be guilty of too great security, in relying upon
the success of this doubtful Treaty, she furnished the Three Ships before
named, under pretence to guard the Western Coast, which at that time was
infested by the <hi>Dunkirkers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because there should be the less notice taken, part of the Victuals
was provided at <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Lewson,</hi> who was then Admiral
of the Narrow Seas, was appointed General, for the more secret carriage of
the business; so as it could not be conjectured, either by their Victualling,
or by their Captain, being Admiral of the Narrow Seas, that it was a Service
from home. As they were in a readiness at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> expecting Orders,
the Queen being fully satisfied, that the Treaty of <hi>Bulloign</hi> would break off
without effect, she commanded Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> to hasten to the Islands,
there to expect the Carrecks, and <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleet. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the other
side, being as circumspect to prevent a mischief, as we were subtil to contrive
it; and believing (as we did) that the Treaty of Peace would prove a
vain, hopeless shew of what was never meant, they furnished Eighteen tall
Ships to the Islands, as they had usually done, since the Year 1591. The
General of this Fleet was <hi>Don Diego de Borachero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Ships coming to the Islands, they and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had intelligence
of one another, but not the sight, for that Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> hailed Sixty
Leagues Westward, not only to avoid them, but in hopes to meet with the
Carrecks, and <hi>Mexico</hi> Fleet, before they could join them: But the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recks
being formerly warned by the taking of one of them, and burning of
another, in 1591. had ever since that year, endeavored to shun the sight
of that Island; so that our Fleet being now prevented, as they had often
before been, (nothing being more uncertain, than Actions at Sea, where
Ships are to meet one another casually) they returned home, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
time and Victuals, to no purpose, and seen not so much as one Sail,
from the time they quitted the Coast of <hi>England,</hi> till their return, two
Ships of <hi>Holland</hi> excepted, that came from the <hi>East Indies</hi> (for then began
their Trade thither) which Ships Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> relieved, finding them
in great distress and want.</p>

               <p>IN the Year 1600. and part of the Year 1601. there was a kind of cessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from Arms, though not by agreement, for this Year gave a hope of
Peace; which failing, the former course of annoying each other was revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
we in relieving the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in assisting the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
in <hi>Ireland.</hi> This was the Summer, that the Arch-Duke besieged <hi>Ostend,</hi>
which was bravely defended, but principally, by the Supplies out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And towards Winter, when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> thought we least looked
for War, <hi>Don Diego de Borachero,</hi> with 48 Sail of Ships, and 4000 Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
was sent to Invade <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his way thither he lost the company of his Vice-Admiral, <hi>Siriago,</hi> who
returned to the <hi>Groyn,</hi> which when the King heard, he was much dista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
with <hi>Siriago,</hi> and commanded him upon his Allegiance, to hasten with
all speed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> as he was formerly directed; <hi>Don Diego,</hi> his Landing
being known in <hi>England,</hi> when it was too late to prevent it; yet, least he
should be supplied with further Forces, Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> valiantly entred
the Harbor, drew near their Fortifications, and fought the Enemy for the
space of one whole day, his Ship being an Hundred times shot through, and
yet but Eight men slain. God so blest him, that he prevailed in his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize,
destroyed their whole Shipping, and made <hi>Siriago</hi> fly by Land into
another Harbor, where he obscurely Imbarqued himself in a <hi>French</hi> Vessel,
for <hi>Spain.</hi> All this while was the main Army, which Landed with their
General, <hi>Don Iuan de Aquila,</hi> seated in <hi>Kinsale,</hi> expecting the aid of <hi>Tyro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi>
who promised every day to be with him. Our Army commanded by
the Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> besieged the Town, so that he
prevented their meeting, and many skirmishes past betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The Siege continued, with great miseries to both the Armies, and not
without cause, considering the Season of the Year, and the condition of
the Country, that afforded little relief to either: some few days before
Christmas, <hi>Tyroen</hi> appeared with his Forces, which was some little heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Enemy, in hopes to be freed of their Imprisonment, for so may
I call it, they were so strictly beleagured. The day of agreement, betwixt
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Tyroen,</hi> was Christmas Eve, on which day, there happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
an Earthquake in <hi>England;</hi> and, as many times such Signs prove <hi>aut bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,
aut malum Omen;</hi> this proved Fortunate to us, the Victory being
obtained, with so little loss, as it is almost incredible.</p>
               <p>This was the day of Tryal, whether <hi>Ireland</hi> should continue a parcel of
our Crown, or no; for if the Enemy had prevailed in the Battel, and a
Treaty had not afterwards obtained more then Force, it was to be feared,
<hi>Ireland</hi> would hardly have been ever recovered. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:55770:23"/>
seeing the success of <hi>Tyroen,</hi> and the impossibility for him to re-inforce his
Army, being hopeless of supplies out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and their Poverty daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing,
they made offers of a Parly, which was granted, and after ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Peace there: The Conditions whereof are extant in Print. They
were furnished with Ships, and secured of their Passage into <hi>Spain,</hi> where
arriving in <hi>English</hi> Vessels, the Ships returned back for <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>THE last Attempt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> awakened the Queen,
who, it seemeth for two or three Years together, entertained the
Hopes of Peace, and therefore was sparing in setting forth her Fleets. But
now perceiving the Enemy had found the way into <hi>Ireland;</hi> and that it
behoved her to be more vigilant than ever; she resolved, as the safest course
to infest the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coasts with a continual Fleet; and in this year furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Ships aforesaid, having Promise from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> to joyn
to them twelve Sail of theirs; and because this important Service required
great speed, she had not time enough to man them, or supply them with
Provisions altogether so well as they were usually wont to be; but was
content with what could be gotten in so short a warning, so desirous was
she to see her Ships at Sea.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> set sail with five of them the <hi>19th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and left
Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> behind with the other four, to attend the coming of the
<hi>Hollanders:</hi> though within two or three days after, Sir <hi>William</hi> received
Command from the Queen, to hasten with all speed to Sir <hi>Richard Lewson;</hi>
for that she was advertised, that the Silver Ships were arrived at the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera's.</hi>
Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> hereupon neglected no time, nor stayed either
to see himself better Manned, or his Ships better furnished; but put to Sea
the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Intelligence of the Queen's was true: For the Plate Fleet had been
at the <hi>Tercera's,</hi> and departing from thence, in their Course for <hi>Spain,</hi> Sir
<hi>Richard Lewson,</hi> with his few Ships, met them; but to little purpose, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the rest of his Fleet, and the help of the 12 <hi>Hollanders.</hi> We may very
well account this not the least Error or Negligence that hath been commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in our Voyages: For if the <hi>Hollanders</hi> had kept touch according to
Promise, and the Queen's Ships had been fitted out with Care, we had
made her Majesty Mistress of more Treasure than any of her Progenitors e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
enjoyed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55770:24"/>
Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi>'s Design against the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet, notwithstanding
his Renowned Valor, being thus frustrated, and by the <hi>Hollanders</hi> slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
crossed, he plied towards the Rock, to meet Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> as
the place resolved on between them; but Sir <hi>William</hi> having spent 14 days
thereabouts, and hearing no Tidings of him, went round to the <hi>Southward
Cape,</hi> where he was likewise frustrated of a most promising Hope: For meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with certain <hi>French-men</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> at the same instant, he descried
three Ships of ours, sent by Sir <hi>Richard</hi> to look him. These <hi>French</hi> and
<hi>Scottish</hi> Ships came from St. <hi>Lucas,</hi> and made report of five Gallions, ready
the next Tide to set sail for the <hi>Indies:</hi> They likewise told him of two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that departed three days before, wherein went <hi>Don Petro de Valdes,</hi>
to be Governor of the <hi>Havana,</hi> who had sometimes been Prisoner in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These two later Ships were met one Night by the <hi>Warspight,</hi> whereof
Capt. <hi>Sommers</hi> was Commander; but whether it was by the Darkness of
the Night, or by what other Casualty (for the Sea is subject to many) I
know not, but they escaped.</p>
               <p>This News of the five Gallions, and the three Ships of the Queen's so
happily meeting together, made Sir <hi>William</hi> direct his Course into the
heighth wherein the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were most likely to sail in; and coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that heighth, he had sight of five Ships, which in respect of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and Course, he made reckoning to be the five Gallions; and thought
that day should fully determine and try the difference between the Strength
and Puissance of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, their number and greatness
being equal: But his Joy was soon quailed: For coming up with them, he
found them to be <hi>English</hi> Ships coming out of the <hi>Streights,</hi> and bound home;
but yet this did not discourage the Hope he had conceived that the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
might be met withall; and the next day he gave Chase to one Ship a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
that came out of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which he took, though he had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
without her: For she brought him so far to Leeward, that that Night
the Gallions passed to Wind-ward, not above eight or ten Leagues off us,
by report of an <hi>English</hi> Pinnace that met them, who came into our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the day following. These Misfortunes lighting first upon Sir <hi>Richard,</hi>
and after upon Sir <hi>William,</hi> might have been sufficient Reasons to discourage
them; but they knowing the Accidents of the Sea, and that Fortune could
as well laugh as weep, having good Ships under foot, their Men sound and
in health, and plenty of Victuals, they did not doubt but that some of
the Wealth which the <hi>Indies</hi> sent forth into <hi>Spain</hi> would fall to their
Shares.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Tuesday,</hi> the first of <hi>Iune,</hi> to begin our new Fortune with a new
Month, Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> and Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> who some few Nights
before had met accidentally in the Sea, were close on board the Rock,
where they took two Ships of the <hi>East</hi> Country, bound for <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and
while they were romaging these Ships, they descried a Carvel from <hi>Cape
Picher</hi> bearing with them; which by Signs she made, they perceived had a
desire to speak with them. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> immediately chased her, and left
Sir <hi>William</hi> with the two <hi>Easterlings</hi> to abide about the Rock till his return.
The Carvel being fetcht up, made a relation of a Carreck and 11 Gallies
to be in <hi>Cisembre</hi> Road; and that she was sent by two Ships of ours, the
<hi>Nonperil</hi> and the <hi>Dreadnought</hi> which lay thereabouts to look out the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.
With what Joy this News was apprehended may be easily imagined:
Sir <hi>Richard</hi> made Signs to Sir <hi>William</hi> to stand with him; and lest he should
not be discerned, he caused the Carvel to ply up with him, wishing him
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55770:24"/>
to repair to him; but before they could approach the <hi>Cape,</hi> it was midnight,
and nothing chanced all that time, but the exchanging of some Shot, that
passed betwixt the Admiral and the Gallies.</p>
               <p>Upon <hi>Wednesday,</hi> the second of <hi>June,</hi> every man looked early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
what Ships of her Majesties were in sight, which were five in number,
the <hi>Warspight,</hi> wherein Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was: For the <hi>Repulse</hi> he had sent for
<hi>England</hi> some few days before, by reason of a Leak; the <hi>Garland,</hi> the <hi>Nonpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,</hi>
the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> and the <hi>Adventure,</hi> besides the two <hi>Easterlings</hi> taken
the day before. All the Captains resorted on Board the Admiral, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
which took up most part of the day. At first there was an Opposition
by some, who alleadged the Danger and Impossibility of taking the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reck,
being defended by the Castle and 11 Gallies: But Sir <hi>William Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
prevailed so far, as that all consented to go upon her the next day, and
concluded upon this Course following, that he and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
as near the Carreck as they could, the rest to ply up and down, and
not anchor. Sir <hi>William</hi> was glad of this occasion, to be revenged of the
Gallies, hoping to requite the Slavery they put him to when he was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner
in them; and singled himself from the Fleet a League, that the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
might see it was in defiance of them; and so the Marquess of St. <hi>Cruz,</hi>
and <hi>Frederick Spaniola,</hi> the one General of the <hi>Portugal,</hi> the other of the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Gallies, apprehended it, and came forth with an intent to fight him;
but being within Shot, were diverted by one <hi>John Bedford</hi> an <hi>English-man,</hi>
who undertook to know the Force of the Ship, and Sir <hi>William</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
her. Before I go farther, I will a little digress, and acquaint you
with the Scituation of the Town, and the manner of placing the Gallies
against us. The Town of <hi>Cisembre</hi> lieth in the bottom of a Road, which
is a good Succor for Ships with a <hi>Northerly</hi> Wind. It is built with Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
and near the Sea is erected a strong and spacious Fort, well reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with Ordnance: Above the Town, upon the top of a Hill, is seated
an ancient, strong Fryery, whose Scituation maketh if impregnable, and
able to command the Town, Castle and Road; close to the Shore lay the
Carreck, like a Bullwork to the <hi>West</hi> side of the Castle; so as it defended
both that, and the <hi>East</hi> part of the Town: The 11 Gallies had flancked
and fortified themselves with the small Neck of a Rock on the <hi>West</hi> side of
the Road, with their Prows right forward, to play upon us, every one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
a Cannon in their <hi>Cruzia,</hi> besides other Pieces in their Prows; and
they were no way to be damaged by us, till our Ships came so nigh the
Town, that all these Forces might play upon us in one instant.</p>
               <p>The Gallies being placed to this great Advantage, they made account
(as a Captain of one of them we took confess'd) to have sunk our Ships
of themselves, without any farther Help. We saw the Tents pitched, and
great Troops of Souldiers drawn together; which was no less than the whole
Country in Arms against us: The Boats pass'd betwixt the Shore and the
Carreck all the day long, which we supposed was to unlade her; but we
found afterwards it was rather to strengthen her with Men and Munition:
Here appeared many Difficulties and Dangers, and little hope of taking her;
but rather of sinking or burning her, as most men conjectured. The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
from the Gallies was great, they being flancked with the point of a
Rock at our Entrance, as you have heard, it being likewise calm, and they
shooting low: Another Danger was, that of the Wind: For if it had come
from the Sea, the Road being open, and the Bay deep, our Attempt must
have been in vain. And notwithstanding these, and many more apparent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen; and that there was no man but imagined, that most of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recks
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55770:25"/>
Lading was on shoar, and that they would hale her on ground, under
the Castle, where no Ship of ours should be able to fleet to her; all which
objections, with many more, were alleadged, yet they little prevailed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastination
was perilous, and therefore with all expedition, they thought
convenient to charge the Town, the Fort, the Gallies, and Carreck, all at
one instant. And they had determined, if the Carreck had been on ground,
or so nigh the shoar, that the Queens Ships could not fleet to her, that the
Two Easterlings, the day before taken, should Board her, and Burn
her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thursday</hi> the Third day, early in the morning, every man commending
himself to God's Tuition and Protection, expected when to begin, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the agreement the day before. A gale of Wind happening about
Ten of the Clock, the Admiral weighed; shot off a Warning-piece, and put
forth his Flag in the Maintop: the Vice-Admiral did the like in his Foretop,
according to the Custome of the Sea; every Captain encouraged his men,
which so imboldened them, as though they were grown weak and feeble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they were now revived, and bestirred themselves, as if a new Spirit
had been infused into them; the Admiral was the first that gave the charge,
after him followed the rest of the Ships, shewing great Valor, and gaining
great Honor; the last of all, was the Vice-Admiral, at whose entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Fight, he still strived to get up as near the shoar as he could, where
he came to an Anchor, continually fighting with the Town, the Fort, the
Gallies, and Carreck, all together, for he brought them betwixt him, that
he might play both his Broad Sides upon them; there might be seen the
Prowess of the Gallies, swim by the sides of them, the Slaves forsake them,
and every thing in confusion amongst them, and thus they Fought, till Five
of the Clock in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>The Vice-Admiral was Anchored to such an advantage, as the Gallies
rowed from one side to another, seeking to shun him, which Sir <hi>Richard
Lewson</hi> observing, came on Board him, and openly, in the view and hearing
of his whole Company, imbraced him, and told him, <hi>He had won his heart
for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rest of the Ships, as they were directed, plied up, except the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
who by the negligence of his Master, or some other impediment, when
he should have Anchored, fell so far to Leeward, as the Wind and Tide car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him out of the Road, so that it was the next day, before his Ship
could be fetcht in again; whereat the Admiral was much inraged, and put
himself into the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> and brought her to an Anchor close to the
Vice-Admiral, about Two of the Clock in the Afternoon: There was no
opportunity let pass, for where the Admiral saw defect in any other Ship,
he presently caused it to be supplied, and the Easterlings, who were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Board the Carrek, beginning to faint, and fail of observing the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
given them, the Vice-Admiral perceiving it, went on Board them
himself, vowing, that if they seemed backward in putting in Execution the
design of firing the Carreck, they should look for as little Life from the
<hi>English,</hi> as they could expect from the Enemy. Whilst the Vice-Admiral was
thus ordering things, Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> came to him, and would in no
case suffer him to Board the Carreck himself, but carried him into the
<hi>Dreadnought,</hi> where they consulted how to preserve the Carreck, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
her.</p>
               <p>The result of this Reference was, to offer her parley, which they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put in practice, and commanded all the Ships to leave shooting, until the
return of the Messenger: The man imployed, was one Captain <hi>Sewell,</hi> who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55770:25"/>
had escaped<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and swam to us, having been Four Years Prisoner in the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and so did many <hi>Turks</hi> and Christians; the effect of this Parley, was to
persuade them to yield, promising honorable Conditions, and he was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate,
as from himself, that the Gallies, whose strength they presumed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were beaten, some burnt, the rest fled; that we had the possession of
the Road, the Castle not being able to abide our Ordinance, much less the
Carreck, and if they refused this offer of Mercy, they were to expect all the
Cruelty and Rigor, that a Conpueror could impose upon his Enemy: After
some Conference to this effect, the Captain of the Carreck told him, He
would send some Gentlemen of Quality, with Commission to Treat, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
that some of the like Quality from us, might repair to him, to the
same purpose.</p>
               <p>These Gentlemen came aboard the <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> where the Admiral and
Vice-Admiral were, attending the return and success of Captain <hi>Sewell;</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the delivery of their Message, they would needs hasten on Board the
Carreck again, for that, as it seemed, there was an uproar and a division in
her, some being of opinion to entertain a Parley, others to save themselves,
and set her on fire: which Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> hearing, without further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
or conference, with Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> what was to be done, he leaped sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
into his Boat, and rowed unto the Carreck; when he drew near to
her, he was known by diverse Gentlemen on Board her, he having once been
a Prisoner among them: they seemed to be very glad of this meeting, and
their passed diverse Imbracements between them, in remembrance of their
old acquaintance: The Captain was called <hi>Don Diego de Lobo,</hi> a Gallant
young Gentleman, of a Noble House. He descended down upon the bend
of the Ship, and commanded his men to stand aside; Sir <hi>William</hi> did the
like to his company, in the Boat; the Captain demanded of him, if he had
the <hi>Portugal</hi> Language; he told him, he had sufficient to Treat of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness;
acquainted him of the Place he commanded in the Fleet, intimated
the affection and respect he bore the <hi>Portugal</hi> Nation, and that the Treaty
which was offered, proceeded out of his motion, and wished him to make
his proposals, which were as followeth, The first demand he made, was,
<hi>That they should be safely put on shoar with their Arms.</hi> The Second, <hi>That it
should be done the same Night.</hi> The Third, <hi>That they should enjoy their Ship
and Ordinance, as appertaining to the King, but we the Wealth.</hi> The Fourth,
<hi>That the Flag and Ancient should not be taken down, but worn while the Carreck
was unlading.</hi> His Speech being ended, Sir <hi>William</hi> told him, <hi>That his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
gave suspition, that under pretence of Parley, they meant Treachery, or
that their hopes were greater, than there was cause; and, but that he knew it was
the use of some men, to demand great things, when less will serve them, he would
not lose his advantage, to entertain a Parley;</hi> he desired, that what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
might be quickly concluded, for Night growing on, might advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
them; and for his Resolution, he should understand it in few words,
<hi>viz.</hi> To his first Demand, <hi>He was willing to yeild, That they should be put on
shoar with their Arms.</hi> To the Second, <hi>That he was contented, that they should
be set on shoar that Night, except Eight or Ten of the Principal Gentlemen, whom
he would detain Three Days.</hi> To the Third, <hi>He held it idle and frivolous, to
imagine, he would consent to separate Ship and Goods, and esteemed it</hi> Por Cosa
de burla. To the Fourth, <hi>He would not consent, being resolved, never to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a</hi> Spanish <hi>Flag to be worn in the presence of the Queens Ships, unless it were
disgracefully, over the Poop.</hi> There was long expostulations upon these
points, and Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> seeing the obstinacy of the Captain, offered,
in a great rage, to leap into his Boat, resolving to break the Treaty, which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55770:26"/>
the rest of the Gentlemen perceiving, and that he had propounded nothing
but what might very well stand with their Reputation, they intreated him
once more to ascend into the Carreck, and they would enter into new Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations:
The effect whereof, as it was agreed upon, were these that
follow;</p>
               <p>That a Messenger should be sent to the Admiral, to have his Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the points concluded on; and that in the mean time the Flag and
Ancient should be taken down; and if the Admiral should not consent to
the Agreement, they to have leisure to put out their Flag and Ancient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fight should begin. That the Company should be presently set on
Shore; but the Captain, with eight other of the principal Gentlemen three
days after. That the Ship with her Goods, should be surrendered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Practice or Treason. That they should use their endeavors, that
the Castle should forbear shooting whilst we rid in the Road; and this was
the effect of the Conditions agreed upon. This Carreck Wintered in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sambicke,</hi>
in her return from the <hi>Indies,</hi> a place of great Infection, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
by the Mortality among them: For of 600 and odd men, twenty
of them lived not to return Home. After a great deal of Calamity and
Mortality, she arrived at this Port of <hi>Cisembre,</hi> as you have heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the
Viceroy of <hi>Portugal,</hi> having sent 11 Gallies to her Rescue, and 400 <hi>mocas
de Camera,</hi> which is a Title of Gentlemen that serve the King upon any
Honourable Occasion, when they are commanded. That she was brought
to this pass, and forc'd to yield on these Conditions, Sir <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> was
wont to impute to the Gentlemens Acquaintance with Sir <hi>William Monson.</hi>
Although three days were limited for setting the Captain on Shore, yet it
was held Discretion not to detain them longer than untill the Carreck was
brought off safely to our Ships; and therefore Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> having
carried the Captain, and the rest of the Gentlemen on board him, where
they Supped, had variety of Musick, and spent the Night in great Jollity;
the Morning following, accompanied them on Shore himself, whither
the <hi>Conde de Vitagera</hi> had drawn down all the Force of the whole Country,
amounting to the number of 10000 men.</p>
               <p>I must not omit to describe the Behavior of the Gallies in the Fight, that
every Man may have that Honor that is due to him: Those of <hi>Portugal,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Squadron of the Marquess of St. <hi>Cruz,</hi> betook themselves, with
their General, to Flight in the middle of the Fight; but <hi>Frederico Spinola,</hi>
who was to convey his Gallies out of <hi>Spain</hi> into the Low Countreys, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
not the Example of the Marquess, but made good the Road; which
the other seeing, with Shame returned; but to both their Costs: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they departed, they found the Climate so hot, as they were forc'd to
fly, their Gallies being so miserably beaten, and their Slaves so pitifully
slain, as there wanted nothing but Boats to possess them all, as well as
the two we took and burnt; which is a thing hath been seldom seen or heard
of, for Ships to take and destroy Gallies. The number of Men slain in the
Town, the Castle, the Carreck and Gallies, are unknown, though they
could not chuse but be many; the Wealth of the Carreck could then as ill
be estimated, though after found to be great; the Value of the two Gallies
burnt with their Loading of Powder, is hard to judge, though it's known
to have been a Service of great Importance. For our Loss, it was not much,
only one man killed in the Fly-Boat, five slain, and as many hurt in the
<hi>Garland,</hi> and one hurt in the <hi>Adventure:</hi> Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> had the left
Wing of his Doublet shot off, but received no other Hurt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:55770:26"/>
The day following, with a favourable Wind, we stood our Course for
<hi>England,</hi> which brought us into 47 Degrees; and there we met a Pinnace,
sent with a Pacquet from the Lords, signifying the readiness of a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Fleet to supply us, and the setting out of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which were
so long looked for; which Fleet of <hi>Holland</hi> was in View of the Pinnace the
same Night; but pass'd by us unseen. This unlooked for Accident made
the Admiral and Vice-Admiral consider what to do, and concluded, they
could not both appear at Home, and have a Fleet of so great Importance
upon the Enemies Coast without a Guide or Head; and therefore they
held it fit the Vice-Admiral should put himself into the <hi>Nonperil,</hi> as the
ablest Ship of the Fleet, and make his Return once more to the Coast of
<hi>Spain;</hi> but he having taken his Leave, and standing his Course for the Coast,
a most violent Storm, with a contrary Wind took him, which continued
ten days, and discovered the weakness of his Ship, who had like to have
foundered in the Deep. The Carpenters and Company seeing the apparent
Danger, if he bore not up before the Wind, presented him with a Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
beseeching him to have a regard to their Lives; for by keeping the
Seas they should all perish. Thus was he forc'd by mere Extremity to bear
room for <hi>England;</hi> and coming for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> he found the Carreck safely
arrived, and the Fleet he went back to take Charge of, not to have quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Coast of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though it be somewhat impertinent to this Voyage, to treat of more
than the Success thereof; yet I will a little digress, and relate the Mishap
of that worthy Young Gentleman <hi>Don Diego de Lobo,</hi> Captain of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reck;
and because his Worth will more appear by his Answer to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Monson</hi>'s Offer to him when he was his Prisoner; thus it was: Sir
<hi>William Monson</hi> told him, he doubted, that by the loss of the Carreck, he
had lost his best Means; for that he supposed, what he had gained in the
<hi>Indies,</hi> was laden in her; and therefore offered, that what he would chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
upon his Reputation to be his own, he should have Freedom to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
along with him. The Gentleman acknowledged the Favor to be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary;
but replied, that what he had, he had gained by his Sword;
and that his Sword, he doubted not, would repair his Fortunes again, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
refusing to accept any Courtesie in that kind: But, poor Gentleman,
ill fortune thus left him not: For the Viceroy, <hi>Don Cristoball de Moro,</hi>
holding it for a great indignity to have the Carreck taken out of the Port,
that was defended by a Castle, and guarded with 11 Gallies, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in his hearing of the Ordnance to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and in the view of thousands
of People who beheld it; some of them feeling it too, by the loss of their
Goods that were in her, others grieving for the Death of their Friends that
were slain; but every man finding himself touched in Reputation.</p>

               <p>And the Viceroy not knowing how to clear himself so well, as the laying it
upon the Gentlemen he put on Board her, the same Night they returned
to their Lodging, he caused the most part of them, with their Captain, to
be apprehended, imputing the loss of the Carreck to their Cowardise and
Fear, if not Treason and Connivance with the Enemy. After some time of
Imprisonment, by mediation of Friends, all the Gentlemen were released
but the Captain, who received secret Advice, that the Viceroy intended
his Death, and that he should seek by Escape to prevent it. <hi>Don Diego</hi>
being thus perplexed, practised with his Sister, who finding means for his
Escape out of a Window, he fled into <hi>Italy,</hi> where he lived in Exile, from
1602. when this happened, untill 1615. His Government in the <hi>Indies,</hi> for
which he had a Patent in Reversion, was confiscate, and he lest hopeless e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to return into his Native Country, much less to be restored to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;
an ill Welcome after so long and painful a Navigation. Having
thus spent thirteen years in Exile, at the last he advised with Friends, whose
Councel he followed, to repair into <hi>England,</hi> there to enquire after some
Commanders, that had been at the taking of the Carreck, by whose Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate
he might be cleared of Cowardise or Treason in the loss of her,
which would be a good Motive to restore him to his Government again.
In the Year 1515. he arrived in <hi>London,</hi> and after some Enquiry found out
Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> to whom he complained of his hard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mishap, craving
the Assistance of him and some others, whom Sir <hi>William</hi> knew to be at the
taking of the Carreck, and desired him to testifie the manner of surprizing
her, which he alleadged, was no more than one Gentleman was bound to
afford another in such a case.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> wondered to see him, and especially upon such an Occasion:
For the present, he entertained him with all Courtesie; and the longer his
stay was in <hi>England,</hi> the Courtesies were the greater, which Sir <hi>William</hi> did
him. Sir <hi>William</hi> procured him a true and effectual Certificate from himself,
Sir <hi>Francis Howard,</hi> Captain <hi>Barlow,</hi> and some others who were Witnesses
of that Service; and to give it the more Reputation, he caused it to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled
in the Office of the Admiralty. The Gentleman being well satisfied
with his Entertainment, and having what he desired, returned to <hi>Flanders,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:55770:27"/>
where he presented his Certificate to the Arch-Duke and the <hi>Infanta,</hi> by whose
means he got Assurance, not only of the King's Favor, but of Restitution
likewise to his Government. The poor Gentleman having been thus tossed
by the Waves of Calamity, from one Country to another, and never find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
rest; Death that masters all men, now cut him off short, in the midst of
his hopes, as he was preparing his Journy for <hi>Spain;</hi> and this was an end of
an unfortunate gallant young Gentleman, whose Deserts might justly have
challenged a better reward, if God had pleased to afford it him.</p>

               <p>THe Fleet of Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi> being happily returned, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of a Carreck, as you have heard, and the Queen having now
no Ships upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coast, to impeach the Enemies preparations, she
feared, the Fleet which was ready at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> would give a Second As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
upon <hi>Ireland;</hi> whereupon Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> who by this time was
arrived at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> was sent for in great haste, by her Majesty, to advise
about, and take on him the charge of the Fleet, then at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> After a
long Conference with Sir <hi>William Monson,</hi> in the presence of her Majesty,
her Lord Admiral, Treasurer, and Secretary, it was Resolved, That Sir
<hi>William</hi> should repair to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and with all speed get forth those Ships,
and others that were there making ready. His directions were, to present
himself before the Harbor of the <hi>Groyne,</hi> being the place where the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
made their Randevouz, and if he found any likelihood of a design up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Ireland,</hi> not to quit that Coast untill he saw the Issue, but if he found
<hi>Ireland</hi> secure, and the Enemies preparations to be intended only for defence
of their own Coasts, then his instructions led him thence, to the place where
the <hi>Holland</hi> Fleet had order to attend, and expect him; and afterwards, the
whole carriage of the Action was referred to his discretion, but with this
caution, that above all respects of other profit or advantage, he attended the
affair of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The Wind this part of the Summer hung contrary, and
it was Six Weeks before he could clear the Coast, during which time, he
lost his greatest hopes, by the return of the Carrecks of the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet,
which happened a full Month before his arrival: He set Sail from <hi>Plymouth</hi>
the last of <hi>August,</hi> with a scant Wind, which continued with foul Weather,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:55770:28"/>
untill he recovered the <hi>Groyne,</hi> choosing rather to keep the Sea, then hazard
the overthrow of the Voyage by his return.</p>
               <p>He stayed at the <hi>Groyne,</hi> until he understood that the Fleet which was
suspected to be prepared for <hi>Ireland,</hi> was gone to <hi>Lisbone,</hi> to join with
<hi>Don Diego de Borachero,</hi> who all that Summer durst not budge forth, for
fear of our Fleet, that made good the Coast thereabouts: Sir <hi>William</hi> in his
way to the Rock, commanded his Carvel to repair to the Islands of <hi>Bayon,</hi>
as the likeliest place to procure Intelligence of the State of those parts; as
the Carvel drew near the Islands, he discerned the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, consisting
of Twenty Four Sail, whose design was, as she understood by a Boat she
took, to look out the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, whose comming they daily expected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Coast; and meeting Sir <hi>William</hi> with this news, he held it a good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to be thus warned of them. Here he took two goodly Ships of <hi>France,</hi>
bound for <hi>Lisbone,</hi> which Harbor he put them from, and took Pledges, that
they should directly return into <hi>France,</hi> without touching in any Harbor of
<hi>Spain,</hi> for that he understood, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet was ill provided of men,
and many other things which these Ships could supply. Sir <hi>William</hi> and the
<hi>Dreadnought,</hi> were carried with a chase into the Road of <hi>Cisimbre,</hi> where
the Carreck was taken not long before, and after some Fight with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
who defended the Vessel chased, they came to a friendly Treaty, and
Presents past between them.</p>
               <p>That Night, while the Admiral rid in the Road, a Carvel comming in,
not mistrusting him, was taken, but dismissed in a friendly manner; by
whom he understood the affairs of <hi>Lisbone,</hi> but could get no notice of the
<hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, which was appointed to attend at the Rock, whither once
more he repaired.</p>
               <p>Coming thither the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> a light was espied in the Night,
which the Admiral chased, thinking it had been the Fleet of St. <hi>Omer,</hi> or
<hi>Brazil,</hi> bound for <hi>Lisbone,</hi> where they were expected; but drawing so
near them, that he might hail them, he found them, by the hugeness of their
Vessels, and the number which answered the relation the Carvel made, to
be the <hi>Armado</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> whereupon he sought means how to clear himself,
being ingaged amongst them, and made a <hi>Spaniard</hi> which served him call to
them, but they could not hear him; the <hi>Adventure</hi> only, and the <hi>Whelp,</hi>
were left with him, the rest losing company, Four nights before in a Storm;
the Enemy perceiving our lights, and thinking it to be some Fleet of <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings,</hi>
stood in amongst us, but the <hi>Adventure</hi> being discovered to be an
Enemy, the Alarum was soon taken, and they shot at her, and slew and
hurt some of her men; as soon as the day appeared, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> beheld
the Three <hi>Enlish</hi> Ships a head them, which they chased, and Three of them,
which were better of Sail than the rest, fetcht upon us, and drew near the
<hi>Whelp,</hi> who was of small Force to resist them.</p>
               <p>But the Admiral resolving, though it was to his own evident Peril, not
to see a Pinnace of her Majesties so lost, if so be he could rescue her with
the loss of his Life, though it was much against the persuasions of his Master,
and company, he stroak his two Sails for the <hi>Whelp,</hi> and commanded her to
stand her course, while he staid for the Three <hi>Spanish</hi> Ships, with hope to
make them have little list to pursue us: The Admiral of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
how little he cared for his Three Ships, in that he lingered for their
coming up, took in with the shoar, and shot off a peice for his Three Ships
to follow him. It may appear by this, as by several other expeditions of
ours, how much the swift Sailing of Ships doth avail, being the principal
advantage in Sea Service, and indeed the main thing we could presume up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55770:28"/>
in our War against the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> Sir <hi>William</hi> having thus escaped the
Enemy, in his traverse at Sea, there happened, as there doth upon all Coasts,
where there is plenty of Trade, divers occasions of chases; and one day Sir
<hi>William</hi> following one Ship, and the <hi>Adventure</hi> another, they lost company
for the whole Voyage.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> was advertised by a Ship he took, being a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who
came from St. <hi>Lucas,</hi> that the St. <hi>Domingo</hi> Fleet was looked for daily, which
Intelligence made him bear up for the <hi>South Cape,</hi> as well in hopes to meet
with them, as to have news of his Fleet.</p>
               <p>He was no sooner come to the <hi>Cape,</hi> but he was informed by some <hi>English</hi>
men of War, that the <hi>Domingo</hi> Fleet was past by two days before; here he
met with Ships of several Nations, some he rescued from Pirats, and to
others that were in League with her Majesty, he gave his safe conduct, for
their free passage on the Sea; he kept that Coast until the <hi>21th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi>
on which morning he gave chase to a Gallion of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Castle of <hi>Cape Sacre,</hi> before he could fetch her up; although
he knew the strength of the Castle, yet he attempted, and had carried her,
had it not been for the fear and cowardize of him at the Helm, who bore up,
when he was ready to Board her: The Fight was not long, but sharp and
dangerous, for there never past shot between them, till they were within a
Ships length one of another: The Castle plaid her part, and tore his Ship,
so that a man might have crept through her: Between the Castle and Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they slew in the Admiral Ten men, and hurt many more, in the view of
<hi>Sireago</hi> and his Quadron, to the <hi>Westward,</hi> and of divers <hi>English</hi> men of
War, to the <hi>Eastward,</hi> who durst not put themselves upon the rescue of Sir
<hi>William,</hi> for fear of the Castle: Sir <hi>William</hi> being now left alone, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what head Land soever he came unto, he was to encounter a <hi>Spanish</hi>
Squadron, stood his course that night to Sea, thinking to try, if the Islands
of <hi>Terceras</hi> would afford him any better Fortune, but coming within Forty
or Fifty Leagues of the Islands, he was taken short with the Wind, yet still
bearing up what he could for the Rock; but at length finding his Victuals
grew short, his Mast perished, and the dangers he was exposed to, by keeping
that Coast, he directed his course for <hi>England,</hi> and came to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the
<hi>24th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> where he found the <hi>Mary-rose</hi> and <hi>Dreadnought,</hi> most
part of their men being dead or sick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Adventure</hi> arrived within an hour after him, who in her way home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fell, fell amongst the <hi>Braizl</hi> Fleet, and encountring with them, lost
divers men, but took none: The <hi>Paragon</hi> was at home long before, with a
Prize of Sugar, and Spices, which countervailed the charge of the Voyage.
The <hi>Quittance</hi> in her return, met Two Ships of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and in fight
with them, her Captain was slain, but she acquitted her self very well, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further harm. This Fleet, as you have heard, was to keep the Enemy
busied at home, that he might be diverted from the thoughts of <hi>Ireland;</hi> what
hazard it endured by the Enemy, the fury of the Sea, and soul Weather,
doth appear; and no marvel; for it was the latest Fleet in Winter, that
ever kept upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coast, as it was likewise the last Fleet her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
imployed; for in <hi>March</hi> after she died, and by her Death all War cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
As Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> was General of this last Fleet, so was he a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
and a Youth, at the beginning of the Wars, and was at the taking of
the first <hi>Spanish</hi> Prize, that ever saw the <hi>English</hi> Coast, which yet was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
with the loss of Twenty Five of our men, besides Fifty hurt. This
Prize was afterwards a Man of War, and served against the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and
was in those days reckoned the best Ship of War we had; she was called
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55770:29"/>
the Commander, and belonged to Sir <hi>George Carew,</hi> then Governor of the
Isle of <hi>Wight.</hi>

               <p>SIR <hi>William Monson</hi> returning with his Fleet, in <hi>November,</hi> there was
a Resolution to furnish another against <hi>February,</hi> which should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited
with fresh Ships, Men and Victuals in <hi>June.</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Lewson</hi>
was to command the former Fleet, and Sir <hi>William Monson</hi> the later: For
the Queen found it a Course both secure and profitable, to keep a
continual Force upon the <hi>Spanish</hi> Coast, from <hi>February</hi> to <hi>November,</hi> that
being the time of greatest Peril to her Majesty; and she was the rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
thereto, by the safty she found the last Summer, and the Wealth
and Riches she had from time to time taken from the Enemy. The
Complaint of the ill furnishing out of her Ships in other Voyages, made
it more carefully to be look'd unto now, and there was better Choice of
Victuals and Men than usually had been; but in the mean time, it pleased
God to visit her Majesty with Sickness, which caused a ling'ring, though
no absolute dissolving of the Fleet; but when her Danger was perceived
to increase. the Ships were hastened out to Sea, it being a point of good
Policy, to keep our Seas guarded from any Forreign Attempt, untill his
Majesty should be peaceably settled in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Fleet departed from <hi>Quinborough</hi> the <hi>22th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and arrived
in the <hi>Downs</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> of the same, being the day after her Majesties Death:
The News whereof, and Commandment to proclaim King <hi>James</hi> the Sixth
of <hi>Scotland,</hi> our Lawful King, and the rightful Inheritor to the Crown,
arrived both together; which put us into two contrary Passions, the
one of Grief, the other of Joy: Grief for the Loss of the Queen, Joy
for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> accepting of the King in that peaceable manner, which was a Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
beyond all Expectation, either at home or abroad.</p>
               <p>As the Design of this Fleet was to guard and defend our own Coasts
from any Incursion that might be made out of <hi>France</hi> or the Low
Countreys; so the Commanders were vigilant to appear on those Coasts
once in two days, to dishearten them, in case they had any such Thought;
but the truth is, it was beyond their Abilities, whatever was in their
Hearts to impugn his Majesty. And because the Arch-Duke would
make the Candidness of his Intention apparent to the World, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in his Letters of Reprizal against the <hi>English;</hi> and published an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55770:29"/>
Edict for a free and unmolested Traffick into <hi>Flanders:</hi> So that now
our Merchants might again trade peaceably into those Parts from which
they had been debarred the space of Eighteen Years. The King find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>France</hi> neither impeached his Right, nor gave any Jealousie
by the raising of an Army; and that the Arch-Duke made a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of his desire of Peace, his Majesty did the like, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the League he had with those Princes, with whom the late Queen
had Wars: For Wars betwixt Countreys are not hereditary; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
end with the Death of their Kings: Wherefore he commanded
his Ships to give over their <hi>Southern</hi> Employment, and to repair to
<hi>Chatham,</hi> giving manifest Testimonies, how desirous he was that his
Subjects should recover that Wealth and Freedom by Peace, which they
had formerly lost by War.</p>
