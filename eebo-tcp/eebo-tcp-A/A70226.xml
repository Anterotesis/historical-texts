         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
WORD
TO THE
Wavering, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>'Tis ſaid, (Page 3.)—Whereſoever Protection fails wholly,
Allegiance falls with it.</p>
            <p>THE whole Nation almoſt did not think ſo when they
own'd King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second in his Exile, when
his Protection failed them; and yet they, very Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully
and Religiouſly, as well as Loyally and Unanimouſly,
brought him in in 1660. and did what they could poſſibly for
him by their Pens, and Purſes, in his Abſence.</p>
            <p>And the whole People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> did not think
their Allegiance cancell'd, becauſe King <hi>David</hi>'s Protection
over them was diſabled, but ſtrove who ſhould be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt
to bring him back, 2 <hi>Sam. 19. 42. And all the men of
Judah anſwered the men of Iſrael, Becauſe the King is near of kin
to us: wherefore then be you angry for this matter? have we eaten
at all of the King's coſt? or hath he given us any gift?</hi> (nay, to
accommodate the Caſe to the Objection,—Was he ſo much
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:43334:3"/>
as able to protect us?) Yet <hi>the men of Iſrael anſwered the men
of Judah</hi> (Ver. 43.) <hi>We have ten parts in the King, and we have
alſo more right in David than ye: why then did ye deſpiſe us, that
our advice ſhould not be firſt had in bringing back our King?</hi> What
more evident, then that their Allegiance did not fall with
<hi>David</hi>'s ability to protect them, ſeeing they profeſs no Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt
in the caſe, no Gift, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but only the Allegation of
Birth, Family, and Kindred, or the like.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> (Pag. 3.)—Service and Obedience are without doubt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
when a Father ceaſes to be a Father, by becoming an Enemy.</p>
            <p>That the Father of our Country is not become an Enemy,
ſhall be made out hereafter—But if a Father, or a Prince,
becomes an Enemy, yet Service, and Obedience, are ſtill due
to them; in as much as the Vices of the Fathers cannot affect
the Duty of the Children. <hi>Cham</hi> got a Curſe for diſcovering
his Father's Nakedneſs, while <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth</hi> got a Bleſſing
by covering it. Why ſhould <hi>Cham</hi> be curſed, if <hi>Noah</hi>'s Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs
had cancell'd his Son's Reſpect and Duty? And, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
his Majeſty's Children abhor the thoughts of but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
their Duty to their Natural Parent and Soveraign at
preſent waved, or extinguiſhed; leſt upon the breach of the
Fifth Commandment, of not honouring their Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
their days ſhould not be long in the Land; beſides the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
of Eternity.</p>
            <p>(Pag. 4.) The firſt 7 Verſes of the 13th. Chapter to the <hi>Romans</hi>
are ſet down; in which the Duty of the Magiſtrate, as well as the
Obedience of the Subject, are ſet forth, and ſo mixt together, as that
our Author thence concludes—upon the total failing of the one, the
other does likewiſe ceaſe.</p>
            <p>But firſt, does this hold on both Sides? Then, if Rebels and
Traytors have totally failed their Duty of Allegiance, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
is not to do his; not to try, judg, nor condemn, nor ſee
them executed. Is that it, which you would be at? Why then
do you blame the King for going away, from that his Duty? But
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43334:3"/>
thus much only to ſhew the Weakneſs of your Reaſoning. As
to the Text, St. <hi>Paul</hi> meant it primarily, and literally, of <hi>Nero,</hi>
the worſt of Men and Princes; who was ſo very far from doing
his Duty, or protecting our Religion, that he was a grievous
Tyrant, and a mighty Terror to good Works; and yet the
Apoſtle commands all, without exception, to be ſubject to
him, not becauſe he was a <hi>good</hi> Governour (for that he was
not) but becauſe he was one of the Higher Powers; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had received that Power, not from any mutual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
of the People, but only from God, whoſe Vicegerent he
was (though never ſo bad;) ſince there is no Argument ever
yet able to ſhake that Aſſertion, <hi>That there is no Power but of
God, and the Powers that be are ordained of him:</hi> Whoſoever
therefore reſiſteth (not the Vice and Wickedneſs of the Man,
but) the Power and Ordinance of God, lodged in that Man,
ſhall receive to themſelves Damnation; from which, good
Lord, deliver us all.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Nero</hi> was the worſt, ſo <hi>Saul</hi> was none of the beſt of
Princes; and yet <hi>David</hi> ſtiles him, 1 <hi>Sam. 24. 8. My Lord the
King;</hi> and owns him his Soveraign, becauſe he was the Lord's
Anointed, <hi>Ver.</hi> 10. and this not out of Flattery and Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
but Loyalty and Duty; for he had been far from a Saint
after God's own Heart, if (even upon any Occaſion) he had
let himſelf looſe to ſpeak evil of Dignities.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> I will add a third, and that is <hi>Pilate,</hi>
whoſe Power <hi>Chriſt</hi> owned to have been from above, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 11.
and therefore ſubmitted to it even to the Death, though there
was no Law of the <hi>Romans</hi> by which he could be put to Death,
<hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 31, 38. and when he ſuffered, he threatned not, but
committed himſelf (not to Arms and Revenge) but to him
that judgeth Righteouſly, thereby leaving us an Example
that we ſhould follow his ſteps: And accordingly all the
primitive and ſucceeding Chriſtians fought the Battles of
all their Pagan Emperors and Tyranical Perſecutors, without
Reſiſtance, or ever aiding the Armies of the Rebels. <hi>Tertullian</hi>
glories, that when <hi>Poſſenius Nigar</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Clodius Albinus</hi>
in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britany,</hi> rebelled againſt <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> that
bloody and cruel Emperor, and pretended Piety, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43334:4"/>
Good, yet that none of the Chriſtians joyned with
either.</p>
            <p>And the noble <hi>Thebaean</hi> Legion, in the 18. of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> are
moſt eminently Famous for laying down 6666 Lives at the
command of the Emperor <hi>Maximinian,</hi> when they could
eaſily have ſaved them; if they could have imagined, that
the Protection of the Magiſtrate failing, it was Lawful for
the Subject to withdraw his Obedience. This is viſible through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all Ages and Places of the Chriſtian Church, and has been
ever moſt eminently the conſtant Doctrine and Practice of
this Church of <hi>England,</hi> in her Articles, Conſtitutions, and
Behaviours; however ſome that have been willing to rejoyce
in Iniquity have imagined ſome Occaſion of triumph, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of ſome Perſons, and Things, which perhaps they do
not fully underſtand: But there is too much behind.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 4.) The King's Zeal for his Religion never puſhed
him beyond the Meaſures of a pious and juſt Prince: If he
attempted any thing that has appeared ſince Illegal, it was
againſt his Will, having had the Judgment and Deciſion of all
(or moſt of) the Judges, and many other Proteſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors
Learned in the Law, upon their Oaths, and Conſciences,
That what they put him upon, was ſo far from Subverting the
Eſtabliſhment of our Religion and Laws, that he thought he
did no more than his Royal Predeceſſors had done; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and King <hi>James,</hi> by their Legal,
and Acknowledged Prerogative, which is Law, as well as
thoſe Priviledges which concern the Subject, according to
Statute, as well as Common, and Natural Law.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 5.) Seeing you grant, That if the King was in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Danger, he was then driven away: I ſhall only ſay, that
as long as the King did rationally believe it, and all his
Friends, you and I ought to believe it too, or at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce
ſo far in it, as that his Majeſty hath not thereby for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
his Crown, and Right: It is more mannerly to ſuppreſs
the diminiſhing Conditions of (what you call) a Treaty, than
inſiſt upon the hardneſs, or unacceptableneſs of any of them;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43334:4"/>
as for the Seals they may be brought again, by the ſame
Hand that took them away, at a convenient Seaſon.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 6.) Allegiance ſtands in its full force, make you
what Conſequence you pleaſe; neither is it under any Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion,
for none but God can Suſpend it, or Legally put the
Regency into other Hands: Neither is there any Incapacity,
by being Affected, and Culpable; for nothing is ſuppoſed to
be Culpable in the Perſon of a Lawful King, in reſpect of his
Subjects, who are no competent Judges of what are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
his Faults.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 8.) As for the terms of Security, the beſt way is to
leave them to him, who is the only Ruler of Princes, <hi>By whom
alone Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Judgment;</hi> and that without
the expectation of Miracles, to preſerve us under our again
reſtored Sovereign; foraſmuch as he ſees thoſe Rocks upon
which he daſh'd before, and doubleſs will avoid them, as
becomes ſo Great, ſo Wiſe, and ſo Experienced a Prince:
Neither need we now fear any Jeſuits in the Council, no, nor
ſo much as any Papiſt in the Government; ſeeing they now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and deſire no more Priviledge than they have in <hi>Holland,</hi>
nor ſo much neither, unleſs the King and Parliament ſhall
vouchſafe it them; no danger therefore of throwing our ſelves
back into any miſerable Condition upon the King's return.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 10.) Oaths are binding, although thoſe in behalf
of whom they are taken do not perform their part. The
breach of one Man's Duty, will not Legitimate an others.</p>
            <p>The Matrimonial Oath is not abſolutely made for term of
Life, but God himſelf has put in an Exception in the caſe of
Adultery, which he has not done in the caſe of Loyalty;
wherefore the Oath of Allegiance binds <hi>ſemper, &amp; ad ſemper,</hi>
and admits of no Intermiſſion, or Interception. The King
never ceaſes to be a King till he ceaſes to be a Man; and it is
a contradiction <hi>in terminis,</hi> that the next Heir, ſhould be at
the ſame time King: For if he be actually King, he is no
Heir; and while he is an Heir, he is no King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43334:5"/>
(<hi>Pag.</hi> 11.) For all your new fangled Interpretation of that
Maxim—<hi>The King can do no Wrong;</hi> it is to be underſtood of
the King's Perſon, not his Power, in your Senſe; for his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
even in his Minſters, may poſſibly do amiſs; but this is
not to be imputed to, or exacted of his Perſon, but his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments,
whoſe fault it is, if he be not better adviſed.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 12.) As for the Preſidents of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
II. 'tis too long to examine their Hiſtories: But, let me
offer in general, that never any King of <hi>England</hi> was Judged
in Parliament for their <hi>Male Adminiſtration,</hi> in Quiet and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
Times, but always ſoon after ſome great Commotions or
Rebellions. And would you bring the Acts of the <hi>Rump,</hi> or
thoſe at the latter end of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. Reign, for Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of Law, eſpecially againſt a King?</p>
            <p>For the Judgments of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. whether
they were ever revoked or not, by the ſucceeding Kings, is a
Queſtion; but this is certain, that ſome of the Conſpirators
againſt <hi>Edward</hi> II. were in the <hi>4th.</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> III. adjudged and
attainted in Parliament, although the King was but a Child.
And as to that againſt <hi>Richard</hi> II. it was given in the Firſt
Parliament of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. whoſe Son, and Son's Son, reigned
after him, and was the Foundation of their Uſurping Titles,
and ſo could not be for their Honour or Intereſt to have them

claimed from <hi>Edward</hi> III. and not from <hi>Richard</hi> II. he leaving
no Iſſue, whoſe buſineſs it might have been, more properly,
to have ſeen the Judgments againſt his Father abrogated.</p>
            <p>Beſides, notwithſtanding that, <hi>Richard</hi> II. was Murthered
ſo Inhumanly, yet he was ſeveral times ſet up, by the People,
againſt <hi>Henry</hi> IV. which ſhews what Opinion they had of that
Scandalous Judgment.</p>
            <p>But for that againſt <hi>Charles</hi> I. which was much of the ſame
Nature, all the proceedings againſt that Unfortunate Prince
were, by Act of Parliament, ordered to be taken off the File,
Eraced, and (if I am not miſtaken) ordered to be burnt by
the Common Hang-man; and the Perſons concerned, by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
Attainted, and moſt of them Executed. Beſides,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43334:5"/>
conſidering the diſtance of time between <hi>Richard</hi> II. and <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
IV. which was 60 Yeras probably eraſing them would
not quit Coſt, nor be <hi>tanti,</hi> in compariſon of the Smoak and
Puther thoſe Agitations might raiſe, between King and People;
to prevent which, the Wiſdom of thoſe latter Definitions (you
ſpeak of) is Conſpicuous, and has been Succeſsfull to the
Peace and Welfare of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But our Author in this matter, (as well as to the Right of a
Husband, who Marries the Heireſs of the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi>)
ſhews his little Reading in the Laws and Statutes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
For if he had any, he would have remembered what
the Parliament, by an Eſtabliſhed Law has declared, after
giving a Hiſtory of the Proceedings againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> I.
<hi>That by the undoubted and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Laws of this Kingdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12 Car. 2. cap. 30.</note> 
               <hi>neither the
Peers of this Realm, nor the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
nor both together, in Parliament
or out of Parliament, or the People col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively
or repreſentatively, nor any other
Perſon whatever, ever had, have, hath, or
ought to have, any Coercive Power over
the Perſons of the Kings of this Realm,</hi>
which is, I hope, a full Abrogation or Declaration of the Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
of thoſe Judgments of <hi>Edward</hi> II. and <hi>Richard</hi> II. with
a Witneſs.</p>
            <p>The Convention, which you call the Repreſentative of the
Kingdom, having ſuch an Honour and Deference to the Prince,
it is to be hoped, they will concur with his Highneſs, in laying
the blame on the <hi>Evil Counſellors</hi> rather than on the Sacred
Perſon (which you acknowledge ſo) of the King, his Father,
and Uncle, and great Obliger.</p>
            <p>As to the calling his Majeſty's Honour in queſtion, he has
born a great deal of that already. In Gods Name; If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mother, Father, Nurſe, Midwife, Servants, will come
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43334:6"/>
in, and confeſs all, with due credible Circumſtances, (out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighing
the Depoſitions upon Oath, of ſo many Proteſtants,
and others) let them come forth and be heard; and that with
all ſafety, till the Truth be out. <hi>Let us try all things, and hold
faſt that which is good;</hi> and let Truth never fear the Frowns of
any Impoſture, how great and powerfull ſoever. This, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
is the <hi>Cardo Controverſiae;</hi> and, I hope, we may wiſh
his Majeſty's Affairs, and all his Royal Family, may thrive
and proſper according to the Merit of that great Cauſe.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 13.) The 10th. Paragraph is wholly ſpent in throwing
down the imaginary Treaty with the King; and the Arguments
are ſo ſtrong againſt any indecent Propoſal that I cannot an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them; neither is it the Intereſt of the Cauſe, if I could.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag. 14. Parag.</hi> 11.) There my Author contends, That
<hi>this Nation is a Proteſtant Kingdom incompatable with Popery, or a
Popiſh King,</hi> witneſs the Excluſioners—You know it was
compatable before the Reformation; and you ought to know,
That Dominion is not founded in Grace: Neither do the
Temporal Rights of Princes depend upon Religion, whether
true or falſe. The Power of the Magiſtrate is never the more
from God, becauſe he is a good Man; and never the leſs
from God, becauſe he is a bad Man: To this purpoſe is that
of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his Fifth Book <hi>de Civitate Dei,—Qui Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſto
ipſe &amp; Neromi, &amp;c. Qui Conſtantino Chriſtiano, ipſe Apoſtatae
Juliano, &amp;c. He that gave the Soveraign Power to</hi> Auguſtus,
<hi>gave it likewiſe to</hi> Nero; <hi>and he that conferred it upon</hi> Conſtantine
<hi>a Chriſtian, beſtowed it in like manner upon</hi> Julian <hi>an Apoſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag.</hi> 15.) As for the King's Friends, I dare ſay you, Sir,
are none of them; and they know how to conſtrue his Abſence
from them, without your invidious ſuggeſtion of his aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
them. True Friendſhip, much leſs ſteady Loyalty, will
never think ill of a Prince in ſuch Circumſtances; who has
done ſo much good, and ſo little deſerved any ill Uſage from
his Subjects. As for the disbanding the Army; What danger
was there of their turning <hi>Banditti,</hi> when there was ſuch a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43334:6"/>
potent and ſucceſsful Prince, and power to ſuppreſs them? And the
event ſhews this ſuggeſtion to have been meer Malice. <q>Upon all
this, <hi>Is it Natural?</hi>
               </q> I ſay it is <hi>Unnatural to declare the Throne void,</hi>
which the Law looks upon as Impoſſible; no, not upon the Death
of a King, who in Law never dies; inſomuch that it never admits
of an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> much leſs vacancy for another Candidate. <q>That
the King therefore has fallen from all Right to the Throne,</q> is a
Chimaera, and Figment of this Authors Brain, proceeding from a
<hi>vacuum,</hi> or vacancy, never known, or underſtood, or read of before.</p>
            <p>As to the King's return from <hi>Feverſham.</hi>—Doubtleſs had he
thought himſelf in Safe and Honorable Circumſtances, he had ſtay'd;
and, then there would have been no want of the Seals, or a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or any other Conceſſion, that was fit for a good King to grant,
to make his People happy; which they can never be, <hi>Without render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Things that are</hi> Caeſars; and acknowledging <hi>the Lords
Anointed,</hi> to be their only Lawful Sovereign during his Life.</p>
            <p>(<hi>Pag. 16. line 3. Errata.</hi>) Inſtead of <hi>Unbounded,</hi> read <hi>Legal,</hi> or
<hi>Scriptural,</hi> or Primitive Loyalty; which is as much as the King, or
our Clergy call for.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, Your <hi>Flurts</hi> and Dawbing, can never alter the
Steady Principles of the Reverend and Learned Clergy, who have
declared themſelves abundantly, ever ſince the Reformation, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the Crown, and in Favour of entire Loyalty: And it is not
<hi>Nature</hi> (as you ſay) they muſt Conquer, but Scripture and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Primitive and Eſtabliſh'd Authority, their own great Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and their well regulated Conſciences; if they ever depart from
the Glory of the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Loyalty, which they have ſo
Nobly, ſo Faithfully, and ſo Dutifully Aſſerted and Propagated, as
a moſt Evident and Fundamental Truth.</p>
