            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O go about to prove that the <hi>Holy Fast</hi> of <hi>Lent</hi> was
first taught the World by the Apostles of our Lord
Jesus, I know very well, is, as they say, <hi>Actum agere,</hi>
to do what has been done; and that very efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
fifteen years agoe, by Dr. <hi>Gunning,</hi> now
Bishop of <hi>Ely.</hi> in his Elaborate and useful Treatise
on this Subject; Printed by his Majesties special
Command, in the year 1662. And I perswade my
self, had the rest of the Clergy taken but a quarter of the pains in
Reading and Studying that Rational Discourse, which the Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
did in compiling of it, they would have been so well satisfied of
the great benefit of Religious Fasting in general; as also that the first
Planters of Christianity were the first Institutors of the Lent-Fast in
par-ticular; that they would not have dared, but to have Religiously
observed it themselves, &amp; to have taught the like Observation to their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109113:3"/>
Parishoners in their respective Districts. But it being too too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that very little notice is taken of that Sacred Penitential time, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Priest or People, I resolved to press its observation not only
by renewing my Lord of <hi>Ely's</hi> Arguments; but also by superadding
some particular Reflections of my own.</p>
            <p>Omnipotent Iesus, who wrought so many Miracles of Love when you
were upon Earth, Curing the Blind, Deaf, and Dumb; now from
Heaven work upon me a miracle of Iustice, and Wither my hand, or
strike me Blind, if I be about to write any thing in favour of Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Will-worship: But if I design nothing, but to perswade a practice
which was taught the World, either by your Blessed Self, or your Holy
Apostles, Bless me according to your great mercy, and bless my poor
Labours to all those, into whose hands they shall come.</p>
            <p>I confess it was my Unhappiness to be Educated in <hi>Puritanism,</hi> or
<hi>Non-Conformity,</hi> and to look upon the keeping of Lent as a fruitless
Superstition: But thanks be to Almighty God, I now dare no more
eat Flesh in Lent, than I dared to Work upon a <hi>Lords Day,</hi> when I
was a <hi>Non-Conformist.</hi> But how was this strange Change wrought
in me? I'le tell you: Reading in one of Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
upon <hi>Ash-Wednesday,</hi> how we were to take notice, th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t before
<hi>Popery</hi> was batch'd, St. <hi>Hierom</hi> taught the keeping of Lent was an
Apostolical Tradition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hereupon, I began to reason with my
self: If the Apostles ordained the keeping of Lent, why should not I
keep it? And I confess, setting my self to the keeping of it; before
<hi>Easter</hi> I was so satisfied of the great benefit of Religious Fasting, that
one might as soon have perswaded me, that Hony was not
sweet, as that Fasting was not strangely profitable to the Soul, or that
Lent-Fast had any thing of Superstition in it: So true did I find those
words of our Blessed Saviour, <hi>Iohn 7 17. If any one will do his,</hi> that
is, Gods <hi>Will; he shall know concerning my Doctrine, whether it be
from God, or I speak from my self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My deerest Friends, would you indeed gladly be satisfied, whether
Fasting in <hi>Lent</hi> be <hi>Superstition</hi> or no? Set your selves in a Christian
manner to Fast that Holy Time, and you shall know whether such
a practice be from God, or a human Invention? That is, Content your
selves every day in <hi>Lent</hi> with onely one temperate Meal, of less Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury
and less Nourishing Victuals; not out of any Superstitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
as if one Meat were more unclean than another, but out of a
Pious design to humble your selves before God for your sins, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your selves unworthy of the coursest fair, and the smallest
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109113:3"/>
quantity; judging your selves, that you may not be judged of our
Lord. Take the Rod into your own hand, and gently Chastise your
selves here, to prevent the more severe Animadversion of your Lord
hereafter: Being well assured that the All-merciful Jesus will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the same faults to be punished twice. If you punish your selves for
them in this World, He'l not punish you for them in the other; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
your exterior Humiliation be accompanied with a hearty inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
repentant sorrow. It is not imaginable what difficulty our
proud Nature makes to condemn it self, though never so deservedly:
To acknowledge for example a practice to be Holy and Good, which
for many years we have totally neglected as Superstitious, and to no
purpose. A little experimental knowledge of the great Spiritual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Religious Christian Fasting, would strangely conduce to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
our Eyes to see the force of such Arguments, as prove Lent-Fast
to be Apostolical. Had we a little tasted how good it is for the Soul,
to afflict the Body with Fasting, we should easily be perswaded to see a
pious observation of Lent was well worthy the Institution of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
and well worthy our Blessed Lords Fasting forty days, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
us thereunto. And the truth is, In this latter Age, amongst too
too many Christians, little more than the name of Fasting being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
the thing it self, according to the Primitive practice, being in
a manner lost; no wonder vast multitudes should easily be perswaded
to deem Lent an useless Superstitious Ceremony. Having put away a
good Conscience, as to a Religious Observation of that Holy Time—,
no wonder if we made Shipwrack of our Faith, of its Apostolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.
Too too many Christians in Lent, and upon other Fasting-days,
giving themselves all liberty of drinking Wines, and other
strong Liquors, both at Meals and betwixt Meals, and stuffing
themselves plentifully, at Noon, with all sorts of Fish and other Vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ands,
which their Purses could reach, provided they were not Flesh;
and pampering Nature again in the Evening with a large proportion
of solid Sustenance, and with whatsoever quantity of strong
drink they please; no wonder if such Fasters as these were easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
such a Lent-Fast as this was never appointed by the Holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
of our Lord Jesus. Is this the Fast our B. Saviour excused his
Disciples from, as above their spiritual strength, till such time as they
should have received the Holy Ghost after his departure? Is this the
Fast that has a power to cast out Devils; to obtain the Holy Ghost
for our selves or others; to appease God All-mighties Anger to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a particular Person, City, or Country? Would <hi>Nineveh,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:109113:4"/>
think you, have escaped the Destruction which <hi>Ionas,</hi> in the Name of
Almighty-God threatned it with, had its King Proclaimed and
practised such a Fast as this? Might he not rather justly have feared,
for such a damnable Hypocrisie of pretending to humble himself by
Fasting, when he did nothing less; that he and his people, instead
of within forty days, within twenty should have been utterly
destroyed.</p>
            <p>I remember to have read, how that the Primitive Christians, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
in their souls a more lively sense and apprehension of our B. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
humble Birth, and painful Death, were wont often to go to
<hi>Bethlehem</hi> and Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> there to make their Prayers and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations;
reflecting, and no doubt with a singular profit to their
Souls, that there their dear Redeemer was humbly born, and here
the same Redeemer pitiously died for them. But the Devil envying
these good Christians, their so profitable Devotions, by a cunning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
thus thought to deterr them from them. He suggested to the
Pagans, to set up the Statue of <hi>Adonis</hi> in the Stall of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and
the Statue of <hi>Venus</hi> on the Mount of <hi>Calvary,</hi> so that the Devout
Christians could not now go either to the one place or the other, to
help their Religious Piety, without seeming superstitiously to worship
<hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Adonis.</hi> A lively representation me-thinks this, of the
notorious abuse the same Devil has put upon us Christians in our
yearly Observations of <hi>Christmas,</hi> in memory of our Saviours Birth,
and weekly Observation of <hi>Friday,</hi> in memory of his Death. The
Primitive Christians weekly observed the day of our Lords bitter
Death and Passion, afflicting their Souls for their sins with penitential
sorrow, and their bodies with rigorous Fasting, both the quantity and
quality of their Diet, rather expelling Death than cherrishing Life.
The same first Christians yearly observed the time of their Lords Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity,
but so Religiously, as it was manifest their study was to
fatten their souls with devout Meditations, &amp; not to pamper their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
with delicious fair: The Devil envying the Church of Christ, so
great profit, from the pious observation of these Holy Times, he sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gests
to sensual Libertines so to prophane the Holy Time of <hi>Christmas,</hi>
with excessive Rioting, that none could profess to keep it without
playing the Debauche; and so to abuse the Religious Fast of <hi>Friday,</hi>
and other times of Christian Abstinence by an intolerable excess in
all sorts of Fish and Wine, and dainty Comfitures, that none could
pretend to observe them without playing the Hypocrites, professing to
afflict their bodies with Austere Fasting, when they pampered them by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109113:4"/>
delicate Feasting. But what Remedy? Abandon the profane Abuse,
and recall the first Pious use. Demolish the Statues of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donis,</hi>
but help your Devotions still by Visiting the Sanctified places of
our Lords Birth and Passion.</p>
            <p>Though you must give me leave to tell you, that I fear, were the
matter well examin'd, it would be found that not others uncouth, exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
manner of Fasting, but our own Inordinate desire of eating when
we will, what we will, and as much as we will; that is of not Fasting
at all, is the true cause of our Cavilling at the Holy Fast of Lent, and
other times of Abstinence. Let it be. Some, who pretend to Fast, do
nothing less, abstaining indeed from Flesh, but giving scope to their
Sensuality in other things: But they say, <hi>Carpere vel noli, vel
meliora face.</hi> Either do not carp at our Fasting, or else Fast
more strictly your selves. And those who are so forward in
Reproaching to their Neighbours their Mock-fasts, I fear if they
were obliged to Fast, would find but difficulty enough, even to
fast so largely, as they do, whose Fastings they carpe at. And
though indeed you may find too too many Libertines, who study by
all means possible to avoyd the difficulty of Church-Fasts, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Drinking, and intemperance in Meats not prohibited; yet
those of a better Conscience, though they come far short of the rigor
of the Primitive Christians in their Abstinence, yet do so Fast, as their
fasting days, are days of real Mortification unto them. As for Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,
its rather to be wondered they will deny themselves, even to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from Flesh, than that they take the liberty they do upon Fasting-days.
Do not so wholly fix your Eyes upon the Cockle, as you take
no notice at all of the good Corn.</p>
            <p>But to the Point undertaken to be proved. How may one, who
with his soul, desires nothing more than to observe most Religiously
all Apostolical Ordinations, be satisfied that the Holy Apostles of our
Lord Jesus ordained the Quadragesimal Fast of Lent as a time of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
and Humiliation for all Christians? Let him throughly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
himself, that Fasting is a Christian duty, and has a singular force
to cast out the Devil to obtain the Holy Ghost, to appease the All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties
just Anger, and which shall have a singular reward in Heaven.
And moreover, let him reflect, if any Credit be to be given to the
Old and New Scripture, and to Eccesiastical History, the more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
any one has been for Piety and Sanctity, the more exemplar have
they been for Fasting and Abstinence. <hi>Moyses, Elias, Daniel, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109113:5"/>
Anne,</hi> great <hi>Fasters</hi> under the old Law; St. <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> our
Blessed Saviour, St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and all the Apostles under the
Gospel. St. <hi>Paul</hi> testifies of himself, that he <hi>Fasted</hi> often: Our
B. Saviour assures us concerning all his Disciples, that when he was
taken from them, they should <hi>Fast.</hi> To say nothing of our <hi>Basils,
Hieroms,</hi> and <hi>Augustines,</hi> &amp;c. whose <hi>Fasts</hi> were very frequent and
very rigorous, and yet we cannot, without injury to the Apostolical
Colledge, surmise, that those later Fathers of Christs Church, should
surpass either in Piety or Abstinence, the first Planters of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
By which it is evident to every Christian Man, that <hi>Fasting</hi> in
general is very well becoming every good Christian; and that he
hardly deserves the name of a Christian, who wanting neither health
nor strength, yet <hi>Fasts</hi> not at all. And indeed, if we examin the
matter well, we shall find that one great end of our Lord Jesus, His
coming into the World, was to save us from our sins, by Teaching,
by his Doctrin, and by enabling us by his Example, and other graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Assistances, fervourously to practise the propitiatory Humiliation
of <hi>Fasting.</hi> Our All-wise Mediator, understanding very well, that
could he but bring us heartily to Repent us of our sins, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
the sincerity of our interior Contrition by exterior Humiliation
or <hi>Fasting;</hi> such was the genius of his Eternal Father, that he could
not but pardon us, how great, or how many soever our sins might
be: But on the contrary, we refusing to Repent, and that even in
Sack-cloath and Ashes, that is, with such a Repentance as shows it
self by some exterior acts or other, no Prayers, no Tears, no Blood,
no Death of his could possibly obtain our pardon, except we would
Repent, Perish we must, and that Eternally.</p>
            <p>But what conduces this to perswade <hi>Lent-Fast,</hi> was appointed by
the Apostles? Very much. For we having hence, that <hi>Fasting</hi> is a
necessary Christian duty, and strangely conducing to save the World
from sin, it evidently follows, it was well worthy the Apostles, the
better to secure so useful a practice, to determin certain days every
ye<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r, in which all Christians should be obliged to humble themselves
by Abstinence, as to the quantity and quality of their Food; they
knowing very well by the Unction of the Holy Ghost, what we know
by too sad experience, that the generality of the people being left to
Fast when they pleased, would please to Fast seldom or never at all.
Nay moreover, it follows hence, that the Institution of set-days of
Abstinence was not only well worthy of the Apostles, but also that it
cannot well be understood how they could be faithful to their charge
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109113:5"/>
of the Souls of the whole World, and neglect by the proviso of such
an Ordination, to propagate to all Generations an Universal practice
of <hi>Fasting</hi> amongst Christians. For, though it were granted that the
Primitive Christians were so fervorous both in Piety to God, and in
Mortification to themselves, as they neither stood in need of set Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-days
to invite them to their Prayers, nor of set <hi>Fasts</hi> to invite them
to Penitential works. Every day was a Lords day to them, so long
and frequent were their devout Prayers, and other spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises;
the whole year was one continued <hi>Lent</hi> unto them, so rigid
was their daily Abstinence. Although, I say, all this were granted
to the Honour of the Primitive Christian fervor; yet it lying upon
the Apostles to secure all Christian practices, not only for their own
days, but to all Generations, as much as in them lay; and they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing
by the light of the Holy Ghost, how apt tepid Posterity would
be to excuse themselves from all obligation of the hard and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
duty of <hi>Fasting</hi> upon any set-times, had they been left free to
<hi>Fast</hi> when and how they pleased; this, I say the H. Apostles foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
their very Office seems to have obliged them from the beginning
to ordain not only certain Festival days, but certain <hi>Fasting</hi> days al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
lest after-Generations should say, Our Ancestors went to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
without <hi>Fasting</hi>-Lent, or other set <hi>Fasts,</hi> and why may not we?
And indeed, had not the Holy and long <hi>Fast</hi> of Lent been instituted by
the first planters of Christianity over all the World, Provincial, or
General Councils would have found it too hard a task to have obliged
all Christian Countrys to an observation so repugnant to the natural
inclination of Man-kind. And this consideration alone does not a
little encline me to believe that the Apostles of our Lord Jesus did
actually, and indeed ordain the Christian Lent-<hi>Fast.</hi> For, is it a
likely Story that the Apostles and Primitive Christians <hi>Fasted</hi> as
seldom, and in such a manner as our <hi>Non Conformists</hi> do, only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
their good Flesh-meal till three a Clock in the Afternoon for
five or six times a year: But when Christians in after-Ages grew
cold in all Christian exercises, they fell to Abstinence from flesh, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
themselves with less nourishing, and less savory Viands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Evening, three days every Quarter, and forty days every
Year, besides the Eves of several Festivities, and two days of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
every week? Is this, I say, a likely story? Or is it not rather
much more likely that the Holy Apostles, all over the World, taught
their first Converts, both by their Example and Doctrin to <hi>Fast</hi> very
often, and very strictly? but after-Ages growing more languid, as in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109113:6"/>
all Christian exercises, so especially in <hi>Fasting,</hi> as hardest and most
contradictory to flesh and blood; at length they came to <hi>Fast</hi> so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misly,
even upon days of the very Apostles Ordination, that they
added to one full Meal about Noon, a Collation at Night, and that
such a one too, as would hardly have been allowed a Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faster for his whole dayes Refection? I desire the impartial
Reader would be pleased to consider which of these two is the more
likely story, and to encline accordingly towards the belief of Lents
being an Apostolical Ordination. Or did the Primitive Christians
<hi>Fast</hi> indeed very often, and very strictly, urged hereunto by their
extraordiuary fervor, but without any extrinsical Law obliging them
hereunto, upon any set-days or times; but in after-Generations, the
Primitive inward fervor being lost, did Christians generally <hi>Fast</hi>
seldom, and very remisly; which their Pastors observing, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for their souls good: Did they hereupon Ordain Lent, and other
<hi>Fasting</hi> days as an extrinsical help to recover in their languishing
Flock the Primitive Christian practice of <hi>Fasting?</hi> According to that
of the Apostle, <hi>The Law is not made for the Iust Man, but for the
Vnjust,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 8. This might not without some probability be
surmized, were it not contrary to all Ecclesiastical History, which
makes mention of Lent in the most Primitive times, as I shall say here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>But Efficaciously to prove the holy <hi>Fast</hi> of Lent was taught the
Christian world by the Apostles of our B. Saviour. I confess I was
not present when St. <hi>Peter,</hi> or S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or any other of the Apostles
Preached to their first Converts the observation of Lent. Neither
were you present, I believe, when S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ his Epistle to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans;</hi>
and yet I perswade my self, you think you are able to satisfie
any reasonable man that he did write it. Then why may not I be able
also, to prove satisfactorily that the holy Apostles did teach the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Lent, though I was not present at any of their Sermons
or Exhortations to that purpose? Or perhaps, will you say, You
matter not who writ the Epistle to the <hi>Romans.</hi> Having diligently
Read and perused it, you fear not with all confidence to aver, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
writ this Letter, I am sure the Holy Ghost Indited it: I know
it by its very stile, and its other intrinsecal Vertues, there's a Divine
Character stamp'd upon it, by which I clearly distinguish it from all
human Writings; and this suffices me, to make me receive it as a rule
of my Faith and Manners. But this would be small satisfaction to a
Pagan, who doubts of the Divine Authority of that holy Epistle, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109113:6"/>
you could make him also discern that Sacred Impress, which you
say you so clearly distinguish; take heed you do not mistake. 'Tis
Education I fear has made both you and me bear that Reverence we
do to that and whatsoever else Portion of holy Writ we receive. Had
we been Educated in Judaism, in all likelihood we should have as little
regarded the New Testament, as we do now Mahomets Alcaron. I
could tell you also, that I know by the nature of Lent it self, it must
be Instituted and first taught by Missionants sent from Heaven, and
enumerating the singular benefits that accrue to a devout soul, Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
observing of it; I could moreover make even you, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Non-observer</hi> of it, as well as my self see it must needs at first
come from a good Spirit, that wished Man-kind well, for that it so
strangely conduces to the perfecting of human Nature, and to the
adorning of it with many excellent Vertues. For example: If I
<hi>Fast</hi> to afflict and humble my self before God Almighty for my sins,
my <hi>Fasting</hi> is an act of Repentance. If I eat less my self, that I may
have the more to give to those that are in Necessity, my <hi>Fast</hi> is an
act of Charity. If I <hi>Fast</hi> the better to dispose my self for Prayer, 'tis
an act of Religious Devotion. If I <hi>Fast,</hi> judging my self not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of any Delicacies, nor of my fill of even the coursest Fare, 'tis an
act of Humility, and disposes my soul moreover as little to affect fine
Cloaths or stately Dwellings, as I do good Victuals; and consequently
moderates my desires of Money and Riches, which are not desirable
by corrupt Nature, but for these or such like uses. If I <hi>Fast,</hi> that I
may be better able to pay my Debts, or provide my Children Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
'tis an act of Justice and Christian paternal Piety. If to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
my inordinate Appetite of Meat and Drink, 'tis an act of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance.
In fine, 'tis hard to name a Virtue which <hi>Fasting</hi> does not
strangely help to procure, maintain, and encrease. And after all this,
can either Pagan or Christian deny the holy <hi>Fast</hi> of <hi>Lent</hi> to have a
Divine Character stamp'd upon it? and must it be still stigmatized
with the ignominious brand of <hi>Superstition</hi> and <hi>Will-worship?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how do I know assuredly the Apostles of our B. Saviour
taught the Primitive Christians to <hi>Fast</hi> in <hi>Lent?</hi> Am I able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a grand Jury of so many Venerable old Men, who have been
miraculously kept alive ever since, and are ready to avouch as
much upon solemn Oath? No, not I. How do I then know it? Has
an Angel appeared to me, and told me as much? No. How then?
Why, how did the <hi>Israelites,</hi> who lived above two thousand years after
the Institution of the Sabbath, know, that God Almighty commanded
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109113:7"/>
their first Father <hi>Adam</hi> to keep it holy? They had no book of it;
the Book of <hi>Genesis</hi> being written above two thousand years after by
<hi>Moses.</hi> I conceive they knew it thus. <hi>Adam</hi> instantly upon God-Almighties
Command, set himself Religiously to observe that day,
and taught his Children to do so also; his Children practised and
taught their Children downwards, till <hi>Moses</hi> his days. Nor had any
reason to doubt of the Divine Institution of that first holy day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it was not transmitted and recommended to them by a Book.
Nor would it have been a sufficient excuse for any one then to have
pretended, how could they be certain that some of their Ancestors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them and <hi>Adam,</hi> had not of their own head superstitiously de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised
a Religious observation of that day before all others; unless
they could have produced some positive evidence of such an Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In like manner I say concerning the holy <hi>Fast</hi> of Lent. The
Holy Apostles first taught the observation of it in the several Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys
where they Preached the Gospel; their Converts fell to the
practice of it, and taught their Children in like manner; and so one
Generation another, till our present days, and this all over the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World. Now, unless <hi>Non-Conformists</hi> can shew when this bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome
precept of Fasting-Lent was imposed upon Christendom since
the first planting of Christianity, I cannot see how they can more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves from this Obligation, than could the <hi>Israelites</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
themselves from the keeping of <hi>Saturday</hi> Sabbath, which was
ordained two thousand years before they were born; and there was
also as yet no written Word of God at all for any such observation.
But what proof can be brought, that all intermediate Generations
since the Apostles, in several Christian Countrys, have kept Lent? A
much stronger then <hi>Iacob</hi> could bring to prove to his Children, that
<hi>Saturday</hi>-Sabbath had been kept ever since <hi>Adam.</hi> He could only
produce the Testimony of the present Generation, that so they had
been taught by their Fathers and Grand-fathers time out of mind;
nor had they any Tradition amongst them of a later beginning of such
an Observation: Written Records, Divine or Human he had none. I,
besides the Testimony of those of the present Age in several Christian
Countrys, who affirm that they have Immemorially from the first
planting of Christianity amongst them, Religiously observed Lent,
will produce by and by Records of above a thousand years standing
for its Apostolical Institution.</p>
            <p>But positively to prove that the Apostles appointed <hi>Lent,</hi> I argue
thus. Two hundred years agoe, <hi>England, France, Spain, Germany,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109113:7"/>
Italy,</hi> and all the Eastern Church, universally <hi>Fasted</hi> Lent, as 'tis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
by the Records and Annals of our own and those other Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Countrys. Therefore the Apostles taught Lent to their first Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
both in the Eastern and Western World where they Preached.
For it cannot be imagined that so many several Countrys, Kings, and
Subjects, Priests, and People, could by chance fall upon the yearly
practice of Abstaining from flesh forty days before <hi>Easter:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
they must either all at first be taught so by their first Masters of
Christianity, which is the Conclusion intended to be proved; or some
Universal Supream Authority, Ecclesiastical or Civil, must so have
commanded them to do; or some Preachers first in one Country, and
then in another, must so have perswaded them to do in some Age
since. But no Annals of our own, or other Christian Countrys
make any mention of any such Preachers, or any such Ordination
made by any general Council, Pope, Prince, or Emperor. Nor
yet have we, or other Cbristian Countrys wanted Ecclesiastical Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riographers,
who in their Memorials have taken notice of far lesser
matters than such an Innovation as this must needs have been, had the
Apostles taught the World no such Observance. And the truth is,
'tis pure Ignorance in Ecclesiastical History, and the works of the
Primitive Fathers, that makes so many waver in the Belief of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Institution of Lent; in which, if they were well Conversant,
they could not possibly doubt of it. Further, Not only two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years ago; but twelve hundred years agoe, Lent was Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
observed in the whole Christian World, both in the Eastern and
Western Church, as is manifest out of the pious works of the prime
Pillars and Pastors of Christs Church, in the fourth and fifth Century
of Christianity. Nor do the Opposers of Lent deny so much, and
therefore appeal to the first 300. years after our Saviour; for which
time, and for which only, they pretend the Christian worship was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted,
and not infected with the Superstitious observation of Lent.
And no doubt they have a great deal of reason to think so Charitably
of the Primitive Christians, who for the first 300. years after our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
were all over the World sought after to death, for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
that they would have a care to keep that Religion unspotted,
and teach the same faithfully to their Posterity, which they were all
ready every day to dye for, and many of them actually did dye for.
Besides, what a reproach would it be to our B. Saviour, that his
Church should be Universally over-run with Superstition within 300.
years after his Death; and yet <hi>Moses</hi> should be able so to establish a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109113:8"/>
Religion, as it should be transmitted to Posterity untainted for many
Generations? Especially when our Lord had promised that he would
so firmly settle and found his Church, that all the power of Hell
should never be able to prevail against it. But me-thinks our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
might extend their Charity to the Christians of the fourth, fifth,
and sixth Century, and not think they would have so little regard to
the Religion taught them, and Seal'd to them by their Ancestors with
their dearest blood, as immediately to change and corrupt it; and by
it so altered and corrupted, infect themselves and their Posterity as
much as in them lay, to all Generations, with a dangerous <hi>Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Will-worship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us suppose then that for the first 300. years of Christianity, the
Church of Christ in <hi>England, Italy, Greece,</hi> and other Countrys
observed no such thing as <hi>Lent-Fast;</hi> and consider by what means
possible, the fourth Age could not only bring it in all over the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World, but bring it in so secretly and covertly, that the prime
Doctors of the fifth Age should not be able to discern that this new
burden was superadded to Chri<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tianity by their immediate Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
but should be verily perswaded that such an observation had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorially
from Generation to Generation descended to them from
the first Planters of Christianity, the Apostles. And yet its evident
that the fifth Age did not only keep Lent, but also kept it as an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Institution; and the prime Christian Doctors of that Age
have left it upon Record in their diservedly admired works, that they
kept this <hi>Holy-fast</hi> as an Observance taught them by Tradition from
the Apostles. Hear their own words; St. <hi>Hierom</hi> in his Epistle to
<hi>Marcella: We Fast one Lent</hi> (Quadragesimam) <hi>within the compass of
the whole year, according to the Traditions of the Apostles, in a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
fit for us. The Montanists keep three Lents in the year, as if three
Saviours had suffered.</hi> Now, if for the first 300. years there had
been no such observance by Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> but if in the fourth
Century some Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> or some Provincial or general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
or Christian Emperor had first introduced it, could a Priest of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and one well versed in all Ecclesiastical matters as S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
was, err so grosly, as to mistake so new an Institution for an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical
Tradition, that is for an Observance taught the City of <hi>Rome</hi>
from Father to Son, from the Apostles? For the Greek Church, hear
the Testmimony of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches
of which See, it was entrusted by the first General Council,
that they should yearly signifie beforehand, to the rest of the Churche;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109113:8"/>
as well as their own, the true time of <hi>Easter.)</hi> In his first Paschal E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
he writes thus: <hi>Let us cure the divers wounds of Vices,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>And so may we enter the Fasts at hand, beginning Lent the</hi> 30th. <hi>day
of the Month</hi> Mechir (as it were our <hi>February,</hi> the <hi>Egyptians</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
30. days in every month) <hi>The week of the salutary Pasch, on the</hi>
5th. <hi>day of the Month</hi> Pharmuth, (or <hi>April) and ending the Fasts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Evangelical Traditions on the Evening of the</hi> Saturday,
<hi>being the tenth of</hi> Pharmuth; <hi>and on the next Lords day, the</hi> 11th. <hi>of the
same moneth, let us Celebrate the Feasts.</hi> The like he says in his second
Paschal Epistle; and again he says, <hi>according to the Evangelical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
I add the Testimony of S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> Patriarch of the same <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi>
in the next Age, in his 20th. Homily <hi>de festis Paschalibus.
So, to let us keep a pure Fast, beginning the Holy Lent from such a
day, ending also the Fasts on the</hi> 7th. <hi>day of</hi> Pharmuth, <hi>late in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
according to the Traditions Apostolical.</hi> The same S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> in
19. other of his Homily, cited by B. <hi>Gunning, de festis Paschalibus</hi>
(Preached in so many several years) refers the same <hi>Fasts</hi> of Lent
to Tradition, Appointment, or Instruction Evangelical. <hi>The Law of
Abstaining in Lent, was always in the Church,</hi> says the above-cited
<hi>Theophilus Alexandrinus.</hi> Now, can it be imagined that these two
Learned Patriarches (to whom, by the whole Christian Church was
committed the care of signifying the due time of Lent and <hi>Easter)</hi>
had the Holy <hi>Fast</hi> of Lent been so lately brought in by some Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Ecclesiastical or civil Authority, could be ignorant of it, and think,
and tell all the World also that they had been so taught to end Lent
from Generation to Generation, from the Apostles?</p>
            <p>Let it be. The Pastors of Christs Church in the fourth Century,
met together in a General Council, though for the first 300. years
there had been no such Custom amongst Christians to Fast Lent, might
make a Law of Abstinence from certain Meats for 40. days before
<hi>Easter,</hi> and command the whole Christian World to obey it; but they
could not possibly have the Impudence to annex to such an Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and thus we have been taught to Fast by Tradition from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
when they all must needs know themselves to be the first Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainers
of such an Observance: Nor could they possibly impose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Posterity such a belief, but their Posterity must needs know
that such a custom was no Antienter than their immediate Progenitors.
Which being so, how comes it to pass, that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> and other
Learned Doctors in the fourth and fifth Century, tell us that they kept
Lent by Tradition from the Apostles; if the Holy Apostles were not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109113:9"/>
the first Teachers of it, but some particular Preachers, or a General
Council, or some civil Ecclesiastical power since? The first opposers
of Lent, though they had the Impiety to call it Superstition and Will-worship,
yet they had not the Impudence to say they had been so
taught to call it from Father to Son, ever since the Apostles, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
their Ancestors for many hundred years had been in blindness
and ignorance; but they by reading the Holy Scriptures and Writers
of the first 300. years, found there was no such observance in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church. In like manner, had the keeping of Lent been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation,
the first Introducers of it must have pleaded for it in the
fourth or other Century, as the Opposers of it in this latter Age
pleaded against it. They must not have said, Abstain from certain
Meats in the Holy Time of Lent, for so we have been taught to do
from Father to Son from the Apostles, for every one would have
known this to be a notorious Lye; but they must have pretended to
have more light than their immediate Progenitors, and have said the
Apostles and Primitive Christians used such Abstinence; but fervor of
Piety decaying, the world for some Centuries had laid aside that holy,
but troublesome Mortification, and they were stirred up by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God to retrieve that Religious Primitive custom: But no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
History, in so much as any one Christian Country in the
world, makes mention of any such manner of introducing the <hi>Holy
Fast</hi> of Lent; but on the contrary, wheresoever Lent is observed,
the Observers of it profess from Generation to Generation to have
observed it, from the first planting of Christianity amongst them;
and wheresoever Lent is not observed, its Non-observers do profess
only from such a time to have not observed it; and their Ancestors
before that time, for divers Generations, ever since they cannot well
tell when, had blindly observed it; whence it is manifest that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Lent is the ancient Christian practice; and its non-obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
a Novelty.</p>
            <p>And indeed, had the keeping of Lent been a Novelty, and not heard
of in the Primitive times, its observance being so burthensome and
contrary to flesh and blood; and besides, as its Opposers say, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
also, its not possible it should be introduced not into one, but
into all the Christian Countrys of both the Eastern and Western
Church in a short time, and with a small industry of its Introducers,
and without great opposition both from good Men for its Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and from bad Men for its troublesomeness, to Corrupt nature. But
no Ecclesiastical History, though far lesser matters be Recorded,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109113:9"/>
makes mention of any such opposition made against Lent in its first
bringing in, or how, or by whom it was brought in, even into so
much as one particular Diocess. But all Records testifie that the prime
Doctors, both of the Greek and Latin Church, in the fifth and sixth
Century, have been most Religious Observers, and Zealous defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it, which certainly they would never have been, had Lent
been a Superstitious Novelty, and not heard of in the first 300. years.
And indeed, whosoever maturely considers the genius and temper of
the Christian Doctors and Bishops for the first five hundred years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Saviour, will find it impossible for all the power of Hell to
impose a Novelty upon them. For they were not like the seeming
Zelots of our Age, pretenders to new Lights; but their Profession
was, not to correct Antiquity, but faithfully to deliver to Posterity
what they immemorially from the Apostles had received from their
Ancestors; and their great Answer to Introducers of new Doctrines
or Practices was: <hi>Nihil novandum nisi quod traditum est. We must
Innovate nothing, but stick close to what has been delivered to us by our
Fore-fathers.</hi> Does a <hi>Montanus</hi> upon pretext of Divine Inspiration,
endeavor to impose upon Christians the observation of three Lents in
the year; the Church of Christ replys by one of her prime Doctors,
S. <hi>Hierom; We Fast one Lent within the compass of the whole year, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Tradition of the Apostles: The</hi> Montanists <hi>keep three
Lents in the year, as if three Saviours had suffered.</hi> For other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
I refer my Reader to the Golden Treatise of S. <hi>Vincentius
Lerinensis</hi> against Innovations. As for Pretenders to discover new
truths by reading of the Holy Scriptures, its easily conceivable how
such persons may be imposed upon by subtil Sophisters, and lead in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Superstitious practices, and made to believe Erroneous Doctrines,
to wit, by bad and new Interpretations of good and antient Scriptures.
But on the other side, how shall a Teacher of Novelties deceive a
Country, which is resolved to hold fast whatsoever Doctrin or
Practice was taught them by their immediate Progenitors, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the same Doctrin or Practice by an uninterrupted delivery
from Father to Son from the Apostles. Let him pretend Scriptures,
and bring a thousand places out of the Law, Psalms, Prophets, and
Apostles, what will the Reply be? The Scriptures you alledge we
Reverence, and have ever been taught to Reverence, them as Divine;
but we have been taught to interpret and understand them in another
manner and sense then you alledge them. Let him pretend Authority
of Doctors, as Learned as <hi>Origen,</hi> or as Holy as <hi>Cyprian;</hi> nay, if he

will, a whole Provincial-Council as numerous as that in <hi>Africa,</hi> which
determin'd Re-baptization of Persons Baptized by Hereticks; they
reply, We must not Innovate, we must hold to what was taught us
by our Ancestors. What means then to make persons thus disposed
to leave their antient faith and practice, and admit of a Novelty? you
must prove to them that you and they, and other Christians in several
Countrys have been taught so to believe by your immediate Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
and uninterruptedly from Father to Son from the Apostles;
but then you cease to be a Preacher of Novelties contrary to the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
Apply what has been said to our present Controversie.</p>
            <p>Now that the study of the Christian Church in the fifth Century
was, not to deliver to Posterity, Doctrins of her own devising, but
carefully to keep what she had received from her Fore-elders, and
faithfully to teach her Children what she had been taught by her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is manifest out of S. <hi>Vincent</hi> cited above, who lived in that Age,
and testifies that often asking of very many his Contemporaries fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for their Sanctity and Learning, how he might be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the truth of the Catholick Faith from the falsity of heretical pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
he always received this Answer in a manner from them all:
<hi>That if he desired to remain sound in his Faith, he must fortifie it; first
with the Authority of the divine Law, and then with the Tradition of
the Catholick Church;</hi> that is as he explicates himself afterwards: He
must examin what has always, all over the Christian Church, and by
all Christian Doctors, or in a manner by all, been Believed, and hold
to that against all Novelties, though defended by private Doctors,
never so Holy, or never so Learned, or producing never so many
Scriptures for themselves, if interpreted after a new manner. But
saies the same S. <hi>Vincent,</hi> chap. 2. <hi>Here perhaps some body may ask,
seeing the Canon of the Scriptures is perfect, and is it self sufficient,
and more than sufficient for all things; what need is there to add to it the
Authority of the Ecclesiastical or Churches understanding of it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the holy Scripture, by reason of its depth, is not by all taken in one
and the same sense; for</hi> Photinus <hi>expounds it one way,</hi> Sabellius <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
Donatus <hi>another,</hi> Arrius <hi>another.</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 41. He tells us how
the third General Council held in his days at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> proceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this rule, Condemned <hi>Nestorius.</hi> For the Fathers of that
Christian Synod, in number about 200. having consulted the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their Predecessors, the eminent Doctors of the Oriental and
Western Church, S. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> S. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> S. <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
S. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> S. <hi>Basil,</hi> S. <hi>Gregory Nyssen,</hi> S. <hi>Felix,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:109113:10"/>
S. <hi>Iulius,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> concerning their Controversie in
debate, they resolved to hold their Doctrin, to follow their Counsel
to believe their Testimony, to obey their Judgment. <hi>Quae tandem,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>What were at length</hi> (saies S. <hi>Vincent) the Voyces and Votes of them all,
but that what was anciently delivered should be kept; what was of late
invented should be exploded? After which we admired and proclaimed
the great Humility and Sanctity of that Council: In which so many
Priests, in a manner also the greater part were so many Metropolitans,
and of so great Erudition and Learning, as they were almost all able to
dispute of Dogms; to whom, when their gathering together in one,
seemed to add a confidence of daring and decreeing something from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
yet notwithstanding they would presume nothing, arrogate nothing
at all to themselves, but take all possible heed lest they should deliver to
their Posterity what themselves had not received from their Fathers;
and not only well disposed the matter for the present, but also give ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to them that were to come; to wit, that they should reverence the
Dogms of Sacred Antiquity, and condemn</hi> (adinventa) <hi>the additional
inventions of prophane Novelty.</hi> Had Abstinence from certain kind of
Meats for 40. days before <hi>Easter</hi> been a Superstitious Novelty, its
manifest no Introducer of it could have perswaded it to a Christian
Church thus principled, as the Doctors of this Age were. They
would all unanimously have reclaimed, nothing must be Innovated,
besides what has been delivered to us by our Ancestors. Or was
Lent first taught in the Age fore-going; and were the present Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
of this 5th. Age in the actual belief and practice of it? If so,
how possibly could they profess to be such Zelots for Antiquity, and
such Exploders of Novelty, and yet themselves most Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers
of a Superstitious practice, never heard of till it was of late
invented by their immediate Progenitors? And how would their
Adversary <hi>Nestorius</hi> have upbraided them with it, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to him the Novelty of his Doctrin? Or perhaps was Lent first
introduced in the third Age? But that could not be neither; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of that Age being no less Zealous for delivered doctri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and
practices, nor less Opposers of Novelties, than the 5th. Age, as is
manifest by the contest betwixt the Bishop of <hi>Carthage</hi> and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and his Collegues, where the Assertors of Re-bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
wanted neither Wit nor Eloquence, nor number, nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risimilitude
of truth, nor Oracles of the Divine Law, but understood
after a bad and a new manner, as S. <hi>Vincent</hi> says, <hi>chap.</hi> 9, &amp; 10. How
then came they to lose their cause? S. <hi>Stephen</hi> and his Collegues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109113:11"/>
               <hi>Nihil novandum nisi quod traditum est. Nothing is to be
innovated besides what has been delivered to us. Agrippinus,</hi> Bishop
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> holding Rebaptization against the Divine Canon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the rule of the Universal Church, against the sense of all his
fellow-Priests, against the Custom and Institutions of his Ancestors;
and hereby (as S. <hi>Vincent</hi> observes) giving a form of Sacriledge to
all Hereticks, this overthrew him. This then was not an Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to Introduce either Novel practices or Doctrins into the Church,
nor any other before S. <hi>Vincent.</hi> For he tells us, <hi>chap. 9. Mos iste,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>That Custom has always flourished in the Church, and by how much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
one has been more Religious, the more readily has he opposed new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.
We have hereof plenty of examples every where.</hi> And this
manner of discoursing proves a <hi>Priori,</hi> that had Lent been a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
Novelty, it could not possibly have been brought into the
Christian Church for the first 500. years; and yet its manifest by all
the Christian Writes of the 4th. and 5th. Age, that it was then Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
practised both in the Eastern and Western Church; whence it
follows, that it is no Superstitious practice, but true Christian Piety,
and was taught the World by the first planters of Christianity.</p>
            <p>Although our Learned Adversaries deny not, but that the prime
Doctors, and chief Champions of Christianity, of the 4th. and 5th.
Age, were Zealous Observers and Preachers of the Quadragesimal
Fast of Lent, and for this cause appeal to the first 300. years; yet for
the satisfaction of others less Learned, I have thought fit to Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
their Testimonies as they are cited by Bishop <hi>Gunning,</hi> in his
Learned Treatise in defence of the Paschal or Lent-Fast.</p>
            <p>Hear then the Testimonies of the Christian Doctors of the 4th. and
5th. Century; and if you have the least grain of Christian modesty,
dread to call that Superstition which so many Grave Fathers extol as
singular Christian Piety. <hi>S. Basil,</hi> in his Sermons, <hi>de Iejunio,</hi> makes
mention of Lent-Fast: For he makes mention of five days Fasting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
commanded to be observed by all degrees all over the world,
which returned by an orderly course. Now in other his Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries
we find express mention of a Forty-days Fast; nor was
there ever by Christians Fasted five days consequently but in Lent;
and the reason he mentions five days, is, because the <hi>Grecians</hi> only
Fasted five days in every week in Lent, leaving out <hi>Saturday</hi> and
<hi>Sunday.</hi> Hear his own words, <hi>Hom. 1. Let us as becomes Saints,
receive the days that are at hand, not with a sad Soul, but with a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
affection.—Be not sad, when thou art Cured.—Whoever amidst
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109113:11"/>
sumptuous Feasts and continual delights was made partaker of any Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
gift?</hi> Moses, that he might a second time receive the Law,
needed a second Fast.—Doest thou not eat Flesh? But thou eatest up
thy Brother. Doest thou abstain from Wine? But thou doest not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to injure thy Neighbour. Thou expectest the Evening before thou
take thy refection, but spends the whole day in Law-Courts—Let not
Drunkenness introduce thee to the mysteries of Fasting.—The Wrestler
is exercised before he wrestle for the Prize; the Faster is prepared to
Fast by Temperance. Do not as if thou would'st Revenge thy self on
the days of Fasting, or mock the Author of the Law, lay up against
these five days the Treasure of Surfetting—Our Lord who has brought
us to the recourse of this time, give us as to Combatants, throughout
these days, in which we are called out to Combate, to declare the strength
and Nerves of Continence, <hi>Orat.</hi> 2. Fasting is at all times profitable
to those who voluntarily undertake it, but much more at this time when
the denuntiation of Fasting is proclaimed all over the World. Nor is
there any Island nor Continent, nor City, nor Nation, nor the farthest
corner of the World, where the Edict of Fasting is not heard. S. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
Nazianzen. Orat.</hi> 4. Christ Fasted a little before his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we before the Paschal feast; <hi>And Orat.</hi> 41, 42. Yesterday I was
Crucified with Christ, to day I am as it were glorified with him. <hi>S. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphanius</hi>
In expositione fidei Catholicae. The same Church has been wont
to observe Lent, continuing in Fastings: But the 6. days of the week before
<hi>Easter;</hi> all the people continue in dry dyet, using then Bread, Salt, and
Water at the Evening; Yet those that are very devout, pass two, three,
and four days, and some the whole week, untill Cock-crowing on <hi>Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
S. Ambrose</hi> in his book <hi>de Helia &amp; Jejunio.</hi> A Lent is fasted
with us all days, except <hi>Saturday</hi> and the <hi>Lords-day.</hi> And <hi>Serm.</hi> 25.
Our Lord, after he had fasted 40. days, overcame the Devil; not but
that he could have overcome him before his fastings, but that he might
shew unto us, that then we shall be able to overcome the Devil, when by
40. days we have been through fasting Victors over our Carnal desires.—For
neither Brethren is it a little fault to break by greediness of the
Belly, the Lent indicted to Believers, and the Consecrated Fast. <hi>Serm.
de Jejunio &amp; Elia.</hi> Behold, through the mercy of God we have past
through the indicted Fasts of Lent, and have fulfill'd by the devotion of
Abstinence, the Commands of our Lord. <hi>Theophilus, Patriarch</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi>
lib. 3. <hi>Pasch ad totius Aegypti Episcopos.</hi> By no means let

a Cup of Wine.—They that keep the Precepts of the Laws, tast

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>S. Hierom in his Comment upon</hi> Ionah, <hi>c.</hi> 3. Our Lord himself, the
true <hi>Jonas,</hi> sent to Preach unto the World, fasted 40. days, and leaving
us the Inheritance of fasting, under this number prepares our souls for
the eating of his Body. <hi>In his Comment. on</hi> Isaiah 58. Our Lord
fasted 40. days in the Wilderness, that he might leave unto us the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
days of Fasts. <hi>S. Chrysostom</hi> in his <hi>11th.</hi> Lent-Sermon upon
<hi>Genesis.</hi> Wherefore, in every thing, due measure and moderation is
best.—According whereunto, therefore, concerning this season also of
the Holy Lent, we shall now find it to have been ruled out unto us. For
as in publick Conveyance of Travellers, there are certain Stages and
Inns that the wearied Passengers may rest themselves, and intermitting
their Labours, they may again set upon their Iourney. In like manner
here also in Holy Lent, our Lord has indulged these two weekly days (the
<hi>Saturday</hi> and the <hi>Lords-day)</hi> to such as undertake this course of this
fast, like certain Stages or Inns, Shores, or Havens, that both the body
may be a little relaxed from its labours of fasting, and the mind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted;
that when these two days shall be past over, they may again with
chearfulness set upon this their good and profitable Travelling in this
way. <hi>S. Gregory Nyssen</hi> in his <hi>zd.</hi> Oration of the Resurrection.
<hi>Matthew</hi> added the time when it began to dawn towards the first day of
the week: The Night, saith he, was so far passed, that it was now the
time of Cock-crowing, which giveth warning that the light of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
day is at hand. For this cause also at this time, <hi>viz. (far in
the Night before</hi> Easter-day) and not in the very Evening of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday,</hi>
dissolving or ending the Fastings, we begin the Ioy, the Custom,
that obtains with all men consenting thereto. <hi>This for the fourth
Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the 5th. Age S.</hi> Augustin <hi>in his 119th. Epist to</hi> Ianuarius. The
Lent truly of Fastings has Authority both in the old Books, out of the
Fast of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and out of the Gospel, because our Lord Fasted
so many days.—In what part therefore of the year more aptly could the
Observation of Lent be Constituted, then in that which is Conterminous
and next unto the Passion of our Lord.—That those 40. days before
<hi>Easter</hi> should be observed the Custom of the Church has Corroborated.
<hi>In his 118. Epist, to the same Januar.</hi> But those things which we keep
being not written, but delivered down, which are observed throughout the
whole world, are given us to understand that they are retain'd, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
and appointed, either by the Apostles themselves, or by Plenary
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109113:12"/>
Councils, whose Authority in the Church is most wholsome; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
that the Passion of our Lord, and his Resurrection and Ascension
into Heaven, and the coming of the Holy Ghost, are Celebrated with an
Anniversary Solemnity. <hi>S.</hi> Leo <hi>the Great, Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>in his 6.
Sermon of Lent.</hi> That the Apostolical Institution may be fulfilled in
the Fast of forty days, not by sparing from our Dyet only, but especially
by abstinence from sins. <hi>And in his 9th. Serm of Lent.</hi> In which <hi>(days
of the Paschal Fast)</hi> with good cause severer Fastings were ordained by
the Apostles through the teaching of the Holy Ghost, that by a common
comparticipation of the Cross of Christ, we also should do something in
that which he did for us, as the Apostle says: if we suffer with him, we
shall also be glorified with him. <hi>S. Chrysologus.</hi> That we Fast Lent, is
not a human Invention, it is of Divine Authority. <hi>S. Cyril, Patriarch
of</hi> Alexandria, is above-cited at large: This for the 5th. Age. In the
following Ages the observation of Lent in all Christian Countrys is
so manifest, that no body, any whit Versed in Church History can
possibly doubt of it.</p>
            <p>Now after the manifest Testimonies of so many and so Learned and
so holy Doctors of Christs Church the Opposers of the Holy Fast of
Lent must give me leave to bespeak them in the words of the great
<hi>S. Augustin,</hi> by him directed to <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Pelagian,</hi> after a like Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
about another matter of these very Holy Fathers by me now
cited, as to a great part of them. <hi>Tu qui am crebro,</hi> &amp;c. <q>Thou
sadly deluded Zelot, that doest so often object to us Catholick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
the name of Will-worshippers, the crime of Superstition, for
Religiously observing the Holy Fast of Lent: If thou beest awake,
see, what, and what kind of men, and glorious defenders of the
Christian Faith thou darest to bespatter under our names, with so
execrable a Crimination. Go now, and object to us the crime of
Superstition, dissemble and feign thy self not to know what they say
in this point; overlook them as it were, and attack us only, as not
knowing that under our name they are reviled; and confidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
over so many, and so great Doctors of the Church of Christ;
who after a most Saintly Life; and having beaten down the Errors
of their times, most gloriously went out of this Life before you and
your Comrades bubled up. Doest thou see with what kind of Men
we sustain thy Reproaches? Doest thou see with whom we have
the same common cause, which without any sober consideration thou
calumniates and endeavours to expugn? Doest thou see (proud
Zelot) how pernicious it is unto thy self to object so horriable a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:109113:13"/>
Crime of <hi>Will-worship</hi> to such men as these, and how glorious it is
to us to sustain the charge of any Crime, together with such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
as these? Or if thou doest see, see, and hold thy peace, and
let so many Catholick tongues silence thy Phanatical tongue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The Ruffian <hi>Polemus,</hi> to compleat his wild ramble, would needs
early in the morning, half drunk with his Night Revels, go to the
School of the grave Sophist <hi>Xenocrates,</hi> to affront him and his
Schollars. But he was no sooner entred the School of that sober
Platonist, but the very sight of the modest and grave Comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Philosopher and his Schollars did so strike my young
Gallant, that he was quite out of Countenance; and ashamed of
himself; he pull'd off his Drunken Bayes and composed himself to
modesty, and became his Convert, whom be came on purpose to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
and scoff at. Such force had the grave Countenances of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
Platonist and his School to compose a rude Ruffian. Finding
my presumptious Non. Conformist Drunk with Pride and Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
I could think of no better means to reduce him to Sobriety,
than to bring him, not into the School of a sober <hi>Ethnick</hi> Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
but into a grave Assembly of the most memorable Bishops
and Doctors of the School of Christ. To whom certainly so much
a greater Reverence and respect is due, by how much their Doctor
and Master Christ is greater than <hi>Xenocrates</hi>'s Master and Doctor,
<hi>Plato.</hi> I desire now, my conceited Non conformist, that thou
wouldst think it worth thy while, to eye, to look upon so many and
so grave Prelates of the Catholick Church: And imagin them to
look as it were upon thee, and mildly and gently to say unto thee,
<hi>Itane nos fili Iuliane,</hi> &amp;c. Is it so indeed, Son N. N. are we
then Will worshippers? What Answer wouldst thou give them?
With what Face wouldst thou look upon them? What Arguments
would occur to thee? Wouldst thou dare, wouldst thou have the
Face to produce such woodden Daggers, as thou art ever and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
drawing upon us? Or rather would not such pittiful Weapons
fall out of thy hand at the presence of so great Doctors, and such
grave Prelates of Gods Church? Wouldst thou have the Fore-head
to tell the great S. <hi>Hierom;</hi> Not that which goes into a Man defiles
him, but that which comes out: Ye observe days and times I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
of you, forbidding to abstain from Meats, which God has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to be received with Thanksgiving, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As if that Great
Doctor and his Venerable Fellows could be ignorant of such petty
Cavils as these? <hi>Tantumne apud se,</hi> &amp;c. Can now an <hi>S. M.</hi> or
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109113:13"/>
an <hi>E. C.</hi> have so much Authority, with any person of Sobriety,
that he should for their regards, not only forsake so many and so
great Doctors and defenders of the Christian Faith, from the rising
of the Sun to the going down thereof, but also dare to call them
Superstitious Will-worshippers? I desire my conceited Non-Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist
would but consider into what an Assembly I have brought
him. 'Tis an Assembly of Saintly Doctors, not a popular multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude;
such as were not only Children, but Fathers of the Church,
famous in their Generations for Learning and Sanctity; who well
furnish'd with Spiritual Weapons, strenously Warred against the
Hereticks of their days, and having happily finished the labours of
their dispensation, Holily went to rest in peace. They are of that
number, concerning whom it was fore-told: For Fathers are born
unto thee Children, thou shalt constitute them Princes over all the
Earth. Nor was the practice we are now disputing, any new In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of theirs; but what they learnt in the Church of Christ, in
the time of their Rudiments, that they taught the Church of Christ
in the time of their Honors. But if my Non-Conformist will
perhaps say, he does not charge S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> or S. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> &amp;c.
with the crime of Superstition; he must give me leave to tell him,
nor then does he justly charge us, whom he sees in the same Cause
to have followed their steps. But if he will only Reproach us with
such a Calumny, not for any other reason, but because we think
concerning the Holy Fast of Lent what they thought, hold what
they held, Preach what they Preach'd; who does not see that he
openly reviles us only, but secretly has the like judgment of them?
For what they believe, we believe; what they teach, we teach,
yield to them, and you yield to us; acquiess in their sentiments,
and you'l cease to condemn ours. Moreover, this grave Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Antient Doctors, to whom we appeal, then judged con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this our Cause, when no body could say they had favor or
Ill-will for either party. They had neither Friendship nor Enmity
with you or us. That which they found in the Church, that they
held; that which they learnt, that they taught. That which they
received from their Fathers, they delivered to their Children. We
did not as yet appeal with you to them as Judges, and our Cause
was decided by them: Neither you nor we were known to them,
and we recite their Sentences given for us against you. We did
not yet Contest with you, and they pronouncing Sentence for us,
we have overcome you. Or will my Non-Conformist have the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109113:14"/>
Impudence to accuse (as some do) these grave Doctors of blindness.
A multitude of Blind men for-sooth avails nothing to find out the
Truth; and these were the Errors and mistakes of those Learned
Doctors. What an Age are we faln into? Truth must be called
Error, and Error Truth; Light Darkness, and Darkness, Light.
S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom,</hi> S. <hi>Cyril,</hi> S. <hi>Cryostom</hi> are blind, but <hi>S.
M. C. D.</hi> and <hi>E. F.</hi> see. These Doctors I have called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of, have left such Monuments of their Sanctity and Learning in
their Holy and Learned Writings, that the whole Christian
Church has ever admired and revered them as her prime Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians
against Pagans, Jews, and Hereticks; yea, our very Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
pretend a Sacred Reverence for them also. They were Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of such Learning and Sanctity, that if a Synod of Bishops were
gather'd out of the whole World, it would be much if so many,
and such Doctors could be found to sit in it; neither indeed were
these all at one time. But God-Almighty, as pleases Him, and as
He judges to be expedient, scatters a few more excellent and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Dispensers of his Mysteries in several Ages, and distances of
places. By such Planters, Waterers, Builders, Pastors Nursing-Fathers,
after the Apostles, the Holy Church has encreased. Now what an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
&amp; what an Impudence must it be for any to presume to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of the horrible Crime of Superstition, so many holy, egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
and memorable Doctors of the Catholick Verity; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
together with them the whole Church of Christ, to which
Divine Family they Faithfully Ministring Spiritual Food, flourished
with great glory in our Lord? Nay further, they who dare to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the manifest Sentiment, not of so many Platonical, Aristoteli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
or Zenonical Doctors, but of so many Saints and Illustrious
Prelates in the Church of God; and these, some of them singularly
endowed with human Literature, and all of them eminently Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Sacred Letters, have reason not so much to fear them, as
him who made them profitable Vessels to himself. These Judges,
by how much the more desirable they ought to be unto thee, if thou
did'st hold the Catholick Faith, by so much thou hast more reason
to fear them, because thou opposest the Catholick Faith, which they
suck'd in in Milk, and took in in solid Meat, which Milk and Meat
they Ministred to Little and Great, and which Faith they mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
and stoutly defended against his Enemies; yea, against you,
then not as yet born. For, not only when they lived did they by
their words, but also by their Writings, which they left to Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,

            <p>I thought fit to adjoyn this Reflexion of S. <hi>Austen,</hi> though super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant
to the force of my Argument, it being sufficient for my
purpose to prove that Lent-Fast was generally practised in the 4th.
and 5th. Century, both by the Eastern and Western Churches, and
so much evidently follows from the Authorities above cited. For,
though some may be so self-conceited, as to confess that S. <hi>Hierom,</hi>
S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> S. <hi>Basil,</hi> S. <hi>Crysostom,</hi> and the rest of the Holy Fathers
Greek and Latin, deemed the observation of Lent to be a pious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
practice, but they with humble submission, judged it to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
Will-worship, and the Doctrin of Devils: Yet few, I think,
but have so much regard for these Primitive Doctors, as to allow
them so much judgment as to know what was the practice of their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Churches in their days, and so much fidelity as to write the
Truth as to that particular, which is sufficient for the purport of my
discourse; unless you can think that these Holy Fathers were of one
Faith, &amp; their Flocks which Reverence them as Sts. of another. For the
4th. and 5th. Age practising Fasting in Lent, not as a piece of Piety
begun by themselves, but commended to them by Tradition from the
Apostles, it not only follows that it could not be first begun by their
immediate Progenitos, which had it been, they could not possibly
have been ignorant of it; but also, that it must necessarily have been
first taught the world by the Apostles. For if the first Converts of
the Apostles all over the World had not only been taught no such ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
but also had been positively instructed to look upon Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
from certain kind of Meats as Superstition, and the Doctrin
of Devils; and with all, had been charged not to receive any other
Doctrin, though Preached to them by an Angel sent from Heaven,
and they in like manner teaching their Children the same they had
learnt, as none can doubt but they did. How is it possible that the
Christians in the 4th. Century should most tenaciously adhere to this
principle of admitting no new Doctrin or Practice, but to hold fast
to what was delivered them by their Ancestors from the Apostles, and
yet should themselves Superstitiously Abstain from Meats, and not
pretend Scripture for it neither, but Apostolical Tradition? But had
the Pastors of the 4th. Century Abstained from certain Meats on
pretext of Scripture in such a manner understood by them, or upon
account of some Decree of a General Council or Law of some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109113:15"/>
made in the second or third Century, or pretending to follow
some person or persons raised up by God in the third Age, to teach
the Christian world a more strict observance, it might well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
how the 4th. Age might abstain from Meats upon a Religious
account, though no such thing had been taught the world by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
but the quite contrary. And from what has been said, all
well put together, I think it is efficaciously concluded against all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
of Lent-Fast, that it was taught the world by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</p>
            <p>But it is not a Tippet, or a Surplice I am Arguing for, but a practice;
which if rightly observed, is sufficient to make all the world Saints;
and therefore for the more abundant satisfaction of my Reader, I shall
now adjoyn positive Evidences out of the Writers of the first 300.
years, that the Holy Fast of Lent was practised in those most pure and
Primitive Times. <hi>S. Denys,</hi> B. of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> who lived in the
middle of the third Age, in his Epistle to <hi>Basilides</hi> the Bishop, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
the Fast before <hi>Easter,</hi> as Universal as the joy and Feast of
<hi>Easter. It will be confessed,</hi> saies he, <hi>of all agreeably that we ought
to begin the Feast,</hi> (viz. <hi>of</hi> Easter) <hi>and Ioy, until that time, humbling
our souls in Fastings—they truly which make too much hast, and before
well toward mid-night, break their Fast, we blame as regardless, and
not Masters of their Appetite, giving over the Race a little before the
Goal.—Such indeed as are much worn by the Fasts, and toward the
end, as it were faint, we easily pardon if they eat sooner.</hi> And in the
same Epistle he mentions in special manner the six days of Fasts, to
wit, those of the last week not alike observ'd of all. <hi>Origen,</hi> in the
beginning of the same Age. <hi>Hom. 10. In Leviticum. Habemus Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragesimae
dies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We have the days of Lent Consecrated to Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
we have the fourth and sixth day of the week, on which we so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
Fast. And certainly a Christian has liberty to Fast at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
times, but not out of a Superstitious Observation, but by the Vertue of
Continency.</hi> The first General Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> held a little after the
year 300. did not first ordain the keeping of Lent, but in the sixth
Canon, makes mention of it as a time known to all the Christian
world; for in that Canon, the Fathers ordain that two Provincial-Councils
should be celebrated by the Bishops of every Province every
year; one of them <hi>ante dies Quadragesimae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>before the days of
Lent, to the end that all Contests, if any such be, being made up, a pure
and solemn gift may be offered to God.</hi> Now how should Lent be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
all over the Christian world so early, before any General
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109113:15"/>
Council? What other Universal cause could there be of so Universal
an Observation, but the first teaching of the Apostles? Or if such a
practice had been Superstitious, and the Doctrin of Devils, how came
so Venerable and holy a Councel not to take notice of it? As if they
could be ignorant of such Scriptures as falsly understood are alledged
against it by Non-Conformists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the second Age,</hi> Tertullian <hi>in his Book</hi> de Iejunio, <hi>c. 1, 2. tells
us that it was not the Sentiment of some one particular Man, but of
all Catholick Christians, who are by him contumeliously called</hi>
Psychici, <hi>that the Pascal Fast was Constituted by God, and observed
by the Apostles. His words are,</hi> Nam quod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For as to what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to Fasts, they oppose, that there are certain days Constituted by
God They surely think that in the Gospel, those days are determined
for Fasts, in which the Bridegroom was taken away, and those days only
are now the legitimate days of Christian Fasts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that thus the
Apostles observed the rule of Fasting, imposing no other Yoke of certain or
Set-Fasts to be kept of all in common. <hi>And c.</hi> 13. Ye prescribe against us
that the solemn times for this matter, are to be believed already constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the Scriptures, or in the Tradition of our Elders, and that no
further observance is to be superadded for the unlawfulness of Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Maintain this your ground, if you can; for lo I convince you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
your selves Fasting, besides the Paschal Fast, those days in which the
Bridegroom was taken away, interposing also your selves the half-fasts
of the Stations, and your selves other whiles also as each pleases, living on
meer Bread and Water.</p>
            <p>The same, <hi>Tertullian,</hi> before he was a <hi>Montanist,</hi> testifies in his
Book of Prayer, <hi>c. ult. Sic &amp; die Paschae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So also on the day
of Christs suffering whereon is observed the common, and as it were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Religion of Fasting.</hi> In the same Age S. <hi>Telesphorus,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> did not first institute Lent-Fast as <hi>Zanchy</hi> observes, <hi>l</hi> 1. m
4m. <hi>Praeceptum,</hi> Cited by B. <hi>Gunning</hi> in his Appendix; but only add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
certain days to be observed over and above by the Clergy. His
words are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Certe Telesphorus</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Assuredly</hi> Telesphorus, <hi>who was the
seventh Bishop of the</hi> Roman <hi>Church, and a Martyr, about the year of
Christ 139. makes mention of this (the Quadragesimal time above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned)
as observed before him in the Church. For he added certain days,
which he would have observed by Clerks and Priests, over and above
what were observed by the Laity.—We ordain,</hi> says he, <hi>that all Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
i. e. <hi>such as are called into the Lot of our Lord, fast from flesh
seven whole weeks before</hi> Easter; <hi>because as the life of Clergy-men ought
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109113:16"/>
to be distinguish'd from the Conversation of the Laity, so ought there to
be a difference in their Fasting also.</hi> Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
in her self a power to Institute Holy-days, or Fasting-days,
had any of her Bishops first ordained Lent-Fast, she would have
made no more difficulty of Registring who it was, then She does of
telling us when, and by whom was first Constituted the Feast of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus-Christi,</hi>
and divers other Ritual Observances. Moreover,
in the same Age, there was a difference betwixt S. <hi>Polycarp,</hi> Disciple
of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and by him ordained Bishop of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> together with
<hi>Thraseas,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Eumenia,</hi> and <hi>S. Anicetus,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with
other Western Bishops on the other side, about which difference <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycarp</hi>
came to <hi>Rome: Anicetus</hi> professing to follow the Rule received
from <hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> by the Instruction of his Predecessors,
<hi>Xystus, Telesphorus, Hyginus &amp; Pius:</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> professing to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
what <hi>S. Iohn</hi> and other of the Apostles had practised. The
words of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> concerning <hi>Polycarp,</hi> whom he had seen and heard,
are these. <hi>That</hi> Anicetus <hi>could not perswade</hi> Polycarp <hi>to vary from
what he had observed ever with</hi> John <hi>the Disciple of our Lord, and the
rest of the Apostles, with whom he had Conversed, or spent his time.</hi>
Iren. ap. <hi>Euseb.</hi> l 5 c. 24. <hi>The same difference revived again about
the 97th.</hi> year after <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> betwixt <hi>Polycrates</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
with other Asian Bishops, and <hi>Victor,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> with others
of the West. <hi>Polycrates</hi> pleading the Authority of <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> and
<hi>S. Philip;</hi> and <hi>Victor</hi> pleading the Authority of the Tradition of
<hi>S. Peter</hi> and <hi>S. Paul. Sozom.</hi> 1. 7. c. 19. <hi>Polycrates,</hi> and they of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi>
contending: <hi>That from antient Tradition they deemed that they
ought to observe the Feast of the Salutary Pasch on the</hi> 14th. <hi>day of the
month, as being of duty altogether on that day, upon what soever day of
the week it fell, to put an end to, or dissolve their fastings.</hi> On the other
side (which was <hi>Victors</hi>) it was alledged, <hi>No such Custom to observe
on that mauner in the rest of the Churches throughout the whole World,
they observing from Apostolical Tradition, which come down to that time,
that only on that day, which should be also the weekly day of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reci:
on of our Lord, they ought to dissolve or end their Fastings.</hi> You
see both parties had a Tradition, that the Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
certain Fasting days, and all this is witnessed in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> l. 5.
c. 23, 24. About <hi>Easter-day</hi> it self, they had indeed different Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<hi>S. Iohn</hi> and <hi>S. Philip</hi> finding it useful in those parts of <hi>Asia,</hi>
where many <hi>Iews</hi> Inhabited, by condescention to observe the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st
an <hi>Easter</hi> on the same day with the Jewish <hi>Easter.</hi> But <hi>S. Peter</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:109113:16"/>
and <hi>S. Paul,</hi> where no such cause was, prescribed as meet, not to
disjoyn their Anniversary from their weekly memorial day of Christs
Resurrection, as B. <hi>Gunning</hi> reflects. We have then <hi>S. Iohn</hi> taught
S. <hi>Polycarp</hi> to Fast before <hi>Easter,</hi> as testifies <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who saw and
heard <hi>S. Polycarp.</hi> Moreover, in this Age the same <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> tells
<hi>Victor,</hi> in an Epistle to him, that there was Controversie, not only
concerning the day it self of <hi>Easter,</hi> but also touching 'the manner it
self of the <hi>Fast;</hi> but none disputed whether there was to be a Fast or
no before <hi>Easter.</hi> His words are, <hi>Neither is the Controversie only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout</hi>
the day (of <hi>Easier</hi>) <hi>but also concerning the 'form it self of the Fast;
for some think they ought to fast one day, some two, others also more, and
some by forty hours of Day-time, and of Night, commensurate their
day. And such variety of those that keep</hi> (this Fast) <hi>hath not been made
or begun now in our Age, but very long before with our Ancestors, who,
as it is meet to believe, not accurately retaining</hi> (the manner of the
Fast above-mentioned) <hi>have changed the Custom which was simple and
plain into that which was afterwards.</hi> Now what uniform Custom
could there precede in the Christian Church, and not be from the
Apostles; <hi>Irenaeus</hi> writing thus about the 97th. year, after <hi>S. Iohn</hi>'s
death. Though he seems not to speak of the whole Lent-Fast, but only
of the Fasts of the Paschal week.</p>
            <p>In the very Age of the Apostles we have the Testimony of <hi>S. Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>
their Contemporary in an Epistle to the <hi>Philippians.</hi> His words
are, <hi>Do not Contemn Lent, for it contains an imitation of the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of God. Neither do you despise Passion-week: Fast upon</hi> Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesday
<hi>and</hi> Friday, <hi>giving what you leave to the Poor. Philo</hi> the Jew,
in his Book of the Religious, says <hi>Eusebius,</hi> l. 2. c. 16, 17. describes
the Religious Life of certain Apostolical persons of the Hebrew Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
at <hi>Alexandria, having not only seen them, but accurately taken
knowledge of them, describing there such their Conversation, as is to be
found in the Christian Religion only;</hi> and he adds, <hi>according to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
and such Religious fastings</hi> (says he) <hi>which have descended down
accurately the same even unto our times, which more eminently<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were
exercised in Fastings and whole Nights Watchings, and attentions unto
the Word of God, at the Solemnity of the Passion of our Saviour. It is
manifest to every one that</hi> Philo <hi>comprised in that Writing, Customs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in the beginning from the Apostles.</hi> Hitherto <hi>Eusebius.</hi> Now
let us hear <hi>Philo</hi>'s own words. <hi>These Assemble themselves especially
by the space of seven weeks—Wine in those days is not brought in unto
their Tables.—And their Table hath not any thing of that which had
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109113:17"/>
Blood, but Bread for their Food, and Salt for that which they eat with
their Bread—Some for the space of three days receive no Food; and
scarce by the space of six days did they refresh themselves with their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Food—A week they observed by a pure and holy Virgiral obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
which was preparatory to the greatest Feast which was followed
with the 50. days Solemnity.</hi> Thus <hi>Philo,</hi> contemporary of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
concerning the Hebrew Christians in and about <hi>Alexandria,</hi>
where S. <hi>Mark</hi> was set Bishop by <hi>S. Peter.</hi> I omit the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the 68. Canon of the Apostles, for that Ecclesiastical Writers
do not unanimously agree that those Canons, at least all of them were
made by the Apostles; although the sixth General Councel Celebrated
above a 1000. years agoe received and approved 85. of them. There
can be no doubt but they are very antient; Bishop <hi>Gunning</hi> thinks
they were made in the second Century by the Successors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who in that Age were commonly (as he says) called Apostles.
The 68<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h. Canon runs thus <hi>If any Bishop or Priest, or Deacon, or Lector, or
Cantor shall not Fast the sacred Lent</hi> (Quadragesimam) <hi>before</hi> Easter,
<hi>or</hi> Wednesday <hi>or</hi> Friday, <hi>let him be deposed, unless he be hindred by
weakness of body. But if he be a Laick, let him be deprived of the
Communion.</hi> Indeed the Canon does not seem first to institute Lent,
but rather supposes it, and urges its observance by inflicting a penalty
upon Non-observers: All which makes for my designed purpose; for
who could so early, except the Apostles, be the first Authors of such
an Institution, when as yet there had been no General Council, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
that of the Apostles at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But have we no Scripture for the Observation of Lent Fast? We
have Scripture that our B. Saviour Fasted 40. days; and we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
in Scripture, that if any man says he is in Christ, he ought to walk
as he walk'd. Moreover, we have yet more express Scriptures as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted
not by some one or two Fathers, but by the whole body of
Catholick Christians, as Bishop <hi>Gunning</hi> well observes out of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>
cited above. <hi>They</hi> (that is the Catholick Christians who are
called by him <hi>Psychici</hi>) <hi>surely think that in the Gospel, those days are
determin'd for Fasts, in which the Bridegroom was taken away</hi>—<hi>and
a little after, <hi>the Paschal Fast, those days in which the Bridegroom was
taken away.</hi>
               </hi> Those words then of our B. Lord, in excuse of his Disciples
not Fasting whilst he was with them; <hi>Can you make the Children of
the Bridegroom fast while the Bridegroom is with them? But the days
will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, then shall
they fast in those days.</hi> Those words, I say, in the sense of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109113:17"/>
Church in the second Century, were intended by our B.
Saviour to signifie that Christians after his departure should Fast year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> the day of his death, and the rest of the Pascal,
or Lent-Fast, those days in which the Bridegroom was taken away. I
add, whether those words <hi>in those days</hi> did in the intention of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
signifie Lent-Fast or no; it's evident, had not the Primitive
Christians Fasted Lent, they would never have interpreted our Lords
words as they did, which is sufficient for my purpose; to wit, to
evince, that the most Primitive pure Church did Fast Lent. And
besides, according to common sense, who are more likely to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
aright our B. Saviours, or his Apostles words, they who lived
in the next Age to them, or we who live sixteen hundred years after?
Do we, or any other Nation in the world understand our written
Laws, according to the sense a crafty witty Lawyer can wrest them
to signifie; or accordingly as they have been immemorially under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
since the first making of them, and as cases and disputes have by
our Learned Judges been decided by them. More-over, suppose
but only the Primitive Christians, for whose sake the Holy Scriptures
were written, rightly understood them; and let after Generations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
the same Scriptures in the sense they were interpreted by their
Ancestors; and let this be their great enquiry, how their Fore-elders
understood them, and its impossible they should ever be mis-under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
but leave their Interpretation to every private mans sentiment,
and you open a gap to all Innovations and Heresies, as Bishop <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
judiciously observes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> (says he, <hi>pag.</hi> 23.) <hi>and experience, and the direction of all
Wise men in the Church of God (Antient and Modern) the House of
Wisdom, Councels, Reverend Fathers and Writers, and our Church in
particular, have directed and commanded us not to interpret the Scripture
in things of publick concernment to the Churches rule of believing and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but as we find it interpreted by the Holy Fathers and Doctors of
the Church, as they had received it from those before them. For that
the leaving of every man to make any thing of any Text, upon any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
out of his own head, to the founding of any new and strange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
or Practice as necessary there from, or to the opposing any constantly
received Doctrin or Practice of the Church-Vniversal (for in other
matters they may happily with leave quietly abound in their own sense)
leaves all bold Innovators (which can draw any disciples after them) to be
as much Law-givers to the Church; by their uncontrolable Law inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting,
as any Pope or Enthusiast can or need pretend to be; and hath

                  </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and Schisms brought into the Church by Men, who departing from
the teaching and stable Interpretation of the Church in their own Insta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Science falsly so called, pervert the Scriptures to their own and
others (their obstinate followers) destruction.</hi> And indeed, he, who
has so much Pride and Self-conceit as to prefer his own seeming sense
of holy Scriptures before the sense which Holy Fathers and Christian.
Doctors unanimously attest to have received from their Fore-elders,
is nextly disposed to vilifie and reject the whole Letter of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
upon pretext of being uncertain, whether the Letter now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
owned and approved by the unanimous consent of Christian
Doctors, be indeed that Letter which was left the World by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</p>
            <p>But if a yearly Religious Observation of the Holy Fast of Lent be
of such singular benefit and Spiritual advantage to all Christians; and
if also the Apostles of our Lord Jesus did recommend such an Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to the several Countrys by them Converted to the Christian
Faith, how comes it to pass that none of all their Writings which have
come to our hands, makes express mention of it? Hear Bishop <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> p. 138. <hi>Ritual Observances being Visible, and as it were legible
in the Vniversal Churches constant practice, needed not to be set down
in her written rule. Or those which are therein set down, not necessarily,
so evidently, but that they might need the Interp<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etation of such the
Churches practice.</hi> And indeed whoever will impartially consider the
nature of the Books of the New Testament, will be so far from won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that all the Rituals of Christianity are not expresly declared
in them, that he will rather wonder there is so much in them of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Rites of Christian Religion as there is. Had any of the Sacred
Christian Pen-men written a Book on purpose to declare the whole
manner of Christian worship, like <hi>Moyses</hi> his <hi>Exodus</hi> or <hi>Leviticus,</hi> we
might reasonably have expected an account what days Christians
were to set apart for Fasting or Religious Feasting, what Garments
they were to use in time of Divine Worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> they only, as
is manifest, writing Books for other intents and purposes by way of
History for example, or moral Exhortations, and making mention
only by the by of some of our Christian Rites, as they occurred; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more unreasonable then to expect in their said Writings
an express clear mention of every Christian Ceremonial Observance.
The four Gospels are a History of our Blessed Saviours Life and
Death, who lived as to the external Rites of Religion, according to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109113:18"/>
the Jewish Law, and so we cannot reasonably in any of them expect
what Fasting or Festival days we Christians are to observe. Indeed
had the Act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Apostles been intended as an exact Narration, how
the Apostles lived as to the whole course of their Life, what days they
kept Holy, and what they Fasted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We might reasonably have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
some mention there of Lent and <hi>Easter:</hi> But that holy Book
making mention only of some few particular passages of two or three
of the Apostles lives, the Apostles might well keep Lent and <hi>Easter</hi>
too, and teach them also to their first Converts, and yet there be a
profound silence of them in the Book of their Acts: As for S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s
Prophetical Book, it were no ways proper in it to speak of <hi>Easter</hi> or
Lent. The rest of the New Testament are certain Epistles or Letters
of Spiritual Counsels written by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> or some other Apostle to
particular persons or whole Cityes, already instructed in the Christian
way of worship: But why they should needs make mention therein of
Lent, I understand not, unless perchance the persons they wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

            <p>But does not S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly decry the keeping of Lent in one of his

of Days and Times, <hi>Gal. 4. v. 9, 10. How are ye Converted

observe Days, and Months, and Times, and Years. I am afraid of
you, lest I should have laboured amongst you in vain.</hi> Was then the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Apostle afraid lest the <hi>Galatians</hi> should leave Christianity and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to Judaism or Pagaism, because of their observing Lent in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of our Blessed Saviours Fasting 40. days, or <hi>Easter</hi> in memory
of his Resurrection? Is this a likely Story? Or is it not evident from
the Context <hi>of their returning again to weak and poor Elements,</hi> that
because of their returning to the Observation of <hi>Iewish days,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Pagan</hi> days in honour of <hi>Iupiter, Mars</hi> &amp;c.

to be received with Thanksgiving of them which believe and know
the Truth. For every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused,
if it be received with Thanksgiving.</hi> That we may rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
these words of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> we must reflect that upon a double
account we may abstain from certain Meats or Drinks. First, we
may abstain from certain Meats, as thinking them, out of Error and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition,
naturally unclean and unholy: And to teach Abstinence
from certain Creatures upon such an account, is deservedly called
the Doctrin of Devils. And with this Heresie the <hi>Manicheans</hi> are
charged by S. <hi>Austin</hi> and other Fathers. And that the Apostle meant
such like Abstainers from certain Creatures, is manifest by the reason
he gives why Christians should not Abstain upon such an account; to
wit, because every Creature of God is good, and consequently we
ought not to reject any as in themselves evil and unclean. Secondly,
we may abstain from certain Meats or Drinks as less suitable to a time
of Humiliation, or appeasing of Almighty God for our sins by Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
works of Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning, or for some other
Spiritual end. And such an Abstinence as this is so far from being
prohibited by S. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other of the Apostles, that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
not only by the light of Nature, but also by the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and the examples of the Holiest Men that ever lived upon Earth.
Thus S. <hi>Tymothy</hi> Abstained from Wine continually for Mortification,
so that S. <hi>Paul</hi> thought fit to exhort him not always to drink water,
but to make use of a little Wine for his Stomack-sake and frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities.
Whereas, had it been Superstition to ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ain from certain
Creatures of God upon a Religious account, he ought to have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
him from his Abstinence, by telling him such an Abstinence
from the good Creatures of God was the Doctrin of Devils, Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worship,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Eating Flesh, and drinking Wine are very Lawful and
Laudable, when done in their due and proper season; but are no
ways suitable to days or times when I am called upon by my lawful
Superiors to appease God Almightys Anger for my own and others
sins, by Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning. Hear not me, but the
Holy Prophet, <hi>Isa. ch. 22. v. 12, 13, 14. And in that way did the
Lord God of Hosts call to Weeping and to mourning, and to Baldness,
and to Girding with Sack-cloath. And behold Ioy and Gladness, slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Oxen and killing Sheep, eating Flesh and drinking Wine: Let us
eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall dye. And it was revealed in mine
Ears by the Lord of Hoasts; surely this Iniquity shall not be purged
from you till ye dye, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</hi> Now they seem not
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109113:19"/>
so much to be a-sleep as dead, who hear not God. Almighty crying out
unto them, and calling them to Fasting, Weeping, and Mourning this
Holy and Penitential time of Lent, after all the Authorities above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
for its Apostolical Institution. To say nothing of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
of all sorts of wickedness amongst us, and the heavy Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Plagues of blindness of mind, and insensibility of Divine things
which has seized upon us, and no doubt call aloud for Penitential Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations.</p>
            <p>But if Abstinence from certain Meats upon a Religious account be
true Christian Piety, what shall we say to S. <hi>Paul?</hi> Rom. 14. v. 2.
<hi>One believeth that he may eat all things; another who is weak eateth
Herbs;</hi> and v. 6. <hi>He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth
God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
God thanks,</hi> and v. 17. <hi>The Kingdom of God is not Meat and
Drink, but Righteousness, and Peace, and Ioy in the Holy Ghost.</hi> So
that it seems by the H. Apostle, that it matters not whether I eat Flesh,
or I abstain from Flesh in Lent, so I give God thanks: I am every
whit as good a Christian, though I eat, as if I abstained. Read the
14 <hi>v.</hi> and that will help you to correct your mistake. <hi>I know and am
perswaded by the Lord Iesus, that there is nothing unclean of it self;
but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
By which words, it's manifest the <hi>Romans</hi> case and ours is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.
The scrupulous <hi>Romans</hi> seem to have had a difficulty to eat
Flesh or drink Wine, as imagining them to be in themselves unclean,
either for that they had been offered up to Idols, or prohibited by the
abolished Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or as naturally unclean, and necessarily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
them to sin; but we abstain from them upon none of all these
accounts, but judge them as clean in themselves as any other Creatures
of God; only we deem them less suitable to a Penitential time then
drier and less savory Viands, and smaller sorts of drink. But more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
you must give me leave to tell you, that according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in this very Chapter, you ought if you will walk
Christianly, to abstain from Flesh in Lent, at least upon the account
of not scandalizing your weak Brethren<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who think themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to abstain from Flesh those days of Christian Pennance. Hear
the Apostles own words, <hi>v. 15. If thy Brother be grieved with thy
meat, now walkest thou not Charitably,</hi> and <hi>v 21. It is good neither to
eat Flesh nor to drink Wine, nor any thing whereby thy Brother stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth,
or is offended, or is made weak</hi> Though, as I was telling you,
our case is quite different from the Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom S.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109113:20"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> writes. We abstain from flesh in Lent, not as deeming it in it
self unclean, as some scrupulous weaklings amongst them did; but
having Testimonies from all Christian Countrys, and from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
writings of the prime Pillars of Christianity, in the most Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Times, that the Apostles so ordained; and being besides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
so to do by our Civil and Ecclesiastical Superiours, who are
ordained of God to countenance Well doers, and to watch for our
souls good, as they who must give an account, whom we think our
selves obliged in Conscience to obey in all their Lawful commands;
but especially in such commands, which when sincerely and undeceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
observed, tend to the great Spiritual advantage of our souls.
There are other places commonly urged by mis-understanders of
Holy Scriptures, against Abstinence from Meats upon a Religious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
but to any one that considers the whole context, and all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
they evidently appear nothing to the purpose: For they
are all intended against Superstitious Abstinence from Meats, either as
unclean by Creation, or as unclean, because prohibited by the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> or as having been offered up to Idols, or as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
eaten with unwashen hands against frivolous and useless Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of men. Thus when our B. Saviour, <hi>S. Mat.</hi> 15. 11. tells us,
<hi>Not that which goeth into the mouth, defileth a man; but that which
cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</hi> Its manifest by the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his saying those words, <hi>v.</hi> 2. The Scribes and Pharisees quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
with his Disciples for not washing their hands before they did
eat Bread; and by what follows, <hi>v. 20. To eat with unwashen hands,
defiles not a man;</hi> that he never intended by those words to signifie
that we might upon a day or time of publick Humiliation, recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us by our Superiors, without defiling our selves, eat what we
please, when we please, or as oft as we please.</p>
            <p>But at least is it not against the Laws of the Land to abstain from
certain Meats upon a Religious account? Here you must distinguish.
To abstain from certain Meats upon a pretendedly Religious, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
Superstitious account, as if some Meats were less Holy, or more
unclean than others, is both against God's Laws and Mans Laws; but
to obstain from certain Meats, upon a truly Religious, and indeed pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
account, as judging some Meats more suitable to Penitential days
and seasons than others, is according both to the Laws of God and our
Nation. Hear our Laws themselves, and be your own judges of the
meaning of them. Statute 2. and 3. <hi>Edward 6. c. 19. The Kings Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
having a more clear light, and thereby perceiving that one Meat
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109113:20"/>
is not more holy, more pure, or more clean than another, and that no Meats
can defile Christian Men, so that they be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not used in Disobedience or
Vice; yet for as much as divers of the Kings Subjects have of late time,
more than in times past, broken and contemned such Abstinence, which
hath been used in this Realm upon the</hi> Friday <hi>and</hi> Saturday, <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
days, and other days commonly called Vigils, and in the time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Lent, and other accustomed times, the Kings Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
that due and Godly Abstinence is a means to Vertue, and to
subdue mens Bodys to their Soul and Spirit; and considering also that
Fishers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doth Ordain and Enact with the Assent of the Lords Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>That no person or persons, of what Estate, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,

Friday <hi>or</hi> Saturday, <hi>or the</hi> Ember <hi>days, or in any day in the time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
called Lent.</hi> Take Bishop <hi>Gunnings</hi> Reflection <hi>hereupon. The
scope and reason, and motive of which Law, if it be considered according
to the principal end of it, subduing the Flesh to the Soul and Spirit (for
there is added another end also which was political) may well admonish us
(though it was hard to contain the particulars in a Law) to abstain also
at such times of Mortification from what soever Food else is more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
costly, of hotter nature, and of higher nourishment. The formers
of that Law (which is now the Law of our Land) had no doubt, before their
eyes, the approbation of God, and his gracious answer to</hi> Daniel <hi>so Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening
himself, as in the holy Scripture is described,</hi> Dan. 10. 2, 3. 12.

heart to understand, and to chasten thy self before thy God, thy words
were heard, and I am come for thy words. Which that Ministers of
Gods Word should not as well have before their eyes, as our civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
is a great shame.</hi> Reflect also with him upon the Prayer for
the first <hi>Sunday</hi> or Lent: O Lord, who for our sake didst Fast 40.
days and 40. nights, give us Grace to use such Abstinence, that our
Flesh being subdued to the Spirit, we may ever obey thy Godly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Righteousness and true Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How unworthy it would
be to make that Holy Prayer to bear such a sense as this, <hi>O Lord, who
for our sakes didst Fast forcy days and forty nights, give us Grace to use
such Abstinence, that our Sea-faring Men and Marriners, and young
Cattle, and the like, may be mainta<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

In fine, Abstinence from certain Meats upon certain days, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
no Law that I know of, but the Law of sin in our own sinful
bodys, our corrupt greedy desire of eating what we will, when we will,
and as much as we will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But still you say you are afraid of Will-worship
and Superstition, by observing a time which you fear God
has never commanded you. But you have more reason to be afraid
of Profaneness in taking no notice of a time, which you have all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think God has commanded you Religiously to observe, if you
reflect well upon what has been said. But you cannot perswade your
self its any ways acceptable to God to Fast in Lent. For that you
must know that the power of Education is upon you, and our proud
corrupt Nature has a great deal of d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficulty to condemn it self of so
gross ignorance and mistake, that notwithstanding we have made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
our business for perhaps twenty or thirty years, or more;
yet we have looked upon a Practice as an useless, vain Superstition,
which was indeed true Christian Piety. But its better to come into
Gods Vineyard at the Eleventh hour than not at all. Better late
than not at all come to the knowledge of any part of true Christian
Piety. Learn to be Wise from your own dammage, and reflect seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
with your self how seldom you have Fasted in the whole course
of your life, and yet you cannot but acknowledge the singular benefit
of Religious Fasting; and if you believe Jesus Christ, when it is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
performed, it shall have a singular reward in the other Life: And
consider moreover, whether you shall in all likelihood Fast more days
in this next year, if you Fast only when the Spirit of God shall move
you to Fast, or if you should engage your self to Fast all <hi>Fridays,
Ember</hi>-days, <hi>Lent,</hi> &amp;c. God knows our private good purposes are
easily broken by us, and the best of us stand in need of the extrinsecal
help of a common Law to call upon us to do our duty, especially in
such things as are troublesome to Flesh and Blood, as Fasting and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence
are. You are resolved for example, to Fast to morrow; a
Friend comes in, and either invites himself to Dine with you, or you
to Dine with him; and now its ten to one, but either out of modesty
or human respect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you break your purpose of Fasting. But when a
day is set apart for Fasting or Abstinence by a common Law, every
one presumes his Neighbour observes it, and does not expect that for
his sake he should Violate it. Fasting and Prayer are strangely useful
to save our souls, and it concerns Superiors to secure some times
for them in their Subjects, let them super-add what they please by
their own private Devotions. And we find it but too true by too sad
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:109113:21"/>
experience in too many, what the <hi>German Lutheran</hi> confessed to his
Son. His Son refusing to eat upon a <hi>Fasting-day,</hi> he told him he was
not to Fast upon <hi>Fridays</hi> or <hi>Saturdays,</hi> or any other Set-days, that
was Superstition, but when the Spirit moved him: His Son demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I pray Father when did the Spirit move you to Fast, these thirty
years you have been a <hi>Lutheran:</hi> He ingenuously confest, <hi>By Goat
niet een mael; By God not once.</hi> And indeed it is a sad thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
in our poor Country how many Zelots there are amongst us for
Religion, and yet how seldom or never at all they Fast. Nay, many
of them, because they are loth to condemn their own practices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the holy Scripture sometimes Allegorically calls Abstinence from
sin Fasting, look upon Abstinence from Meat and Drink as no true
Fast: As if they should say there were no such thing prohibited by
God as Carnal Adultery and Fornication, because in a Spiritual and
Allegorical sense Idolatry or a Worshipping of false Gods, is often
called in Holy Writ Fornication and Adultery. But this is the just
punishment of Pride and Self-conceit, God ever resisting the Proud,
but giving Grace to the Humble; &amp; deservedly do they fall into a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Spiritual Phrensies and Madnesses, who prefer their own private
seeming sense of H. Scriptures, not only before the judgment of their
present Guides and Teachers, but also before the unanimous inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the prime Christian Saints and Doctors of all Ages, whom
God has appointed to preserve us, whilst we adhere to their solid Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
from being carryed away with every wind of Doctrin of our
own private Opinions.</p>
            <p>Whom all that has been said cannot perswade to a Religious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the Penitential time of Lent, I have one reasonable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
to them, that they would but for one year Fast as many days
out of private Devotion, as they do who <hi>Fast</hi> at Set-times and days
commanded by an extrinsecal Authority; and I perswade my self,
they would find so great spiritual benefit thereby, that they would
clearly see, <hi>Fasting</hi> being good in it self, its being commanded by
our Superiors, can never make it Superstition. I deny not but the
change of the Primitive Christian way of <hi>Fasting</hi> into a meer mock-abstinence
from certain kind of Meats, by Set-Fasters, gave but too
great occasion to many simple well-meaning people, to look upon all
Fasting as a meer Superstition: It being hard to conceive that ever the
Apostles could appoint such a manner of Fasting as is too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
practised by Pretenders to follow Apostolical Institutions in
their Set-Fasts. For what say Non-Conformists, if we must upon
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109113:22"/>
the Authority of Primitive Fathers <hi>Fast</hi> Lent, why then ought we
not to follow the manner of <hi>Fasting</hi> prescribed by the same Fathers?
Now they recommend to us as well Abstinence from Wine as flesh, and
only one temperate Refection towards the Evening. As for Answer
to this Objection, we all acknowledge our fault, and are resolved se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
to endeavor amendment, and according to our Corporal and
Spiritual strength piously to emulate the Primitive Christians <hi>Fasting:</hi>
And would you joyn with us in so holy an exercise, we hope what our
own simple knowledge is not able to prevail with our sensual Nature
to do, your good example would shame us into the effectual perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of, at least in some good measure. And now I hope your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
is Answered. And a happy solution this indeed God grant it.
But its time to add a word concerning the Practical manner of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fasting.</p>

how to Fast.</head>
               <p>BUt now we are resolved to keep Lent, how may we keep it so as to
do our bodys no hurt, and our souls a great deal of good?
We must remember God-Almighty loves a cheerful giver, and
therefore whether we do more or less Mortification, this Sacred Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential
time, let us do it with a chearful Heart and Countenance. And
although there can be no doubt, but the more strictly we can prevail
with our selves to <hi>Fast,</hi> we may hope for the more abundant benefit
from our <hi>Fasting;</hi> yet we must consider the proportion not only of
our Corporal, but also of our Spiritual forces; we must Mortifie our
bodys but not Kill them; we must humble soul and body for our sins,
but yet with such regard to our measure of Divine Grace and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
strength, that we do not make our lives tedious and intolerably
irksome. It was not want of Corporal but Spiritual strength which
made our B. Lord excuse his weak Apostles from the rigorous <hi>Fasts</hi>
of the Disciples of S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> and the <hi>Pharisees.</hi> The strong
new Wine of <hi>Fasting</hi> put into such craz'd Bottles as they were, before
they were strengthened with the Infusion of the H. Ghost upon the
day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> would have broken them all in pieces. We must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
humble our selves this Penitential time for our unfaithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Divine Majesty, but yet so as we do not make our selves
wholly weary of his Service. And when Penitential works seem grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
to our delicate frail bodys, we must encourage our selves to go
on by reflecting, <hi>Aut Panitendum aut ardendum<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> we must either gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:109113:23"/>
Chastise our selves for our sins in this world, or else severely be
for ever Chastized by God-Almighty for them in the other. And
this will make us cry out amidst our most rigorous <hi>Fasts,</hi> with the
Devout S. <hi>Bernard. O bonum judicium quod me divino subducit Iudicio.
O good, O welcome self-judgment which frees me from the severe Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p>But how must we Fast this Holy Time? In the first place we must
have a special care to Fast from Sin. <hi>Illa est in Quadragesimae die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>This</hi> (says S. <hi>Austin</hi>) <hi>is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> no small<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> benefit of the Lenten-Fast,
that whilst at that time we even abstain from lawful things, we are
vehemently admonished much more to avoid such things as are unlawful:
For we, who abstain from flesh, which we may lawfully eat upon other
days: We, who abstain from Wine, which we may lawfully drink mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately:
We, who abstain from those things which sometimes are lawful,
especially ought to abstain from Sin, which never is lawful. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we desire well to Fast from Meat, in the first place let us Fast also
from Vices,</hi> &amp;c. otherwise we may justly fear that severe Reproach of
Almighty-God, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. to his own People the <hi>Iews,</hi> concerning days
and observances of his own appointment, because Celebrated by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
living habitually in grievous sins: <hi>Who hath required this at your
hand, to tread my Courts?—Incense is an Abomination to me—Your
new-Moons, and your appointed Feasts;</hi> your Embers, Vigils,
and Lent-Fasts <hi>my soul hateth, they are a trouble to me, I am weary to
bear them. When you make many prayers, I will not hear, your hands
are full of blood.</hi> Had not the Penitent <hi>Ninevites</hi> joyned with their
Fasting and Sack-cloath amendment of their wicked lives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had
not escaped the Destruction threatned them from God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
by his Prophet <hi>Ionah.</hi> Chap. 3. ver. 10. <hi>And God saw their
Works, that they turned from their evil Way, and God repented of
the Evil that he had said that he would do unto them, and he did
it not.</hi> And indeed, what can be more absurd, and impiously
prophane, than when we are professing to endeavour to appease
God Almighties Anger for our Sins, by Fasting and other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations;
then actually to incense him to Wrath and Indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against us, by deliberately offending of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:109113:23"/>
Secondly, Have a special care you so Fast, as your Fasting be
a real Mortification unto you, and not a mere Mock-Fast; A
pure Abstinence from Flesh, and a real Feasting upon other Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ands.
Let us not deceive our selves; the God before whom
we pretend to humble our selves is not mocked: He is the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerousest
Person in the World to go about to cheat, and impose
upon. And think seriously, what is the true End of our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
in commanding us Fasting and Abstinence; and then order
our Eating and Drinking, as we miss not of That. If it be to
dispose us for Prayer and other Spiritual Exercises, to appease
Gods Anger towards us for onr Sins past, to weaken the Strength
of Concupiscence enclining us to sin for the time to come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
be sure we do nothing on a Fasting-Day destructive of those
Ends. We must look upon Fasting as the Physick of our Souls,
prescribed to us by our Spiritual Doctors and Physitians, not
purely to show their Authority, and exercise our Obedience; but
as absolutely necessary for the recovery of our Spiritual Health,
vvhich we have lost by Sin: And therefore, if any one should go
about to dispense with you, as to the taking of this bitter Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
before you admit of his Dispensation, ask him what Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
he can give you, it shall go equally well with your Souls
Health, whether you take the unsavory Potion of Fasting or no?
<hi>VVe fell sick</hi> (sayes S. <hi>Basil.</hi> Ho. 1. de Jeju.) <hi>by Sin, we are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by Repentance. But Rep<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ntance without Fasting is vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</hi>
And to Fast from one sort of Viands, and Feast upon
another; or to Fast from Meat, and what we want in Meat to
make it up with strong Drink, is as good never a whit as never
the better. And in such a manner to pretend to attone your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
God by Fasting, is as if you should make shew of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
your self by wearing Sack-Cloath, and secretly line
your Sack-cloath with Plush. And he who will regulate his Fasting
by what Latitudinarian Guides and Directors tell him he may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
do upon a Fasting-day, without breach of his Fast, whereas his
Blessed Saviour, whom he pretends to imitate, Fasting 40. Days and
40. Nights, was afterwards a hungry, he may Fast 40. Days and
40. Nights without e're being hungry, either in the time of his Mock-fast,
or afterwards. And this I take to be the true reason, why many
complain they have kept many Lents with little or no profit to their
souls, and with good reason, because they seldom or never really
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109113:24"/>
and indeed <hi>Fasted;</hi> but instead of endeavouring according to their
strength to humble themselves by more and more rigorous Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
they have sought by all means possible to cheat those Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
days. Hear not me, but S. <hi>Basil</hi> above, concerning those, who
because a five-days <hi>Fast</hi> was at hand, would make themselves drunk
the day before. <hi>Si cras venias vinum obolens,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If thou comest to
morrow smelling of Wine and its putrid and corrupted Crudities, how
shall I impute to thee thy drunken Surfet for a Fast. In which order
shall I place th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e? Amongst Drunkards, or amongst Fasters?</hi> But in
what order think you would the Holy Father have placed those, who
not barely smell of Wine drunk to excess the day before, but upon
the very Fasting-day it self, drink their skins full of Wine? Had we a
deep sense how much the health of the soul is to be preferr'd before
the pleasure of the body, and a strong Faith, how exceedingly Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
conduces to the souls health, all the World would be in love with
<hi>Fasting;</hi> and though our Constitutions would not permit us to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from flesh, this Love would wake us so ingenious to Mortifie
our selves in a temperate use of flesh, that we should no less reap the
fruit of <hi>Fasting,</hi> than those who lived upon Fish or Herbs. <hi>Let us by
no means</hi> (says S. <hi>Basil</hi>) <hi>receive the days that are approaching with a
sad heart, but as becomes Saints with a chearful affection.—Be not sad
when thou art Cured. It would be very absurd if we should grieve for the
substraction of our Victuals, and not rather rejoyce for the health of our
soul; and so seem to value more the pleasure of our belly than the cure of
our mind. For fulness causes delight unto the belly, but fasting is gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to the soul. Rejoyce, for that is given thee an efficacious Medicine to
abolish sin. For as Worms which breed in the bowels of Children are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
by certain sharp and bitter Medicines, so Sin that abides in the
inmost recesses of the soul, is instantly kill'd and extinguish'd by fasting,
which purges the bowels of the mind.—Do not imitate the disobedience
of</hi> Eve; <hi>do not again make the Serpent thy Counsellor, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text
of sustaining thy body, perswades thee to eat. Do not excuse thy
self for thy infirm Constitution; do not say thou art not able to endure fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For thou doest not make those excuses to me, but according to the
Proverb, thou speakest to one who knows the Truth, to wit, to God, who
is ignorant of nothing. Go to then, tell m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, canst thou not Fast, and
canst thou fill thy self with variety of Meats, canst thou surcharge
thy body with the weight of Victuals? But we know Physitians are wont
to prescribe to such as are infirm not abundance of Food, but a spare
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109113:24"/>
Dyet and Abstinence. How comes it to pass then that you can feast, But
pretend you can not fast? Whether is it more easie to the belly to pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Night with a slender Refection, or to lye opprest with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Meats? Yea, indeed not to lye, but stretching and groaning
continually to turn, now to this side, and now to that?</hi> But what mod<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in eating and drinking should we do well to use upon Fasting-days?
Consult God and your own Conscience, and such as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the right exercise and great benefit of true <hi>Fasting.</hi> In three
words. Be contented with one temperate Meal taken as late as your
health and other circumstances will permit. Drink no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> strong drink,
or very sparingly, and this only at your Meal; and though you
should take some small matter at night, Even such an abstinence
would not want its singular Spiritual advantages, so you exercised it
not merely in a Customary manner, but for good Christian ends, with
sincerity as in the sight of God, according to the measure of your
health and strength.</p>
               <p>Thirdly: Be sure to joyn with the exterior Mortification of your
body, the interior Humiliation of your soul by a hearty sorrow and
contrition for your sins. Though you give your whole Estate to the
Poor, if you want Charity, it will avail you nothing: And though
you make your body a mere Skeleton, by rigorous Fasting and Absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
if your heart be not truly Penitent and sorry for your sins,
all's to no purpose. A broken and an humble heart is a Sacrifice
which God-Almighty will by no means despise: But if contrition of
heart be wanting, all exterior Mortifications will be rejected. And
it is want of this which makes Fasting and other voluntary Austerities
and Involuntary Crosses seem hard and intolerable unto us. A soul
deeply humbled with an intimate sense of its deserts for its manifold
sins and wickednesses, thinks all Meats, all Cloaths, all Lodging, and
whatsoever Accommodations too good for it. But as exterior acts of
Charity beget and encrease true Charity in our hearts, so exterior
Penitential works are apt to beget and encrease interior Penitential
sorrow in our souls. And though the interior of Charity, Repentance,
and other Vertues be the chief and main thing we are to aim at, yet all
interior pretences to any Vertue, which show not themselves in exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
acts, are to be suspected as Counterfeit. What St. <hi>Austin</hi> says
of Charity, is no less true of Repentance, or any other Vertue. <hi>Amor
si est,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Love, if it be in us, it will be working; if it do not work, it
is not in us; if it be great, it will work great things.</hi> Repentance, if
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109113:25"/>
it be in us, it will be working by Fasting, and other Penitential works;
if it works not, it is not in us; if it be great, it will work great things.
Christian Vertues with their exterior acts, are not unfitly compared
to some rich Wine in a Cask or Vessel. A rich Wine without a Cask
or Vessel to contain it, cannot be presented; a bare Cask presented
without the rich Liquor in it, would not be accepted, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. 12.
<hi>Therefore also now saith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your heart,
with Fasting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly: Take heed of corrupting the Mortification of your
Fasting by excess in other joyances. Holy <hi>Daniel</hi> in his three weeks
Fast, abstained not only from pleasant Food, but also from Anoynting
of himself, <hi>Ch. 10. v. 3. I ate no pleasant Bread, neither came Flesh nor
Wine in my mouth; neither did I Anoynt my self at all, till three weeks
were fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <l>Vtamur ergo parcius,</l>
                  <l>Verbis, cibis, &amp; potibus,</l>
                  <l>Somnio, jocis, &amp; arctius</l>
                  <l>Perstemus in Custodia.</l>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us be more sparing, not only in our Meat and Drink, but also in
our Words, Sleep, and Recreations, and keep a more Vigilant Watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
our selves, that in nothing we exceed.</hi> And the reason is manifest,
for one great end of Fasting being by that exterior Mortification to
beget or encrease interior Contrition and Sorrow of heart for sin,
it manifestly follows, if we seriously design the end of Fasting, we
ought carefully to moderate all other Joyances, however in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Lawful, and at another time laudable, which manifestly impede
our designed end, least we pull down with one hand, what we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to build up with the other, and make our Spirits as vain and
light by frothy Conversations and other Divertisements, as we make
them grave and sober by Fasting and Abstinence, Hear the 4th.
Council of <hi>Toledo, c. 5. In omnibus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In all the foresaid days of
Lent we ought to insist on Fasting and Mourning, to cover the body with
Hair-cloath and Ashes, to humble our mind with Mournings, to change
our Ioy into Heaviness, until the time of the Resurrection of Christ,
when we are with joy to sing Allelujah, and turn our heaviness into
gladness. For this the consent of the Vniversal Church in all parts of
the Earth hath confirmed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:109113:25"/>
Fiftly: Spend more time in Prayer, Meditation of Divine things,
and Spiritual reading and hearing of Sermons; for one great end of
Fasting is the better to dispose us for these Spiritual exercises. <hi>Venter
non habet aures</hi> The pampered paunch is to nothing deafer than to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inspirations. <hi>Impletus venter non vult studere libenter.</hi> The full
belly has no great mind to study, but much less to speak to God-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
by devout Prayer, or to hear him speak to it by spiritual
reading and hearing of Sermons. Thus the Antient people of God,
the <hi>Iews,</hi> spent the fourth part of their days of publick <hi>Fasting</hi> and
Atonement, in reading and hearing the Law of Almighty God, and
another fourth part in worshipping the same God with devout prayers.
<hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. v. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Now in the twenty and fourth day of this moneth,
the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>were Assembled with Fasting, and with Sack-cloathes
and Earth upon them. And the Seed of</hi> Israel <hi>separated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from all Strangers, and stood and confessed their Sins, and the
Iniquities of their Fathers: And they stood up in their place, and read in
the Book of the Law of the Lord their God, one fourth part of the day,
and another fourth part they confessed and worshipped the Lord their God.</hi>
And the Church of Christ has ever in Lent, to Prayers and Fastings,
annexed more frequent hearing and Preaching God's Word; and
many of S. <hi>Crysostoms</hi> Golden Homilies, as likewise of others of the
Antient Fathers, were Sermons Preached day by day, in Lent, to the
people. Hear S. <hi>Crysostom,</hi> upon those words of our Blessed Saviour,
<hi>This kind goes not out, but by Prayer and Fasting:</hi> Qui orat, <hi>&amp;c.
He that prays with Fasting, hath two Wings, and those lighter than the
Winds themselves; for such an one doth not stretch himself, or yawn, or
is drowsie in his Prayer—He that fasteth is light and winged, and
prays with Vigilancy, and extinguishes his own evil Lusts, and renders
God propitious to himself, and humbles his own soul that was lift up. For
this cause also the Apostles in a manner continually Fasted—Fasting
with Faith, brings into the soul a great force, and much Philosophy, and
makes of a man an Angel, and helps him to fight with incorporeal powers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly: What we defraud our own Appetite of by <hi>Fasting,</hi> let
our Lord Jesus eat by the mouth of his Poor. And this indeed is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
end and fruit of Fasting, to make us more able and more willing
to relieve those in necessity. To feel some hunger our selves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
makes us more tenderly compassionate of those who in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
are continually hungry; and its manifest, the less we expend on
our selves, the more we have to bestow on the Needy and Indigents
and daily experience teaches us that none are more liberally Chari<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ble
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:109113:26"/>
to others, then those who are most Christianly severe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
And no wonder, their frequent Abstinences demonstratively
convincing them that the best use of wealth is, to spend as little as
they can upon themselves, and as much as they can upon their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Neighbors. And hence also follows another admirable fruit of
Religious <hi>Fasting;</hi> to wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an absolute indifferency to worldly
riches and abundance. For who will break his Sleep, or weary his
Limbs to get that, which he believes when he has gotten, the best use
he can make of it, is to give it away to others. Hear the Antient and
Learned <hi>Origen.</hi> Hom. 10. <hi>in</hi> Levit. 16. <hi>Habemus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We have the
days of Lent Consecrated to Fastings; we have the</hi> 4th, <hi>and</hi> 6th. <hi>days of
the week, whereon we solemnly Fast—There is also yet another Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
way of Fasting, whose praise is set forth in writing from certain of
the Apostles; for we find in a certain Book, that it was said by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,
Blessed is he who fasts also for that end, that he may relieve the
Poor. This Mans Fast is much accepted with God.</hi> Hear S. <hi>Chrysolog.</hi>
Serm. 8. de Jejun. <hi>Eleemosynae,</hi> &amp;c: <hi>Alms and Prayers are the
wings of Fasting, by which 'tis carryed up to Heaven, without which it
lyes dead and spiritless upon the Earth.—Let us therefore, O my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
when we Fast, deposit our Dinner in the hand of the Poor, that
their hand may preserve for us what our belly would have lost us.—The
hand of the Poor is the Treasury of Christ—He that Fasts not to the
Poor, doth but feign a Fast to God—Fasting without works of mercy,
is but an empty Image of Hunger. Without pitty to others, 'tis but an
occasion taken of Covetousness. Because by such sparing, what is taken
down in the flesh, swells in the bag.</hi> In fine, hear God-Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
<hi>Isa. 58. Is not this the Fast that I have chosen—Is it not to deal
thy Bread to the Hungry, and that thou bring the Poor that are cast out
into thy house? When thou seest the Naked, that thou cover him, and that
thou hide not thy self from thine own flesh?</hi> And now would all Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to fast in Lent, and upon other Set-days, Fast in some tolerable
manner, according to what right reason, Holy Scriptures, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
Fathers direct us, as has been showen; the Devil himself would
be ashamed to call such Fasting the Doctrin of <hi>Daemons,</hi> Will-worship,
or Superstition.</p>
               <p>But to Fast truly and Christianly, is troublesome to flesh and blood.
It cannot be denyed. And this is indeed the true cause we have so
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>s of Lent-Fast amongst us. The want of express Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>om
 Fast, is, the difficulty flesh and blood finds in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:109113:26"/>
Fasting. But as to this, we must help our selvas sometimes, by call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to mind the bitter eternal torments we have deserved for our sins;
and this will make us ashamed to complain of the gentle Pennance of
the most rigorous Lent-Fast. Had God-Almighty, upon the account
of our manifold sins and wickednesses, required of us some great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for example, To have Fasted our whole Lives with Bread and
Water, ought we not gladly to have done it? How much rather then
ought we to comply most willingly with his most equitable and gentle
command of Fasting moderately sometimes? How gladly would a
Damned Soul accept of a <hi>Methusalem</hi>'s Age of rigorous Fasting, and
whatsoever most severe Mortifications in exchange for its intolerable
eternal torments? And no less gladly and willingly ought we to do or
suffer any thing never so troublesome to flesh and blood, to prevent
our falling into the same state of immutable unsufferable misery. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and seriously to think of this; to wit, that except we Repent with
Fasting, Weeping and Mourning, we must Perish, and that eternally,
would make the most rigorous severity seem gentle and easie. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles
let us call to mind the eternal joyful <hi>Easter</hi> a Religious devout
Lent-Fast will end in. And this will make us cry out with the great
S. <hi>Paul, The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with
the future glory which shall be revealed in us.</hi> Whatsoever we can suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
by Fasting, or whatsoever other Christian severity in this our time,
upon this Earth, is light &amp; easie, if compared with the immense weight
of eternal glory, which expects us in the other Life. Courage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
O my soul. Sigh, Pray, and Fast; Heaven will make amends
for all. <hi>Si credis omnia patere, si non pateris non credis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>O Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Man</hi> (says the Divine S. <hi>Crysostom</hi>) <hi>If thou believest, be willing to
suffer all things; if thou art not willing to suffer, thou doest not believe;
for such and so great things are promised us, that rather than fall short of
them, we ought to suffer a thousand deaths;</hi> undoubtedly a few Lent-Fasts.
<hi>Immortality, Glory, a Kingdom, an eternal Kingdom is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto us.</hi> To which Kingdom, He, who to teach us the way to it,
Fasted 40. days and 40. nights, bring all devout Imitators of his
Quadragesimal Fast. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>A Postscript.</head>
            <p>IF any one be offended at the proving of Lent to be an Apostolical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
by the unanimous Tradition of all Christian Countrys,
they are desired to Reflect, First, how they would Tryumph, had
they a like Tradition but even of one Country for a Non observance of
Set-Fasts: And Secondly, how that all Christian Churches agree, that
a Sacred Reverence is to be given to whatsoever Doctrins or Pract<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ces
can be proved to be Apostolical, by a truly universal unanimous Tradition:
But the dispute betwixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and Church of <hi>England,</hi>
is, whether certain Doctrins or Practices were indeed always, every
where, by all, or in a manner by all Christian Doctors acknowledged as
Apostolical: I say by all, or in a manner by all; for as Bishop <hi>Gunning</hi>
well observes, <hi>p.</hi> 132. he would in a dangerous degree disserve our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Christianity, who would reject some Book of H. Scripture, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles
for example of S. <hi>James</hi> and S. <hi>Jude,</hi> or something for being a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
Apostolical for the positive possible Rejection of some one <hi>Socrates,</hi> or
other Ecclesiastical Writer, or some one or a few Fathers, against the known
generality and consent of the rest of Antient Writers, and immemorial
witness or practice of whole Christian Countrys. And the reason is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
especially in our present particular matter of Practice. Had the
H. Apostles for example, in the several Countrys they Converted to
Christianity, taught no such thing as Abstinence from certain Meats on
