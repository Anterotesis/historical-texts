            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Present your Highnes with the Life of your Royal <hi>Oncle</hi> of France, A success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and triumphant King both at home and abroad throughout the whole course of his Raign, and that, in so constant a degree, as if <hi>Fortune</hi> herself had bin his <hi>Companion,</hi> and <hi>Victory,</hi> his <hi>Handmayd:</hi> They attended
<pb facs="tcp:98453:3"/>
Him o're the <hi>Alps;</hi> They usher'd Him o're the <hi>Pyreneys;</hi> They were his Harbingers o're the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and they brought his horses to drink of the <hi>Danube;</hi> They were his Pilots at Sea, and they fill'd his sayles upon the Ocean, where he was incomparably more powerfull then all his Progenitors.</p>
            <p>Nor would I adventure to expose thus to the present world, and transmit to future Ages the Raign of a <hi>For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rein</hi> King, had not I bin <hi>Spectator</hi> of divers of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits (and had occasion also to make my addresse to his <hi>Cardinal;</hi>) for the rest, I have labour'd to gather as faithfull instructions and authentic notes as I could, and those not upon loose trust or from light persons; The Relations, which are the ingredients of this Story, were not taken at the <hi>Porters lodge,</hi> but above staires, and most of them from the Counsell Table, and Courts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>This Victorious King began to bear Arms and wear <hi>buff,</hi> about the same yeers that your Highnes did, for before he was thirteen, He suppress'd in person two Insurrections in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and <hi>Britany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> He quell'd divers more, which at last turn'd to his advantage, as we find great trees growing towards their full consistence, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborat and take firmer rooting being shaken with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, by the resistance they make: So by debelling so many civill commotions he came to finde his own strength the more, and to be <hi>fear'd</hi> as well as <hi>belov'd</hi> of his Subjects, and a mixture of these two passions make an excellent government; For though <hi>the strongest Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of a King be his Peoples love,</hi> and their <hi>hearts his best Exchequer,</hi> yet it is observ'd, that <hi>Love without Feare commonly turns to Scorn, and Fear without Love turns into Hatred.</hi> In the perusall of this Royal Story, if Your <hi>Highnes</hi> please to observe the circumstances and grounds of some intestin broyles, You shall find that divers of them have a neer analogie with these of <hi>England,</hi> for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:98453:3"/>
grew from discontents, that the great <hi>Convention of the three Estates was discontinued, and that France adhaer'd to Spanish Counsels,</hi> with other resemblances besides; Of these and other kind of commotions there happen'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ten in this Kings Raign: Nor is it any news to hear that <hi>France,</hi> hath such fits of distemper, or indeed any Countrey else, that labours with superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, I mean that swels with exces of people and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; for as the <hi>Natural</hi> body when it is too repleat must have some vent, just so, the <hi>Political,</hi> must have some E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuations at home or abroad when it is too full, and t'will thrive the better upon't afterward. If we cast our eyes upon the great world we shall find restlesse moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reluctations and combatings between the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet we cannot call this any incongruitie or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in the frame of things, but it tends to the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the whole, and may be said to keep <hi>Nature</hi> herself in action and health; That the <hi>Earth</hi> trembleth, the <hi>Sea</hi> tumbleth, that the <hi>Aire</hi> is alwayes in agitation, that 'tis rent with thunder, coruscations, and other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teorological impressions; that all the Elements are in an incessant feud, it is for the Vniversal good, and to keep things vigorous, and fresh; So in <hi>Man</hi> who is the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crocosm,</hi> the <hi>little world,</hi> and made up of elements, there be passions and humors which are in perpetuall relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance within him, and so break out into tumults, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations, and war; And where this war is well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, 'tis wholsom, and the victories that are acquir'd thereby, are <hi>Decreta Caeli,</hi> the <hi>Decrees of Heaven,</hi> but in an ill grounded war they are no other then <hi>Faelicia Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera, fortunat villanies:</hi> Moreover, to transcend the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if we mark the course of the <hi>heavenly</hi> bodies themselfs, there are crosse motions amongst them, they are in perpetuall revolutions and circumgyrations, nay, there are branlings and <hi>trepidations</hi> amongst them, (which yet the wisest of Philosophers held to be no

other then an harmonious sound, and sweet regular sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony,) And as the gran <hi>Vnivers</hi> runs thus alwayes <hi>round,</hi> and carryeth all bodies after it; So <hi>Man,</hi> who is part or rather the <hi>Epitome</hi> thereof, specially in reference to his actions, may be said to dance in a circle; For there is not any thing now acted, but may be parallell'd, and exemplified by some Age or other. Therefore among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent fruits of <hi>Story</hi> this is none of the least, <hi>to put one off, from wondring at any thing,</hi> because he meets with precedents and patterns of all sorts in former times; He that wil observe how some of the great Roman Emperors were content to live in <hi>Capreae</hi> (a petty Island) how the Princes of Italy fled to the <hi>Lakes</hi> of Venice for safetie, how some of our Kings to the <hi>Isle</hi> of Man, how <hi>Charles</hi> the seventh had no other town to keep his Court in but <hi>Bourges</hi> in <hi>Berry,</hi> one of the smallest Provinces in all <hi>France,</hi> which made him call'd a good while <hi>King of Berry;</hi> with a world of such examples, will nothing wonder that your Highnes keeps his Court now at <hi>Ier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey.</hi> Nor is this present Story a plain down-right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd narration of things, for to compile such a work, is as easie as to make fagots, or to trusse up a bundle of straw; but (besides other observations and excursions) that which the Author chiefly aymes at, is to make the <hi>method of providence</hi> in dispensing judgements, and to make a research of the causes of them <hi>de longue main,</hi> for they seldom come immediatly one upon another, but many yeers, and sometimes a whole age intervenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the judgement and the cause.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I have bin carefull in this Story to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicat <hi>England</hi> touching the circumstance of some traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> twixt <hi>Her and France,</hi> during this Kings Raign, which are misreported by the French <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niclers:</hi> there will be other censures found here besides, but this I have done as he <hi>that kill'd the Serpent upon the childs head without touching his body.</hi>

he been <hi>Knight, Baron</hi> and <hi>Marshall,</hi> it had put a farre clearer lustre (though with lesse noise) upon his abilities, which were not common; And he had the opportunity and advantage to shew them upon so high and open a theatre, that he made the whole Europaean world his Spectator: Indeed a sword hangs not handsomly by a Churchmans side, and a <hi>morrion</hi> upon a <hi>mitre</hi> shewes ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favouredly: But me thinks I heare this martiall Prelate passe it over, as Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the second did upon like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, who having had a long feud with the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> (against whom he had fought twelve battels) and being one day gently admonish'd by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Ostia</hi> who had consecrated him (and whose pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar jurisdiction it is to consecrate all Popes) how S. <hi>Peter</hi> his first predecessor was commanded <hi>to put up his sword,</hi> T'is true said <hi>Iulius, Our Saviour gave the prime Apostle such a command, but t'was after he had given the blow, and cut off</hi> Malchus <hi>eare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So this adventrous Cardinall got out his Masters sword to cut off the excrescencies, and to loppe the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant boughes of that broad-spreading <hi>Austrian</hi> Tree, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they would extend and shoot out into <hi>France;</hi> As also to clip the wings of the <hi>Imperiall Eagle,</hi> who was in a faire way to recover some of his old feathers, I meane those <hi>Hansiatick</hi> and other free Townes in Germanie, who had emancipated themselves time out of minde for money, and by other meanes from the Empire: But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not finish'd the worke, Both of them have left the weapon still unsheath'd, and dropping pittifully with Christian blood, and Heaven onely knowes, when it will be put up againe.</p>
            <p>Now to proceede more regularly in my intended sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, I will begin with the <hi>Monarch,</hi> and then fall upon the <hi>Minister,</hi> it being consentaneous to reason, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to good manners, that the Master should have prioritie of the Servant, though I am not ignorant how some mercenary Chroniclers would hoise the <hi>Cap</hi> above
<pb facs="tcp:98453:6"/>
the <hi>Crowne;</hi> They seeme to attribute the successe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of things more to the <hi>Minister,</hi> praising him with greater industry and heat; They would cut his name in <hi>marble,</hi> and his Masters but in <hi>freestone:</hi> By a new Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy they make such a Constellation of him as should give a greater lustre in the French firmament, then the <hi>Sunne</hi> from whence he had deriv'd all his light: Others goe further, and seeme to idolatrize him, by calling him the <hi>good Genius</hi> and <hi>tutelar Angel</hi> of his Countrey, and <hi>that he was as necessarie for the government of France, as God Almighty was for the universe:</hi> Nay some soare high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and by monstrous parasiticall reaches of prophanenes would make the world believe that the Almightie had imparted unto him some of his own peculiar attributes, as to make him <hi>omniscious, cardiognostick, and to worke without the concurrence of second causes;</hi> which made one futilous pamphleter fall into an egregious bull, while scruing up his wit to hoise him aloft, he call'd Him the<note place="margin">fourth</note> person in the Trinitie.</p>
            <p>Such Scriblers as these are a more sordide sort of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, then those we read of, who lick'd up <hi>Dionysius</hi> his spittle, and in my judgement are a scandall to the noble French nation; besides, they rather eclipse then illustrate his worth; for his very enemies confesse, that his merit had matter enough for modestie her selfe to work upon without such ridiculous hyperbolies, and forc'd transcendencies; For <hi>Vertue</hi> (whereof there shin'd in him many <hi>eminent</hi> pieces) is <hi>of her selfe so amiable</hi> and powerfull, that shee attracts all eyes upon her, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts praise and admiration from foe as well as friend. The truth is, that all those yeares this great minister sate at the helm, may be term'd a time of miracles, by that prodigious course of constant successe matters had abroad and at home, as if he had struck a nail in <hi>Fortunes</hi> wheele, that shee should not turne all the while.</p>
            <p>Yet let me tell you, there wanted not those that writ as <hi>satyrically</hi> of him, as others did <hi>sycophantically,</hi> as will
<pb facs="tcp:98453:7"/>
appeare in his life; for though his habit was in <hi>grain,</hi> yet there were many foul <hi>spots</hi> cast upon it, insomuch that the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> with other nations, thought it would never be fit to make reliques of, because it was so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drencht in blood; Nay some of his owne Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, specially the poore face-grounded Peasan, doe much doubt whether he that was so much <hi>deified</hi> upon earth, will ever be a <hi>Saint</hi> in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But now to the maine designe the life of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, and to take him in all his proportions we will go first to his cradle, and begin with his nativitie and <hi>Dauphinage;</hi> Then we will on to his <hi>minoritie</hi> or bassage; and thence to his <hi>majoritie</hi> and raigne, and so our storie shall grow up with him in dimensions and yeares.</p>

               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ewis</hi> the thirteenth (second French King of the Bourbon line) had for his father Henry the <hi>great,</hi> and the <hi>great</hi> Duke of Toscanies daughter for his mother; The first we know was sent out of the world by <hi>Ravaillac,</hi> the second by <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu,</hi> as some out of excesse of passion doe sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest: For this great Queene having conceived a deep displeasure, and animositie against him, and not liking his counsels, and course of policy to put quarrels, and kindle a war betwixt her children, in a high discontentment she abandon'd France, and so drew a banishment upon her selfe, which expos'd her to divers encumbrances, removes and residences abroad, and this some thinke accelerated her end: For <hi>great spirits have this of fastnesse and constancie in them, that where their indignation is once fixed, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their counsels cross'd, their authoritie lessen'd, and the motions of their soules resisted, they come ofttimes to breake, rather then bow: As we see the huge Cedars, who, scorning to comply, with the windes and stormes, fall more frequently, then the Willow and poore plying Osier, who yeeld and crouch to every puffe.</hi> But to our chiefe taske.</p>
            <p>When the sixteenth Christian centurie went out, <hi>Lewis</hi> the thir teenth came into the world, and he began the seventeenth, being borne in the yeere sixteene hundred and one, about the Antumnall <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> which was held to be a good presage, that he would prove a good <hi>Iusticer:</hi> The Queene had a hard delivery, her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy having beene distemper'd by eating of fruit too freely, so that when the Midwife brought him forth to the King, and to the Princes of the blood in the next roome, who, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of France, use to be present for preventing of foule play for an Heire apparant of the Crown, his tender body was become black and blue with roughnesse of handling, and the Midwife thinking to have spouted some wine out of her mouth into his, the King tooke the bottle himselfe, and put it to the Dauphins lips, which reviv'd his spirits. His publique Baptisme was not celebrated till five yeers after at <hi>Fontainebleau</hi> because the plague was in <hi>Paris,</hi> and the solemnitie was greater in preparation and expectance, then it was in performance. The King would have had him nam'd <hi>Charles,</hi> but the Mother over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rul'd, and gave the law in that point, and would have him called <hi>Lewis. Paul</hi> the fifth was his godfather notwithstanding that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish faction did predominate in the Conclave at his election, which happen'd about the time the <hi>Dauphin</hi> was borne: And the French Ambassadour then at Rome meeting with the Spanish, at Saint An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo, and telling him <hi>Ilmio Rè há fatto un maschio,</hi> my King hath made
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98453:8"/>
a sonne: The Spanish Ambassadour answer'd, <hi>&amp; il mio Rè há fatto un Papa,</hi> and my King hath made a Pope.</p>
            <p>It seemes that Mercury the father of eloquution, and who hath the powerfullest influence ore the tongue, was oppressed by a disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious conjunction with a more praedominate planet at his Birth, which appear'd by that naturall slownesse he had in his speech, as <hi>Lewis</hi> the sixt his predecessor (and last Emperour of the six French Kings) had. But a rare thing it was, and not to be paralleld in any age, that two of the greatest Kings of Europe, I meane the Dauphin we now write of, and His Majesty of England now regnant, should come both into the world within lesse then ten moneths compasse, the one in November, the other in September next following; I say a most rare thing it was that it should so fall out, that as they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries in yeares and raigne, the same kinde of utterance should be coincident and connaturall to them both, though the haesitation be lesse in <hi>Him</hi> of November: Besides, it seemes he is richly requited with the advantage of an incomparable imperious pen, wherein na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture joyning hand with Art, hath made him so rich a compensation, that he may well claime the palme of all his progenitors.</p>
            <p>But now againe to our Infant Dauphin, which the English with other call <hi>Dolphin</hi> commonly, but very corruptly; for 'tis not from a fish, but a faire Province that he derives this appellation the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant he comes into the world; the ground whereof was this. <hi>Humbert</hi> last Dauphin of Viennois having lost his eldest sonne in that famous battaile of <hi>Crecy</hi> against the English, and his tother sonne having died of a fall from betwixt the Fathers armes as he was dallying with him; The said <hi>Humbert</hi> being oppressed by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and others, transmitted and bequeathed as free gift the brave Province of <hi>Dauphinè</hi> unto <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> then King of France, with this proviso that his eldest sonne (and so of all successive Kings) should beare the title of Dauphin to perpetuity during their fathers lifes, holding it, as he did and his progenitors had done, in fee of the Empire.</p>
            <p>This was the sixteenth <hi>Dauphin</hi> since the first, who was <hi>Charles</hi> the wise in the yeare 1349. whereby I observe that the precedent title of the presomptif Heire of the Crowne of France, is not so ancient by halfe a hundred of yeares, as the title of <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> to the Heire apparant of England, which begun in <hi>Edward</hi> the firsts time, who conferred that honour upon his sonne <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Caernarvon</hi> 1301. But this title of <hi>Dauphin</hi> seemes to have a greater analogie with the Dukedome of Cornwall, which title was confer'd first upon the black Prince, because this as that of Dauphin needes no creation, for <hi>ipsissimo instante,</hi> the very moment that any of the King of Englands sons come to be Heire apparant of the Crowne, he is to have liverie and seisin given him of the Dutchy of Cornwall, with all the honours and lands annexed for his present support.</p>
            <p>Touching those publike passages of State that happened during the <hi>Dauphinage</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, while <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth lived,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98453:8"/>
we will nor meddle with them, because we would not confound the actions of the father with those of the sonne; He was educated with that speciall care and circumspection wherewith the <hi>Dauphins</hi> of France are wont to be bred, as also with that freedome from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much awe, and apprehensions of feare, which is observed in the French breeding generally, because the spirits may not be suppressed and cowd while they are ductible and young, and apt to take any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression: He was not much taken with his booke, nor any sedentary exercise, but with pastimes abroad, as shooting at flyes and small hedge birds, to which end his Father put to him <hi>Luynes</hi> who had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complacentious devices to fit his humour that way, for which petty volatill sports he <hi>soard</hi> at last to the highest pitch of honour that a French subject could flie unto, for of a gentleman in <hi>decimo sexto,</hi> he was made Duke, Peer, and Lord high Constable of all France; But he had the advantage to have the managing of his masters affection while it was green and pllable, and he did it with such dexterity, that those stamps which he made upon it then, continued firme and fresh to the last, as will appeare hereafter.</p>
            <p>And now must we passe from his <hi>Dauphinage</hi> to his minoritie, his Father being now defunct; And tis a sad tale to relate the manner how his Father was forcd out of the world, but told it must be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a necessary appendix to our storie.</p>
            <p>There was gentle calm through all Christendome, and France had not the least share of it, having continued <hi>twenty</hi> yeares together in a constant repose without the least tintamar or motion of arms (a rare thing amongst so <hi>spritefull and quicksilverd people to whom peace becomes a surfet any longer then they have pickt up their crumbs for a new warre</hi>) I say there was a <hi>catholick</hi> peace throughout Europe, when <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>fourth</hi> of France would needs get a horseback upon a great martiall designe, which was a mysterie for the time, for all men stood at a maze what he meant, the businesse was carried so closely; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he raiseth a potent Armie of horse and foot.</p>
            <p>But behold the greatest example of the lubricity and instablenes of mundane affaires, and of the sandie foundation whereon the highest pomp and purposes of men are grounded, that any age can parallell; For this great King, as I told a little before, having a most potent and irresistible armie compos'd of 40000. combatants, all choise men, led by veteran Commanders, and the most expert Europe could affoord, in a perfect equipage; Having also a mount of gold as high as a lance estimated at sixteene millions to maintaine this armie; Having assured his Confederates abroad, settled all things at home, causd his Queene to be crownd in the highest magnificence that could be, and appointed her Regent in his absence, behold this mighty King amongst these triumphs of his Queens, being to go next day to his armie, when his spirits were at the highest elevation, and his heart swelling with <hi>assurances</hi> rather then <hi>hopes</hi> of successe and glory, going one afternoone to his Arsenal, he was stopd in a small street, by so
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98453:9"/>
contemptible a thing as a colliers cart, and there from amongst the armes of his owne Nobles, he was thrust out of the world by one of the meanest of his owne vassals, who with a prodigious hardinesse putting his foot upon the coach wheeles, reachd him over the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of one of his greatest Lords, and stabd him to the very heart, and with a monstrous undauntednesse of resolution making good his first stab with a second, dispatchd him suddenly from off the earth, as if a mouse had strangled an elephant.</p>
            <q>—Sic parvis pereunt ingentia rebus.</q>
            <p>The French stories speake of divers auguries and predictions of his death; But I will insert here a passage or two that are not found in any printed Author, therefore not vulgar, and our intent is to refrain from stuffing this piece with any thing that hath bin too much blown upon; The first is a prophecie in an Italian manuscript from a good hand, written above an hundred yeares since, which runnes thus. <hi>Vn gran Ré di Francia havendo le spalle al Papa voltate, s'inchinera poi a Roma, &amp; al piu alto della sua' gloria</hi>
            </p>
            <lg>
               <l>Li taglierá la vita,</l>
               <l>Vn coltel feroce,</l>
               <l>Che n'andará la voce</l>
               <l>Per tutto'l mundo.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Thus rendred into English.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>A great French King, having his face</l>
               <l>Turn'd from the Pope, shall then embrace</l>
               <l>The Roman Faith, but after, He</l>
               <l>At highest pitch of Majesty</l>
               <l>Shall by a fatall knife be rent,</l>
               <l>To all the worlds astonishment.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>To this may be added the speech of <hi>Francisco Corvini</hi> a Toscan Astrologer, who the night before <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth was slaine leaning upon a Balcon in Florence, which is neer upon 600. miles from Paris, and prying into the motions of the starres, he suddenly broke out of his speculation into these words; <hi>Tomorrow one of the greatest Monarchs of Christendome will be slaine;</hi> And the very next day the mortall stab was given by <hi>Ravaillac,</hi> who had been seen often a little before at <hi>Brussels,</hi> and was observd to have frequent accesse, and much privacie with Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> which many wondred at being so plaine a man; A melancholy odde Humorist he was, one who had at times some flashes of illuminations, as his friends gave out: <hi>Now, such is the strength of imagination, and force of fancie, that having let in false ideas into the braine, and being fomented by some fatuous zeale, it hurles a man headlong oftentimes upon desperate attempts, and undertakings of inevitable danger, making him misprize his owne life, so that he may be master of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, especially when the enterprize is heated with hope of fame, revenge, or merit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus fell one of the compleatest Kings under which the flower de luces ever flourishd, a sprightfull and well tempred Prince, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently versd in the studie of men, alwayes well disposd, pleasant and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98453:9"/>
wittie, close in his counsels, and constant in his purposes, parsimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, yet open handed to Cadets whom he lovd to see about him ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then elder brothers whom <hi>nature</hi> had already advanced. And lastly (though this be but a quarter character of him) a great discerner and rewarder of worth and vertue, a brave qualitie and one of the prime requisits in a King; for subjects are industrious, or dissolute, they aspire to vertue and good parts according as their Prince hath judgement to distinguish and value their worth, and so to employ and advance them. The memory of this King is yet as fresh in France, as if he had been ta'ne away but yesterday, and his death was resented abroad as well as at home, being universally honourd by all nations, for the worst that his very enemies reported of him was, that he was a great Courtier of Ladies, whereupon this petulant Anagram was made of him.</p>
            <q>Henricus Borbonius. Hircus in orbe bonus.</q>
            <p>But take the aspiration away (and with it let the aspersion go) this befits him better.</p>
            <q>Cyrus in orbe bonus.</q>
            <p>Having spoken this little of the Fathers <hi>death,</hi> tis time now to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and pursue the <hi>life</hi> of the Sonne, and bring him to his <hi>minoritie;</hi> yet though a <hi>Minor,</hi> he is absolute King, He is already <hi>regnant,</hi> though his mother be <hi>Regent:</hi> And in regard method is a mighty advantage to memorie, and that the Logician gives us a good Rule, <hi>Qui benè di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidit, benè docet,</hi> A good Divider makes a good Disciple: we will make a quinquenniall partition of his raigne, we will divide it to so many lustres of yeares, and in the first his <hi>minoritie</hi> shall be included.</p>

            <p>THough the Sun was thus set in a dark <hi>ruddy</hi> cloud in the French<note place="margin">Anno 1610.</note> firmament, yet no night ensued, for another suddenly riseth up, and shoots his rayes through every corner of that part of the hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth. The season that he began thus to display his early beames, being the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> corresponded with the verdant time of his age, being not yet full nine yeares old, so he was cradled first in the <hi>Fall,</hi> and came to the crowne in the <hi>Spring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The report of the monstrous parricide committed on the person of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth did penetrate all hearts, and made a strange kinde of consternation to seise upon the minds of men, though it was no new thing in France to have their King torn away from them so, for it was fresh in the memorie of many thousands how two and twentie yeares before <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>third</hi> was dispatchd in that manner, though the Assassin found his tombe in the very place where he did perpetrate the fact. The Court of Parliament suddenly met that afternoon and declared Dame <hi>Mary de Medici</hi> Queene <hi>Regent,</hi> which was the next day confirmed by the young King himselfe sitting on the bed of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98453:10"/>
Iustice; This was done without any opposition or scruple at all, for<note place="margin">Anno 1610.</note> King <hi>Henry</hi> had designd her for <hi>Regent</hi> before, during his absence in the warres, and the reverence that all had to the judgement of so wise and welbelovd a King advantagd the worke, with a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of some other circumstances, for both the Princes of the blood were then absent, the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> was farre up in the Countrey where he had retird not without some discontentments; The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was in Italy, to whom an expresse was suddenly sent, but the Count of <hi>Fuentes</hi> then Governour of <hi>Milan</hi> had given him the newes before of King <hi>Henries</hi> death, and as some say, labourd to infuse into him some aspiring thoughts for the Protectorship, and so to embroyle France, which tooke no effect; There were also two great armies afoote, one under <hi>L'esdigueres</hi> in Dauphine, the other under the command of the Duke de <hi>Nevers</hi> in Champany, ready to suppresse any insurrection.</p>
            <p>The Queen mother being thus establishd in her Regency, shee put three things in present consultation:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The securitie of the Kingdome.</item>
               <item>2. A satisfaction to Iustice for the Assassinat.</item>
               <item>3. The obsequies of the dead King.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For the first, it was thought fitting to re-publish the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> in favour of them of the Religion.</p>
            <p>And now the Author craves leave to give this advertisement by the way, that though his intent be to draw (as well as he can) the Acts of this King to the life, yet the Reader must not expect to have them here in their full length, and in all their dimensions; He must not thinke to finde Edicts, Declarations, Articles of Treaties, Letters and such like in their entire bodies here, He leaves that to the French Chroniclers, such publike exemplarie precedents being more proper and usefull to the people who live under that government, yet, care will be had to insert here the substance of all such acts, and not to pretermit any thing that is materiall, and conducing to the exactnesse of the storie.</p>
            <p>The first act of State, as I said before, was the reviving of the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> to content them of the Religion, who after the King are the powerfullest bodie in France, having so many strong presidiarie townes for their securitie, insomuch that they may be said to be a kinde of <hi>Republike</hi> in a <hi>Realme;</hi> yet France receives this advantage of them, that they are a meanes to keepe the King more narrowly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his bounds, and make him more cautious in his actions; They may be said to be like goats among sheepe whose smell keeps them from the shakings and other diseases, so they keep the regall power from excesses. In the Declaration wherein the foresaid Edict was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, there was also some clauses of compliance that reflected upon the Citie of Paris, which was also to be pleasd: Then the Princes of the blood were invited, and expresses sent for them to come to the Court, Governours of provinces were permitted to remain still in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98453:10"/>

            <p>Concerning the second which was a satisfaction to <hi>Iustice,</hi> and how <hi>Ravaillac</hi> should be offer'd up as a victim to <hi>her,</hi> much paines were taken; At his first examination they would have perswaded him that the King was not dead but like to recover, whereat he smil'd say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that he knew well enough the worke was done, <hi>for t'was not he, but the hand of heaven that had don't;</hi> Then being ask'd how he durst em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brue his hands in the bloud of Gods anointed, the most Christian King, and his Soverain naturall Prince; at the word <hi>most Christian</hi> he smild again in a sleighting manner: Being search'd there was found about him a paire of beads, and a heart made of cotton with a piece of wood in't, which he was made to beleeve was a part of that very crosse whereon Christ suffer'd. All meanes imaginable were essayed to make him discover if he had had any instigators or complices in this infandous plot; but he still answerd positively, and constantly he had none at all, saying, he durst never speake of it to his Confessor for feare of discovery, for so he might have bin punish'd for the <hi>will,</hi> without the deed; yet a Iesuite and a Cordelier who were his ghostly fathers were strictly examin'd, but nothing could be had out of them; Hereupon there rose a nice question amongst the Divines, <hi>whether the Priest be bound to reveale the confession of his penitent,</hi> but 'twas onely propounded and so left problematicall and indecided for that time.</p>
            <p>Every one did whet his invention to devise some exquisite lasting torment for <hi>Ravaillac;</hi> The Butchers of Paris, who are habituated in bloud, propos'd a way to flay him, and the torture of excoriation should continue three daies; Others gave the draught of an instrument in form of an Obelisk where he might be press'd, and the torment should last a long time; Others found out a way to have his body cut quite off, from his hips downward, and his bowels to be clap'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently upon a hot yron plank, which should preserve the other halfe of the body in pangs of agonie a long while: But the court of Justice thought it not fit to invent, or inflict any other punishment upon him but what the <hi>lawes</hi> allowed; therefore he was condemn'd to be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a tombrell naked in his shirt with a flaming torch of two pound weight in his hand to the common place of execution, where holding the knife wherewith he had perpetrated that most abominable parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, his hand should be first pierc'd with the said knife, and so to be burn'd with fire of sulphur upon the stage: That he should have bus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins fill'd with boyling oile applyed to him, That he should be pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer'd in the paps, thighes and braun of the legs, and that boyling lead should be powr'd into the one, burning rozin into the other, and wax melted with sulphur into the third; That his body should be torn af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards by horses, all his members burn'd, reduc'd to cinders, and thrown into the aire; That the House where he was borne in <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme</hi> should be raz'd to the ground, and that none presume to build upon that piece of earth; That within fifteene daies after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98453:11"/>
of this sentence, his father and mother should quit the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Anno 1610.</note> and never return; that his brothers, sisters, uncles and others should never afterwards beare the name of <hi>Ravaillac</hi> under paine of being hang'd and strangled.</p>
            <p>This dismall sentence was executed to the very height of torture, and extended to the utmost length of time, affection of sense, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibilitie of nature, for there were waies invented to keepe him from syncops and fits of swounding: Before, at the beginning, and in the midst of all his torments there could be no other confession extorted out of him, though he was sifted with all the sagacitie that could be, but that the motives which impell'd him to such a desperate attempt, were certaine <hi>revelations,</hi> that he saied he had had, which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards call'd <hi>tentations,</hi> And that he thought he should do a work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God, to take away a King that was a Favourer of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, who went about by the armie he had then afoote to perturbe the peace of the Catholike church, and make warre against the Pope. The people in generall did love the deceased King so passionately, that nothing but imprecations and curses could be heard ecchoing from them, so that none did pray with him when he was upon the scaffold for the salvation of his soule, and for his body, when it was torne by the horses, happie was he that could get any piece of it, so that he was burnt in more then twenty places up and downe the Citie in severall fires; so Nemesis had her glut.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ravaillac</hi> being thus extinguish'd, and as it were <hi>annihilated,</hi> the next care of the Queene was to give rites of buriall adaequate to so glorious a King. His heart the Iesuites had, for he had promis'd them to be depositaries and guardiens of it in his life time, notwithstanding that one of their Societie had once attempted to murther him; so in extraordinarie pomp his heart was carried to <hi>la Flecle,</hi> and his bodie to Saint <hi>Denis;</hi> And <hi>Henry</hi> the third who had layn all the while at <hi>Compeigne,</hi> was sent for to beare him companie; so that as they had the like destinie in their death, so they came to take their last lodgings the same time in Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> whither, they say no French King went with his good will.</p>
            <p>The latter of the two, whom we will call hereafter <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>great</hi> (that title being entayl'd upon him by the universall suffrage of all) was condol'd with farre more regret then the former, and divers to this houre weare a constant anniversarie mourning for him that day he was kill'd; Amongst others her Majestie of great <hi>Britain</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, who was then a cradle-infant, and <hi>Barberino</hi> at that time Nuncio in France (and after created Pope by the name of <hi>Vrban</hi> the eighth) comming to congratulate her birth, and finding that the Queen mother had bin better pleas'd if she had borne a male; He told her, Madame, <hi>I hope to see this, though your youngest daughter a great Queene before I die,</hi> the Queene answer'd, <hi>And I hope to see you Pope;</hi> both which prophetick complements prov'd true, and within a short time one of another.</p>

Which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net being then pronounced pernicious and hereticall, impious and diabolical by the said Colledg and Counsell, was now also by 150 choice Theoloques of the said Family adjudg'd to be an error against the holy Catholic faith, and the fundamentalls of morality, opening a gap to rebellion, and atheisme, to a violation of all bonds of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane obedience, and government, and tended to bring confusion, and a Hell upon Earth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iesuits</hi> were murmur'd at, as Fautors of the foresaid opinion of <hi>Mariana,</hi> whereupon <hi>Cotton</hi> (then Preacher to the King) publish'd a declaratory letter to vindicat their Society, and shew their confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Doctrin to the foresaid Decree of the Counsell of <hi>Constance,</hi> in which letter he protested in the name of the rest, that, that opinion of <hi>Mariana</hi> was a particular fancy of his own, and so to be restrain'd to his person only; That it is so disapprov'd and exploded by their Society, that some of them have compil'd, and expos'd to the open world sundry Treatises in confutation of it, and condem'd it in two Provinciall Congregations held in <hi>Paris and Lion</hi> in the yeer 1606. where their Reverend General <hi>Claudius Aquariva</hi> was present, and there the Soverain puissance, and authority of Kings was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, and <hi>in temporal matters to hold soly of God himself;</hi> The substance of Father <hi>Cottons</hi> declatory Letter tended all to this effect, though it gave not so full a satisfaction to all men.

            <p>The formidable Army which <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>great</hi> had rais'd, was now disbanded by command, and only 12000. kept still a foot in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagny which were reserv'd to assist the German Princes, who were then in motion of armes upon this occasion. <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Iuillers and Cleves</hi> being dead without Heir male, the right of succession was debated by other Princes his allies; but the Emperour alledging that the Duchy of <hi>Iuillers</hi> was a fief moving of the Empire, invested <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi> his Cousin german in the possession of it, who by armed hand seizd upon the town and castle of <hi>Iuillers.</hi> The opposit Princes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving besieg'd him there, sent to France for help: Hereupon Marshall <hi>de la Chastre</hi> march'd with those 12000.

            <p>This relief of <hi>Iuillers</hi> was the first forren act that happen'd in the raign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirtteenth, and the expedition was intended before by his father.</p>
            <p>Although in successif hereditary Kingdomes (as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where the law sayeth <hi>the King never dieth</hi>) the act of Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be not so absolutly necessary, as to appertain to the essence of the thing, yet hath it bin used as a <hi>ceremony</hi> not superfluous for the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the people. Hereupon there were great preparations made for the crowning, and the anointing of the young King with the holy oyle, which is kept alwayes in the town of <hi>Rheims</hi> in a little vial; and the French faith is, That it is part of the same oyle wherewith <hi>Clovis</hi> (who was the first Christian King of France converted by his wife above 1000. yeers since) was anointed, and that a Dove brought down in her beak the said vial into the Church, and so vanish'd, which oyl they say continues fresh and sweet, and without diminution to this day; The said vial was once caried away by the English, but it was recovered by the inhabitants of <hi>Povilleux,</hi> for which they enjoy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers priviledges to this day. This ceremony of Coronation in France is a very solemn thing and continues above eight houres long, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intermission. The twelve <hi>Peers</hi> are the chiefest Actors in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are six Spiritual, and six Temporal; the last six have now no being in France but only in name: For they ought to be the Dukes of <hi>Burgundy, Normandy,</hi> and <hi>Aquitain,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Tholouse, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Champagny,</hi> all which are represented by Deputies in this act: One of the first circumstances in this ceremony is, that two Bishops come and knock in the morning at the Kings Bed-chamber dore, the Great Chamberlain asks them <hi>what they would have,</hi> they answer, <hi>Lewis the</hi>

            <p>The King and Queen Regent being return'd to <hi>Paris,</hi> the scene where the last act of this pomp should be perform'd, before the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph was ended there was a dash of water thrown into their wine, by news that was brought of an insurrection that was in <hi>Berry</hi> by <hi>Florri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond de Pay</hi> Lord of <hi>Vatan,</hi> who undertook to protect certain Salt Merchants by arms, which he had leavied, but he was quickly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, and his head chop'd off, divers of his complices hang'd and strangled: This was the first flash of domestic fire that happen'd in the raign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, which was the more dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the said Lord of <hi>Vatan</hi> was of the Religion, and 'twas fear'd the whole body of them would have abetted him.</p>
            <p>There arise a little after two ill-favour'd contentions twixt Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which kept a great noise for the present; One was of the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who presented a remonstrance to the Court of Parliament, that by vertu of an Edict of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> 1611. they might be permitted to open their Colledg of <hi>Clermont</hi> for the instruction of youth, and to erect Classes for the public Lecture of the Sciences in a scholary way: The Rector of the Universitie seconded by the Sindic of Sorbon with the whole body of Academiks oppos'd it mainly; The first thing the Court ordred was, that the Jesuits should subscribe to a submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conformitie to the Doctrin of the Sorbon Schoole in these foure points.</p>

of the <hi>Gallie</hi> Church. The Jesuit shrunk in their shoulders at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Anno 1611.</note> so one in the name of the rest answer'd, that amongst their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuts there was one which oblig'd them to follow the rules and laws of those places where they were; therefore they could not promise their <hi>General</hi> would subscribe to the foresaid propositions, but their <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> in France should do it with the whole Colledg of <hi>Clermont,</hi> which was done accordingly; yet the Parliament could never be induc'd to passe a Decree whereby they might be authorized to open their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in Paris for the education of youth; though afterwards the King and Queen Regent by sole advise of the Counsell of State, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the opposition of Parliament, and Universitie pass'd an Edict in their favour: And this was done out of pure reason of State, for the world knows what dangerous instruments Jesuits are, if offended.</p>
            <p>The other scuffle amongst Church-men was of a greater conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence<note place="margin">Anno 1611.</note> which was thus. The <hi>Iacobins</hi> (who are the chiefest order of preaching Friers) have a generall Chapter every three yeers in Paris; This convention happen'd this yeer, and divers Tenets were propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded there; One amongst the rest was, <hi>That in no case the Counsell is above the Pope.</hi> There sate in this Assembly many eminent persons as the Cardinal of <hi>Perron,</hi> the Popes Nuncio, with divers other great Prelats; There were also some Presidents of Courts there, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, and the Provost of Paris: Amongst others <hi>Hacquevill</hi> Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the great Chamber of Parliament at the debatement of the said <hi>thesis,</hi> stood up and averr'd that it was <hi>heretical;</hi> whereat the Nuncio was offended, and after some heat of argument <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> took the word, and said, that this controversie being not of <hi>Faith,</hi> it might be lawfull for them tother side the Alps to hold it <hi>affirmative,</hi> and for those of this side, <hi>negative,</hi> but to condemn one another <hi>positively</hi> thereupon, was to bring a <hi>schisme</hi> into the Church. Great was the confusion and clashings that grew out of this: Till <hi>Morelles</hi> a Spaniard who sate in the chaire stood up, and protested that this position was propounded only as <hi>problematicall,</hi> without dessein to determin any thing thereupon. Another enlarg'd himself further, saying, that they tother side the <hi>Hils</hi> have their reasons for the <hi>affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative</hi> part, and others for the <hi>negative.</hi> The French acknowledg sufficiently the hierarchy of the Church, and in consequence of that they receive the Decrees and Ordinances of the Vicar of Christ in every thing that concerns spirituall matters, points of Faith, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy Ecclesiastic: They make their addresses to him for dispensations to hold incompatible benefices, to be promoted to Prelacy or other dignities being not of age, for degrees of kinred and affinitie in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages; They hold with all <hi>Antiquity</hi> that it belongs to the Pope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict oecumenical and universal Counsels, to approve, ratifie, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize their Decrees; and in <hi>this sense</hi> the Pope may be said to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Counsell: But if the Pope should under pretext of spiritual jurisdiction attempt to enervat, and lessen the temporal power of Kings, which they hold immediatly and foly from the great God, it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98453:13"/>
is then lawfull for them to appeal to a generall Counsell; And in <hi>this</hi>

               <hi>sense</hi> the Counsell may be said to be above the Pope.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richer</hi> the Syndic of Sorbon was hottest of any that assisted in this dispute for the <hi>negative</hi> part, and writ a book entitled <hi>de Ecclesiastica et Politica Potestate,</hi> which was condemn'd by the solemn censure of Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> and sundry other great Prelats who held a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation purposely about it, but with this modification, provided, that the rights of the King and Crown of France with the immunities and enfranchisements of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church be not prejudic'd: But they condemn'd the Syndiks Book, because he went about to turn the <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi> of the Church, which is a <hi>Monarchy,</hi> into an <hi>Aristocracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richer</hi> was thrust out of his Sindicship for the said book, though directly against the Statuts of the Colledg of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> whereof one is, that no Syndic be dispossess'd of that place but with his own free will: And thinking to plead this, the Counsell of State overrul'd the case, and a Mandamus came in the Kings name to proceed in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a New Syndic. There issued also out a Declaration, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the King sharply reprehends the congregating of the said Bishops without his royal Commission, and for passing a generall, extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and incertain censure of the said Book; wherein they seem'd to rebuke, and approve; confirm and condemn the tenets thereof, whereof most were Orthodoxal; which tended to puzzle the brains of men, and form scrupulous imaginations in their intellectuals, whence might ensue dangerous consequences.</p>
            <p>Thus those high contentions were hush'd which were like to have usher'd a shrewd schisme into the <hi>Gallic</hi> Church, had not Moderation guided the helm; <hi>Moderation that sage sober Matron, the inseparable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of true Sapience, and Policy, and happy are those Counsels, those So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain Courts and Parliaments where she sits in the chaire.</hi>

            <p>This yeer 1612. was remarkable for the interchangeable Alliance<note place="margin">Anno 1612.</note> that was made twixt France and Spain, the French King being affian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the Infanta <hi>Anne of Austria;</hi> and the Prince of Spain (now <hi>Philip</hi> the fourth) to the Eldest daughter of France Madame <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth of Bourbon;</hi> The great Duke of <hi>Mayn,</hi> great in <hi>constitution</hi> as in qualitie, being one of the goodliest personages of Europe, was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed Ambassador to Spain. He made his entrance to Madrid with 245. sumpter Mules, 50. houshold Officers came after, two by two, and 52. Pages with a querry before them, and their Governor behind. Then followed the Duke himself accompanied with the Prince of Tingry, 7. Earls, 4. Marquises, 17. Lords, and above 200. Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. He was brought in by 500. Spanish Ginetts; At his lodging he had ten Coches every day attending besides his own three. The busines it seems, was wrought to his hand before his coming, for he met with no difficulties at all: The contract of the mariage was in Spanish and French, but the <hi>French</hi> was first sign'd: though the other first read. The <hi>dotal</hi> portion was but 600000. crowns on either side, which was payed and no purse open'd, being a crosse mariage, the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98453:14"/>
summe of the dowry was so moderat, because there might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<note place="margin">Anno 1612.</note> happen an occasion of restitution. But the wonder was not so much at the smalnes of the dowry as of the <hi>joynture</hi> of both Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, which was but 20000. crowns yeerly rent. Much praecaution was us'd by the Spaniard, that, to correspond with their <hi>Salic</hi> law in France, the Infanta should renounce all right of succession to the Crown and dominions of Spain known or unknown. The Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> was much honor'd for the time, and once the King took him out of purpose to ride by his side through the town; under pain of indispensable death, none was to draw sword against any Frenchman while he was there; The Duke was presented with a chain and Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band valued at 15000. crownes with four Ginetts. And hoping it might prove a good omen for the prosperitie of the match, the Feast of Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> was commanded to be celebrated with as much solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and held as holy as any other Saints day in the whole Calender. The Duke of <hi>Pastrana</hi> came that summer to <hi>Paris</hi> in another such splendid Equippage, and concluded the counterpart of the match. Sundry sorts of triumphs pass'd in <hi>Paris</hi> upon these reciprocall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; but the two Princes of the bloud would take no share in those public solemnities, but retir'd from Court in disgust; Causing some Confidents of theirs to blaze abroad the grounds of their grievances, which were, <hi>That the Queen Regent did not communicat unto them the most important affaires of State; That she had concluded the foresaid mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages without their advice; That they were untimely and praecipitat, consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the age of the Princes: That the Queen steer'd the great vessell of the State by a forren compasse: That the masse of treasure left by the last King was exhausted, with such like.</hi> But a way was found to comply with them for that time, so they both return'd to Court, where <hi>Soissons</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little after.</p>
            <p>But there was a more dangerous consequence then this like to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue; for the said <hi>match,</hi> and so much intimacy with Spain bred ill bloud amongst them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and fill'd them with ombrages of fear, it might turn to their prejudice and danger one day, in so much that a disposition of rising was discover'd in them generally; which was ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by an ill-favour'd accident that happen'd in the Town of <hi>Nismes</hi> in Languedoc, where one of their prime Preachers <hi>Ferrir</hi> being turn'd Roman Catholic, the rabble of the town sack'd his house, burnt his books, grub'd up his vineyards, and plunder'd all he had; The King being offended hereat remov'd the Presidial Court and Seneshalship thence to <hi>Beaucaire.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Anno 1612.</note> 
               <hi>though they be at best, but conjecturall, yet are they not altogether to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn'd, albeit that scarce one in a hundred hit;</hi> there is a multitude of no mean examples that may be produc'd, one was pointed at in the Proem of this peece. And divers know how the yeers of the late Erl of <hi>Pembrook</hi> were precisely limited by a Genethliacall calcule. <hi>We read that</hi> Otho <hi>the Emperour commanded all Astrologers to quit his dominions by such a day; The Astrologers sent him word, that since he had assign'd them a day to go out of the Empire, they would assign him another to go out of the world, for by such a day he should be no more among mortals; which prov'd true. This was contrary to a passage of</hi> Edward <hi>the Confessor King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who, when an Astrologer came, and told him, that he had taken great pains to pry into the horoscope of his nativitie, and found that his Majesty should dy in such a moneth; The King answer'd, I can go neerer to work then so, for I can foretell thee the very hour of thy death, which will be to morrow at two a clock in the afternoon precisely, so that thou canst not avoyd it: So he commanded him to be tryed and executed accordingly. But although it be presumption in man to determin any thing peremptorily out of their obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the motions of Celestiall bodies, yet it must be granted that the said bodies by their perpetuall influxes having dominion over every thing that is natural in man, as the body, the masse of bloud, the organs and sensual appetit, they may dispose his humors and inclinations to peace or war, to obedience or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, to love or hatred accordingly. For if Comets, as we find by wofull experience, which are of a far baser and more grosse extraction, being meer meteorologicall stuff, are thought to have a virtual power to make impressions upon the air, and to leave infectious qualities behind them in the regions thereof, which use to work upon human bodies in contagions, and upon their humors to suscitat the minds of men to tumults, and war, much more may the Stars claym such a power: Nevertheles although</hi> Astra regunt homines, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be allow'd that the Stars praedominat over every thing that is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal in man, it follows not, that this dominion extends to his intellectuals and to those actions which depend upon the absolut Empire of the</hi> will, <hi>and other faculties of the soul which are purely spiritual; but though this should be partly granted, yet if we consider the union that is twixt the soul and the senses (being inmates of one house) which is such, that she cannot produce any act if they do not contribut, and present the object which is the intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble species, it may well be inferr'd that the faculties of the soul operat by the ministery of the senses, and sensual appetit; and the sensual appetit by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxes from heavenly bodies, which may be said to have power to incite though not to force the will and affections of men to commotions and war; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their various conjunctions and oppositions, their anglings and cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations to cause good or bad effects, which may prove inauspicious or suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull; as some Astrologers observ'd when his Majesty of great Britain (then Prince of Wales) went to Spain to fetch a wife, there was then a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction twixt Iupiter and Saturn which is always held malevolent, so that journey had no successe; but whither am I thus transported by this speculation from my intended road?</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:98453:15"/>But without consulting the stars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was easie for any one of<note place="margin">Anno 1612.</note> a mean foresight to be a prophet of some sudden commotions to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, considering how matters then stood in <hi>France;</hi> for the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal of <hi>Ancre</hi> (an Italian) had then the vogue, having engrossed to himself by the favor of the Queen Regent the managing and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of all the greatest affairs of State; A man not so despicable as the French Annalists make him, for his grandfather was Secretarie of State to <hi>Cosmo de Medici,</hi> and by birth, breeding and courage was a gentleman; besides his wife had suck'd of the same milke as the Queen Regent did, for her mother had bin her Nurse. But it seems <hi>D'Ancre</hi> had scrued up the strings of authoritie too high, and so they came not only to jar, but to crack at last.</p>
            <p>There were printed this yeer two Latine Books which kept a great clatter all Christendome over; one was writ by <hi>Schoppius,</hi> calld <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticus;</hi> The other by <hi>Becanus,</hi> calld <hi>Controversia Angliae de pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state Regis et Papae.</hi> They both trenchd highly upon Regall power. The first had base touches of scandall upon <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, and his late Majesty of England; In so much that by a solemn sentence of Parliament it was burnt in Paris: so France was revengd on the <hi>Book,</hi> and England had some revenge on the <hi>body</hi> of the Author. For he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Madrid,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Digby</hi> (now Earl of Bristol) being Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour there, Master <hi>George Digby</hi> his kinsman (a generous hardy young Gentleman) encountting the said <hi>Schoppius</hi> he gave him a faire large cut athwart the face, and so stigmatiz'd him to the view of the world, which visible mark he wore to his grave.</p>
            <p>Touching the other Book of <hi>Becanus:</hi> The Syndic of <hi>Sorbon</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiond the Queen Regent that it might receive the same doome, and that the Sacred <hi>Faculty</hi> of Theology might be permitted to put forth some public instrument to condemn the Doctrin thereof; The Queen advis'd them not to determin any thing thereon as yet, nor to make such noise, or take so much notice thereof. But they press'd further, alledging it wold be a shrew brand to the Sacred <hi>Faculty</hi> to pass over so slightly such a scandalous Book, that derogated so much from the authority of Kings, and particularly of the <hi>most Christian,</hi> with silence. For posteritie will interpret this <hi>silence</hi> to be a <hi>consent</hi> to the tenets thereof. But they were still put off, and in the interim there came news from Rome that a Decree was published by the Pope wherein the <hi>said Book was condemn'd and adjudg'd to contain many false, rash, scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and seditious things respectively, and therefore to be no more printed or publishd, but to be put in the second Classes of Indexes, untill it be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the correction approv'd according to the rules of the Index.</hi> In the said Decree the word <hi>respectively</hi> some imagined to be inserted of purpose, as an evasion, to shew that the Jesuits do not absolutely condemn the doctrin of <hi>Becanus,</hi> but only as it invades the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the French Crown.</p>
            <p>They of the <hi>Religion,</hi> as I told you before, suspected some ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences of the crosse Match with Spain, and feared it would prove

               <hi>crosse</hi> to them in time; Moreover the Princes of the bloud, and others<note place="margin">Anno 1613.</note> repin'd at the power of <hi>D' Ancre,</hi> whereupon the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> prime <hi>Marshall</hi> of France, (and prime <hi>Machinator</hi> of this tumult) came to visite the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and made a solemn studied speech unto him as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord, it would be impudence in me to represent unto you the deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable estate of France, whereof you have more knowledge then I: or to touch the arrogance of</hi> Conchiny, <hi>which you must needs daily resent; or to make his power suspected, which is the next dore to tyranny; or to exhort you to oppose his pernicious desseins: The consideration of your own safety with that of France, is enough to rouze up your generous thoughts, and to administer Counsell to you who are the most judicious Prince of Europe: Moreover in such a manifest and urgent affair as this, ther's no need of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrance, consultation or exhortation, but to apply some sudden, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remedy: Therefore I addresse my self now to your Excellence, not onely to offer you my means, but my person; as also</hi> 100000. <hi>men, who would esteem themselves happy to serve you, and will hold it a glory to employ their bloud to the last drop under your conduct, for the good of the State, and your just defence against this</hi> Faquin Florentin, <hi>this Florentine porter, who plots the ruin of all those Princes, and Peers of the Kingdom, who would oreshadow his advancement, and hinder to establish his tyranny: The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Religion which we professe, ought not to empeach a strong and solid union between us, in the conjuncture of so common a danger; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that while we endeavour our own safety, we secure the State generall, and incolumity of our Countrey; which are conditions inseparable from the Kings service, whose Sacred Person is not safe enough under the irregular ambition of a stranger; which his Majesty himself begins now to perceive, and seeing his liberty engag'd, fears the ambition of this tyrant, and will find himself oblig'd to those that can rid him of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord, you are well assur'd that the greatest part of the Princes finding themselfs involv'd in the same interest with you, are touch'd with the same resentments, and dispos'd to joyn with your Excellence in a project as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as necessary; For doubtles the Gentry of France in whom consist the sinews of our armies, being naturally averse to the commandements of a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, will run unto you from all parts to assist you with their armes; Touching the Towns, you need not doubt, but a good part of them which are under the Government of the Princes will declare themselfs for you. And I give you certain assurance, that They of the Religion (which are the strongest, and best provided with soldiers, artillery, ammunition, and victualls of any other) will declare themselfs for your party, as soon as you shall publish your laudable intentions by some Manifesto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It concerns your Excellence therefore my Lord, to take hold of Time by the foretop, for the restauration, and safetie of the State in generall, and your own in particular, and of all the Princes, and Gentry of the Kingdom: But if you let</hi> Occasion <hi>escape you, know that she is bald behind, and you shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to catch her again: Besides the Armies which you might justly raise now, during the Kings minority, and by reason the government is usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>

               <hi>be hereafter felony and treason under the majority and liberty of our lawfull Monark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince was a subject fit to be wrought upon, and ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any print, for he could not brook the exorbitant power of <hi>D' Ancre,</hi> therefore having assurance that the Dukes of <hi>Nevers, Main, Longueville, Luxemburg,</hi> and the said <hi>Bovillon</hi> would follow him, he retires to <hi>Mezieres</hi> upon the frontire of Champany; he made choice of that place because it was his Patrimony, and that he might have a sure Rendevous of <hi>Sedan</hi> if need required: The Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> thinking to retire to <hi>Britany</hi> was arrested in the Louure, but he got loose by a trick; and the Chevalier his brother was sent to <hi>Malta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The foresaid male-contented Princes recruted dayly in <hi>Champany,</hi> But had the young King got a horsback and pursued them presently though with a petty Army, the Countrey wold have riss with him, and so he had prevented their encrease, and driven them in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie to <hi>Sedan,</hi> where he might have kept them in exile, with a small Army on the frontires; And his Counsell was much tax'd for not advising him so: But in lieu of arms he sent Ambassadors and Epistles after them to perswade their return, or, if they refused, to amuse them till he might raise forces sufficient to encounter them; to which end he sent to Swisserland for 6000. men; but <hi>Bovillon</hi> by his artifice hinder'd that design from taking its full effect.</p>
            <p>Thus a fearfull storme was like to fall on France, for the male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents dispers'd themselfs to divers strong holds; <hi>Longuevill</hi> went to Picardy, <hi>Main</hi> to Soissons, <hi>Bovillon</hi> to Sedan, and <hi>Vendosme</hi> was as busie as any other to raise the Countrey in Britain, <hi>Conde</hi> continued still at <hi>Mezieres,</hi> nor could any Letter from King or Queen Regent sent by the Duke. of <hi>Ventadour</hi> reduce him; He writ to the Queen <hi>That the ill government, which he imputed not to Her, but to ill Counsellors, were the cause of his retirement, who because they might have the sole dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of things, hindred the convocation of the States generall which were used to assemble always in the Kings minority: he complain'd that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with Spain were precipitated: that the authority of the Parliament was diminished, the Church-men trampled upon, the Nobles undervalued, the people laden with gabells and tallies, divisions sowed in</hi> Sorbon, <hi>and the University; with divers other soloecismes in the present Government. In his conclusion he insists much upon the convocation of the</hi> States generall <hi>of the Kingdom</hi> sure &amp; free, <hi>a suspension of the mariage with Spain, and so concluds with much complement.</hi> These were specious pretences, but they were as so many <hi>imaginary</hi> lines drawing to one reall Center which was the Marq: of <hi>Ancre</hi> who indeed was the sole grievance, and not He neither, but his power and <hi>privacy</hi> with the Queen Regent, which they thought to demolish by Arms.</p>
            <p>The Queen Regent in her answer to <hi>Conde</hi> reprocheth him, <hi>that he had not imparted these things privatly to her to whom he had perpetual acces; that notwithstanding he seems to cast the fault upon certain Counsellors, yet all</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:98453:16"/>
               <hi>bounds upon her by reflection: she declares that long before the reception of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1613.</note> 
               <hi>his Letter, she had resolv'd, and to that end there were public dispatches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to summon the Convocation of the States Generall; she takes exception that he should call them</hi> Estats seurs &amp; libres, States sure and free, <hi>which made her conceive a violent jealousie of some artifice on his side, to sow seeds of difficulties in the said great Assembly: she alledgeth that from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning she imparted both to him and the Co: of</hi> Soissons <hi>the mariage with Spain, that they approved of them and subscribed the Articles; That the late King declared his inclination unto it when</hi> Don Pedro de Toledo <hi>pass'd through France. And so she concluds with exhortation that he wold ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Assembly of the three Estates, and bring with him all his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats, to contribut the great zeal they professe to the common good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> The Queens Letter was large, and in it there was a curious mixture of meekness and Majestie. The Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> sent her al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so two Letters, but he could get no answer to either.</p>
            <p>Thus a fearfull black clowd hung over poor France, which the Queen Mother essayed by all means possible to dissipat before it shold break out into a tempest of intestine War, therefore, the King and she descended to send again the Duc of <hi>Vantadour</hi> accompanied with the Presidents of <hi>Thou</hi> and <hi>Ieanin</hi> with others to draw <hi>Conde</hi> to a treaty of accord; which at last was agreed upon, and the prime Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were these.</p>

               <item>1. That the States Generall shold assemble in the Town of <hi>Sens</hi> within such a time, wherin the Deputies of the three Orders may safely and freely make such Remonstrances and Propositions that they shall hold in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences to be profitable for the common good, for the redresse of disorders, and conservation of public tranquillity.</item>
               <item>2. His Majesty being willing to gratify the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> hath upon his prayer and instance, and upon assurance of his future affection and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, accorded to put into his hands the Castle of <hi>Amboise</hi> as a gage till the <hi>States Generall</hi> dissolve, and 100. men for garrison in the said Castle.</item>
               <item>3. That 100. men shall be entertain'd in <hi>Mezieres,</hi> 200. in <hi>Soissons</hi> whereof the Duc of Main is Governor, till the <hi>States Generall</hi> have risen.</item>

               <item>5. That in consideration of the expences the said Prince might be at in this business, his Majesty accords to give him 450000. Franks to dispose of as he shall think fit.</item>

            <p>These with divers other Articles of this kind, the King was induc'd (I will not say inforc'd) to condescend unto for preventing of greater evils; and it was call'd the <hi>Treaty of Saint-Menehou;</hi> And one would have thought that a gentle calme should have follow'd, and that the meeting of the States General would have perpetuated it; But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

two ill-favor'd accidents, like two impetuous puffs, put things<note place="margin">Anno 1613.</note> again in disorder: The one was that the Duke of <hi>Vendosin</hi> would not put <hi>Blavet</hi> into the hands of the Marquis of <hi>Caeuures</hi> according to the Kings command, but stood still upon his gard in Britany. The second was an affront which <hi>Conde</hi> alledg'd to have receiv'd from the Bishop of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> who would not suffer him to enter the Town (as he pass'd to his government of Dauphine and secur'd the Castle of Amboise) being sought unto by the Governor the Duc of <hi>Roanez</hi> to establish his authoritie there. The Bishop arm'd first, and the town after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. <hi>Conde</hi> writes a Letter to the Queen Regent which did not please her well, for he subscribes himself only her <hi>thrice-humble ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and neveu,</hi> whereas he was us'd to write <hi>your thrice humble, and thrice obedient servant, and subject.</hi> The Marquis of <hi>Bonnivet</hi> a creature of <hi>Condes</hi> had not yet dismissd all his troupes, therefore under his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie he harasseth and plunders all the Countrey about Poitiers, sacks the Bishops House and commits many sacrilegious and execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble outrages; The young King hearing this, gets presently a Hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and sends the Duke of <hi>Main</hi> before to stop the ravages of <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivet,</hi> so he followeth after, and passing by <hi>Orleans, Blois, Tours,</hi> and <hi>Chastel le heraud</hi> a cautionary town of them of the <hi>Religion</hi> (who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding presented the Keys to his Majesty as he pass'd) he came to <hi>Poitiers;</hi> where he reconcil'd the Prince of Conde and the Bishop; caus'd <hi>Bonnivet</hi> to disband his forces compos'd of Picaroons and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabonds, Thence he went to <hi>Nants,</hi> where also he rang'd the Duke of <hi>Vandosme</hi> to obedience, dismantled the Fort at <hi>Blavet</hi> and so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a short compasse of time compos'd and quash'd all things he returns triumphantly to <hi>Paris,</hi> where an Ambassadour was attending him from <hi>Zuric,</hi> who desir'd to enter into an alliance with him, as the rest of the Cantons had.</p>
            <p>This was the first exploit that <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth did in his own person, which like the rising Sun dispell'd those frog vapors that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in <hi>Poictou</hi> and <hi>Britany:</hi> and it was held a good augury for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>The presence of a King is oft-times very advantageous; for Rebellion durst never stare long in the face of Majesty, which useth to lance out such penetrating refulgent rayes, that dazzle the eyes of Traytors, and put them at last quite out of countenance.</hi> With this achievment we will conclude his Minority, and his Mothers Regency; And as this first expedition of his prov'd lucky, so was his whole life attended with a series of good successes, as if <hi>Fortune</hi> her self had rid with him all the while upon the same horse. And now must we put a period to the first <hi>lustre</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenths raign, and with it to his <hi>minoritie</hi> or bassage; We proceed to his second <hi>lustre</hi> wherewith his <hi>majoritie</hi> begins being arriv'd to the yeer fourteen.</p>

            <p>In the former Chapter we told you that by vertue of the Treatie of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Menehou</hi> the Queen Regent had promis'd, and was oblig'd to the Princes by capitulation to summon the <hi>States Generall,</hi> and suspecting there might be some desseins against her authoritie, she endevour'd to prevent it divers wayes. First, in the Mandats sent to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of Provinces, and Towns for the elections of Deputies, there were speciall cautions inserted, to choose no factious persons; The second means was to defer the convocation of the <hi>States Generall,</hi> till the Kings <hi>majority</hi> was declar'd, that so his authoritie might be the more compleat and absolut, whereby he might have a greater power to take into his hands her interests, and oppose such resolutions that might prejudice them.</p>
            <p>Lastly, whereas the said convocation was appointed first to be at <hi>Rheims,</hi> then at <hi>Sens,</hi> she sent summons abroad that it should be held at <hi>Paris,</hi> where the King was strongest by the residence of his servants, the affections of all orders of people, and the assistance of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Court of Parliament which is still there sitting, though it was us'd to be ambulatory with the Kings Court.</p>
            <p>Now, the difference which is in France between an <hi>Assembly</hi> of the three Estates, and their <hi>Parliaments</hi> is, that the former hath an analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie both in point of institution, power, and summons with our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain high Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> in England, compos'd of Lords and Commons, wherein the King sits as head, and it is He alone who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens and shuts it with his breath; This being the greatest of all Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, treats of matters touching the universall good of the State, and the making, correcting or repealing of laws, and it is the highest Sphere which gives motion to all the rest.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliaments</hi> of France, whereof there are <hi>eight,</hi> have not the same latitude of power, yet are they Supreme Courts, or Sessions of Justice, where mens causes and differences are publikly determined in <hi>last ressort</hi> without any further appeale; and any Peer of France by right of inheritance hath a capacitie to sit there.</p>
            <p>The day being assign'd for publishing the Kings <hi>Majority,</hi> the Queen Regent and He with his now sole brother the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> (for his brother the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> was lately dead) went in a stately solemn maner to the Court of Parliament, accompagnied with the prime
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98453:18"/>
Prelats, and Peers of the Kingdom, and amongst them there were<note place="margin">Anno 1614.</note> fower Cardinalls; A contestation happen'd 'twixt the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> and Peers for precedency; because the twelve <hi>Peers</hi> of France, before an Ordinance made by <hi>Henry</hi> the third, preceded any Prince of the bloud at the Coronation and Sacring of the King, and the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his <hi>Majority</hi> was an Act reflecting on that. Yet the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordred the priority for that time to the <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> because they were <hi>Princes of the Church universal,</hi> which made the <hi>Peers</hi> retire from the Court lest it might serve for a precedent to future Ages.</p>
            <p>The Court being sat, and all silenc'd the Queen Regent riss up, and said, <hi>That she prais'd and thank'd God to have afforded her grace to bring up her son to the yeers of his Majority, and to maintain his Kingdom in peace the best she could: That now he being come to age, she transmitted the Government to him, exhorting the company there present, and all other his subjects to render him that service, obedience and fidelity which is due unto him as to their King.</hi> The Chancelor hereupon pronounced the Arrest of the Court, importing a verification of the declaration of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties <hi>Majority;</hi> which was done in a solemn studied Oration. This great solemnity did not end so, but it was accompagnied with four wholsom Edicts, as the first fruits or hansels of his raign.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The first aym'd at a general <hi>concord</hi> 'twixt his subjects, by strict injunction of observing the <hi>Edict of Nantes</hi> concerning them of the Religion.</item>
               <item>2. The second aym'd at a generall <hi>obedience,</hi> prohibiting all ligues, confederacy and intelligence with any strange Prince or State under pain of lifs.</item>
               <item>3. The third against Duells.</item>
               <item>4. The fourth against Blasphemy and Swearing.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus ended the Regency of <hi>Maria de Medici</hi> in <hi>form,</hi> though not in <hi>effect,</hi> for she swayed a good while after as <hi>Queen Mother</hi> in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, the King reposing still his chief confidence in her; during her Regency she did many public things which discover'd a pious and Princely soul; Amongst others she provided divers Hospitalls in the suburbs of Saint <hi>German</hi> for the relief of the poor, the aged, and sick, and to set young people at work; which will continue there as long as the walls of Paris for monuments of her honour and charity.</p>
            <p>The King having notice that the Deputies of the three States were com, he sent the B p. of Paris to warn them in his name to fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfs for receiving the grace of God, that so a blessing might fall upon their consultations; to which purpose three daies fast was enjoyn'd them, to prepare them the better for the holy Communion, which was also inordred them. So according to ancient custom a generall Procession was made, wherein divers ranks of Fryars and Hopitalers went before, then followed the Deputies of the <hi>third Estate,</hi> who took place according to the rank of the 12. Governments of France, and made in number 192. The <hi>Nobles</hi> followed them; in number 132. They of the Clergie went last, who made 140. so that in all they
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98453:18"/>
came to 464. which number I observe is inferior to that of the English<note place="margin">Anno 1614.</note> Parliament, where the Members of the House of Commons alone which corresponds the <hi>Third Estate</hi> in France, come to neer upon 500. After these the King himself followed on foot, accompagnied with the Queen and the Princes and Peeres. The next day after, all met in Bourbon House hall where the young King told them, <hi>That having not long since declar'd his Majority, he thought fitting to convoque the States Generall of his Kingdom, to begin his raign by their good advice and Counsell, to receive their complaints, and provide for redres accordingly, as it should be more amply told them by his Chancelor, who took the word therupon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This generall overture and Ceremony being ended, the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall spent some daies to visit one another, and to choosing of their three Praesidents or Prolocutors which they presented to the King with protestation of all fidelity and obedience. The next day they took the Communion all in one Church, going six at a time (<hi>viz.</hi> two of every Order) to the holy Table. The Munday following they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assembled intending to fall close to work, but their proceedings were retarded by some differences which interven'd touching the rank of the 12. Provinces or Governments, and this clash kept a great noise; till the King interpos'd therin his Authority, and by the advice of his Privy Counsel, which they submitted unto, made this decision mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shalling the 12. Governments thus: 1. the Isle of France, (whereon <hi>Paris</hi> stands) 2. <hi>Burgundy,</hi> 3. <hi>Normandy,</hi> 4. <hi>Guyen,</hi> 5. <hi>Britany,</hi> 6. <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> 7. <hi>Languedoc,</hi> 8. <hi>Picardy,</hi> 9. <hi>Dauphine,</hi> 10. <hi>Provence,</hi> 11. <hi>Lion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> 12. <hi>Orleans.</hi> This being regulated by the King, they fell to the main work, and three Propositions were made; the first by the <hi>Clergy</hi> wherewith the <hi>Nobles</hi> joyn'd.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Counsell of <hi>Trent</hi> should be publish'd through France.</item>
               <item>2. That the venality and selling of Offices should be suppressed.</item>
               <item>3. That the King should acknowledge in this Assembly to have no other superiour power on earth in his Temporalls, and that he held the Crown immediatly of God alone. This last Proposition was put on by the <hi>third Estate,</hi> against the intention and without the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> of purpose to hinder the concession of the other two, because divers of the <hi>third Estate</hi> were favourers of them of the <hi>Religion</hi> and Financiers.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The first Proposition was couch'd in these termes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Oecumenical Counsel of</hi> Trent <hi>be receiv'd and publish'd in your Realms, and the Constitutions thereof kept and observ'd; but without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to your Majesties rights, the liberties of the Gallic Church, the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and exepmtions of Chapters, Monasteries and Cominalties which his Holinesse shall be prayed, may be reserv'd, and to remain in their entire strength, so that the publication of the said</hi> Counsell <hi>may not prejudice them any way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Estate protested against this, alledging these reasons; That in the said Counsell there were divers <hi>Decrees, whereby the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, invaded the Temporall rights. That it would be a thing not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98453:19"/>
               <hi>but dishonourable for France to approve of a Counsell, wherein the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1614.</note> 
               <hi>most Christian King had received a palpable injury in the persons of his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors, who were postpos'd to them of Spain, which caus'd them to retire, and quit the said Counsell in sense of that indignity offer'd to them who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonated the first son of the Church in so public a Convention.</hi> They excepted also against that clause <hi>that the Pope should be prayed, the liberties of the Gallic Church might be preserv'd,</hi> for that was to submit them to a forren power, to the Papall authoritie; whereas the said liberties are inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and originally inhaerent in the Gallican Church, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with Christianity it self; <hi>The difference 'twixt</hi> Liberties <hi>and</hi> Priviledges <hi>being this, that the latter presuppose the concession and grant of some superior Power, but liberties are originall, and immemorial possessions, and equall to inheritances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching the second Proposition of the Clergy and Nobles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the venality and merchandising of Offices, it was wav'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause divers of the <hi>Third Estate</hi> were either Financiers, or Officers of Justice, which places they had bought, and so had power to sell them again for money.</p>
            <p>Touching the third Proposition that concern'd the independency of the French Crown which was presented by the <hi>Commons</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the first Proposition made by the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> for the publication of the Counsell of <hi>Trent;</hi> the one being made out of a zeale to the State <hi>Civil,</hi> the other to the State <hi>Spiritual,</hi> there were hot bandings on both sides; The third <hi>Estate</hi> or <hi>Commons</hi> would have it declared for a <hi>fundamentall law, that the King being supreme and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute in his own Dominions, there is no power on earth, either Spirituall or Temporall, that hath any right to deprive him of his Crown, or to dispense and absolve his subjects from their allegiance unto him:</hi> This was done to extinguish that dangerous Doctrin broached by som, how it was lawfull to kill Tyrants, and if the Roman Bishop had power to declare Kings Tyrants, their lifes would be expos'd to the passion of every Pope, and so to perpetuall apprehensions of danger.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> finding how pertinacious and resolute the Commons were in this point for securing the lifes of their Kings, and fearing it might breed a schisme 'twixt the Apostolicall See, and the Monarchy of France, Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> a man of high merit and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, was sent to make a Remonstrance unto them, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to three heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That it is not permitted upon any cause whatsoever to kill a King.</item>
               <item>2. That the Kings of France are Soverains in all degrees of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral soverainty within their Realm.</item>
               <item>3. That there is no case, wherby subjects may be absolved from their oth of fidelity to their Prince.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Concerning the first two he pronounc'd them as absolut and <hi>cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall;</hi> but touching the last the Cardinal said, that in regard it might usher in a Schisme, he left it as <hi>problematicall,</hi> not positif.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98453:19"/>The President or Speaker of the Commons answer'd, that the third<note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> Proposition being <hi>politicall,</hi> he conceiv'd it concern'd not the Doctrin of <hi>Faith,</hi> and consequently could not introduce any schisme; much bussling there was about this point, the Commons being very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in it, having the Parliament of Paris siding with them, who pass'd an Arrest in favour of them accordingly: but the King evok'd the difference to himself commanding that nothing should be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd theron; in regard that he being assured of his own right and possession, it appertain'd not either to the <hi>States,</hi> or to the Court of Parliament, or any other arbiter whatsoever to take cognisance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and remarkable it was, that the King did not evoke and call that matter to Himself and to his <hi>Counsell,</hi> according to the ordinary form, but absolutly to himself and his own Person.</p>
            <p>But although the King commanded the said Decree of the Court of Parliament to be suspended, the Attorney Generall made such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligences, because he was a friend to the businesse, that divers Copies were sent abroad.</p>
            <p>The great Assembly drawing now towards a closure, they brought their Cayers, or papers of grievances to the King at Bourbon House hall; The Bishop of <hi>Luson</hi> (after Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu</hi>) was Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor for the Clergy; the King presently delivered the said <hi>Cayers</hi> to his Chancelor, promising them an answer with all convenient expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Thereupon a little after he sent for them to the <hi>Louure</hi> his royal Palace, and told them that in regard of sundry affairs of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he could not answer their <hi>Cayers</hi> so soon as he desired, but he would give speedy order to do it, in the interim they might carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them to the Countrey an assurance of the satisfaction they expected touching the chiefest Articles; for he was resolv'd to suppres the selling of offices, to ease his people of tallies and subsidies, to cause a research to be made into the misdemeanures of his Receivers and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanciers; and lastly, to retrench the multiplicitie of Offices and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, which were encreas'd from about two millions of franks, (which was the stint in the former Kings raign) to four millions, which make four hundred thousand pounds sterling. Observ'd it was that the Marshall of <hi>Ancre,</hi> while this busines of retrenching Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Pensions was in hottest agitation amongst the States, got three new Tresurers of Pensions to be created, from whom he drew neer upon one hundred thousand pound sterling, as you will find here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when it will be thrown into his dish.</p>
            <p>This was the first and last Assembly of the three <hi>Estates,</hi> or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment general, that was held in the raign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, which it seems found his <hi>grave</hi> then, for there hath bin none ever since, and there is litte hopes of its <hi>resurrection,</hi> while the Clergy and Nobles continue so potent, who finding that the third <hi>Estate</hi> began to tamper with the Popes jurisdiction, and Church matters, have wrought means to hinder their meeting any time these 30. yeers and upwards.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98453:20"/>This yeer died Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> the last Branch of the <hi>Valois,</hi> being<note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> come of the loyns of thirteen successif Monarks of that line, a Lady of a rare attracting exterior bewty, she had a high harmonious soul, much addicted to music, and the sweets of love, and oftentimes in a Platonic way; She would have this Motto often in her mouth; <hi>Voulez vous cesser d'aymer? possedez la chose aymée.</hi> Will you cease to love? possesse the thing you love. She had lodg'd <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Guyse who was kill'd at <hi>Blois</hi> so far in her heart, that being afterwards marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against her will to <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and divorc'd by mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, she profess'd she could never affect him; she had strains of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and transcendencies beyond the vulgar, and delighted to be call'd <hi>Venus Urania.</hi> She would have Philosophers and Divines in her House, and took pleasure to hear them dispute, and clash one with the other; she entertain'd fortie Priests, <hi>English, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Irish;</hi> she would often visit hospitals, and did divers acts of charitie to satisfie for the lubricities of her youth.</p>
            <p>There was an accident happen'd this yeer in <hi>Paris</hi> that made a mighty noise for the time; Two of the Kings gards having fought, and the one being kill'd, the other fled into Sanctuary to the Abbey of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Germain;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> fetch'd him thence by force: Complaint being made to the King, he put him over to the Court of Parliament to receive his doom for infringing the Priviledges of the Church, and commanded him to deliver the Prisoner again to the <hi>Sanctuary, or he would fetch him away himself;</hi> The old Duke did so, and coming to the Palace to appear before the Parliament, a ruffling company of Souldiers and Cadets follow'd him who did some acts of insolency against the Lawyers by kicking them with their spurs in the Hall where none should come spurr'd; this aggravated the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but the Duke made a long submissive speech to the Parliament, wherein he acknowledg'd his error, concluding with an apology, <hi>that they would excuse him if his discourse did not content their learned eares, for having bin all his life time a Captain of foot, he had learnt to do better then speak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The prime President then rise up, and said; <hi>That since the King in imitation of his Progenitors intends to be more inclin'd to sweetnes and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, then rigor: The Court by his expresse command, and in consideration of your long services, beleeving the good rather then the bad, doth graciously interpret the actions of an ancient Officer of the Crown and Peer of France, and so receives your excuses: hoping that this will occasion you, and your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to render the King and the State such services as you are oblig'd to do, and for the futur that you will contain your self within the bounds of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and honor which you owe to this Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was mention made a little before how the Assembly of the <hi>States Generall</hi> was dissolv'd, and that having deliver'd their <hi>Cayers</hi> of complaints to the King, they were dismiss'd but with large parol pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises only; We related also how the <hi>Arrest</hi> made in the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> in Confirmation of the opinion of the Third Estate <hi>touching</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:98453:20"/>
               <hi>the independency of the Crown of France,</hi> was commanded by the King<note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> to be suspended, and that nothing should be determin'd therein. This gather'd ill bloud, which bred ill humors, and so brake out into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers distempers afterwards, as will appear: <hi>For as in the naturall body, if upon taking of Physic, the superstuities be onely stirr'd, and not purg'd, it doth more hurt then good, and makes the drug to remain in the stomach undigested; So in civil Corporations, if abuses be only moved, and not remedied, it makes the body Politic worse then it was.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> was sensible how the Arrest wherein they concurr'd with the <hi>Third Estate</hi> was slighted, and countermanded, therefore they publish'd an Order, that, <hi>under the good pleasure of the King,</hi> all Princes, Dukes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown which are capable of sitting and have deliberative votes in that Court, should repair thither by such a time, to consult of matters tending to his Majesties service, &amp;c. When this Order pass'd the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was promis'd to be there, but he was counter-commanded by the King, nor did any of the rest appear: yet the Parliament went on and fram'd a Remonstrance of abuses in Government which by their Deputies they sent to the King, and being come to the <hi>Louure</hi> they danc'd attendance there a good while, and afterwards they were brought up by a back odd way to the Kings presence, where the Queen Mother was also present and divers Princes; The prime Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident made an oylie complemental speech full of protestations of loyalty to his Majesty, and afterwards delivered the <hi>Cayer</hi> of Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strances, which was read aloud by one of the Secretaries of State, wherein the Parliament instanced in divers grievances, and that they resented nothing more, but that in the face of the whole State, the royal power was rendred and left <hi>problematical,</hi> and doubtfull.</p>
            <p>The young King was not well pleas'd with this <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> and the Queen <hi>Mother</hi> much lesse; <hi>Who told them that the King had just cause to be offended with the Parliament, because against his command they had meddled with matters of State, and that she was not so short sighted, but that she could perceive how these things reflected upon her Regency, which they had formerly highly approv'd of, and the Assembly of States General had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so thank'd her for.</hi> Then the Chancelor took the word, telling them <hi>that they had bin misinform'd in many things which they took upon trust, and that they were much out of their account, in that they alledg'd that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences were greater, and the receipts lesse under this King, then his Father, who reserv'd but eight thousand liures, every yeer, not two millions, as they pretended.</hi> So the prime President, and the rest of the Parliaments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legats were dismiss'd with little or no countenance at all; The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of State spoak high language, averring that the passing of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said public Order to invite the Princes, and Peers to meet in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon extraordinary occasions, without his Majesties leave, was an open, and insupportable attempt upon his authoritie now that he is declar'd <hi>Major,</hi> as also upon the authoritie of that Counsell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Arrest issued out, <hi>That the Parliaments Remonstrances were false,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98453:21"/>
               <hi>calumnious, and full of malice and disobedience, and that therefore they</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> 
               <hi>should be drawn off the Register of the said Parliament, and suppress'd for ever, with an inhibition that the said Court should not meddle with matters of State but by the Kings command.</hi> Before this Arrest was publish'd, the Parliament mainly endevour'd to give some contentment to their Majesties; therefore they employ'd again the prime President with others, <hi>To declare the great displeasure the Court had, that their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance was not agreeable to their Majesties wils, protesting that it was never the intention of the Court to touch upon their actions, or the Queens Regen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whom they acknowledg'd to have oblig'd all France by her wise conduct and care she had both of the Kings Person, and the State, that as they could not, so they would never attempt any thing upon royal authority, what they had don was to testifie the zeal which they owe, and will shew eternally to their Majesties Persons; That they most humbly desir'd them to remember that the very next day after the death of</hi> Henry <hi>the Great, their Majesties were pleas'd to honor that Court with their presence, desiring them to contribut their good Counsels for the conduct of the public affairs, which oblig'd them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the foresaid Remonstrances, &amp;c.</hi> So they concluded with all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble submission, and a desire that the said <hi>Arrest</hi> of his Counsel of State should not be publish'd.</p>
            <p>This took away somthing of the inflamation for the time, but it cur'd not the wound, which began to fester more and more, and so gangrend that the whole body politic was like to perish. For what the Court of Parliament sought by <hi>supplication,</hi> the Prince of Conde not long after sought by the <hi>sword,</hi> who having divers of the greatest Princes, and them of the Religion ligu'd with him, brought their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition upon the Pikes point; <hi>Conde</hi> flew to that height, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not by way of <hi>Remonstrance,</hi> but, as if he had bin a Prince ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solut, by way of <hi>Manifesto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was then in <hi>Picardy</hi> whither the King had sent divers Letters by persons of good quality, to invite him to come to Court, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in his voyage to Guyen to fetch the Infanta, but all would not do; for old <hi>Bovillon</hi> had infus'd other Counsels into his head, and so he publish'd a Manifesto that the cause of his retirement from the Court, was <hi>the insolent deportment of the Marshall of Ancre, the dissipation of Henry the Greats treasure, the introduction of strangers, of Iewes, Sorcerers and Magicians, by the said Marshall;</hi> and so he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded King-like, (<hi>parlant en sire</hi>) <hi>Wherefore we pray and warn all the the Princes, Peers, and Officers of the Crown, and all such as call themselfs French to succour and assist us in so good an occasion: And we require and adjure all forren Princes and strangers, all the Allies and Confederats of this State to give us ayd and assistance, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were the specious pretences that caus'd this Manifesto, which divers forren Princes took in foul scorn, that he should <hi>require</hi> them, being but a vassal himself; The truth is, there was but one generall grievance, and that was the <hi>Marshall of Ancre</hi> a Confident of the Queen Mothers, whom she had brought with her from Italy, his wife
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98453:21"/>
having bin her foster sister; He had the greatest vogue at Court,<note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> which being a stranger made him repin'd at. The King and the Queen Mother were then resolv'd upon a journey to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> to receive the Infanta, and to deliver the Daughter of France for the King of Spain: <hi>Conde</hi> disswades the King from the voyage by Letters, which were not well taken. So while the one prepares for his journey, the other arms for a war, and gets on his party Longueville, Bulloin and Mayn, who had concluded the match with Spain, yet refus'd to attend in the jour ney; Thus a fearfull clowd hung over France, yet nothing could deter the King from going to fetch his wife, and the Queen Mother said, <hi>That all the power of earth should not hinder him:</hi> Besides he was straitned for money for so long and costly a voyage, nor would the Chamber of Accounts verify in Letters to take any out of the <hi>Bastile;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the King went himself in Person accompagnied by the Queen his Mother, his Chancelor, Secretaries of State, and others, in whose presence the Coffers were open'd and two millions and a halfe of Liures, which make 250000. pounds sterling were taken out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd to the Treasurer of the Privy Purse.</p>
            <p>The King being to begin his journey, the first thing he did was to secure <hi>Paris,</hi> so he left Mounsier <hi>de Liencour</hi> Governour thereof, and to authorise him the more, he admitted him to the Court of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Letters Patents which the said Court did verifie, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the harsh answer they had had to their late Remonstrance at the Louure: The Marshal of <hi>Ancre</hi> was sent to Amiens with a considerable Army: And another Army was left under the command of the Marshal <hi>de Bois Daufin</hi> consisting of 16000. foot, 1500. horse, and 2000. Carrabins, to make head against the Mutiners. So the King and his Mother accompagnied with the Dukes of Guyse, Elbaeuf, and Espernon, with a good number of Gentlemen, with 1200. light horse, his Guard of Suisses and others, making in all 400. foot, parted from Paris towards <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and being come to Poictiers <hi>Madame</hi> his sister which was to be sent to Spain fell sick of the small Pox, which detaind the Court there five weeks, and so much retarded the journey.</p>
            <p>In the intrim the Princes forces encrease and prosper exceedingly, having had the best in three rencounters: Old <hi>Bovillon</hi> had got 600. Reiters from the Marquis of Brandenburg, who joyn'd with them, they got over the Loire maugre the Royall Army under Bois Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin. The Duke of Vandom was then with the King, and he gave him Commission extraordinary to make levies of horse and foot, and having by virtu thereof rais'd an Army of 10000. Combatants, he declar'd himself afterward for the Princes, and employ'd them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King. He who did thrive best amongst the Royalists was the Marshal of <hi>Ancre</hi> who in the interim had taken <hi>Corbes,</hi> and <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King caus'd a Declaration to be publish'd, wherein <hi>Conde</hi> and all his Adhaerents were Proclaim'd Traytors, and sent it to Paris to be
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98453:22"/>
verified by the Parliament, which was never more puzzled in any<note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> busines; those that were averse to the Match with Spain, and favour'd the Mutineers endevour'd to elude the Registring of the royal Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, alledging that the Princes of the bloud being the prime Peers, could not be censur'd there without their Peers, and that the presence of the King himself was requisit, without which his bloud could not be judg'd. After tough altercations the voices of the Court were reduc'd to two Opinions, one was of 73. voices, who order'd that the Declaration should be registred, but the Person of the Prince excepted for a moneth, during which time he should be warn'd to submit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to his Majesty and all others should lay down their arms.</p>
            <p>The other Opinion was caried by 78. voices, which was, that the Court order'd, that the reasons for which they could not and ought not to proceed, to verifie the said Declaration, should be sent to the King; <hi>Condé</hi> to make his quarrel more colourable, and being height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the said <hi>Arrest</hi> of the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> added divers Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles more to his <hi>Manifesto,</hi> viz. 1. That further research be made for the assassinat of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great. 2. That a reformation be made of the Kings Counsell. 3. That the grievances of the three Estates be answer'd, with divers other.</p>
            <p>They of the Religion were yet Neutrals, and thinking to fish in these troubled waters propos'd these high demands.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the independence of the French Crown be declar'd.</item>
               <item>2. That the Counsell of Trent be never publish'd in this Kingdom.</item>
               <item>3. That his Majesty shall be desir'd to declare that upon his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation oath for extirpation of heresies, he understood not or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>his subjects of the Religion.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. That in all public Acts it shall be inserted no more the <hi>pretended reform'd Religion,</hi> but only, Religion.</item>
               <item>5. That their Ministers shall be payed by the King, &amp;c.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These with divers other Propositions were first made at <hi>Grenoble</hi> where the King permitted them to Assemble, but <hi>Lesdigueres</hi> could not endure them there, therefore they remov'd to <hi>Nismes,</hi> and thence to <hi>Rochell,</hi> notwithstanding that the King commanded the contrary. The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had an Agent in the Assembly, who much press'd them to enter into the ligue with him, which they did at last, and writ a Letter to the King of the cause of their conjunction with <hi>Condé.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the King was importun'd by them of the Religion one way, so was he sollicited by the Roman Catholiques of <hi>Bearn</hi> on the other side, that his Majesty would please to restablish them in the possession of their goods, whereof they were depriv'd by <hi>Iane d'Albret</hi> his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal granmother. Amongst these counter-distractions, there came news unto the King that the 6000. Suisses which he had from the Protestant Cantons, had quitted his pay and party and return'd to their own Countrey by the perswasion and practises of them of the Religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:98453:22"/>Madame the Kings sister being recover'd, He went to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> where the Spanish Ambassadour came to demand her for the Prince of <hi>Castile;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> had a Procuration to marry her the next day, which he did the Cardinal of <hi>Sourdis</hi> officiating, and the pietie of the King much appear'd in the ceremony, because he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Cardinals Chaire should be put on a higher ground then his. The same day the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> married the Infanta of Spain in <hi>Burgos</hi> for the King of France. These nuptial ceremonies being perform'd, Madame, now Princesse of Castile, departed from <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> conducted by the Duke of <hi>Guyse,</hi> and in regard a rumor ran that they of the Religion, as also the Count of <hi>Grammont</hi> with others who were said to have ligu'd with <hi>Condé,</hi> had way-laid the young Bride, the King commanded all the Regiment of his gard to attend her; putting himself in the interim in the hands of them of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> The exchange of the two Princesses was made upon a river call'd <hi>Bidasso</hi> hard by S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Iohn de Luz</hi> which separats those two mightie Kingdoms, there were two stately Barges to waft them, the Spaniards on their side had a huge vast globe representing the world, rais'd upon a pavilion very high which made an ostentous shew; The Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> took exception at it, and protested he would never bring o're the Princesse till it was taken down, which was done accordingly.

the <hi>Poet</hi> that made that peece of verse for a Motto was no good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1615.</note> for the <hi>eternal</hi> peace he spoake of, lasted not many yeers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two nations, who <hi>notwithstanding that nature hath conjoyn'd them neer enough in point of local distance, there being but a small river, whereon the two Princesses were exchang'd, that severs them, yet there is no two people on earth are further asunder, and more differing in disposition, affections and interests, being herein right Antipodes one to the other.</hi> By this alliance is verified the saying of the Italian, that <hi>Kings may wed, but kingdoms never.</hi> It appears also hereby, <hi>what a hard destiny, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry condition attends the daughters of Soverain Princes, who are commonly made sacrifices of State, and oblations for Politicall respects, being also to be maried to aliens, and oft-times to husbands of a different Religion, they are wood by Proxy, they must choose by picture, fancy upon trust, and tied in a knot indissoluble to one they never saw but in effigie perchance, and afterwards they must be contented to be unpatriated, disterr'd, and as it were banish'd for ever from their own sweet native soyle, and the ayr they first breath'd: yet</hi> as the Civilian saith, <hi>although they are the end of the House whence they come, they are the beginning of that wherein they enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the King was celebrating his nuptials in his town of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> by divers inventions and exercises of pastime and pleasure, as masks, tilting, playes, bals, and dances, <hi>Condé</hi> with his Confederats, leads another kind of dance up and down France, but while he danc'd and revell'd thus, the poore Countrey sung <hi>lachrymae,</hi> being pitifully oppress'd, torn and harass'd in most parts, there being six or seven armies in motion on both sides: he encreas'd mightily by concourse of partisans, by conjunction of them of the Religion, and by divers successfull rencounters; The King on the other side was at a very low ebb, having exhausted that two millions and a half of liures he had taken himself in person out of the <hi>Bastile,</hi> and being put to hard shifts to get money to defray his ordinary expences, the town of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to her eternal glory, shew'd herself carefull of his honor and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied him. Add hereunto that two whole armies fell from him, that of the <hi>Suisse</hi> consisting of 6000. and that under the Duke of <hi>Vendosm</hi> being the greater of the two, the one only left him, the other turn'd against him, and the whole body of them of the Religion declar'd it self against him, and actually help'd the other side: Moreover, his Parliament at <hi>Paris</hi> would not verifie his Edicts. Yet in the midst of all these straits, He marcheth resolutly from <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with his new Queen to joyn his army with <hi>Bois Dauphin,</hi> with a purpose either to present battaile to the adverse party, or to draw them to a treaty; <hi>Espernon</hi> met him in the way with 4000. foot, and 500. horse. The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> did very much labour and made journeys to and fro for an accommodation, and his endevors took so good effect, that a Conference was agreed on at <hi>Lodun;</hi> where Commissioners were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and did meet on both sides: in the interim the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> perform'd a notable exploit, with 2000. of the Kings prime horses,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98453:23"/>
wherwith he set upon three Regiments of <hi>Condés</hi> at <hi>Nantueil,</hi> which he<note place="margin">Anno 1616.</note> slew, took, and put to flight, carrying all their colours to the King for a present. Hereupon a suspension of arms was accorded through all the Kingdom, except in <hi>Anjou, Perch,</hi> and the frontiers of <hi>Britany</hi> where <hi>Vendosm</hi> continued all acts of hostility, notwithstanding that he had his Deputy at the Conference.</p>
            <p>The King was then advanc'd to <hi>Chastel le Heraud,</hi> where <hi>Villeroy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd him the Articles of the Truce sign'd by the Princes, and where a Legat came from the Pope to deliver him the Imperial <hi>Sword,</hi> and to the Queen the <hi>Rosetree of flowers, and leaves of gold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thence the King went to <hi>Blois</hi> where after a long debate, an Edict of <hi>Pacification</hi> was publish'd upon the Treaty of <hi>Lodun,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 54. Articles, wherein all the Princes, with their adhaerents, as also They of the Religion found satisfaction, and divers persons of base condition were nominated therein, which the world cryed shame upon. By this Edict the King approv'd of all actions pass'd, as having bin done for his Service, and by consequence tacitly disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow'd what He and his Counsell had ordain'd to the contrary. The former <hi>Arrests</hi> of the Court of Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> which the King had suspended were reestablish'd, and they of the Counsell of State annull'd, and many high demands were accorded to them of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; The Chancelor <hi>Sillery,</hi> and divers others who were the Kings Favorits before, were outed of their offices.</p>
            <p>Besides the said <hi>Edict</hi> there were also secret Articles condescended unto, containing rewards and honors to some particular men in lieu of punishment and they were presented in a privat close way to the Parliament to be verified with the gran <hi>Edict;</hi> The Court wav'd them a while, but afterwards by expresse commandment of the Kings, and by a Declaration he made that those secret Articles contain'd no more then what was granted in the secret Articles of the Edict of <hi>Nants</hi> already verified by the same Court, the businesse pass'd, though with much reluctancy, for if those of <hi>Nants</hi> were verified, what need these being the same, have a second verification? This, as it were <hi>enforc'd</hi> Verification, was accompagnied with Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents from the King in special favor to the Prince of <hi>Condé;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Letters in favor of them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> by which his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty declar'd, <hi>not to have understood his subjects of the Reform'd preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Religion in the Oath and Protestation he had made at his Coronation, to employ his sword and power for the extirpation of heresies;</hi> which put the world in an astonishment, because it made the meaning of the Taker of that Oath, and of the Prelat who administred it, to differ. This turn'd afterwards rather to the disadvantage then the benefit of the Demanders, for those hard and high termes which reflected so much upon the conscience of a yong King, stuck deep in his breast, nor could he ever digest them, as will appear in the ensuing Story: Nor was his honor thought much to suffer hereby, being newly come out of his nonage, little vers'd in the art of Government, and having not attain'd

            </p>
            <p>This shrew'd tempest being pass'd, the weather broak up and clear'd; And the King brought his new Queen to <hi>Paris,</hi> having sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted such a world of difficulties, and waded through a sea of troubles; he had bin absent thence neer upon a twelvemoneth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may well imagin with what joy, and triumph the Parisians receiv'd him; Observable it is that in this voyage the King notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he had condescended to hard capitulations, yet he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd his main ends, which was to perfect the Alliance with Spain, and to fetch home his wife in safety, which he did maugre the great Martiall oppositions that were made by most of the Princes of France who malign'd the match.</p>
            <p>In this yeer there happen'd some ill-favor'd jarrs in Italy twixt the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Mantova,</hi> about <hi>Monferrat;</hi> The King employed thither the Marquis of <hi>Coeuures</hi> to compose the difference, but he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd without doing any good, notwithstanding that the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> joyn'd with him; He sent after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Marquis of <hi>Rambovillet,</hi> who caried himself with more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse, for he tamper'd with the affections of the French and Suisses, which made the better part of the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> army, with such dexterity, that the Duke entring into a diffidence of them, hearkned to a Treaty. <hi>Don Pedro de Toledo</hi> then Governor of <hi>Milan</hi> was arm'd for the <hi>Mantovan,</hi> and by this Treaty both Parties were to disband; in the interim if the <hi>Spaniard</hi> attempted any thing upon <hi>Monferrat, France</hi> should assist his Highnes of <hi>Savoy.</hi> But the <hi>Spaniard</hi> though he attempted nothing, yet he reinforc'd his Troupes, which struck an apprehension of fear into the <hi>Venetians</hi> (who of all Nations are most eagle-ey'd to foresee dangers) because there was a small difference twixt them, and the Archduke of <hi>Grats</hi> about the <hi>Uscochi,</hi> which made them confederat, and co-arme with the <hi>Savoyard:</hi> there were great Forces on both sides, and <hi>Don Pedro</hi> took <hi>Verselli, &amp; Damian,</hi> but his Majesty of France employ'd thither <hi>Mons. de Bethune,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd a Treaty in <hi>Pavia</hi> to that end, which took effect; but the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard afterwards delaying to give up <hi>Vercelli, Modene Luynes</hi> kinsman was sent thither who did the work; The difference also twixt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public and the Archduke of <hi>Grats</hi> was accommoded by French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, so that in lesse then a twelve moneths, four Ambassadors went from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About this time the Lord <hi>Hayes,</hi> afterwards Earl of Carlile, came in a very splendid equippage to <hi>Paris,</hi> to congratulate, in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie of Great <hi>Britain's</hi> name, 1. <hi>The alliance with Spain:</hi> 2. <hi>The arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of the new Queen:</hi> 3. <hi>The Kings return to Paris:</hi> 4. <hi>The end of the late wars.</hi> The French Chroniclers relate that his chiefest arrand was to propound a Match between the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> (now King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) and the Lady <hi>Christina,</hi> second daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great; but they are much mistaken; for the said Ambassador might happily have instructions to look upon and view the said Lady, but for any

            <p>The King, the two Queens, and the whole Court being now set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled at <hi>Paris,</hi> the discontented Princes repair'd also thither, but <hi>Conde</hi> being newly recovered of a dangerous sicknes, (which some took as a judgement upon him) lagg'd behind, and excus'd his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming till all the Articles of the late Treaty were perform'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the King may be said to be no lesse then compell'd, being, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ties forc'd to revoke part of the solemn Oth he took at his Coronation, that therby they of the Religion might rest conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: At last <hi>Conde</hi> came, and was entred into a perfect redintegrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace and favor at Court with the rest of his Confederats.</p>
            <p>So after such turbid times there was an intervall of faire weather, but the Ayer was suddenly ore' cast again with clowds, and the chief Meteor whence they sprung was the power and privacy of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of Ancre</hi> at Court. The Queen Mother had advice of certain clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destine meetings, and secret consultations held to alter the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to demolish <hi>Ancre;</hi> hereupon <hi>Themines</hi> (who receiv'd the Truncheon to be Marshall the same day) apprehended the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the <hi>Louure,</hi> and carried him thence to prison; the report hereof startled divers others, and old <hi>Bovillon</hi> being then at a Sermon in Charenton, durst not come back to look upon the <hi>Bastile;</hi> so he with the Dukes of <hi>Mayn, Nevers, Guyse</hi> and divers other retir'd and arm'd under pretence of reforming of abuses in the State, and for the <hi>public good. Poore France, how often hath privat interest of some aspiring spirits bin term'd in thee by the specious name of Public good? How often have thy discontented Grandees ground the faces of thy innocent peasants? How often hast thou turn'd the sword into thine own bowels, and swomm in the blood of thine own children? How often have thy Towns bin turn'd to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spitals, thy fields to desarts under the gilded pretext of Reformation?</hi>

            <p>The arrest of <hi>Conde</hi> alarm'd all France, and a politic rumour was spread in <hi>Paris</hi> that the Marshall of <hi>Ancre</hi> had murther'd him in the Louure, though he was then at <hi>Amiens</hi> 100. miles off. This made the <hi>Beast</hi> with many heads run furiously to his House in the suburbs of Saint <hi>German,</hi> which they sack'd and plunder'd most pitifully, they unplank'd his roomes, grub'd up his trees, and committed divers barbarismes besides. The King caus'd a Declaration to be publish'd full of vigorous expressions tending to this purpose.</p>
            <p>Lewis <hi>by the grace of God King of France and Navarr, to all who shall see these present</hi> Letters, <hi>greeting. It is with incredible regret which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Our very heart, that We must so often employ Our Authority to represse the mischievous desseins of them, who seek the raising of their fortunes, in the ruines of Our Estates, and in the prodigious cruelty of civill wars, take an unbridled libertie to doe what law and reason forbids: And We are the more sensible hereof, because the remedies We must use, for the safety of our Person, and the welfare of this Kingdom, must diffame our own blood, and</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:98453:25"/>
               <hi>render it culpable of impiety both against Us, who are in place of a Father</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1616.</note> 
               <hi>to our subjects, as also against their own Countrey which is reverenc'd as a Mother by all people though never so barbarous.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So he goes on to relate the Treaty at <hi>Lodun,</hi> and the last Pacifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which had cost him twenty millions of Liures; and what grace he had done to <hi>Conde</hi> and his Complices.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet the exces of Our grace and favor hath not bin able to represse the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinat wills of them, who find no rest but in trouble, and ground their hopes upon Our destruction: for before and after the return of Our Cousin the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>to</hi> Paris, <hi>there have bin Nocturnall Assemblies held in Saint</hi> Martin <hi>and other places with consultations to debauch and abuse the people, and undermine those who have Martiall Offices under us, and to excite them to commotion; Curats and Preachers have bin tampered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to vent scandalous Doctrin, and meanes were consulted on to seize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Our Royall Person, and our most honored Mother, and to Cantonize France under the specious vayle of reforming the State: All which hath bin told us by some of the best of Our subjects who were present at some of their consultations, and close meetings; And We were also advis'd by forren Ambassadors to have a care of our self, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the substance of the Kings Declaration, but all would not do, to contain the Princes within the bounds of obedience, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them had retir'd to <hi>Picardy,</hi> and seiz'd upon divers places which they fortified apace. A little after the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was clap'd up, the Duke of <hi>Vendosm</hi> was seiz'd on, but he scap'd by a wile; The Chancelor and Secretaries of State with other Officers were chang'd; And in this hurly burly the young Bishop of <hi>Lucon</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> having bin design'd for Ambassador to Spain, was made principall Secretary of State.</p>
            <p>The Marshal of <hi>Ancre,</hi> notwithstanding that he had understood how he was hated in Paris, and that his House was so plunder'd in a popular furie, yet was he nothing daunted, but comes boldly to Court, and presently three Armies were rais'd and appointed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the Mutiners; One under the Duke of Guyse who was charm'd to come in by the Queen Mother: The second under Marshall <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigny;</hi> and the third under the Count of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> (who was freed from his 11. yeers close imprisonment in the <hi>Bastile</hi> for that purpose) and had already besieg'd the Duke of <hi>Mayne</hi> at <hi>Soissons,</hi> and much straitned him.</p>
            <p>While this huge storme was dropping pitifully upon poor France, there were secret consultations held by some in the <hi>Louure</hi> how to hurle Him into the <hi>Sea</hi> who was the cause of the tempest, which was cryed up to be the foresaid <hi>Ancre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He knew too well how he was malign'd in Court and Countrey, and the young Kings affection towards him began now to brandle, and all this was by the suggestions of <hi>Luynes,</hi> who was one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Confidentst the King had, having bin his servant from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and was vers'd in his genius more then any: <hi>Ancre</hi> had pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98453:25"/>
to remove him from the Kings Person, with some others whom<note place="margin">Anno 1616.</note> he suspected to do him ill offices.</p>
            <p>Besides this fewd 'twixt the King and Princes, there was another petty war then a foot betwixt the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> and the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> the ground whereof was that they would not acknowledge him Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the Countrey of <hi>Aunis,</hi> and of their Town, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to derive by Patent from the raign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third. He had also a grudge unto them that they had debauch'd the conscience of the Count of <hi>Candalle</hi> his son by inducing him to abjure his Religion, and to professe theirs; <hi>Espernon</hi> was commanded to wave that quarrel, and to come to assist against the Princes: divers others were wrought upon to abandon their party; amongst the rest the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> was much sought, and he refusing, he was accus'd to have said, <hi>That he was descended of a better House then the Queen Mother;</hi> which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disavowed, and offer'd to combat the raiser of that report in Duel.</p>
            <p>The obloquy and hatred of <hi>Ancre</hi> encreased daily, and the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of Colonel <hi>Stuard</hi> and <hi>Hurtevant,</hi> with erecting of new gibets in divers places about <hi>Paris,</hi> and one upon the new Bridge hard by the <hi>Louure</hi> in <hi>terrorem,</hi>—all which was imputed to the Marshall of <hi>Ancre,</hi> exasperated the humors of the Parisians against him more and more, in so much that it was an easie thing to be a Prophet what would become of him. <hi>Luynes</hi> with others at Court infusd daily new thoughts of diffidence of him into the young King, who had taken exception at some personall comportment of his, by putting on his Hat when he play'd with him at Biliards: so in a close Cabinet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation twixt the King, <hi>Luynes,</hi> and <hi>Vitry</hi> who was Captain of his Guard, the King gave him command to seize upon the said Marshall of <hi>Ancre,</hi> and in case of resistance to kill him; The businesse was carried wonderfull close, and two dayes after the Marshall entring the <hi>Louure, Vitry</hi> was prepar'd with his guard about him, and while the Marshall was reading of a Letter, <hi>Vitry</hi> comes and grapples him by the shoulder, and told him he was commanded by the King to arrest him; Me? said <hi>Ancre, yes you by the death of God, (mort Dieu)</hi> repli'd <hi>Vitry:</hi> hereupon <hi>Ancre</hi> laying his hand upon his sword to deliver it, as most thought, <hi>Vitry</hi> with a loud voyce cri'd out, Kill him, thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he received three Pistols shots into his body, and was presently dispatch'd; <hi>Vitry</hi> with naked sword in his hand cri'd out, that none should stir; For he had executed but the Kings commands. Hereupon those hundred gentlemen which had attended the Marshall that mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Queens Court where he was us'd to go the back way slunk away: and not one drawn sword appear'd amongst them.</p>
            <p>The King being above in a gallery and hearing a noise below, ask'd what the matter was? one answerd, that the Marshall of <hi>Ancre</hi> was kill'd, and being told the manner, he said, I will make good what <hi>Vitry</hi> hath done, and giving a caper, he said, <hi>I am now King of France, I have no competitor. Vitry</hi> presently after broke into <hi>Leonora's</hi> cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98453:26"/>
               <hi>Ancres</hi> wife seiz'd upon her person, upon all her Trunks and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets,<note place="margin">Anno 1616.</note> where in gold, and jewels there was the value of above an hundred thousand pounds sterling. Her Chamber was next the Queen Mothers, who sending in for <hi>Vitry,</hi> ask'd him without any shew of dismay <hi>whether he had kill'd the Marshall;</hi> Yes Madame, said he: and why? <hi>because the King had commanded me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ancres</hi> body was buried in a little Church hard by the <hi>Louure,</hi> and stones laid and flatted upon the grave, but the next morning, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quays of the Court, and rabble of the City, came and digg'd up his coffin, toare his winding sheet, and dragg'd his body through the gutters, and hang'd it upon the new gibet which he had commanded to be set up upon the new bridge, where they cut off his nose, eares, and genitories, which they sent for a Present to the Duke of Mayne at Soissons, and nayl'd his eares to the gates of <hi>Paris,</hi> the rest of his body was burn'd, and part of the ashes hurl'd into the river, and part into the ayer. His wife was then imprison'd, search'd and raz'd for a Witch, though little or no proofs (God wot) were produc'd against her, only that she employ'd some Jews; as also that she had bewitch'd a Spanish Ginet the Duke of Mayn had at Soissons which he should have mounted one morning, but Mounsier <hi>Maurice</hi> his son who was Keeper of one of the chiefest Academies of <hi>Paris</hi> riding him before, and the Horse having pranc'd and curvetted a good while under him, he suddenly fell, gave a grone and so breath'd his last, and the Rider was taken up for dead, and continued in a sleepy trance 48. houres to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So she was also executed afterwards, and the difference twixt her husband and her was this, that she had the favor to dye after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was given, and he before, for his indictment was made after his death, and then his sentence pass'd when he was in tother world.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Conchino Conchini</hi> (a Florentin born) Marquis of <hi>Ancre,</hi> and Marshall of France was demolish'd, or rather extinguish'd, in a most disastrous manner, and his wife <hi>Leonora Galligay</hi> beheaded, who shew'd a notable Roman resolution at the block; their estate, which was not above four thousand pound sterling <hi>per an.</hi> was given to <hi>Luynes</hi> most part of it; They left one only male child who being young was sent to Italy, where he lives to this day in a Noble equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page by the title of Earl of <hi>Pena:</hi> though pronounced ignoble in France by an arrest of the Court of Parliament: A stout man this Marquis of <hi>Ancre</hi> was, a good Soldier, and a compleat Courtier, he was endowed with divers good parts, only he wanted moderation, and therein he did degenerat from an Italian.</p>
            <p>There were divers censures abroad of this act of the young Kings, and indeed it was the worst thing he did in all his life, being an act fitter for the <hi>Seraglio,</hi> then his Castle of the <hi>Louure:</hi> for the wisest sort of men wonder'd that he should stain the walls of his Court, with a Christians bloud in that manner, without any legall proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the party. He sent Letters to the severall Princes that were in arms, to content them, as also to satisfie the world; and all of them of this tenor following.</p>

               <hi>the death of the late King my Lord and Father (whom God absolve) you have observ'd how the Marshall of Ancre and his wife abusing my mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the power which they acquir'd upon the spirit of the Queen my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, have projected to usurp all authority, to dispose absolutly of all matters of State, and to deprive me of the means to take cognisance of mine own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; a dessein which they have push'd on so far, that hitherto there hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd unto me but the sole name of a King, and that it was a kind of capital crime for my Officers and subjects to have acces unto me, and to entertain me with any serious discours; which it pleasing God to make me perceive, and to point out the danger which my Person and State were like to incur by such an exorbitant ambition, being compell'd by some considerations, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd by Counsel from above, I resolv'd to secure the person of the said Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall, and therefore I commanded the Captain of my Guard to arrest him within my Castle the Louure; which he attempting to do, the said Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall being well accompagnied offerd to oppose my said command, and certain blows being given the said Marquis fell down dead, &amp;c.</hi> So he tells him that he intends for the future to take the reins of Government into his own hands. Wherefore he exhorts him to returne neer his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and take his due rank in Court and Counsell. And concludes <hi>that if he renders proofs answerable to the esteem he makes of his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, he will be ready to acknowledge it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Letters went abroad from the King of this tenor, and they took such effect that all arms were thrown down every where, and the Princes repair'd to Court: Now and not before it may be said that the King began to raign: by this change, France chang'd her countenance, old Officers were restor'd to their places; <hi>Sillery</hi> was made Chancelor again, <hi>Du Vair,</hi> and <hi>Villeroy</hi> were restor'd with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others; and the Bishop of <hi>Lucon</hi> left the Secretariship of State, and retir'd, though he was offer'd to be still of the Privy Counsell if he would stay. The Queen Mother shew'd her self a true Queen of her passions herein, for though her favourit, and foster sister were torn away from her thus, yet such was her temper, that she disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd no extraordinary resentment, that which she said, she took ill was, <hi>that the King did not impart unto her his intentions, for she would willingly have concurr'd to do all things to his contentment;</hi> The King appointed her the Castle of <hi>Blois</hi> to reside in, and coming to take his leave of her, <hi>he thanked her for the pains she had taken in Government, but he resolv'd to sit now at the helme himself, and if she would be a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, she should find him a good Son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Marchiones of <hi>Ancre</hi> was not executed till the Queen was gone from <hi>Paris,</hi> at her arraignment she shew'd an Amazonian cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and the subtilty of her spirit put all men in admiration; she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, <hi>with much disdain, all kind of witchcraft and sorcery,</hi> (and indeed the proofs were little or none at all against her) <hi>She confess'd that she had convey'd some moneys out of the Kingdom, but it was either for the Kings service, or for her own utility; for the first, it deserv'd rather a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:98453:27"/>
               <hi>for the second there was no law against any stranger to do the like; she</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1617.</note> 
               <hi>acknowledg'd to have receiv'd divers favors of the Queen her Mistresse in whose service she had employ'd her whole life, and to receive favors from great Princes was never held a crime till now; she often dehorted her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band from some violent courses he took, which made her make a separation of her estate from his, fearing that some funestous accident might befall him; but it being granted that she had conceal'd the defauts of her husband, there was never any law that could punish, much lesse condemn a wife for that;</hi> In conclusion, she defended herself with that caution and courage, that many of the Judges were of opinion that banishment was enough for her; but the quality of the times, and state of things transported the Judges to extraordinary rigor.</p>
            <p>Upon the Scaffold she carried herself with such a scorn of death, and with that exemplary piety and patience, that she mollified the hearts of all the spectators, and sent hundreds away with wet eyes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst whom were divers of those who had embrued their hands so barbarously in her husbands bloud.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vitry</hi> had the Truncheon to be Marshall of France hereupon, and out of the ruins of <hi>Ancre Luynes</hi> rais'd his fortunes, which may be said to be three stories higher, for he suddenly hois'd not only himself but his two brethren, <hi>Cadenet</hi> &amp; <hi>Brand,</hi> to an incredible height, which made one fix upon the <hi>Louure</hi> gate this pasquil <hi>Aux trois Rois,</hi> at the the three Kings; some cryed out that the tyranny was not chang'd but only the tyrant; <hi>That the same Tavern stood still, only it had a new bush.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Luynes</hi> had given him the Marquisat of <hi>Ancre,</hi> and all the Stable possessions of the Marshal: but <hi>Du Vair</hi> a good while would not let it passe the Great Seal, in regard that by an <hi>Arrest</hi> of the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament all their Stable goods were confiscated and reunited to the Crown, and he stood stiffe in this untill the King had given him the Bishoprick of <hi>Lysieux,</hi> and having then fixed the Seal, the French Pasquin began to tell him, <hi>Et Homo factus sum;</hi> a little after the King married his Favorit <hi>Luynes</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Montbazons</hi> daughter, He gave the Duke twenty thousand pound sterling, and made him Governor of the <hi>Isle</hi> of France, the Duke of <hi>Main</hi> being translated to <hi>Guyen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King desiring to be in good intelligence with all his Subjects, fell upon a new reach of Policy by the advice of his Counsell, which was, that in regard he had found that the Assembly of the <hi>States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> brought with it more trouble then utility, in regard of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepant humors and interests which such a number of men of various conditions, Professions and Religions carried with them, instead of the <hi>States General,</hi> he convokes an <hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>notables</hi> as he term'd it, compos'd of some selected Persons out of every Order, whereunto should be added some Counsellor out of every Court of Parliament. Which being fewer in number would not breed such a confusion; And this Assembly should be equipollent to that of the <hi>States General,</hi> and their acts so obligatory. To this end the Kings Writs were issued
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:98453:27"/>
out, the day and place appointed which was the Citie of <hi>Roven;</hi> All<note place="margin">Anno 1617.</note> solemnly met there in the Archbishops Hall, where after the King, the Chancelor made a grave Oration, that his Majesties pious inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to call them thither, was to regulat and police the State, and to ease the Subject. The first four daies were spent in settling the ranks of the Deputies; and a great clash fell twixt the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of Parliaments, whom the <hi>Nobles</hi> said they had reason to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, in regard they took them to be but Members of the <hi>third Estate,</hi> but they disadvow'd that qualitie, and stood to their Soverain Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction which extended over the <hi>Nobles</hi> as well as other persons; nor could they be call'd the third Estate, because they never us'd to meet in the Assembly of the <hi>States Generall;</hi> The <hi>Nobles</hi> alledg'd the lustre of their birth, the excellence of the Profession of Armes above the gown, strengthning their cause with divers other arguments: but the difference being left undecided, the King resolv'd that the <hi>Nobles</hi> should be plac'd about the Person of the King; but with this proviso, that it should not prejudice the second rank they have by Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall right In the convention of the <hi>States Generall,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is next the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie; and for delivering of Opinions, the King inordred, that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning the Church the <hi>Clergie</hi> should vote first, in matters of War the <hi>Nobles,</hi> in matters of <hi>Law</hi> the Officers of Justice, in matters of the <hi>Revenue</hi> of the Crown, the Exchequer men, and Financiers.</p>
            <p>In this Assembly were agitated and concluded many wholsome things; First,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That the Secret affairs of State be communicated to few, and those of known probity, and prudence, for fear of discovery.</item>
               <item>2. That the expence of the Kings House, and the salary of Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry men be regulated.</item>
               <item>3. That Pensions be retrench'd.</item>
               <item>4. That a course be taken to regulat gifts and rewards which are to be made in silver.</item>
               <item>5. That it be illegal to sell any Offices in the Kings House, in War, or Government.</item>
               <item>6. <hi>That reversion of Offices, and Benefices be restrain'd, because it gives occasion to attempt upon the lifes of the living Incumbents, and takes away the Kings Liberty, to advance persons of merit, taking also from the persons themselfs, the encouragement of doing better by hope of advancement.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>7. That the Annuel right be suppress'd.</item>
               <item>8. That the venality of Offices be prohibited.</item>
               <item>9. That small wrangling Courts, and the number of Pettifoggers be retrench'd, and that all causes be brought to the Soverain Courts.</item>
            </list>
            <p>These in grosse were the Results of this Assembly which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a great deal of harmony, the King himself was present most of the time, and in his absence <hi>Monsieur</hi> presided; There pass'd also a Law to permit the Jesuits to open their Colledg of <hi>Clermont</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> and to endoctrinat young youth in the Sciences; But the Universitie of <hi>Paris</hi> to make this Edict illusory, made two Decrees, by the first,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98453:28"/>
it was ordred that none should be admitted to the course of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,<note place="margin">Anno 1618.</note> unlesse he have studied three yeers under the public Professors of the Faculty of Theologie in <hi>Sorbon;</hi> and that he be put to his oath not to have studied in any other Colledg. The second was, A prohibition to all Principals of Colledges, for admitting any, but those that go to the Lectures of the Professors of the said Universitie, and that none shall enjoy the Priviledges of Scholarity if he studieth not under those Professors. An indifferent moderat man said that there was no way to end this quarrell, but that the Jesuits might be united to the body of the Universitie, and so submit themselfs entirely to their Laws and Ordinances.</p>
            <p>We will conclude this <hi>lustre</hi> with a horrible fire that hapned in the Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> in the chief Palace of <hi>Iustice,</hi> it rag'd most in the great Hall where the Lawyers and Counsellors use to meet, where also the Statues of the Kings of France are set up, and are rank'd according to the times of their raign in excellent Sculpture, all which were utterly reduc'd to cendres, with the Table of Marble about which the Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were us'd to sit; The cause of this fire is to this day unknown; but it might be very well interpreted to be a visible judgment from heaven upon that place and Palace for the hard measure of Justice, the Marshall of <hi>Ancre</hi> and his Lady had received a little before; Which makes me call to mind a Latin verse, I have read upon a Stat-House in <hi>Delph</hi> in Holland, which had bin burnt in like maner and reedified, not one other house about it receiving any hurt.</p>

We will begin this with bone-fires of joy, for the Mariage of the Lady <hi>Christina,</hi> second daughter of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great, to the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who came in Person to <hi>Paris</hi> to do his own busines: he comported himself with that addresse, that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenes, that bravery of spirit accompagnied with such gentlenes, that he gain'd much upon the French Nation; The busines was not long a finishing, for <hi>Henry</hi> the Great was well pleas'd with an ouverture that had bin made formerly by the said Prince for the Eldest daughter, who was maried to <hi>Spain:</hi> She had for her Dower 1200. thousand French liures, which comes to one hundred and twenty thousand

            </p>
            <p>The Queen Mother was all this while at <hi>Blois;</hi> and som ombrages of distrust hung 'twixt the King and her; for the Bishop of <hi>Lucon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by command removed from her, Mounsieur <hi>Roissy</hi> was sent expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the King to attend her, whom the Queen took to be no other then a kind of Spy, to watch over her actions; nor was she invited to the marriage of her daughter, which was solemniz'd at <hi>Paris;</hi> and with this mariage it seems the King did consummat his own by bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with the Queen his wife, which he had not done since he had maried her at <hi>Burdeaux</hi> almost four yeers before, where he lay with her only two hours; and though this was done for fear it should hinder his growth, and enervat his strength, yet there were some whispers that it was done with an intent to be divorc'd from her, and <hi>Luynes</hi> was blamed for it; Hereupon he finding the King one night inclinable, took him out of his bed in his armes, and casting his night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gown over him he carried him to the Queens bed; The <hi>Nuncio,</hi> and Spanish Ambassador were so joy'd at this, that they presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd expresses to carry the news, and bonefiers were made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon both in <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> for there were some surmises abroad that so long a separation from bed, would turn in time to an aversion, which might draw after it a repudiation, and so a divorce.</p>
            <p>While the King was thus <hi>confirming</hi> his own, and celebrating his sisters Nuptialls in <hi>Paris,</hi> there were tydings brought that his Mother got out of <hi>Blois</hi> Castle, and was convey'd away secretly in the night through a window which was towards the moate, where she glided down a good height upon a counter scarp, and so made an escape. The King had sent Father <hi>Arnoul</hi> the director of his conscience a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before under colour of complement to visit her, but the design was to draw from her a solemn oath, that she would not come to the Kings Court without his preadvertisement, and approbation, which oath she took upon the Evangelists: He sent her also word, that he and the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> now her son in law would come to visit her; but she knew well enough how matters were carried at Court, and so she gave little credit to those endearments, fearing there was too strong a drug under the pill.</p>
            <p>Her escape was trac'd by <hi>Espernon</hi> the little Gascon Duke who had bin from the beginning a great servant of Ladies, there had bin divers clashings and counterbuffs 'twixt him and the gown-men of the law; amongst others <hi>Du Vair</hi> the then Lord Keeper and he could not agree; <hi>Du Vair</hi> did him ill offices to <hi>Luynes,</hi> who began to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign him more and more. So the little Duke had two mighty ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at once, the one full of <hi>cunning,</hi> the other of <hi>credit</hi> with the King, therefore being at the Town of <hi>Metz,</hi> the King sent him order not to stir thence, because there were like to be wars in Germany; <hi>Esper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> sent answer that he being in the next place to Germany had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd certain advice that there are no commotions like to be there, that his Majesties service, and his own affairs were all in a disarray in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:98453:29"/>
Guyen, and that he knew not in what to serve him there, <hi>unlesse it</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1619.</note> 
               <hi>were to convey his packets to and fro;</hi> Therefore he humbly desir'd his Majesties permission to go for <hi>Guyen</hi> whither some pressing occasions call'd him, and that <hi>La Vallette</hi> his son shall render him a good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that place.</p>
            <p>The Queen Mother and he had much privat intelligence, and she sent him an expresse to complain unto him of her hard condition, and withall she sent the Originall of a late Letter unto her from the King, wherein he permits her to go to any Town or place throughout his Dominions (his own Court excepted), so in conclusion she prayes and conjures him <hi>as he was a Cavalier</hi> to help her out, and conduct her to <hi>Angoulesme.</hi> The old Duke was glad of this advantageous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of things, therefore without any further attendance of the Kings pleasure, he suddenly leaves <hi>Metz</hi> commanding the Gates to be close shut for two dayes after his departure, and so went towards the Queen Mother with a resolution to intermingle his interests and dangers with hers; So he employ'd <hi>le Plessis</hi> a confident of his, who receiv'd the Queen first of all out of the Castle window<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and convey'd her over the river in the dead of night, where she met the Archbishop of <hi>Tholouse</hi> after Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> with 15. horse, and a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Duke himself with 60. great horse, for he would have no more, for making too great a noise, so he attended her to <hi>Angou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King resented to the quick this presumption and hardinesse of the Duke, who being asked how he durst venture upon so dangerous an enterprise, he answer'd, <hi>Because I would have two cables to my Ship in a storme that was like to fall upon me.</hi> The King hereupon frames an army to chastise the insolence of <hi>Espernon;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> was commanded to come from <hi>Province,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> from <hi>Guien,</hi> to meet him about <hi>Angoulesme</hi> with forces. Some held it to be a derogatory and unbefitting thing in the King to keep such a stir for to have a revenge upon his own Mother, and upon a Vassal, and an old Officer of the Crown, and so advis'd his Majesty to go thither with his ordinary Guards: Others counsel'd him to separat the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests of the Queen Mother from the Dukes, and to send a person of quality to her to dispose of her to a conformity to his pleasure, and to leave the Duke to stand upon his own legs. To which purpose divers were sent unto her from the King, but in vain, for she could never be brought to abandon the interests of <hi>Espernon</hi> who had expos'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to such dangers for her. Hereupon the Bishop of <hi>Lucon</hi> (afterwards Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi>) who was retir'd to <hi>Avignon,</hi> and had been in great esteem with her formerly, was sent for by the Kings command to atetnd the Queen, and being a man of eloquence, and of powerfull reasons, he moulded the Queens mind as he pleas'd, and fitted it for a reconciliation; being thus prepar'd, the King sent <hi>Marossan</hi> unto her to assure her of the obedience and love of a Son; and withall to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of her a dimission of the government of Normandy for other
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98453:29"/>
places which she should have in exchange. She as'kd <hi>Marossan</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Anno 1619.</note> he brought any <hi>letters</hi> from the King about that, he said no, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King at the first enterview would speake with her by word of mouth about it, but he was resolv'd not to write to her: and <hi>why so?</hi> replied the Queen. Madame, said he, <hi>I have not in charge to tell you the reason, but if you command me I will; You will do me a pleasure,</hi> said she; <hi>It is, Madame, because the King having written unto you a letter full of affection at</hi> Blois <hi>wherein he was willing you might go into any other place within his Kingdom, you gave the letter to the Duke of</hi> Espernon, <hi>thereby to affoord him means to colour his conveying you away from</hi> Blois <hi>and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you hither; for fear therefore that you would doe the like again, he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to write no more unto you of any matter of moment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen enlarg'd her self upon that subject, saying, <hi>That any body would do as she did being in captivitie, there being nothing that the brute animals desire more then freedom, and therefore this inclination was not to be wondred at in rationall creatures;</hi> so she came to the point and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her self to the Kings desires in every thing.</p>
            <p>Matters being brought to this passe, the King suffer'd the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> to go visit her, which he had long desir'd with much impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience; being come with his brother Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> neer <hi>Angoulesme, Espernon</hi> with a hundred great horse went to meet them, in a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some equippage; The Prince stay'd there some dayes to wait upon his new Mother in law, and at his departure she gave him a Diamond of high price which was the Emperour <hi>Ferdinands</hi> her Grandfather, and so he return'd to the King.</p>
            <p>A while afterthere was an enterview appointed 'twixt the King and his Mother at <hi>Cousieres</hi> a House of the Duke of <hi>Monbazons</hi> in <hi>Touraine;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> attended her to the farthest limits of his government, and at parting she gave him a rich Diamond, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring him never to part with it, but that it might be preserv'd from father to son as an eternall gage of her gratitude, and in memory of the gallant and most signal service which he had render'd her to the hazard of his life and fortune:</hi> The Duke us'd to wear the said Diamond afterwards upon his finger in a ring upon festivall dayes which he said cost him two hundred thousand Crowns.</p>
            <p>The Queen being come to the place of meeting, <hi>Luynes</hi> who was now made Duke and Peer of France, and Governor of <hi>Normandy,</hi> was sent from the King before-hand; after his first audience the Queen brought him to her Cabinet where she melted into passion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the hard usage she had receiv'd, which she would quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get; yet she could not refrain from falling still upon the mention of her hard usage, which did her no good afterwards, for <hi>Luynes</hi> thereby fear'd that matters pass'd had taken such lasting impressions in her, that they could never be defac'd; and considering the vindicatif spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the <hi>Nation</hi> whence she came, he still mistrusted if she return'd to Court, she would project some way of revenge, &amp;c. The King came the next day in Coach with the young Queen, his two Sisters,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98453:30"/>
and the two Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the House where the Queen was, and<note place="margin">Anno 1619.</note> there was a compleat glorious Court, the mutual demonstrations and postures of tendernes which Mother and Son shew'd at their first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, melted the hearts of all the Spectators. A few daies after all parted, the King and his Queen towards <hi>Paris,</hi> the Queen Mother to <hi>Angers,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Piemont</hi> put themselfs in their journey to crosse the <hi>Alps.</hi>

               <hi>Luynes</hi> having taken his oath as Duke and Peer of France in the<note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> Court of Parliament, he moved the King to perfect the number of the Cavaliers of his <hi>Order,</hi> the Order of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> who being an hundred by the primitive institution were now diminished to twenty eight, so there were divers more created to the number of fifty nine, whereof <hi>Luynes</hi> two brothers <hi>Cadenet</hi> and <hi>Brande</hi> were two: <hi>Luynes</hi> plot was to ingratiat himself hereby into the Nobility, but it prov'd otherwise, for the Competitors that were excluded, grew to be more bitterly his <hi>foes,</hi> then they who were instal'd Knights became his <hi>friends.</hi> Much murmuring also was at his two brothers, this Order being the next degree to bring one to be Duke and Peer of France. As the Ceremonies of these new Knights were a performing, the two Princes of the bloud, <hi>Condé</hi> and <hi>Soissons</hi> being at Court, as the King was ready to sit down at diner, the Steward of the Houshold deliver'd the towell to <hi>Soissons</hi> to give the King; <hi>Condé</hi> perceiving it, would have had it from him, but he would not part with it, so they fell to high words, one saying it was his right as he was <hi>prime Prince of the bloud,</hi> the other as he was <hi>gran Master of France;</hi> as they were deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the point in hot termes, the King sent for his brother, to whom the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> deliver'd it; so with much ado the King made them both friends upon the place, and the next day many hundreds of Gentlemen appearing on horseback, and offring their service on both sides, there came out a strict Order from the King, there should be no more stirring in the businesse.</p>
            <p>It fortun'd about this time that the young Queen fell sick, and there were extraordinary Offices of devotion performed for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and a generall Procession Ordred, where the whole Court of Parliament assisted in their red robes: The Queen being recover'd she employed the fifteen thousand Crowns which the King had given her for a <hi>ball</hi> to works of Piety and Charity.</p>
            <p>The Kings Exchequer was at a very low ebbe at this time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon there came out an Edict call'd the <hi>Bursall Edict</hi> which tended to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:98453:30"/>
raise money, and the King mistrusting the verification of it by the<note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> Court of Parliament, went thither himself in great state, where the Lord Keeper made a speech a bout it: The Prime President answer'd him boldly, <hi>That the Court receiv'd violence to verifie such Edicts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any precedent deliberation, that being well assur'd of the goodnes and justice of his Majesty the Court imputed this disorder to ill counsell, and therefore desired the names of them who gave him this damnable counsell should be given up and registred in Parliament to be proceeded against accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly; Servin</hi> the Kings Advocat was more hardy, saying, <hi>That his Majesty did wrong himself to come to Parliament to authorise by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, that which could not be done with reason and justice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Edict</hi> pass'd, and that afternoon, the Court of Parliament was commanded to wait at the <hi>Louure,</hi> where his Majestie told them, <hi>That he was ill edified by their Remonstrances, which he found very insolent;</hi> The Lord Keeper told them, <hi>That to some ill purpose they thought to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat the King from his Counsell, by blaming the one, and exempting the other, for being inseparable, the offence must bring the blow upon both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a thing not to be endured by a Soverain Prince, who is to exspect pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall obedience from his subjects;</hi> so the prime President making a large apologie, at last they were dismiss'd, with recovery of the Kings grace.</p>
            <p>The prodigious and violent promotions of <hi>Luynes</hi> in dignity, power, wealth and command, made him the object of envy to some, of hatred to others, of amazement to all; nor was he contented to hoise himself so, but he must pully up his two brothers along with him; so there was a kind of generall discontentment fomented in the hearts of the people, which was aggravated by the late shift the King had made to get money, and the clash he had with the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> so mens minds were susceptible and ready to receive any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions of mislike against the present Government. The Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> had a particular discontentment, that <hi>Cadenet,</hi> afterwards Duke of <hi>Chaune</hi> which was erected into a Pairrie a <hi>Peership</hi> of France, had maried the Heiresse of Peguigny, whom he had sought for wife; so he with divers other Princes started out and put themselfs in armes; the Count of <hi>Soissons, Vendosm,</hi> and the <hi>Gran Prior</hi> of France his brother (both naturall sons to the last King) went to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Angers,</hi> who quickly entred into the league; They of the Religion offer'd her conjunctive forces, which she wav'd, but the Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> presently accepted of them, which made his army swell to 12000. and upwards.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the King sent the Duke of <hi>Montbazon</hi> to invite the Queen Mother to Court, and to assist in Counsell, but she excus'd herself by indisposition of body (though it was only of <hi>mind:</hi>) He sent again the Archbishop of <hi>Sens</hi> unto Her with a second invitation to Court and he would meet her in the way as far as <hi>Orleans,</hi> but she continued still distrustfull, and jealous of some plot upon her, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that</p>

            <p>She inveighs bitterly against the present Favorits how they exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the Kings Tresure, offended most of the Princes, and dispos'd of all offices and honors, making men of mean extraction lately Knights of the Holy Spirit, and excluding ancient Gentlemen of merit; these complaints she couch'd and enlarg'd in two Letters, one to the King himself, the other to the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> which the Court would not open but sent them to the King.</p>
            <p>The discontented Princes grew daily more and more powerfull, so it was high time for the King to get a Horsback, which he did, and march'd first to <hi>Normandy,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> had arm'd, having bin at the Parliament of <hi>Roven,</hi> to tell them that the ground of his grievance, as of the rest of the Princes, was the indirect and violent means that <hi>Luynes</hi> us'd to establish his own authority, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance his monstrous fortune, &amp;c. <hi>Longueville</hi> understanding the King was advancing to <hi>Roven</hi> retir'd to <hi>Diep</hi> with three hundred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who thought to make the Town of <hi>Roven</hi> to side with them, but the Kings presence scared them all away; There the King sate himself in Parliament, and suspended <hi>Longueville</hi> of the Government of that great <hi>Province,</hi> and put also divers of his Complices out of Office; And so having secur'd <hi>Roven,</hi> he went to <hi>Caen</hi> where the <hi>Gran Prior</hi> had put a strong garrison in the Castle to stand for the Princes, <hi>Crequy</hi> had laid a siege to the Castle before the King came, and held it hot play, for the Castle was extremly well fortified both with <hi>bones</hi> and <hi>stones;</hi> The King immediatly upon his arrival sent <hi>Prudent,</hi> whom the <hi>Gran Prior</hi> had plac'd in the said Castle, a summon to render it, <hi>Prudent</hi> refus'd, hereupon there was a Proclamation publish'd, <hi>That whosoever would bring</hi> Prudent <hi>living or dead unto the King, he should have a reward of ten thousand crowns;</hi> This made <hi>Prudent</hi> tremble, and to apprehend some danger within, as well as from without, for the sound of ten thousand crowns made a mighty noise, and might work upon the garrison it self. So he sent to <hi>Crequy</hi> to know truly of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the King was there in person or no, <hi>For if he were, he had rather die twenty deaths then hinder the triumph of his first arms,</hi> so he gave up the Castle without capitulation, and the King pardoned all: some gave advise to raze the Castle, but being built at first to stay and repell the Forces of the <hi>English,</hi> and being fair, large and strong, it was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to stand, for it might be serviceable again against that Nation.</p>
            <p>The report of taking <hi>Caen Castle</hi> added much to the Kings honor, and struck a terror in the Mutineers. He march'd thence to <hi>Mans</hi> and thence towards <hi>Angers</hi> to his Mother, in the way there were six or seven Castles that discharg'd their garrisons, and rang'd themselfs to the Kings obedience. Being at <hi>Mans</hi> there came some Gentlemen to tell him from the Queen Mother that she was ready to conform her self to his Majesties pleasure, and therefore desir'd a Treaty with this proviso, that all the rest who were now in Arms for her assistance might be included in the Articles; The King sent her word, that <hi>as</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:98453:31"/>
               <hi>he distinguish'd her Person from theirs who were now in rebellion against</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> 
               <hi>him, so he would separat her interests from theirs; for he well considered that she was his mother, they but his subjects; qualities so distant, that it was not fitting to confound them, and involve her in the same Treaty.</hi> Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles he was willing to be gracious to all for what was pass'd, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they would incontinently disarm, and implore mercy. <hi>Luynes</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sent her a Complement by the same messenger, <hi>That there was no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire so ardent in him, as to see her again with the King, as well for her own contentment, as for the repose of the Realm;</hi> But notwithstanding this gracious proffer, they stood still in arms in <hi>Angers</hi> where there were eight thousand foot, and one thousand two hundred horse well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and a great confluence of Nobles. <hi>Angers</hi> being a huge vast Town, and the royal Army being but sixteen thousand foot, and one thousand five hundred horse, the Counsell of War determ'd, that it was more advantagious to attaque <hi>Pont de Cé</hi> not far of, then lye down before <hi>Angers;</hi> So <hi>Crequy</hi> was sent with fifteen Bataillons to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, there was a furious fight twixt the <hi>Sons</hi> Forces and the <hi>Mothers;</hi> at last the <hi>Son</hi> prevail'd, and entirely routed the enemy with slaughter of five hundred men; the next day the Castle of <hi>Pont de Cé</hi> rendred it self; the garrison was us'd very favorably, and all the Domestic Officers of the Queen Mother who had born Arms there, were sent unto her for a present.</p>
            <p>There was then a resolution to set upon <hi>Angers,</hi> but the King would not hearken unto it <hi>while his Mother was in the Town;</hi> Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on She sent the Cardinal of <hi>Sourdis,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Lucon</hi> to the King to tell him, <hi>That She threw herself between his arms, to submit her will and all her inclinations to his Commands, beseeching his Majesty that his grace might extend to all those that had assisted her.</hi> The King con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to every thing, pass'd an <hi>Act of Abolition</hi> of all former faults, and the Articles of the Treaty were sent to <hi>Paris</hi> to be verified by the Court of Parliament; So the Son and the Mother had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enterview at <hi>Brissac,</hi> where their actions, port, gesture, words and tears, wrought much upon the affections of all the beholders.</p>
            <p>The King having in lesse then 40. dayes, quell'd this dangerous rebellion which like a Hydra consisted of many heads, his thoughts then reflected upon the Ecclesiastic's of <hi>Bearn,</hi> who <hi>pretended,</hi> and had consequently petition'd often unto him how much they suffer'd by them of the Religion; so he sent the Queen to <hi>Paris,</hi> and he took the road of <hi>Bearn</hi> a frontier place towards Spain, fastning <hi>Navar</hi> to the foot of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Hills; He took Saint <hi>Iohn d' Angeli</hi> in his way, where the Town complain'd of a Cittadell which the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> would have built to keep them in captivitie; He left a new Governor there behind him, and sent to <hi>Espernon</hi> to have a care of the place; thence he went to <hi>Blay</hi> (the key of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>) where he depos'd the Marquis of <hi>Aubeterre</hi> the Governor, and giving him the Truncheon of Marshall, and 100000. crowns for recompence, he put in his place <hi>Brentes</hi> third brother to <hi>Luynes</hi> after Duke of <hi>Luxenburg:</hi> At <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi>

               <hi>Iane d' Albret, Henry</hi> the Greats Mother, first planted the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion in <hi>Bearn,</hi> taking the revenues of the Roman Clergy to maintain the Ministers, she raign'd divers yeers, and her son <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fourth succeeded, who after he was King of France reesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd a few Bishops there, who gave some satisfaction for the time: The present King his son, out of a greater zeale to Rome, would put all things in <hi>statu quo priùs,</hi> and would have the Church lands entirely restor'd, and for the maintenance of the Reformed Ministers he was willing to part with eighty thousand Franks yeerly out of his own revenue: Yet the Counsell of <hi>Pau</hi> would not ratifie his Edict, which Counsell was divided to three opinions.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The first opinion was utterly to reject the Kings Edict, and to detain still the possessions of the Church.</item>
               <item>2. Others thought it was fit to give the King some contentment, but in appearance only, and to verifie the <hi>Edict,</hi> assuring themselfs that it could never be put in execution, it would meet with so many difficulties.</item>
               <item>3. Others thought it best to delay the verification to another time.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The King understanding that they were thus chopping of Logic, and that the <hi>Synod</hi> also which was there then sitting, did mainly resist the verification of his <hi>Edict;</hi> He resolves to go thither himself, though many disswaded him from the journey by reason of the uncouth wayes, the sory lodgings, the waters in some places poyson'd by <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers,</hi> and the scarcity of provision, in the <hi>Lands</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> But none of these reasons could deter the King, therefore he prepares for his voyage, and in the interim he sent a person of quality to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers</hi> to acquaint them with the <hi>Elusory</hi> answers which the <hi>Bearnois</hi> made to his commands, <hi>and therefore he advis'd and requir'd them to have nothing to do in this busines;</hi> They of <hi>Rochell</hi> little regarding what the King said, but undertook the protection of the <hi>Bearnois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King being advanced in his journey neer <hi>Pau,</hi> the Inhabitants sent to know how he would be receiv'd, the King asked if there were ever a Church in the Town, if there were, he would enter as their Soverain, <hi>if not, he would receive no honor in a place where God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty had no House to be honor'd in,</hi> so he entred without any Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; They of the Religion making three parts of the people for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to send Commodities to <hi>Pau</hi> Market during the Kings sojourn there, to constrain him to go away the sooner; so that his train made hard shift to subsist all the while.</p>
            <p>He goes thence to <hi>Navarrenz</hi> seven leagues neerer the hills, a strong tenable place having 45. peeces of Ordnance, and 40. Culverins, the old Governor <hi>Bertrand de Sales</hi> sent the keys of the Town to the King, where he peaceably entred contrary to all expectation; he put in a

new Garrison of French there, and plac'd another Governor, giving<note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> for recompence to the old 60000. Franks: He also caus'd <hi>Masse</hi> to be sung there which had not bin done fifty yeers before; so having set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled all things at <hi>Navarrenx</hi> he return'd to <hi>Pau,</hi> where the great <hi>Church</hi> which they of the Religion had turn'd to a <hi>Temple</hi> was restor'd to the Priests, and two thousand crowns given for satisfaction; In fine ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cast the Church into its old mould, and the Military with the Civill Government into a new, and leaving a competent strength with <hi>La Force</hi> to preserve both, he took post, and came safely and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly to <hi>Paris</hi> in a few dayes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bearnois</hi> made their addresses to the <hi>French</hi> Churches, and exhibited their complaints unto them, and for their justification they alledg'd two reasons. One was a possession of fifty yeers continued without interruption of those revenues the King had <hi>ravish'd</hi> them of. The second was, an Ordinance of the States Generall of <hi>Bearn</hi> confirm'd by a Declaration of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great to that effect.</p>
            <p>The Roman Catholiks answer'd, That for the possession they speak of, it was violent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accompagnied with rebellion and felony; Touching the Assembly of the <hi>States Generall</hi> which they urg'd, it was altogether illegal, because the first and most noble part which was the <hi>Clergy</hi> was excluded by a cruel persecution, and for <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> he was then himself a persecutor of the Catholiks.</p>
            <p>The French Reformed Churches which are neer upon eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, did much resent the usage of the <hi>Bearnois,</hi> thereupon there was a great Assembly held at <hi>Loudun</hi> without the Kings permission, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they resolv'd to assist their brethren of <hi>Bearn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They drew up <hi>Cayers</hi> or papers to present unto the King containing sundry demands. 1. The first, that his Majesty would please to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke his arrest given in favor of the Ecclesiastiks of <hi>Bearn.</hi> 2. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of their Cautionary Towns foure yeers longer, the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now expir'd. 3. They demanded leave to change two Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors which were turn'd Catholiks.</p>
            <p>When these Papers were presented to the King, he sent their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties word by <hi>Condé</hi> and <hi>Luynes</hi> that his will was, <hi>that first of all they should separat the Assembly, and six moneths after their separation they should be favourably answer'd.</hi> They prai'd this promise might be digested in writing to an Act; they were answer'd, <hi>That it was an indecent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory thing for a Monark to treat in that manner with his subjects, as if his word were not sufficient:</hi> The Deputies receiv'd little satisfaction in this, so they returnd to <hi>Loudun</hi> wher the Assembly continued still notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing two Declarations publish'd by the King, wherein they were commanded to separat upon pain of being proclaim'd Traytors.</p>
            <p>They little valu'd the Kings Declarations, but dissolving their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly at <hi>Loudun,</hi> they sent summons up and down to meet at <hi>Rochell,</hi> where in a greater eagernes, and zeal to the Cause then before, they solemnly conven'd, notwithstanding another new Prohibition of the Kings verifi'd by the Court of Parliament in <hi>Paris;</hi> Hereupon the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98453:33"/>
busines was put into deep deliberation at the Counsell of State, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Anno 1620.</note> the King should declare war against the whole body of the <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> or particularly against those that had met at <hi>Rochell:</hi> and the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion took place, for these reasons.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. First, it could not stand with justice to force consciences to quit that beleef which had bin so long tolerated.</item>
               <item>2. Secondly, that declaring a war against the whole body of them of the Religion might bring in <hi>forren</hi> ayd.</item>
               <item>3. Thirdly, that if a war were pronounc'd in generall, many of the Kings best servants would be involv'd therein, and provok'd, as the Duks of <hi>Trimoville, Bovillon, Lesdigueres, Suilly, Chastillon, Brassai, Montgomery, Blamville,</hi> with divers other of his best sort of subjects.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The King in regard his Treasury was much drain'd was loth to<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> plunge himself in a serious war again the <hi>Rochelers,</hi> therefore to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with them, he accorded <hi>a continuation of their cautionary Towns for five yeers longer, notwithstanding that they demanded but foure.</hi> He also gave them leave <hi>to change the Governor of Lectour</hi> Castle, <hi>and to choose a new Counsellor in the Parliament of Paris,</hi> two things they insisted much upon, but they prevail'd little with them unlesse the late Edict of <hi>Bearn</hi> were revok'd: Hereupon the Gran Assembly at <hi>Rochell</hi> rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd it self, and went on more roundly then ever, there were also up and down the Countrey divers other meetings, as Synods, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies, Circles, and demy-circles which conven'd, and consulted.</p>
            <p>They of <hi>Rochell</hi> went higher and higher, <hi>they had a new public seale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made, they establish'd a new Court of Admiralty, and stamp'd new Coines: They made</hi> 47. <hi>Ordinances, which were printed, and commanded to be strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly observed through all the Reformed Churches: They nominated Governors of Provinces, and impos'd taxes at pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King was much incens'd at these traverses, yet nothing could move him to declare war against the whole body of them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that he was offer'd six hundred thousand crowns yearly by the Ecclesiasticks, <hi>viz.</hi> two hundred thousand by the <hi>Pope;</hi> two hundred thousand by the Colledge of <hi>Cardinalls,</hi> and two hundred thousand by the French <hi>Clergy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Force</hi> whom the King had left Governor of <hi>Bearn,</hi> did not put the Kings commands in execution as he expected, therefore the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> was sent thither with an Army, and settled all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Kings pleasure, and made <hi>La Force</hi> quit the Countrey, who was proclaym'd Traytor, and the Marshall of <hi>Themines</hi> put in his place; though afterwards <hi>La Force</hi> recovered his repute with the King, and receiv'd the Truncheon to be Marshall of France, and grew to be a great <hi>Confident.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having now taken a resolution of war against the <hi>Rechel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> intended to make a Lord High Constable of France, thereupon it was offer'd the old Duke <hi>Le'sdigueres provided he would go to Masse,</hi> which he waving, <hi>Luynes</hi> undertook it; which drew much more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon him then formerly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:98453:33"/>The King put out a Declaration that it was not against <hi>Religion,</hi> but<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> against <hi>Rebellion</hi> that he proceeded, therefore he offer'd to take into his protection all those Reformed Churches that would contain themselfs within the bounds of their obedience to him, and not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haere to the Assembly at <hi>Rochell;</hi> which Declaration was verified in Parliament with much solemnity: so he march'd towards the <hi>Loire,</hi> and being neer <hi>Saumur</hi> a Town of the greatest consequence that the Reformed Churches had, he sent to <hi>Monsieur du Plessis Mournay</hi> that he desired to lodge in the Castle that night with his Queen; The old Governor being above eighty yeers of age was so surpriz'd with this Message that it put him to his wits end, for he made full account the King would have lodg'd in the Town, as other Kings had; and as he was consulting what to do with much perplexity, the Guard of <hi>Swisses</hi> were at the Castle gate; so he peaceably let them in, the King fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed presently after, who charming the old man with complement, made him discharge his Garrison; so the Castle and City was secur'd for the King. Yet the Governor which he left in the Castle was a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist,</hi> who was the Count of <hi>Sault,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Crequy's</hi> son.</p>
            <p>The reductiono and assurance of <hi>Saumur</hi> was a mighty advantage to the King for the advance of his present dessein, in regard that <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> for her situation was one of the importantst Towns that they of the Reformed Religion had, in regard it tied <hi>Normandy, Britany, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> and <hi>Mayn,</hi> with <hi>Poitou, Tourain</hi> and other Countreys circumja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, where they were strongest, besides it lay upon the <hi>Loire,</hi> and it was the probablest place to stop the Kings passage, which they ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor'd to doe afterwards at Saint <hi>Iohn d' Angely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>Saumur</hi> the King marched to <hi>Touars</hi> a Town of the Duke of <hi>Trimovillies</hi> where he was receiv'd with all honor and obedience by the Duchesse in the Dukes absence; from thence he pass'd through divers Towns of the Reformed <hi>Religion,</hi> where in some places he chang'd the Governors, so he came to <hi>Moart</hi> where <hi>Paraberre</hi> the old Governor afterward turning <hi>Roman,</hi> entertaind him with all kind of compliance.</p>
            <p>So he found little or no opposition at all till he came to Saint <hi>Iohn d' Angely</hi> where <hi>Soubize</hi> had cast himself in with 1500. men; a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall siege was planted before the Towne. The King had 15000. foot, and 2000. horse, the flower of the Cavalry of France, and <hi>Espernon</hi> came with 4000. foot more of <hi>Gascons</hi> and <hi>Bearnois;</hi> A Herald of Arms was sent to summon <hi>Soubize,</hi> who being let a little in at one of the gates in his rich coat he pronounced alowd these words: <hi>To thee Benjamin of Rohan, Lord of Soubize, I come and command thee in the Kings name my Soverain Lord and thine, to open unto him the gates of this Town, to deliver it unto him as his own, and to go out presently with all those that assist thee, otherwise I declare thee a Rebell and a Traytor against Divine and Humane Majesty in the highest degree, thy Houses and Castles to be raz'd, thy goods confiscated to the King, and I declare thee and all thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity Yeomen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:98453:34"/>
               <hi>Soubize</hi> answer'd, <hi>That he was a most humble servant and subject of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> 
               <hi>Kings, but being there in quality of a Soldier, the execution of the Kings commandment depended on the Assembly of</hi> Rochel, <hi>who had committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the Government of the place;</hi> this he spoak with his hat on, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Herald replied, <hi>Know that neither as Captain, or Soldier, thou oughtst to answer me with thy head cover'd, when I speak to thee in the name of the King thy Soverain Lord and mine.</hi> Then <hi>Haute Fontaine</hi> took the word, saying, <hi>That the Lord</hi> Soubize <hi>having never seen such summons, was excusable.</hi> This Answer and cariage of <hi>Soubize</hi> that he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Assembly, before his royal <hi>Declaration,</hi> nettled the King extremley, so the siege was poursued very eagerly, a mine or two sprung, and a generall Storm appointed, but in the interim there were Deputies sent to Constable <hi>Luynes</hi> to <hi>Treat,</hi> he sent them back with this Answer, that the King did not use to <hi>Treat</hi> with his Subjects: Hereupon they return'd with Commission to implore grace, so the King publish'd a short Proclamation to this effect. <hi>That his Majesty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contented to admit of a Treaty, at the most humble supplication many times reiterated by them which are in the Town of</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. John d'Angely (or <hi>Angerry</hi>) <hi>he was pleas'd to vouchsafe a generall pardon to all, provided they ask it, and swear, never to bear arms again against his service,</hi> &amp;c. So they came out and <hi>Soubize</hi> kneel'd unto the King and promis'd to observe the conditions his Majesty requir'd.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Saint Iohn d' Angely</hi> was yeelded upon Saint <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> day the Patron of the place after fortie daies siege, which was furious and very hot for the time, divers Lords and Gentlemen of quality lost their lives there, the Prince of <hi>Ienvill</hi> was hurt, so was the Duke of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> the Marquis <hi>de la Valette, de Saint Claumont, Crequy,</hi> with divers others; The Cardinal of <hi>Guyse</hi> fell down at the puffe of a Canon bullet which put him in such a burning feavor that he died before the Town, as also the Marshall of <hi>Brissac:</hi> The King commanded a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of Capuchins to be built forthwith, the wals to be raz'd, and commanded it should be call'd no more a <hi>town,</hi> but a <hi>village;</hi> and to be nam'd <hi>Lewis-Bourg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rendition of this town, was seconded with good news from the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and the Count of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> who had taken <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geau,</hi> and <hi>Sancerre,</hi> which with <hi>Saumur,</hi> were all they had upon the <hi>Loire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the King was before <hi>Saint Iohn d' Angely,</hi> a remarkable passage happen'd twixt Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> now Baron of <hi>Cherberry</hi> (then Ambassador for his Majesty of great Britain in France) and the great Favorit and Constable <hi>Luynes:</hi> which was thus. Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> had receiv'd privat instructions from England to mediat a Peace for them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and in case of refusall to use certain menaces; hereupon he coming to the Army, and finding the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the said Town were almost finish'd, he hastned his addresses to the King for an audience: The King referring him to <hi>Luynes,</hi> and desiring that what he had to say might be first imparted unto him, he
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98453:34"/>
went accordingly to <hi>Luynes</hi> lodgings, and deliver'd his Message so,<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> that he reserv'd still the latter part, which was menace, untill he heard how the busines was relish'd; <hi>Luynes</hi> had hid behind the hangings a Gentleman of the <hi>Religion,</hi> who was upon point of turning <hi>Roman,</hi> that being an earwitnes of what had pass'd between the English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador and <hi>Luynes,</hi> he might relate unto them of the <hi>Religion</hi> what little hopes they were to expect from the intercession of the King of England: The Ambassador and <hi>Luynes</hi> having mingled some Spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the language of <hi>Luynes</hi> was very haughty, saying, <hi>What hath your Master to do with our Actions? Why doth he meddle with our affairs?</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> replied. <hi>It is not to you to whom the King my Master owes an account of his Actions, and for Me it is enough to obey Him. In the mean time, I must maintain that the King my Master hath more reason to do what he pleaseth to do, then you have to ask why he doth it; Nevertheles, if you desire me in a gentle fashion, I shall acquaint you further.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Luynes</hi> bowing a little said, <hi>very well;</hi> The Ambassador answer'd. <hi>That it was not on this occasion only, that the King of Great Britain had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd the Peace and prosperity of France, but upon all other occasions when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever any troubles were rais'd, in that Countrey. And this he said was his first Reason. The second was, That when a Peace was settled there, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of France might be better dispos'd to assist the Palatin in the affairs of Germany.</hi> Luynes said, <hi>We will none of your advices.</hi> The Ambassador replied, <hi>That he took that for an Answer, and was sorry only, that the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and good will of the King his Master was not sufficiently understood, and that since 'twas rejected in that maner, he could do no lesse then say, that the King his Master knew well enough what he had to do.</hi> Luynes said, <hi>We are not afraid of you;</hi> The Ambassador (smiling a little) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>If you had said you had not lov'd Us, I should have beleev'd you, and made you another Answer; In the mean while, all I will tell you more is, That We know very well what we have to do. Luynes</hi> hereupon rising a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle from his chaire with a fashion and a countenance much discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, said, <hi>By God if you were not Monsieur l' Ambassadeur, I know very well how I would use you;</hi> The Ambassador herewithall rising also from his chaire said, <hi>That as he was his Majesties of Great Britains Ambassador, so he was also a Gentleman, and that his sword, whereon he laid his hand, should do him reason if he took any offence:</hi> After which <hi>Luynes</hi> replying nothing, the Ambassador went on his way towards the doore, to which when <hi>Luynes</hi> seem'd to accompagny him, the Ambassador told him, <hi>that after such language, there was no occasion to use ceremony,</hi> and so departed, expecting to hear further from him. But no message being brought him from <hi>Luynes,</hi> he did in poursuance of his instructions demand audience of the King at <hi>Cognac,</hi> St. <hi>Iean d' Angely</hi> being now rendred, who granting it, where he did in the same termes, and upon the same motives Mediat a Peace for them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd a far more gentle Answer from the King. The Marshall <hi>de Saint Geran</hi> coming to Sir <hi>Edward Herbert</hi> told him in a friendly maner, <hi>you have offended the Constable, and you are not in a place of surety here,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto

he answer'd, <hi>That he held himself to be in a place of surety, whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> 
               <hi>he had his sword by him.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Luynes</hi> little resenting the affront he receiv'd from Sir <hi>Ed. Herbert,</hi> got <hi>Cadenet</hi> his brother Duke of <hi>Chaune</hi> with a ruffling train of Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, neer upon a hundred, (whereof <hi>there was not one,</hi> as <hi>Cadenet</hi> told King <hi>Iames, but had kild his man in duel</hi>) Ambassadour extraordinary to England a little after, who misreporting the clash 'twixt Sir <hi>Ed. Herbert</hi> and <hi>Luynes,</hi> prevaild so far, that Sir <hi>Ed. Herbert</hi> was presently revok'd, to answer the charge that should be laid against him. In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> that dexterous Courtier was employ'd extraordinary Ambassador to France for accommodating <hi>le mal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendu</hi> which might arise 'twixt the two Crowns; <hi>Carlile</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to inform himself of the truth of the businesse afore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and he could meet with no relation but what <hi>Luynes</hi> had made himself: wherein more affronting and haughty expressions were laid to Sir <hi>Ed. Herberts</hi> charge then had truly pass'd, for though the first provocation came from <hi>Luynes,</hi> yet the Ambassadour kept himself within the bounds both of his instructions and honor; but as my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> was ready to send this mis-information to <hi>England,</hi> the Gentleman formerly spoken of who stood behind the hangings, came to the Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> and said, that he ow'd so much unto truth and honor that he could doe no lesse then vindicat Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>Herbert</hi> from all indiscretion and unworthines, and thereupon related the true circumstances of the businesse. The Earl of <hi>Carlile</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus rectified in the knowledge of the truth, gave account to King <hi>Iames</hi> accordingly, who cleer'd Sir <hi>Ed. Herbert,</hi> and resolv'd to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy him Ambassador to France, whereof he having notice, kneel'd to the King before the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and humbly desired that since the busines was public in both Kingdoms he might in a public way demand reparation of M. <hi>Luynes:</hi> for which purpose he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech'd his Majesty that a Trumpeter if not a Herald might be sent on his part to M. de <hi>Luynes</hi> to tell him <hi>That he had made a false rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the passages before mentioned, and that Sir</hi> Ed. Herbert <hi>would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand reasons of him with sword in hand on that point;</hi> the King answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would take it into consideration. <hi>Luynes</hi> a little after died, and Sir <hi>Edward</hi> was again sent Ambassador to France.</p>
            <p>But to return to our former road, besides those places formerly mentioned, the Towns <hi>Suilly, Merac</hi> and <hi>Caumont</hi> were also taken for the King, but the latter two by the Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> Governor of <hi>Guyen:</hi> All <hi>Poitou</hi> being reduc'd to Royall obedience, and setled, the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to go for <hi>Guyen</hi> to suppresse the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> and <hi>la Force</hi> who were in arms, and had a considerable Army: He left behind the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> with 4000. foot, and 600. horse to beleager <hi>Rochell,</hi> and stop the advenues in the interim. So he advances to <hi>Guyen,</hi> and divers places in the way open'd their gates unto him, till he came to <hi>Clairac,</hi> where he found a tough resistance; He lost before the Town the great Lord of <hi>Thermes,</hi> and sundry persons of quality besides; in
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98453:35"/>
so much that he would give no generall pardon but reserv'd five for<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> death, and there were most pittifully drown'd and kill'd in the Town above 800. whereof there were above 200. Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>The King having reduc'd <hi>Clayrac,</hi> though it cost him dear, his thoughts then reflected upon <hi>Montauban</hi> which after <hi>Rochell</hi> was the prime propugnacle, and principallest Town of security They of the Religion had in the whole Kingdom. There was a Royall sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons sent before, and it was accompanied with a large persuasive Letter from the Duke of <hi>Suilly</hi> (who was one of the chiefest Grandes they had of the Reformed Religion) to induce them to conformitie and obedience; some interpreted the Letter to a good sense, but the populasse, by the instigation of the Ministers, would not hearken to it; This was that Duke of <hi>Suilly</hi> that had bin a Favorit to <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, whom he had reduc'd from a <hi>Roman</hi> to be a <hi>Reformist</hi> when he was King of <hi>Navar</hi> onely, and perswading him to become <hi>Roman</hi> again, the Duke bluntly answer'd; Sir, <hi>You have given me one turn already, you have good luck if you give me any more:</hi> Thereupon the siege began, and the great Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> who had newly come with additionall forces to the King began the first battery and spent 500. Cannon bullets upon them, a breach was made, but with losse of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers men of note amongst the Royallists; the Marquis of <hi>Themines</hi> breath'd there his last: And not long after the brave Duke of <hi>Mayn</hi> himself peeping out of a gabion within his trenches, was shot by a common soldier from the Town; The <hi>Parisians</hi> were much incens'd for the losse of the Duke of <hi>Mayn,</hi> therfore as some of the reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were coming from <hi>Charenton</hi>-Sermon they assaulted them in the way, hurt divers, kil'd some, and going on to <hi>Charenton,</hi> they burnt the Temple there; but a few nights after two great bridges ore the <hi>Seinn</hi> were burnt quite down to the water in the City of <hi>Paris,</hi> and a great store of wealth consum'd, and it was interpreted to be a just judgement from Heaven for burning of <hi>Charenton</hi> Temple.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Angoulesm</hi> was sent to counter-car the forces of the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> who was then in motion in <hi>Guyen,</hi> and <hi>Angoulesm</hi> was so succesfull that he gave him a considerable defeat, by taking the strong Fort of <hi>Fauch,</hi> in defence whereof 400. of the Reformists were slain.</p>
            <p>The contagion rag'd furiously in the Kings Army before <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauban,</hi> and divers persons of quality died of it, amongst others the Archbishop of <hi>Sens</hi> brother to Cardinall <hi>Perron,</hi> and the Bishops of <hi>Valentia, Carcassona,</hi> and <hi>Marseillis,</hi> and <hi>Pierre Matthieu</hi> the Historio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher added to the number of the dead. This, with the approach of Winter caus'd the King to raise his siege from before the Town, having lost above five hundred Noblemen and Gentlemen of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, besides thousands of common souldiers.</p>
            <p>During this pertinacious siege before <hi>Montauban</hi> there was a remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quable thing pass'd, which was this. There was a cunning report rais'd in the Kings Army that <hi>Rochell,</hi> which was then also beleaguer'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:98453:36"/>
by the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guyse,</hi> the first by Land, the<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> other by Sea, was rendred upon composition; this report was made to fly into <hi>Montauban,</hi> which must needs strike a shrewd apprehension of fear into her; they of <hi>Rochell</hi> hearing of it, articled with Master <hi>Hicks</hi> an English Gentleman (now Sir <hi>Ellis Hicks</hi>) who spake the Language perfectly well, that if he would undertake to carry a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Montauban,</hi> he should receive a noble reward; Master <hi>Hicks</hi> undertook it, and passing through the Army that was before <hi>Rochell</hi> came to <hi>Tholouse,</hi> where my Lord of <hi>Carlile</hi> was then Ambassador ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Master <hi>Hicks</hi> meeting with Master <hi>Fairfax</hi> a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tileman (brother to the now Lord <hi>Fairfax</hi>) he did associat much with him; They both went to see the siege before <hi>Montauban,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gentlemen and thought to be of the English <hi>Ambassadors</hi> train, there was little heed taken of them; They got one day between the Kings Trenches and the Town, and <hi>Hicks</hi> being very well mounted told <hi>Fairfax,</hi> If you love your life follow me, so he put spurs to his horse &amp; having showers of shots powr'd after him he came safe to the gates of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and so he deliver'd the intrusted Letter, which brought news in what a good posture <hi>Rochell</hi> was; this so animated the besieged, that the next day they made a sally upon the Kings Forces; and did a notable execution upon them, and a little after the Siege was rais'd; so Master <hi>Hicks</hi> besides the honor of the act had a guerdon equall to the importance of the service, and danger of the attempt; but Master <hi>Fairfax</hi> (who was inscious of the dessein) staying behind and being apprehended, was put to the torture, and a Diaper napkin dipt in boyling water was squeaz'd down his throat, whereof he died: a hard destiny of a most hopefull young Gentleman.</p>
            <p>Within the compasse of this yeer there died <hi>Paul</hi> the Fift, <hi>Philip</hi> the Third of Spain, the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus</hi> in Flanders, <hi>Cosmo de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis</hi> Gran Duke of Toscany, and Cardinall <hi>Bellarmin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> To whom may be added also the Duke of <hi>Luynes</hi> Lord high Constable of France, who died in <hi>Longuetille,</hi> a small Town in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> of the purple feavor; He was one of the greatest Favourits, for so short a time, that ever were in France, since the <hi>Maires</hi> of the Palace from whom Emperours afterwards issued; His Countrey was <hi>Provence,</hi> and he was a Gentleman by descent though of a petty extraction; In the last Kings time he was preferd to be one of his Pages, who finding him a good waytor, allowed him three hundred crowns <hi>per an.</hi> which he husbanded so frugally, that he maintain'd himself and his two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in passable good fashion. The King observing that, doubled his pension, and taking notice that he was a serviceable instrument, and apt to please, he thought him fit to be about his son (the <hi>Dauphin</hi>) in whose service he had continued above 15. yeers, &amp; by a singular dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie he had in <hi>Faulconry</hi> he gain'd so far upon the young Kings affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that he <hi>soard</hi> to that high pitch of Honor. He was a man of a passable understanding, of a mild comportment, humble and debon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair to all suters, but he <hi>was too open in his counsels and desseins;</hi> he had
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:98453:36"/>
about him good solid heads who prescrib'd unto him rules of policy,<note place="margin">Anno 1621.</note> by whose compasse he steer'd his cours; He came at last to that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent altitude, that he seem'd to have surmounted all reaches of envie, and made all hopes of supplanting him frustrat, both by the constant strength of the Kings favor, and the powerfull alliances he had got for himself, and his two brothers: He married the Duke of <hi>Montbazons</hi> daughter; his second brother <hi>Cadenet</hi> the Heiresse of <hi>Pequigny</hi> with whom he had 9000. pound lands a yeer: His third bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther married the Heiresse of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> of which House there have bin five Emperors; so that the three Brothers with their alliances were able to counterbalance any one Faction in France: He left two living Monuments of his greatnes behind him, which were his two brothers, one whereof was <hi>Marshall,</hi> but both of them Dukes and Peers of France.</p>
            <p>The repulse before <hi>Montauban,</hi> and the death of <hi>Luynes</hi> gave some matter of resentment to the King for the present, but he quickly pass'd it over: And having settled matters to his best advantage in <hi>Guyen,</hi> he return'd to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and so came to keep his Christmas at <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spring following he gets a horseback again, and it was high time for him, in regard there was a generall insurrection of them of the Religion both in <hi>Dauphiné, Languedoc, Guyen</hi> and <hi>Poitou.</hi> In the last <hi>Soubize</hi> had got a considerable army of 7000. foot, and 600. horse, and 9. Pieces of Ordnance.</p>
            <p>The King parts from <hi>Paris</hi> upon <hi>Palm</hi>-Sunday which was cryed up to be a good augury that he would return with the <hi>Palm</hi> the Emblem of victory; so marching to <hi>Poitou,</hi> he found out <hi>Soubize</hi> entrench'd in certain little Islands call'd <hi>Rie &amp; Perier:</hi> upon the Kings approach <hi>Soubize</hi> abandons the place, and with a few Horse got along the sands to <hi>Rochell;</hi> the whole Army being thus left headlesse, in a fearfull consternation all began to flie, and some thought to save themselfs through the Marasse, where many hundreds miserably perished, those that stayed behind the King were pardon'd, only 13. were hang'd for example, and they were some of those that had taken an oath at Saint <hi>Iohn d' Angely</hi> never to bear arms against the King; there were kill'd and drown'd in all above two thousand Reformists in this rencounter.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>Royan</hi> was rendred after a pertinacious siege; and a great slaughter on both sides; The King thence marcheth to <hi>Guyen,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Elbaeuf</hi> had done divers exploits; Insomuch that in a short time all the towns of <hi>Guyen</hi> were reduc'd to the King except <hi>Montauban;</hi> amongst others there were three towns call'd <hi>Tonnenx</hi> knotted one in another, which were utterly extinguish'd, with prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition for any ever to build there again. Being in <hi>Carcassona</hi> upon his March to <hi>Montpellier,</hi> there were two signall things done, <hi>Soubize</hi> was proclaim'd Traitor for flying to England to sollicit for forrein ayd; And old <hi>Lesdeguiers,</hi> was made Constable of France; <hi>Chastillon</hi> also a little after came to be Marshall for giving up <hi>Aiguemortes;</hi> the first
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98453:37"/>
had that high Office, provided he would go to <hi>Masso,</hi> which he did; but<note place="margin">Anno 1622.</note> the last persisted still in his Religion.</p>
            <p>The King appear'd now in Person before <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and a great deal of earth was thrown up by his Pioners before he came, the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being almost finish'd, there were divers furious Sallies from within<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Assaults from without happen'd in this Siege, and many gallant Gentlemen lost, amongst others the young Duke of <hi>Fronsack</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic son to the <hi>Count of Saint Paul,</hi> was condol'd with much regret. And the King was like to have had the same fortune there, which he had before <hi>Montauban,</hi> had not the Duke of <hi>Vendosme</hi> come with a timely supply of five thousand fresh combatants.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and Constable <hi>Lesdiguieres,</hi> old in yeers and new in Office, had privat meetings; the former going into the Town, carried the busines with that power, and wrought so far upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the Inhabitants of <hi>Montpellier,</hi> that he made them inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to let in the King, provided that their fortifications might continue entire, and that they might be exempt from <hi>Cittadel, Governor or Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison,</hi> upon such termes, they with the whole body of the <hi>Religion</hi> would conform themselfs to a generall Peace, which was a little after proclaim'd before <hi>Montpellier</hi> in form of an <hi>Edict,</hi> to this effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Edict of Nants, with the secret Articles thereunto annexed should be inviolably kept, as under the raign of</hi> Henry <hi>the Great; That the exercise of the Catholic Roman Religion should be reestablish'd where it hath bin interrupted, and the Ecclesiasticks restor'd to all their goods; That like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they of the Reformed Religion should exercise it freely in all those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where it was practis'd before these commotions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That all new fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should be demolish'd, specially in the Islands of</hi> Re &amp; Oleron, <hi>and the old wals only stand;</hi> That all Assemblies particular and generall be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to them of the p: Reformed Religion for the futur, unlesse it be upon affairs purely Ecclesiastic, under pain of the crime of Treason; That an abolition be granted of every thing pass'd except of those execrable cases reserv'd by the Article 86. of the Edict of <hi>Nants;</hi> That Catholicks as well as Reformists be chosen promiscuously in civill Offices, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This being done, the Deputies of the Reformed Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to attend the King, they were made to stoop at the entrance of the Kings lodging, and afterward having first desir'd pardon, they presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Keys of the Town unto him; So the next day he entred the Town, and having settled all things thereabouts, the King went to <hi>Provence,</hi> and so to <hi>Avignon</hi> the Popes Town, where the old Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> came to visit him; Thence he returns to <hi>Lyon,</hi> where he found the two Queens; The Prince and Princesse of <hi>Savoy</hi> came also thither to attend him. <hi>Geneva</hi> likewise sent thither her Deputies, who made an Oration to the King upon their knees all the while. From <hi>Lyon</hi> He came triumphantly to <hi>Paris</hi> to begin the new yeer, 1623. in Peace, after such a long Martial progres.</p>
            <p>While the King was himself in person up and down <hi>Poitou</hi> and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98453:37"/>
               <hi>Guyen</hi> to represse them of the <hi>Religion;</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guyse</hi> by Sea,<note place="margin">Anno 1623.</note> (who had an Auxiliary Fleet of eight of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Ships joyn'd with him for which the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was afterwards questioned in Parliament) and the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> by Land did pinch the <hi>Rochellers; Soissons</hi> rais'd up a strong tenable bulwark, which he call'd <hi>Lewis-fort,</hi> that commanded the Chanell Sea-ward, and gave the law by Land.</p>
            <p>The generall Pacification published at <hi>Montpellier</hi> was but a peece slightly plaister'd over, it was far from searching the bottom, from cleansing and curing the wound, for many discontents raign'd still amongst them of the Religion, they complain'd that <hi>Lewis-fort</hi> before <hi>Rochell</hi> was not demolish'd being a new fortification, and they spoak of other grievances; the King on the other side com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, they had not reestablish'd the Ecclesiasticks in their Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive possessions, nor chosen Catholicks in Civill Offices.</p>
            <p>This being profoundly debated in the Counsell of State, some, as the Church-men, and Nobles, gave their opinion, that, rather then to be in such continuall trances and alarms, his Majesty should with his main entire strength apply himself to extinguish both the <hi>Rebellion</hi> and the <hi>Heresie</hi> (as they term'd it) totally together, as the effect with the cause; because his Majesty was not in case to do any thing abroad, while they were left so strong at home, for as one of the Counsellors said, <hi>He that hath theeves to his neighbours dares not goe far from home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Others were of a contrary opinion, that it was very requisit there should be a generall peace now 'twixt the French people, because of the businesse of the <hi>Valtolin,</hi> where the Spaniard had a purpose to block out France in all places towards Italy, which was very neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be prevented, so that it was not fit to enfeeble France at this time by attempting to extinguish them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> and to plunge the whole Countrey in an intestine war, <hi>for it was as if one would cut off his left hand with the right.</hi> This last counsell took more with the King, and so he left no way unessayed to reunite all his subjects: Hereupon to content the <hi>Reformists,</hi> he caus'd their <hi>Temples to be reedified, he appointed</hi> 60000. <hi>Franks for the payment of their Ministers, and permitted them to call a Synod at</hi> Charenton, with divers other acts of compliance; provided, that on their part they should <hi>entertain no strangers for preachers, nor admit Ministers into politic Assemblies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In these difficulties and anxious traverses of things, the King made<note place="margin">Anno 1624.</note> the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> his principall <hi>Minister of State, chiefe of his Counsell, and Director generall under his authority in the government of the State.</hi> He made this election by the advice of the Queen Mother principally, nor was it an improper choice, for the party had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of high abilities in him, answerable to that transcendent trust: and he prov'd, as will appear by the sequele of things, a <hi>succesfull</hi> Instrument; though many doubt whether his Counsel was as <hi>succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi> to <hi>France,</hi> as it was <hi>fatall</hi> to the rest of <hi>Christendom,</hi> which he hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98453:38"/>
plung'd in an eternall war: touching this we leave the Ingenious<note place="margin">Anno 1624.</note> Reader a freedom of censure, according as his judgement shall be gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by an unpartiall, and unbiass'd relation of matters, as they ly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in the ensuing part of this story.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> had two causes of perpetuall apprehensions of fear, one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, th'other internal; The still growing <hi>greatnesse</hi> of Spain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and They of the <hi>Religion</hi> within doors, which were made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent use of by any discontented Princes upon all occasions; and were cryed up by the Jesuits to be as Matches to set France on fire at any time; Therefore the first gran dessein that he projected with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was to clip their wings, and diminish their strength, by dismant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Cautionary Towns, and making them dismisse their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons: The Cardinal knew the King his Master did not affect them since the Treaty at <hi>Lodun,</hi> wherein they forc'd him to put another interpretation upon his Coronation Oth, then his conscience did dictat unto him, or the Prelat, who administred it unto him, meant; which appear'd in a churlish answer that he gave them not long after when he was solicited to prolong the terme of holding their Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary Towns as <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> his father had done. Which answer was, <hi>That what grace the first did shew you, was out of fear, what my father did, was out of love; but I would have you know, that I neither fear you nor love you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To compasse that great work of taking from them their Garrison Towns, it was thought very expedient to secure forren Princes from assisting them, specially <hi>England,</hi> and the united <hi>Provinces;</hi> Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>latter,</hi> they were charm'd with money; for in a fresh Treaty, the King accorded them a million of Franks, and six hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Franks every one of the two yeers next ensuing; which they were to re-inburse the next two yeers that they should conclude a peace or truce with Spain. The Holland-Ambassadors who were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this Treatie did promise the King that there should be liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

of conscience given the Catholiks at his Majesties request; That<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> the States should associat the French with them in the commerce of the <hi>Indies,</hi> give them some choice ports for traffic, and repaire some depraedations they had made by sea; but the money being once got, there was little care taken to perform these promises; which were no more then parol engagements or rather complements; whereupon an Ambassador was expressely sent to complain hereof, but he effected little.</p>
            <p>To secure <hi>England</hi> from succouring Them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> the first overture that the Erl of <hi>Holland</hi> made for an alliance was yeelded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; to whom the Erl of <hi>Carlile</hi> was sent in joynt commission to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it; <hi>The King told them, that he took it for an honour, that they sought his sister for the sole sonne of so illustrious a King his neighbour and Allie; onely he desir'd that he might send to Rome to have the Popes consent for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter satisfaction of his conscience,</hi> and in the mean time the English Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors might send for a more plenary power to England; so in lesse then the revolution of <hi>nine moons</hi> this great businesse was propos'd, poursued and perfected, whereas the <hi>Sun</hi> ran his carreer through the <hi>Zodiac ten</hi> times before that Spain could come to any point of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; This may serve to shew the difference twixt the two Nations, the <hi>leaden</hi> heel'd pace of the one, and the <hi>quicksilver'd</hi> motions of the other; it shewes also how the French is more round and frank in his proceedings, not so full of scruples, reservations and jealousies as the Spaniard: And one reason that the Statists of the time alledg'd why <hi>Spain</hi> amus'd the English, and protracted the Treaty of the Match so long, was, that all the daughters of France might be first married to prevent an alliance 'twixt England and her.</p>
            <p>There was a concurrence of many things that favor'd the effecting and expediting of this alliance: some previous Offices and Letters of invitation from France, wherein there were strains of extraordinary endearments, wherewith the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> corresponded also in an unusuall stile, as appears by this Letter following.</p>

Articles, with a penalty of four hundred thousand crowns upon either of the two Kings which should infringe any of them. Besides these, there were some privat Articles accorded in favour of the Roman Catholiks in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> but far from the latitude of a public Toleration.</item>

            <p>Upon the ending of this great Treaty with France <hi>Iames</hi> the First of <hi>England,</hi> and Sixth of <hi>Scotland</hi> ended his life in his Palace at Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balds; A little before, he broak out into a very passionate Speech to his Lords of the Counsel of the King of France; saying, <hi>My Lords, the King of France hath writ unto me that he is so far my friend, that if ever I have need of him, he will render me Offices in Person whensoever I shall desire him; Truly, he hath gain'd upon me more then any of his Predecessors, and he may beleeve me, that in any thing that shall concern him I will employ not only my peoples lifes, but mine own; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever of his subjects shall rise against him either Catholiks or others, shall find me a party for him: 'Tis true, if he be provok'd to infringe his Edicts, I shall impart as much as in me lies, by counsell and advice to prevent the inconveniences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then falling upon the perfections of Madame <hi>Henriette Marie,</hi> he said pleasantly, <hi>When she is come over I will denounce war against her, because she would not read my Letter, nor my sons, as I understand, before she had first receiv'd command from the Queen her Mother; yet I have cause to thank her, because that after she had perus'd them, she put mine in her cushionet, and the other in her bosome, intimating thereby that she would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon me (for counsell) and lodg my son in her heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>King <hi>Iame's</hi> death retarded a while the proceedings of the Match, for things were at a stand till his Exequies were pass'd, which were perform'd with a Magnificence sutable to so great a King.</p>
            <p>This Ceremony being ended a procuration was sent the Duke of <hi>Cheureuse</hi> from his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> to be contracted unto the Lady <hi>Henriette</hi> and then to marry her in his name, which was done with extraordinary celebrity, the one in the <hi>Louure,</hi> the last in the great Church of <hi>Paris</hi> by the ministery of the Cardinall <hi>Rochefaucaud;</hi> a little before there was a clash twixt him and the Bishop of <hi>Paris,</hi> who urg'd, it was his right to officiat in his own Church, but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal being a Prince of the Church Universall, being also <hi>gran Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner which makes him chief Clark of the Court,</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who had now the greatest stroak in the State, favoring his own <hi>habit</hi> and the <hi>Hat</hi> more then the <hi>Mitre,</hi> the Cardinal carried the day: This solemnity was perform'd to the very height of greatnes and splendor; and such was the bravery of the <hi>English</hi> Ambassadors the Earls of <hi>Carlile</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> that they seem'd to outshine the French that day in their own Sphere; One half of the dowry had bin delivered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon the Contract, which was in all, as was said before, eight hundred thousand crowns, and it was more then the eldest Sister had
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98453:40"/>
by two hundred thousand crowns, and double as much as the second<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> had, the one having but six hundred thousand, the other but foure hundred thousand crowns to their portions.</p>
            <p>The Contract and Mariage being thus finish'd, the Duke of <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingham</hi> came a fortnight after with admired gallantry, to demand the Queen of Great <hi>Britain</hi> for the King his Master, and to attend, and conduct her over to <hi>England.</hi> The Queen Mother accompagnied her as far as <hi>Amiens,</hi> Monsieur her Brother to <hi>Bullen,</hi> whence a Fleet of twenty Galeons Royall transported her to <hi>Dover.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the eighth Nuptiall conjunction of the <hi>Rose</hi> and <hi>Flower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluce</hi> that hath happend 'twixt England and France.</p>
            <p>The first was in the yeer 900. 'twixt <hi>Charles</hi> the First of France, and the Lady <hi>Ogine</hi> daughter to <hi>Edward the old</hi> King of England, 120. yeers before the Norman conquest.</p>
            <p>The second twixt <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of England, and <hi>Margaret</hi> daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Seventh of France.</p>
            <p>The third was between <hi>Edward</hi> the First of England, and the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Hardy</hi> of France.</p>
            <p>The fourth 'twixt <hi>Edward</hi> the Second of England, and <hi>Isabel</hi> daughter to <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Faire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fifth was 'twixt <hi>Richard</hi> the Second of England, and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> daughter to <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth.</p>
            <p>The sixth 'twixt <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth of England, and <hi>Catherin</hi> daughter also to <hi>Charles</hi> the Sixth of France.</p>
            <p>The seventh was 'twixt <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth of France, and <hi>Mary</hi> daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh of England.</p>
            <p>The eighth was this 'twixt <hi>Charles Stuard</hi> Prince of Wales, and <hi>Henriette Marie</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> youngest daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great:</hi> so in these eight Matches England hath had six daughters of France, and France two of Englands.</p>
            <p>As soon as this great Nuptiall pompe was pass'd, there came ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings that <hi>Soubize</hi> upon a new discontent of them of the Religion, had a great Fleet of ships at Sea, and surpriz'd the Port of <hi>Blauet</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> which is a faire and large Haven deposited to the Spaniard in time of the Ligue, and restored to <hi>Henry</hi> the Great at the peace at <hi>Vervins; Soubize</hi> enterd the Haven with eleven Sayle of men of War, and took and carried away six great ships whereof some belong'd to the Duke of <hi>Nevers.</hi> This rendred them of the Religion powerfull at Sea, and because their Ships might have choise of harbors, they seiz'd upon the Islands of <hi>Re,</hi> and <hi>Oleron</hi> where they began to fortifie. <hi>Soubize</hi> sayles up the <hi>Garond</hi> towards <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with a Fleet of seventy sayles of all sort which made him Master of the Sea, and landing a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of land forces at the land of <hi>Medoc,</hi> they of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> joyning with <hi>Toiras</hi> sent him a shipboard again with losse, and so he return'd to <hi>Rochell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little after he sets out to Sea again, and takes divers prises, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely interrupting all traffic on those Coasts; Hereupon the King
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98453:41"/>
sent to the <hi>Hollander</hi> to hyre twenty Sayle of men of War, according<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> to the late Treaty; which were accordingly sent him under Admirall <hi>Hauthain;</hi> These joyning with another Fleet of the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> made a considerable naval power; <hi>Monmorency</hi> was very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to set upon <hi>Soubize</hi> and the <hi>Rochell</hi> Fleet, but he found the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> bacward and cold, being charm'd by Letters and a Remonstance annexed unto it sent to <hi>Hauthain</hi> by two French Ministers, and two Dutch Merchants from <hi>Rochell,</hi> wherein they made piteous complaint that the King had performed little or nothing at all of the Treaty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Montpellier,</hi> and that the utter ruine of the whole body of the Religion (which was the same with that of <hi>Holland</hi>) was intended, therefore they did efflagitat, and conjure the said Admiral <hi>Hauthain</hi> to lay his hand on his heart and conscience, and not to contribute to so damnable a dessein.</p>
            <p>This Remonstrance wrought much upon <hi>Hauthain</hi> and <hi>Dorp</hi> his Vice-Admiral, in so much that he publiquely declar'd unto the Duke of <hi>Monmorency</hi> that he had Commission in expresse termes from his Masters the States, to reduce Monsieur <hi>Soubize</hi> to his duty, either by <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>force;</hi> that he understood how he was ready to conforme himself to the first, and to that effect he and his Brother the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> with other Towns of their party, had Deputies employed to the King to desire Peace which was in a good forwardnes; therefore it was needlesse to force them to their duty, which were willing to do it of their own motion.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Hollanders</hi> refus'd to fight, yet the <hi>Rochell</hi> fleet not fully knowing their intention fell unwares upon them and burnt their Vice-Admirall, but attempting to boord some French, they were repuls'd with the losse of three hundred men, and four Barks full of hurt men: this nettled <hi>Hans,</hi> &amp; afterwards seriously he joyn'd with the French Royall Fleet, which had receiv'd an addition of seven English Ships under the command of Chevalier <hi>de Ris,</hi> and twenty two more under the Marquis of <hi>Royan;</hi> so that the whole number coming to sixty six sayles, they divided themselfs to three Squadrons: In the first was <hi>Monmorency</hi> and <hi>Hauthain; Dorp</hi> commanded the second, and the third was under <hi>Manty Monmorency's</hi> Vice-Admiral: <hi>Soubize</hi> had got into the Isle of <hi>Ré</hi> where he had intrench'd himself, but a considerable Army of the Kings landing there, there were divers fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bloudy skirmishes, wherein there fell on <hi>Soubizes</hi> side above eight hundred; and so many more drown'd in flight: The Royallists also lost there a great number, but they made themselfs Masters of the Island; <hi>Soubize</hi> got away in a Shallop, and (as the enemy gave out) left his hat and sword behind him, so he went to England.</p>
            <p>There was also a great Sea fight neer <hi>la fosse de loy'e</hi> where the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allists took nine ships, burnt one, and attempting to boord their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, call'd the <hi>Virgin,</hi> and being grappled with her, all that were upon the upper deck being kill'd, they who had got under hatches desperatly put fire in the Gunpowder, and blew her up with three
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:98453:41"/>
hundred soules in her, whose members floted afterwards up and<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> down the waves, a piteous and horrid spectacle to see: three of the Kings ships being grappled with her were also burnt. The Duke of <hi>Monmorency,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Ré</hi> being already reduc'd, went then to <hi>Oleron</hi> which he took and secur'd for the King.</p>
            <p>While these fearfull traverses of war happen'd before <hi>Rochell,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was very busie in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> and entertain'd a Treaty with the Spaniard, but <hi>Camredon</hi> his Agent was surpriz'd, and had his head chopt off at <hi>Tholous.</hi> Constable <hi>Lesdigueres</hi> was upon point of passing the <hi>Alps</hi> with an Army at this time to <hi>Italy;</hi> but the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Languedoc</hi> were such that he was diverted, and commanded to march thither against the Duke of <hi>Rohan;</hi> The King endevouring to win <hi>Rohan</hi> by acts of grace offer'd him a prime command in the Army that was to go for Italy against the Spaniard, and his brother <hi>Soubize</hi> the command of ten Galeons, but the motion was not hearken'd unto. <hi>Espernon</hi> and <hi>Themines</hi> did divers exploits up and down <hi>Languedoc</hi> this yeer, specially before <hi>Montauban,</hi> where they of the Town lost eight hundred men in two sallys they had made.</p>
            <p>They of the Religion being now much quail'd by divers ill succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses they had receiv'd by Sea and Land, had recourse to the King with a submissive querulous Remonstrance of their miseries. He that brought it seem'd to reproach the Rebellion in general, but he excus'd the <hi>Rochellers,</hi> declaring <hi>ore tenus</hi> to the King, <hi>How they were bereft of their Priviledges, how their Walls were batter'd, their Vines pluck'd up, how their Tillage ceas'd, and their Traffic was ruin'd; And while others of his Majesties subjects have slept in their beds under the public faith of peace, they have watch'd upon his walls to repell the injuries of a particular war; In fine this usage being capable to make wild the gentlest spirits hath made them apprehend the blow of their utter ruine. It is true, that they had bin forc'd to put the law of necessitie in practise, which they do not alledge to justifie themselfs, they have rather words of execration against those subjects which dare raise armes in Prejudice of their Princes under what pretext whatsoever; but only to make his Majesty see that they have held it necessary to do well, in doing ill, and that they are more worthy of pity then pain: Thus they accus'd themselfs, and were come hither to crave pardon of his Majesty: whom they adjur'd and beseech'd by his Royall naturall goodnes, and by the glory their ramparts have gain'd to have conserv'd his Majesty in the reignes of</hi> Henry <hi>the Great, to restore them to liberty, and to forget their faults, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this Petition the King intended to shew them some Grace, but with this Proviso, to separate the <hi>Rochellers</hi> from the conditions he vouchsafed to the whole body of the Religion that they might be the more humbled, and so to take from them the presumption they us'd to attribut to themselfs to have a kind of authority over the rest, and from the other Churches the confidence and repute they had of them; so by reiteration of divers supplications they obtain'd at last these conditions. 1. That the Counsel and Government of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98453:42"/>
               <hi>Rochell</hi> be put in the hands of the body of the Town as it was 1610.<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> 2. That they receive an Overseer of Justice, to hinder dissensions and factions. 3. That all new Bastions and Fortifications be demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, and that she be reduc'd to her ancient circuit, 1560. 4. That his Majesty shall be receiv'd into the Town with all due respect and reverence whensoever he please. 5. That they of the Town shall not keep any Vessels of War in their Haven, and those that go abroad in course and to traffic shall ask leave of the Lord Admiral. 6. That the goods appertaining to Ecclesiastics, be restor'd, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These being sent to <hi>Rochell, Montauban, Castres</hi> and other places were accepted, and a public Act pass'd; <hi>That the foresaid conditions were taken as a most speciall testimony of his Majesties clemence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There followed a great calm in France after this, and all forces were withdrawn from before <hi>Rochell,</hi> except the Garrison in <hi>Lewis Fort.</hi> So the King had now opportunity to look abroad, and the first place he cast his eye upon was the <hi>Valtolin,</hi> and the <hi>Grisons,</hi> which border up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Milan:</hi> The King of Spain and the Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> his Cousin german, were call'd in there to preserve the Catholicks from the oppression of the Protestants who were powerfull, so coming to the said assistance they took divers old forts and erected new which they secur'd with Garrison: The Spaniard hereby had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary advantage to convey any forces from Italy to Germany upon all occasions.</p>
            <p>The Protestant <hi>Grisons</hi> had recourse to the King of France, and he undertook their protection (according to an old league in <hi>Lewis</hi> the twelfth his time) not as much out of any great good will he bore them, but to deprive the Spaniard of that advantage, therefore he sent the Marquis of <hi>Caeuures</hi> Ambassadour to the Cantons of <hi>Suisse</hi> that were Allies to France to exhort them to defend the <hi>Valtolins. Caeuures</hi> from Ambassadour was made Generall of an Army a while after, and the Venetians with the Duke of Savoy ligu'd with him; He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd divers exploits there, so that the Truncheon of Marshall was sent him; The Pope interpos'd also in this busines, and had Forces there, and there were sundry skirmishes fought; The Spaniard told the Pope lowdly, <hi>That he came thither to conquer Heretiques, and the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he had taken from them were by consequence justly acquir'd, and so might be justly kept, howsoever it was reason he should hold them untill his charges were reimbours'd:</hi> Hereupon Cardinal <hi>Barberin</hi> was sent to France to accommode things, but little could be done for that time.</p>
            <p>This War of the <hi>Valtolins</hi> begot another twixt the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> the principall motive whereof was to divert the Spaniard from the Conquest of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> Yet the Savoyard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that the Genois usurped divers places from him, that they had offer'd him some indignities, in defacing and vilifying his picture; whereby they <hi>imitated the Leopard who by the naturall hatred he beares to man useth to teare his image with his ongles and teeth, when he cannot exercise his fury upon his body.</hi> The old Constable <hi>Lesdiguieres</hi>

notwithstanding that he had one foot in the grave, yet it seems he had<note place="margin">Anno 1625.</note> an ambition to die in the field, therefore he made earnest instances to the King, that he would be pleas'd to employ him against the <hi>Genois;</hi> Hereupon he clammer'd over the Alpes to <hi>Piemont,</hi> where he with the Duke of Savoy made an Army of twentie five thousand foot, and four thousand horse, which they powr'd into the territories of <hi>Genoa;</hi> The Constable with <hi>Crequy</hi> his son in law had the Vantgard; The Duke with the Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> seconded, and they march'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall roads; The French took <hi>Capriata</hi> which was taken by Storm; and all were put to the sword and plunder: the inhumanitie whcih the Souldiers exercis'd upon the women, and maides rais'd an ill odor of the French in <hi>Italy;</hi> He took divers other places; And the Duke of Savoy on the other side rendred himself Master of sundry strong holds; In the interim there were three Spanish vessels which sayling from <hi>Barcelona</hi> to <hi>Genoa,</hi> were by distresse of weather forc'd upon the Coasts of <hi>Marseilles,</hi> and being out of any Port of commerce they were seiz'd upon by the Duke of <hi>Guyse,</hi> hereupon the <hi>Genois</hi> made a loud complaint in <hi>Madrid,</hi> and the King of Spain resented it so much, that a Proclamation issued out to Arrest all French vessels that were in any haven of Spain, and also to seize upon all the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants goods; and it was thought there were neer upon two hundred thousand French then dwelling or trading in Spain, and eighteen thousand in Madrid it self of all sorts of Marchants and Pedlers. In correspondence to this; The French King publish'd a Declaration wherein he interdicted all commerce to Spain.</p>
            <p>The violent progresse of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> Army against Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa awaked all the Princes of Italy; thereupon the King of Spain armes mainly, in <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Naples.</hi> The Emperour also sent a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of horse and foot, and all conjoyn'd under the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> who was made Generall by Land, and the Marquis of <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacruz</hi> came with twentie two gallies, and five galeons by Sea with four thousand combatants from <hi>Sicilie</hi> to secure the sea of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who had eighteen gallies besides in cours, and ten thousand men by Land; upon the appearance of this great Army, most of those places which had rendred themselfs to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy,</hi> open'd their gates to the Spanish army at first approach; They ravag'd the countrey of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat up and down, and came thence before <hi>Ast</hi> a considerable fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire town of <hi>Piemont.</hi> Yet though there were five or six armies in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Sommer in <hi>Italy,</hi> there was no battail fought, but only sieges, and leagers, sallies and skirmishes; The approach of Winter brought a suspension of armes; afterwards a Treaty was appointed at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and twentie Articles interchangeably accorded unto: so the War ended, and a Peace was renew'd twixt all Parties.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was neither himself, nor by his Ambassador or<note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note> Deputy present at this Treaty, which made him complain highly of the King of France, taxing him with infraction of Faith, and of the late Confederation between them: thereupon the King sent Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98453:43"/>
               <hi>Bullion</hi> to him in qualitie of Ambassador to make an Apologie,<note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note> that his Highnes should <hi>not impute this to ill faith, or any disrespect of him, or to any particular advantage his Majesty hop'd to receive thereby for himself; therefore his Highnes should not except at the light omission of complements which had more of exterior apparance, then sincerity. Bullion</hi> having notice that the Duke would give him a solemn open audience in the presence of most of his Lords and Counsell, prepared himself accordingly; and being come into the roome, the little Duke began to speak very high language, thereupon <hi>Bullion</hi> told him in his eare, <hi>That he perceav'd his Highnes to be mov'd, therefore he pray'd him (not as an Ambassador, but as a privat man and his servant) to speak of so puissant and illustrious a Monark with that moderation, respect and reservednes, that his Majesty might not be offended, and if his Highnes thought to satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by words of advantage, nothing would remain unto him but repentance so to suffer himself to be transported by a disordred passion: For the main businesse, the King having obtain'd by the Treaty at</hi> Monson <hi>all that he and his Allies could hope for if they had gain'd a battaile, as also the liberty of the</hi> Grisons <hi>and the</hi> Valtolines, <hi>his Confederates ought not to take offence if he as the</hi> Eldest, <hi>had treated himself alone for his</hi> Cadets, <hi>a title which they had reason to esteeme for honorable: Yet if notwithstanding these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations his Highnes desir'd to have satisfaction in a stricter way he would undertake his Majesty should make him amends.</hi> In the interim he wish'd his Highnes to think upon any thing wherein his most Christian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty might be advantageous unto him.</p>
            <p>The Duke being calm'd by these words, answer'd, that <hi>he thought upon Royalty, and if his Majesty would approve of his design (being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready well assured of the</hi> Popes <hi>good will) he car'd not much for other Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentats, and he would be contented to be treated by the King, in the same manner as the Kings of France were us'd to treat the Kings of</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Navarr: By <hi>Royalty</hi> he meant the Kingdome of <hi>Cypres,</hi> which title the Ambassador told him could not be had without distasting the Republique of <hi>Venice,</hi> (whose adoptif son he was) and whereas he pretended some places in <hi>Toscany,</hi> that could not be done without displeasing the Queen Mother.</p>
            <p>The King having dispos'd already of his 3. Sisters, began to think on a Match for Monsieur his Brother; now it is the style of France to call the Kings sole Brother <hi>Monsieur</hi> without any further addition, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him from others; <hi>Marie of Bourbon</hi> daughter to the Duke of <hi>Monpensier</hi> was thought to be a fit wife for him; hereupon the King mov'd it unto him, but he desir'd time to consider of it, because it was a business of the greatest consequence that possibly could import him, <hi>for a wife is the best or worst fortune that can befall a man in the whole cours of his life:</hi> There were some that whisper'd him in the eare to disswade him from the said Match, 'mongst others the Marshall of <hi>Ornano</hi> his Governor, who told him, That if he maried in France, all his Means, Credit and Fortune would be bounded there, whereas if he maried some forren Princesse, he might have some support, and a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98453:43"/>
place to retire unto abroad upon hard usage at home, which would<note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note> make him better esteem'd.</p>
            <p>This being brought to the Kings eare, <hi>Ornano</hi> with divers other were taken out of their beds in the dead of night, and clap'd in the Bastile; hereupon <hi>Monsieur</hi> went to the Chancelor <hi>d' Haligre,</hi> and reproach'd him to have counsell'd the King to have his Governor pluck'd away from him so; the Chancelor excus'd himself, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he had given such counsell;</hi> The King having notice of this poor answer of his Chancelor, sent the next day for the Seales, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to retire to his Countrey house; The Duke of <hi>Vendosm</hi> and his brother the gran Prior were thought also to do ill Offices in this busines which made them fall into some dislike, and so they were committed prisoners to the Castle of <hi>Ambois;</hi> amongst other things wherewith <hi>Vendosm</hi> was charg'd, one was, that he should say <hi>he would never see the King againe but in picture;</hi> so he was put out of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Britany,</hi> which was conferr'd upon Marshall <hi>Themines.</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Richelieu</hi> having drawn a great deal of hatred upon himself about this match, he had a guard allow'd him, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was afterwards recented according as the measure of envie and danger accrued. The King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Nants</hi> in <hi>Britany</hi> to settle that Government, told his brother that <hi>he much desired he were married to Madamoiselle Monpensier for the good of his</hi> state, <hi>assuring him that he should find his own advantages in it: Monsieur</hi> answer'd, <hi>That if his Majesty judg'd that it would be for the good of his state he entirely conform'd himself to his pleasure;</hi> thereupon he sent a long complement to <hi>Madamoiselle Monpensier,</hi> concluding that <hi>he would prove a better Husband to her, then he was a servant:</hi> So the Articles of Mariage were drawn, and <hi>Monsieur</hi> was to have for his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pannage the Duchy of <hi>Orleans</hi> with other places to the sum of one hundred thousand franks annuall rent, all charges defrayed, so much more in pension, and by speciall warrant five hundred and sixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand franks yeerly upon the receipts of <hi>Orleans;</hi> which comes in all to about seventy thousand pounds sterlin per annum: so the Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu</hi> betroth'd and married them the next day at <hi>Nants</hi> with as much solemnity as the place could afford.</p>
            <p>At this time there were whispers up and down France of divers plots that were to be put in execution; some gave out the King inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to repudiat the Queen; Others, that there was a design to clap up the King in a monasterie, and that <hi>Monsieur</hi> should raign; of this plot there was a whisper the <hi>mother</hi> was, because she alwaies seem'd to love the younger better then the elder. But I beleeve this was a groundlesse surmise.</p>
            <p>There were divers in prison that would have perswaded <hi>Monsieur</hi> to a forrein match, and endeavour'd to crosse this; Amongst others the Count of <hi>Chalais</hi> was one, who was beheaded at <hi>Nants,</hi> and there being no headsman in the town, a prisoner that was in for a capitall crime, undertooke the office provided he might have his pardon, but he manag'd the instrument so ill that he gave the Count thirtie foure

            <p>
               <hi>Sanctarellus</hi> the Jesuit obtruded to the world dangerous tenets about this time, viz. <hi>That the Pope hath power to depose the Emperour, to admonish, and punish with temporall pains other Princes, and absolve their subjects from their Oath of fidelitie in case of heresie.</hi> The book was burnt in <hi>Paris;</hi> Father <hi>Cotton</hi> Provinciall of the French Jesuits, brought a public instrument from the chief of the Colledge of <hi>Clermont</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Society did disadvow, and detest the said opinion of <hi>Sancta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellus,</hi> which instrument was commanded to be put upon Record.</p>
            <p>It was an ancient custom in France before the erection of <hi>Sedentary</hi> Parliaments whereof there are eight, to assemble once or twice every yeer the <hi>States General,</hi> which Assembly was first call'd <hi>Parlement,</hi> wherein they treated of the highest Affairs of State, of making levies of money for the Kings extraordinary occasions; for punishing cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Magistrats, and questioning any Officers whatsoever upon the relations which were made by the Deputies or Members of the said Assembly, which were call'd in old times <hi>Missi Dominici,</hi> viz. Those who were sent by the Lord or King; This, as I said before in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Lustre,</hi> is equivalent to the High Court of Parlement in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, though in number it be inferior to it, in regard that this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Assembly of France consists but of foure hundred and odd members, that in England of neer upon seven hundred. Since the sett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the said <hi>Sedentary</hi> Parlements, this Great <hi>Parlement</hi> hath bin seldom convok'd in France unlesse during the minority of the King: for which the Countrey hath suffer'd much; in regard this universall convention was us'd to keep good correspondence 'twixt the Prince and his people, and the pecuniary levies which pass'd by their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages were given with more cheerfulnesse, and besides there was no need of so many Collectors and Receivors as are employed in the Kings ordinary Revenu, which are so numerous that the fourth part is drunk up among Officers in fees and wages; so that there hardly comes into the Kings Coffers cleer a <hi>Quardecu</hi> in every <hi>Crowne.</hi> This Assembly of the three Estates in France grew to be very rare, and in a manner obsolete, since the Kings had power given them to impose public assessments, the ground whereof was this; When the English had taken such firme footing in France that they had advanc'd as far as the <hi>Loire,</hi> and besieg'd <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Assembly of the three States in these pressures being not able to meet after the ordinary maner by reason of the interposition of the enemy up and down, that power which was formerly inhaerent in the three States of making Laws and assessing the subject with subsidiary taxes, was transmitted to the King himself during the war, which continuing long, that intrusted power grew in tract of time so habitual, that it could never be re-assum'd or the Kings disvested of it: And that which made the busines more fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable for the Kings was, that the burden fell most upon the <hi>Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,</hi> the <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> not feeling the weight neer so much: And it happen'd in so favourable conjuncture of time that the Clergy
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98453:44"/>
and Nobles were contented to have the Peasans pull'd down a little,<note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note> because not many yeers before in that notable rebellion call'd <hi>la Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querie de Beauvoisin</hi> which was suppress'd by <hi>Charles</hi> the Wise, they boldly put themselfs in armes against the Nobility and Gentry to les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen their greatnes: Add hereunto as an advantage to the work, that this power being first transferr'd to <hi>Charles</hi> the Seventh, there suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, a notable cunning King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, who knew well how to play his game; for amongst all the rest he was said to be the first who put the French Kings <hi>horce de Page,</hi> out of their minority or from being <hi>Pages</hi> any more, though thereby he brought the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans to be worse then <hi>Laquais.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of some distast the King took at the last Convention of the three Estates which was upon his entrance to his <hi>Majority,</hi> he resolv'd to summon them no more, yet because he might be in good intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with his people, a way was projected to call an Assembly of <hi>Notables</hi> which should be equivalent to the States Generall though fewer far in number, and some out of every one of the Provinciall Sedentary Courts of Parlement were chosen to joyn with them: such an Assembly as this was held in <hi>Roven</hi> (as we mentioned before) which did little good, therefore the King was advis'd to convoque such another at <hi>Paris</hi> this yeer which was done accordingly. They met in the great Hall of the Twilleries where the King spoak to them thus:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We protest before the living God, that We have no other ayme or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but his honour, and the good and ease of Our subjects: therefore in his Name We conjure and pray you whom we have here convoqued, and, by that lawfull power which is given Us over you, We command and expresly enjoyn you that without any other respect, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideration whatsoever, without regard of pleasing or displeasing any person, you would afford Us with all freedom and sinceritie those counsels which you shall judge in your consciences to be most wholesome and convenient to the advancement of the publique good.</hi> The Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> also made a long rhetoricall Oration (which you shall find in the legend of his life hereunto annexed) but there was no great advantage accrued to the public by this Assembly of Notables though it lasted from the second of <hi>December,</hi> to the twenty fourth of <hi>February</hi> following.</p>
            <p>This yeer a passage happend in the Court of England whence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued ill-favord consequences, and no lesse then a war afterward 'twixt the two Nations; which was this, The train of French servants which the Queen of Great <hi>Britain</hi> had brought with her at her first arrivall was suddenly dismiss'd to the number of one hundred and twenty; In regard of no good offices they did twixt the King and Queen, and for some petulant bold misdemeanurs of theirs, by imposing also certain odd superstitious penances upon the Queen in prejudice of her health: Besides, his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> having settled a Royall joynture upon her of neer upon one hundred thousand crowns a yeer out of the choicest Demeans, Royalties and Houses he had in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98453:45"/>
the Bishop of <hi>Mende</hi> sought to be Surintendent, and steward<note place="margin">Anno 1626.</note> of her lands, and others of her French servants expected to have Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in that kind, which the King would not hearken unto in regard the said French were unfit for those extern employments having not the Language, or knowledge of the Laws and Customs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, therefore he desir'd them to rest contented with the domestic Offices they had about the Person of the Queen; they made a shew to be satisfied herewith, though palpable discontentments appear'd in their countenances and carriage afterward more and more. So they were suddenly discharg'd, and summon'd to quit the Kingdom, and there should be order taken for all conveniences for their journey by Land and Sea, and the arrears of their wages and pensions were pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually paid them.</p>
            <p>The Queen for the present took much to heart the renvoy of her servants, and the King her brother resented it also when notice was sent him, though it was nothing to be wondred at, for he himself had discharg'd the Spanish servants his Queen had brought with her not long after she came, in the same manner.</p>
            <p>The King of England dispatch'd a Messenger of honor to the Court of France to give a true information of matters, which affoor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but little satisfaction; Thereupon Marshall <hi>Bassompierre</hi> was sent Ambassador extraordinary to England expresly about this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, but matters were thrust so far off the hinges that they could not be set right again so soon. The French began the first act of hostili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that before any public Declaration was publish'd, by seizing a great number of English and Scottish ships at <hi>Blay,</hi> as they were returning from the vintage with cargazons of wines from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> but the Scots were releas'd, the English still stayed. A little after an <hi>Edict</hi> issued out in the Kings name to interdict all commerce and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic with England, that no kind of <hi>grain, wines, or pulse</hi> should be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported thither, nor from thence to France any <hi>cloth, serges, woolls, lead, tinn, stuffs, silk stockings,</hi> with an enumeration of divers other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: by this one may observe, the advantage that <hi>England</hi> hath of <hi>France,</hi> in varietie and substance of Marchandizes.</p>
            <p>The French Chroniclers obtrude to the world divers wrong infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of this travers twixt England and France. 1. <hi>They relate that the French were casheer'd of the Queens service with little or nothing at all of their wages,</hi> which is false, for they were payed to a peny, and many of them parted with gifts and much wealth. 2. <hi>They report that the Queen out of her necessities had borrow'd much money of them, which was also a calumny,</hi> for there was never Princesse liv'd in greater plentie. 3. <hi>They make the world beleeve that the first depraedations at Sea, and acts of Piracy were committed by the English,</hi> which is another falshood, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the seisure of the Marchants at <hi>Blay,</hi> where they came to reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque their Ordnance, divers other praedatory acts were done by the French. 4. They publish also another imposture, that while the Earls of <hi>Carlile and Holland</hi> were in the heat of the Treaty of a Match
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98453:45"/>
with England, the same time they did machinat the ruine of France;<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> the first time that England was ever taxed of double dealing. 5. That his Majesty of Great Britain had no hand in the Pacifications which were made twixt the King, and them of the Religion, whereas his Ambassadors and Agents did alwayes follow the Kings Army to their excessive expences, and did perpetually negotiat in their behalf; and became caution to them for performances on the Kings side.</p>
            <p>Thus a black cloud hung between England and France; which broak out into a shrew'd, though short, tempest of war. The King of Great Britain riggs up his galeons, and in a very short time puts to Sea a huge royall fleet in perfect equippage of 150. Sayles, with an Army of 10000. combatants: which by the advise and directions of Monsieur <hi>Subize, and Blancart,</hi> who had fled to <hi>England</hi> some moneths before, were to sayle towards <hi>Rochell,</hi> and seize upon the Islands of <hi>Ré &amp; Oleron.</hi> In <hi>Oleron</hi> the <hi>English,</hi> when they were in possession of <hi>Guyen,</hi> made those famous Maritim laws, which are observ'd by all the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern world to this day: The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was chosen Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral by Sea, and General by Land of this great expedition; who publish'd this following Manifesto to the world.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>What part the Kings of Great Britain have alwayes taken in the affairs of the Reformed Churches of this Kingdom, and with what care and zeale they have labour'd for the good of them, is manifest to all, and the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof are as ordinary, as the occasions have been: The now King, my most honor'd Lord and Master comes nothing short of his Predecessors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if his good and laudable designes for their good had not bin perverted to their ruine, by those who had most interest for their due accomplishment: What advantages hath he refus'd? what Parties hath he not sought unto? that by his alliance with France he might restore more profitably and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the restitution of those Churches to their ancient liberty and splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor? And what could be lesse hoped for by so strict an alliance, and from so many reiterated promises by the mouth of a great Prince but effects truly royall, and sorting with his greatnes? But failings have bin such, that his Majesty, by so many promises, and so straight an obligation of friendship, hath not only bin disappointed of means to obtain Liberty and Surety for the said Churches, and to restore Peace to <hi>France</hi> by the reconciliation of those, whose breath utters nothing else but all manner of obedience to their King under the liberty of their <hi>Edicts:</hi> that contrariwise they have prevayl'd, by the interest which he had in those of the Religion to deceive them, and by this means not only to untie him from them, but also to make him, if not odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them, at least suspected in perverting the means, which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd for their good, to a quite contrary end: Witnes the English Ships not design'd for the extirpation of them of the Religion, but to the contrary, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse promise was made that they should not be us'd against them in the last Sea-fight. What then may be expected from so puissant a Prince as the King my Master so openly eluded, but a thorough feeling equall and proportion'd to the injuries receiv'd? but his patience hath gone beyond patience, and as long as he had hopes that he could benefit the Churches by any other means,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98453:46"/>
he had no recours by way of Arms: so far that having bin made an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> and worker of the last Peace upon conditions disadvantagious enough, and which would not have bin accepted without his Majesties intervention, who interpos'd his credit and interest to the Churches to receive them, even with threatnings to the end to shelter the honor of the most Christian King, under assurances of his Part, not onely for the accomplishment, but also, for the bettering of the said Conditions, for which he stands caution to the Churches.</p>
                  <p>But what hath bin the issue of all this but onely an abuse of his goodnesse? and that which his Majesty thought a soverain remedy for all their sores, hath it not brought almost the last blow to the ruine of the Churches? It wanted but a little by continuing the Fort before <hi>Rochell,</hi> the demolishment whereof was promis'd, by the violences of the soldiers and Garrisons of the said Fort and Isles, as well upon the Inhabitants of the said Town as upon strangers, in lieu whereas they should have retir'd, they have bin daily augmented, and other forts built; as also by the stay of the Commissioners in the said Town beyond the time agreed on, to the end to make broyles, and by means of the division which they made to slide among the Inhabitants to open the gates to the neighbouring Troupes, and by other withstandings and infractions of peace, I say it little faild, that the said Town and in it all the Churches had not drawn their last breath: And in the mean time while his Majesty hath yet continued, and not oppos'd so many injuries, so many faith-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but by complaint and Treaty, untill he had receiv'd certain advice confirm'd by intercepted Letters of the great preparation the most Christian King made to powre upon <hi>Rochell.</hi> And then what could his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> do, but to vindicat his honor by a quick arming against those who had made him a complice of their deceits: And to give testimony of his integrity and zeale which he hath alwayes had for the reestablishing of the Churches, an establishment which shall be dear and precious to him above any other thing?</p>
                  <p>This is the sole end of his arming at this time, and not any particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest: Yet whosoever would doubt hereof, let him consider the circumstance of times, and disposition of affairs as they stand now with the King my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. For who will beleeve that he can have any dessein upon France, or to have projected conquests here in a time so disadvantageous, having now for his enemy one of the puissantst King of the world; and if he had such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, surely he would have sent greater forces then I have now under com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whereof if the number were known they would be judg'd but Auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries only, and that their ayme is no other but for the good of the Churches, which for so many important reasons and considerations he finds himself ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd before God and men to protect and succour. But if it be alledg'd that the King my Master hath been mov'd to take up armes for other respects, as the detention and seizure of all the ships and goods of his subjects at <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux,</hi> and other places of this Kingdom, to the breach and manifest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travention of the peace 'twixt the two Crowns, which in this point tend expresly to the irrepairable prejudice, yea to the totall ruine of commerce, in the rupture whereof the poore people of this Realme being not able to vent
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98453:46"/>
their Merchandises, groans not onely under the burden of so many taxes and<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> impositions, but for the very necessities of life it self. That the apprehensions the King my Master hath of the powerfull encrease of the most Christian King by Sea hath mov'd him to arme for preventing the growth thereof; and lastly that being hopelesse of any accommodation of things, he hath bin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to put himself in armes. The answer to all this is, that whosoever will search the Arrests, prises and seasures which have bin made on both sides, he shall find the King my Master and his subjects have hitherto pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by this breach, and that it hath turn'd to their advantage.</p>
                  <p>In the second place, he is so far off from being jealous of the pretended power by Sea, and that he should have reason to hinder it, that there needs no more then for him to grant, when he thinks it fit, Letters of Mart to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and so these vain and feeble forces at Sea might be dissipated without the employment of any Fleet Royall. Finally, that there hath bin a necessity to arme thus, because there is no hope of accommodation otherwise, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary will be most manifest to him who will consider the researches which have bin made at severall times as well by their own Ministers, as by the Ministers of other Princes to the King my Master, to treat of accommodating things at their instigation. It appears by all this that the King my Master hath not bin forc'd to arme for any particular interest, but only for the defence of the Churches, for the security and freedom whereof he stood responsible: Yet there are some who dare amuse the world that his Majesty hath a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dessein in it, and that he useth Religion for a pretext to gain a party, by means whereof, and by which conjunction he hopes to push on his purposes to the end at which they ayme. No, no, our Religion teacheth us otherwise, and the King my Master's piety (wherein he gives place to no man living) will never permit him. His desscin is the establishment of the Churches, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is their good, and his ayme their contentment; That being done, these Drums beating, these Ensignes displayed shall be folded up again. And all this noyse of War shall be buried in night and silence, which would never have bin but for their cause. <hi>Given aboard of our Admiral this Wens<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the 21. of</hi> Iuly, 1627.</p>

            <p>A good while before this Fleet was under sayle, the French Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal by some pensionary Spies he had in the English Court, had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement of the dessein, therefore there was a Remonstrance sent from the King to his Town of <hi>Rochell</hi> to this effect. <hi>That they were French, and that the English were proud and insupportable, that having vain pretentions upon this Kingdom, if they took any place it was to reduce it to slavery: That their Ancestors being acquainted with the nature of the English chose rather to lose half their goods, then to be under their domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the accord made for the delivery of King</hi> John <hi>when he was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner in England: That his Majesty had given proofs of the effects of his clemency so often, and with so much favor, that his grace seem'd to be above their crimes; for their Religion, if they thought to cast it upon the account, he left them the free exercise of it; touching</hi> Lewis <hi>Fort, which seem'd to</hi>

            <p>By the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> Manifesto it appears the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> had divers grounds of War against France; first, that his Merchants were so abus'd, their ships seiz'd on, and their goods taken away; secondly, that the French King grew so strong in ships, which in former times was us'd to be a sufficient motif for War of it self; and lastly, that Articles were not perform'd of the peace which was made with them of the Religion wherein England was engag'd; His Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> waves the first two, and layes hold of the last, whereby the French <hi>Reformists</hi> had just cause to abet him in the quarrell it being more theirs then his; Though there were reports blaz'd abroad, of other odd motifs; Howsoever the <hi>Policy</hi> of <hi>England</hi> was tax'd (though her <hi>courage</hi> admir'd) abroad to engolf her self into a War with France, when she had another great <hi>neighbour</hi> King already on her back in actual hostility.</p>
            <p>This Fleet gave a mighty alarme to <hi>France,</hi> which made the King to send the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme</hi> before <hi>Rochell</hi> with three thousand foot, and five hundred horse; The King following a few dayes after fell sick upon the way, and <hi>Monsieur</hi> was in mourning for his wife who died in Child-bed of a daughter. The Duke of <hi>Angoulesms</hi> Quarter-masters when they came to take lodgings for the billeting of the Army in the small villages about <hi>Rochell,</hi> took so much roome as would have serv'd an Army thrice as great; and this was done of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, for the report thereof being blown to <hi>Rochell</hi> and so to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Fleet, the Duke, upon <hi>Soubize's</hi> advice, cast anchor at the Isle of <hi>Ré,</hi> whereas his first intention was for <hi>Lewis fort</hi> upon the Continent which dessein was diverted upon the (false) report of the greatnes of <hi>Angoulesms</hi> Army; There were hardly 1200. English landed upon the Island of <hi>Ré,</hi> but 1000. French foot, and 200. choice horse who had layn invisible in a bottom all the while, appear'd, and charg'd them furiously, the French horse did wonderful bravely, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish foot no lesse, who having scarce step'd ashore were set upon and divers driven into the Sea and drown'd; but by the brave example of their Commanders they resum'd courage, and kill'd above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty of the enemies Cavalry, put their foot to flight and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maind Masters of the field; there was good pillage found among the French horsemen that fell, divers of them being persons of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and young spirits, which being stripp'd, many had their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stesses

At this first act of invasion<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> the <hi>English</hi> loss'd some hundreds of men, amongst others <hi>Blaneart</hi> Monsieur <hi>Soubize</hi> companion who had bin one of the chief tracers of this voyage in the English Court, was slain upon the sands, and Sir <hi>Iohn Heyden</hi> was kill'd too, who had afterwards honourable buriall. The next day the English horse landed, and so they began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench: The chiefest Fort in the Island was Saint <hi>Martin</hi> where Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Toiras</hi> a choice man, had bin many dayes before; he sent the next day in a bravado a Page and a Trumpet to tell the Duke <hi>he meant to give him a breakfast,</hi> the Page had twenty peeces, and the Trumpet five given him: If the Duke had gon presently in pursuance of his victory for that breakfast toward Saint <hi>Martin</hi> he might in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability have taken the Fort, but he stayed divers dayes neer the Sea side, and in the interim <hi>Toiras</hi> had time to fortifie: and the cause he stay'd his march further, was that <hi>Soubize,</hi> &amp; Sir <hi>Will: Beecher</hi> had gon to <hi>Rochell</hi> for more ayd which the Duke expected; but the <hi>Rocheller</hi> gave them little countenance letting them in at the Postern gate: <hi>Toiras</hi> after the first, sent a second Trumpet to the Duke for burying the dead, offering a thousand pounds for his brothers body and others who were kill'd, but he had them gratis. <hi>Soubize</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came with five hundred from <hi>Rochell,</hi> and so the English Army march'd towards Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> in the way there was the little Fort calld <hi>Lapree,</hi> wherein as there was advice had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, there was but one old woman; <hi>Soubize</hi> counsell'd the Duke to march another way through the Vineyards, and to leave the Fort; this prov'd fatall, and indeed the greatest cause of the ruine of the English, for had they tane that little Fort it might have serv'd for a handsome retreat: Being come before Saint <hi>Martins</hi> Fort Sir <hi>Io: Burrowes</hi> view'd it, and said positively it was impregnable but by star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and so advis'd the Duke to take what booty could be had in that Isle, and go to <hi>Oleron;</hi> but this counsell took not. While the English Army lay before Saint <hi>Martin</hi> there was an Engineer came out of the Castle, who desired conference with the Duke, but being suspected by his looks, he was search'd and a poyson'd dagger was found about him, wherewith, being put to the torment, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd to have bin sent to kill the Duke, so he had no quarter; All the time the Duke was there, though it was concluded by the Counsell of War, 'twas impossible to take the Fort but by famin, yet no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments were made all the while to block them up, but a way was taken to raise batteries before the Army had made its approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which prov'd chargeable and fruitlesse, for with the infinit company of shot made against the Hill, there was nothing done by way of breach, but more powder and shot spent then the spoyles of the Isle was worth, and still the passage was open for the Town round about to carry in any thing; At last the English began to entrench, yet they could not hinder provision to come by Sea from the main; at last a sicknes happned in the Army whereby many dropp'd away;

Sir <hi>Iohn Burrowes</hi> was kill'd, and divers other ilfavor'd accidents fell<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> out, and discontents began to be fomented, for there came divers messages from the Cittadell to the Duke which he made shy to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to the Counsell of war, whereat there was some distast taken.</p>
            <p>The King of France was now recover'd, and he &amp; his Cardinal were come before <hi>Rochell;</hi> there were all means under heaven us'd to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve <hi>Toiras,</hi> &amp; the Cittadel of <hi>Ré,</hi> whereupon the King writ his Letter encouragement unto him. <hi>Monsieur</hi> Toiras, <hi>understanding the rare vertis and courage wherewith you and the rest that are in that Cittadel do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend your selfs against the English, I was willing to express unto you by this Letter the singular satisfaction that I receive thereby; Therefore you ought to beleeve that I will acknowledge such signal service to every one who shall have a share therein, in such a manner that they shall beare all the dayes of their lifes some mark of honor according to their merits: Therefore I desire you would send Me the names of all those that are shut in with you in that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadell, that neither Gentleman, Officer or Soldier remain without his reward.</hi>

            <p>This Letter being safely arriv'd to <hi>Toiras</hi> it rais'd every ones spirit to a great height of resolution; as also the Kings Person being come so neer them. There were divers complements pass'd 'twixt the Duke and <hi>Toiras</hi> during the siege, and Master <hi>Io.

            <p>This was the dismall'st day that the English ever had in France, who in times pass'd perform'd such stupendous exploits in that Countrey; yet the <hi>Invasion</hi> was made with much gallantry, for they might be said to have swom through water and blood to take footing on the Island, which discover'd much of the ancient courage of the Nation; Besides, they did before the Cittadel as much as men could do, &amp; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their marching away they made two stands to draw <hi>Schomberg</hi> to fight notwithstanding that they had not in number a quarter of the horse that he had newly transported from the Continent. They took likewise divers prisoners of note who were released also without ransome by his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain.</hi> Divers omissions there were that prov'd fatall to this expedition: 1.

            <p>Monsieur <hi>Soubizes</hi> counsell was the cause of these omissions, who was the main contriver of this infortunate voyage (with <hi>Blancart</hi>

who fell at first landing) And it seems a hard destiny hanted the<note place="margin">Anno 1627.</note> said <hi>Soubize</hi> (though a worthy man of himself) in all attempts from the beginning; He was taken prisoner at Saint <hi>Iohn d'Angely,</hi> he was forc'd to flye at <hi>Royan,</hi> and twice (with this time) at <hi>Ré;</hi> He had but ill succes at <hi>Medoc,</hi> and divers ill-favor'd encounters at Sea, though he lost lesse honor there then a shore.</p>
            <p>Some outlandish Chroniclers would have it that there were three <hi>Furies</hi> which impell'd the English to this Expedition. 1. The ambition of <hi>Buckingham.</hi> 2. The felony of <hi>Soubize.</hi> 3. The rebellion of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chellers:</hi> but these men write more out of passion then knowledge, for as I instanc'd in the beginning of this relation, there were divers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to move England to armes as matters stood then.</p>
            <p>The King having had such rare successe against the English, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves<note place="margin">Anno 1628.</note> upon the planting of a serious siege before <hi>Rochell,</hi> thereupon order was given for an exact <hi>circumvallation</hi> by Land, and <hi>Pompco Targon</hi> an Italian Engineer was employed for Sea works: the said <hi>Targon,</hi> being assisted with the Cardinals headpeece, fell on a plot to raise a huge dike in the channell which the <hi>Rochellers</hi> geer'd at first, but they found it the bane of their Town at last.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rochellers</hi> had recourse to the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, who resenting their sad condition employed two Royall Fleets for their succour which made but sory returns; The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> was to be General of the last, but he was tragically slain the day before he was to embark; Thereupon the Earl of <hi>Linzey</hi> went in his place, but before he appear'd before the Town, <hi>Targon</hi> had finish'd the gran Dike, whereof the Cardinal was dayly overseer, the King being then in <hi>Paris;</hi> there were certain kind of palissadoes and other strange fabriques rais'd in the channel to the wonderment of the world, for Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> at his revokment from Flanders to Spain, and passing by the Kings Army, said, he had never seen the like, being as trenches and barricadoes erected in the Sea; and they were done with that advantage that no navall power could do any good up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; In so much that the English Fleet being arriv'd, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal sent to the General, that he should have safe pasport to come a shore with six of his knowingst Commanders, with permission to view the works, and if they thought in their judgements that the Town was succourable, he would raise the siege without fighting a stroak: The General of this Fleet was the Lord <hi>Rob: Willoughby Earl of Linzey,</hi> whom the French Chroniclers call <hi>Willaby Inghay,</hi> and the General of the former Fleet they call Count <hi>d'Emby,</hi> in lieu of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh,</hi> so they call <hi>Burrowes Burrache, Ashpernham Hasburnim.</hi> And as in this relation, so every where els they seldom or never truly render the sirname of any English or German, which (under favor) is a great error, and a kind of stupidity and carelesnes in an Historian.</p>
            <p>The King being return'd with the flower of all the Nobility of France to the siege before <hi>Rochell</hi> which had now lasted a long time, the Town was reduc'd to an extreme exigent and want of provision

(having for greedinesse of mony sold upon high prises to the English<note place="margin">Anno 1628.</note> being at <hi>Ré</hi> much corn and other things) therefore they came at last to a submission, their Deputies making this speech to the King.</p>

               <hi>Sir, they who have bin a long time shut up in obscure prisons, when they come abroad cannot behold the Sun without dazzling their eyes; so we whom a long captivity hath kept reclus'd within our walls, coming now to appeer before your Majesties face, we are not able to endure the brightnesse of it without dazzlement, and some horror of our faults pass'd which adds to our confusion: yet the goodnes of your Majesty, whereof we have tasted the effects so often, and do now find, gives us the boldnesse to prostrat our selfs at your feet to implore pardon, which our frequent relapses into our crimes do not permit us to hope for, &amp;c.</hi> So they go on with a protest and deep asse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration of their loyaltie for the future, wherein they will endeavor to surpasse all the rest of his subjects.</p>
            <p>The King answer'd. <hi>God grant that you have spoken to me from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of your hearts, and that necessity rather then an acknowledgement of your faults hath put these words in your mouthes, you have made use of all means and inventions to withdraw your selfs from the duty of good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full subjects, yet I cannot forbeare to let you feel the effects of my goodnes and mercy; Be wiser hereafter, and assure your selfs I will not breake my promise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the beginning of the siege there were in the Town about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand souls, but at the reddition there were not five thousand; and scarce one hundred who had strength to bear a Musket; an ounce of bread was worth half a crown, a pound of bisket seven crowns, an egg six shillings, a pound of horse-flesh ten shillings, a cabbage leaf three pence; many dragg'd themselfs to the Church-yards and made their own graves: A little before their reddition they married all the young maids in the Town that were espousable who had any por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The King caus'd all kind of fortifications new and old except those towards the haven to be raz'd, all bastions and the walls to be demolish'd, and the moats fill'd up; so of a City she became to be an open village, without Maire, Sheriffs, or any other Magistrat, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to be contributory to all kind of taxes; those ramparts that were built out of the ruines of Churches and Monasteries were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for reedification of the former Churches; a great Crosse was erected in the Market-place, and a Decree pass'd that there should be a solemn Procession every yeer upon <hi>All Saints</hi> day about that Crosse in remembrance that the Town was taken that day; all their Parishes were reduc'd to <hi>three;</hi> In so much that as the quality of the place, so the whole government thereof was entirely alter'd, as if they had bin put to begin the world again.</p>
            <p>In the mean time while the King had triumphed thus over <hi>Rochell,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was very active in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> having considerable forces, which made the Parlement of <hi>Tholouze</hi> thunder out a furious Arrest against him, <hi>That for his so many Conspiracies, Rebellions, Disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, and for bringing the</hi> English <hi>into France, and other most odious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:98453:50"/>
               <hi>he was depriv'd of the title of Duke, made incapable of the benefit of</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1628.</note> 
               <hi>the generall Act of oblivion, that he should be drawn by wild horses, his body dismembred and burnt, his ashes thrown into the wind, his posterity declar'd Peasants, his Duchy reunited to the Crown, and whosoever could apprehend his person and bring him living or dead, he should have one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thousand Franks for a guerdon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke so little valued this sentence that he cau'd <hi>Masvyer</hi> the chief President of <hi>Tholouze</hi> to be hanged the next day in Effigie in the Town where he was.</p>
            <p>There was at this time in <hi>Italy</hi> a former difference reviv'd 'twixt the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Mantova</hi> about <hi>Monferrat,</hi> which had bin some yeers before accommoded by the intervention of France; The <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> were for the <hi>Savoyard:</hi> hereupon <hi>Don Gonzalez de Cordova</hi> besieg'd <hi>Casal:</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> thought it concernd his honor and safety to assist the <hi>Mantovan</hi> who had been once his vassal when only Duke of <hi>Nevers;</hi> therefore having settled all things at <hi>Rochell,</hi> he marcheth with his Army toward the <hi>Alpes,</hi> but demanding passage of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Duke a great while did complement with him; Hereupon he forceth his passage through snow and yce in the moneth of <hi>February</hi> and got over to <hi>Susa</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which was rendred unto him; so the Duke and He were upon good termes, and free passage accorded for his Army to passe to <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> to raise the siege of <hi>Casal,</hi> but <hi>Gonzales</hi> by the advice of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> quitted the siege himself in the interim, and so retir'd to <hi>Milan,</hi> and the King returned to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While he was t'other side the Alps at <hi>Susa,</hi> by the interposition of the republic of <hi>Venice,</hi> there was an overture made of a reconciliation 'twixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which quickly took effect.</p>
            <p>The King in his return ore the Alps with his Cardinal, caus'd a Pillar to be erected in the common road upon one of the highest Mountains with this ostentous Inscription; <hi>To the eternall memory of Lewis the thirteenth, King of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Navarr, <hi>most gracious, most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, most happy, most just; A Conqueror, who having overcome all Nations of Europe, he hath triumphed also over the elements of heaven and earth, having twice pass'd ore these Hills in the moneth of</hi> March <hi>with his victorious Army, to restore the Princes of Italy to their estates, and to protect and defend his Allies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being return'd to France, he heard the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> rov'd still up<note place="margin">Anno 1629.</note> and down with forces in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and that he was upon point of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into a confederation with the Spaniard, to which purpose He employ'd one <hi>Clausel</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> who propos'd <hi>That if his Catholic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would be pleas'd to furnish him with</hi> 600000. <hi>crowns annually, the Duke of</hi> Rohan <hi>would undertake to raise and maintain an Army of twelve thousand foot, and twelve hundred horse to make what diversion his Majesty would appoint, and to continue a war in France.</hi> There were divers other Propositions tending to the kind usage of the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> and withall a request <hi>That the Dukes pension from fourteen thousand crowns, might be</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:98453:51"/>
               <hi>augmented to eighteen thousand, and that his Catholic Majesty would please</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1629.</note> 
               <hi>to add to his brother</hi> Soubize's <hi>pension of eight thousand crowns a yeer, two thousand more.</hi> For performance of these propositions the said <hi>Clausel</hi> could give no other caution but the word of an <hi>Honorable and most Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Prince,</hi> meaning the Duke.</p>
            <p>These offers were accepted by the Spaniard, but the sum was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to three hundred thousand crowns payable in two payments every yeer.</p>
            <p>The Articles being sent by <hi>Clausel</hi> to France by a <hi>Zeland</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he was suspected and taken in a Pond up to the neck, so he was hang'd at <hi>Tholouse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King at his return to <hi>Provence</hi> took <hi>Privas</hi> from them of the <hi>Religion</hi> after many bloudy sallies and assaults on both sides; a place of mighty consequence; In the Campe before <hi>Privas</hi> the Peace was proclaym'd 'twixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to dishearten them in the Town the more, for they thought that the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> was still involv'd in their Cause. This Peace was negotiated by <hi>Georgi</hi> and <hi>Contarini</hi> Ambassadors to the <hi>Mayden</hi> Republic, who <hi>yet</hi> may be call'd the <hi>Mother</hi> of Policy and able to read Lectures on that <hi>Thesis</hi> to the rest of <hi>Europe;</hi> nor did there small glory redound to her by her succesfull intervention herein, and by making her Saint <hi>Mark</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator 'twixt two such mighty Monarks.</p>
            <p>The words of the Proclamation before <hi>Privas</hi> pronounc'd alowd by a king of Arms were these. <hi>Let the world know there is peace, amity, and good intelligence between his Majesty and his good Brother, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law the King of Great</hi> Britain, <hi>acessation of all acts of hostility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them and their subjects, with an entire confirmation of the ancient Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances, and of the Articles and Contract of Mariage with the Queen of Great</hi> Britain, <hi>and an overture of a free and safe commerce between the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the two Crowns: Therefore all persons are prohibited to attempt any think in prejudice of the said Peace under pain of being punish'd as Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the public repose, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The generall Articles also were signed there interchangeably in the ordinary forme, where of there were some extraordinary, as that <hi>In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it would be difficult to make restitution on either side of divers prises which have been taken in this war, the two Crowns are accorded, that there shall be no reprisall made by sea or in any other maner for that which is pass'd 'twixt the two Kings and their subjects during the said war.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And because there are divers vessels at Sea, with Letters of Mart, which give Commission to combat the enemies which cannot presently have notice of this Peace, or receive Order to abstain from acts of hostility, It is accorded that whatsoever shall passe the space of the two next moneths after this accord, shall not derogate from, or empeach this Peace, or the good will of the two Crowns.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King having dismantled <hi>Privas,</hi> and secur'd other petty pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he march'd to <hi>Alets</hi> a very considerable Garrison Town of them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> which being also surrendred, he march'd to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> took <hi>Castres</hi> and <hi>Nismes</hi> once the darling of <hi>Rome</hi> when she had her

            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sirs:</hi> You know well enough that the King doing me the honor as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge me his kinsman, hath had particular consideration of me in all generall Treaties made with your party, and that he hath made me to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually sollicited to separat my self from you, with assurances that he would raise my condition to such a point, that might draw upon it the envy of the Princes, and the greatest of his Kingdom: Neither are you ignorant that the generall interests of the party being deerer unto me then mine own, I have bin so far from lending an ear unto those charming propositions, that to the contrary I have broak with his Majesty whensoever he hath refus'd or delay'd the execution of the Edicts pass'd in favor of us, and exposing my self to his indignation I have run the hazard of my fortun, my honor, and life: Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen I pray do not think, that since our Cause is conjoyn'd with that of God, but that I continu as strong a zeal and inclination as ever towards it: But in regard our affaires are in another condition perchance then you do imagin, I have call'd you hither to instruct you, and then to take such order that your wisdoms shall afford me to put in punctuall execution with as much fidelity as courage.</p>
               <p>You must then consider that any time these eight yeers that the King hath warr'd with us, heaven hath bin so favorable unto him, that it seems he ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther went to the routing of our troupes then to combat, and by assaulting our strongest Towns he prepar'd rather for triumphant entries, then sieges: so that now the number of our combatants, and the strength of our strongest pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doth not serve as much to maintain our party, as to augment his glory: so many Towns in <hi>Poitou, Saintonge, Guyen,</hi> and <hi>Languedoc</hi> which have not bin able toresist him as many dayes as we count moneths, are most sensible proofs hereof: <hi>Rochell,</hi> alas! <hi>(with that he fetcht a profound sigh accompagnied with tears) Rochell</hi> which we thought inexpugnable, that prowd Town one of the miracles of <hi>Europe</hi> being now reduc'd to an open village on all sides, doth carry, and shall eternally beare the marks of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and good fortune of this glorious Monark.</p>
               <p>Having demolish'd this strong rampart of the Gospel, by which the whole party subsisted, he hath penetrated the Kingdom from one Diameter to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and travers'd in five or six dayes the Alps in the most rigorous season of the yeer, which <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> accounted amongst his heroiquest actions, and <hi>Hannibal</hi> could not do it in fifteen dayes without inestimable losse; He hath forc'd the passe of <hi>Susa</hi> marching ore the belly of an Army entrench'd and fortified in a straight. He hath deliver'd the Duke of <hi>Mantova</hi> from the oppression of the King of Spain, and the Savoyard, and oblig'd the latter who was Author of the War to receive such conditions of peace that he pleas'd to prescribe him: Repassing the Alps with like celeritie, he hath depriv'd us of <hi>Privas,</hi> and taken multitudes of places more by the terror only of his victorious Arms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:98453:52"/>He is continually assisted by the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who for the ferti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity<note place="margin">Anno 1629.</note> of his Invention, for the solidity of his Counsels, for the secrecy of his desseins, for his hardines in execution, and for his addresse in all affairs of consequence, I would acknowledge him the greatest man of <hi>Europe</hi> were he not born for the ruine of our party, and the abolition of the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>This young, generous, warlike King, though too much zealoused to Popery, following in every thing the counsels of this Priest as Oracles, can we doubt but our defence, though lawfull, as being for Religion, and liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, be not an occasion to him to advance our destruction, under pretext of rebellion and felony?</p>
               <p>After all that Gentlemen, you must consider that the taking of <hi>Rochell</hi> hath extinguish'd all Factions throughout the Kingdom which commonly serv'd to the encrease of our party; In so much that of three hundred places good and bad, which we had formerly in our hands, we have not 30. remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without rents, without soldiers, or means to put into them all together as many men as would serve to preserve one alone: For although our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons cry out daily in their Chaires that we ought not to despaire of heavenly succour, yet receiving every day proofs of the wrath of the Eternal, there is more appearance to expect punishment for our sins, then miracles for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establishment of our affaires.</p>
               <p>Peradventure you will promise your selfs some great assistance from stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and specially from Protestants, whom the conformity of Religion which ties them to our interests, may oblige to assist us in so urgent necessity. But I pray consider that the Germans have enough to defend themselfs from the oppression of the Emperour, consider the elusions of the Hollander, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puissance of the Savoyard who hath bled at the nose; the lightnes of the English who have concluded a peace with France without comprehending us who were the sole object of the war: And if you stay for the offers of Spain which loves not our Nation, and our Religion lesse, know that he studies how to engage us so far against the King, that we may become incapable of his grace, and that the succours wherewith he will supply us which is but a little money, will not serve but to prolong our ruine, by enfeebling France by our Civill Wars, and intestine broyles.</p>
               <p>For my self, I am now as much solicited as ever to abandon you, and to take advantagious conditions of his Majesty, but I shall never hearken to any thing but wherein you may find your satisfaction in a generall Treaty for the whole Cause, as also particularly for your Towns; If your wisdoms find it to purpose that it be more expedient to seek our conservation with the exercise of our Religion, and liberty of our consciences within the obedience which we owe to our lawfull Prince, then in resistance, which, though just of it self, is held by the Enemies of our Faith no other then a Rebellion and high Treason, whereby under a more specious pretext, to exterminat and destroy us; Or if contrary to all appearance of human reason, you take a resolution to stiffen your selfs against so victorious and invincible a power, I resolve also to incur all hazards with you, though I am sory that neither the advancement of the Faith can be found in my resolution, nor your security in my danger, nor your safety in my losse.</p>

            <p>This studied speech, with the sense of the late ill successe, and of<note place="margin">Anno 1629.</note> the Kings power, wrought so far upon the Assembly, that it extorted a willingnes to submit unto a Treaty which was propounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: so a little after there was a generall peace concluded with the <hi>Reformists,</hi> and the King being in <hi>Languedoc</hi> where the <hi>Plague</hi> after this scourge of <hi>War,</hi> was very rife, he went therefore himself to <hi>Paris,</hi> and left the Cardinal behind to consummat all things; who amongst other places, entred <hi>Montauban</hi> where <hi>Espernon</hi> met him and reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a perfect friendship with him: <hi>Montauban</hi> following the example of all the rest of the Towns dismantled herself of all new fortifications, and restor'd the Church lands, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The Cardinall being return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> the Peace with his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> was solemnly renew'd and sworn unto; but they of the <hi>Religion</hi> took it ill that there was no mention at all made of them in the Treaty, they having bin declar'd to be the object of Englands last war with France. All the Princes were commanded to be at this Ceremony, and because a difference did arise for precedency 'twixt forrein Princes of souverain Houses, and the naturall sons of Kings, a provisional Order was made by the Privy Counsel, <hi>That every one should take place according to his seniority of age.</hi>

            <p>Thus our fourth Lustre of the life of <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, ends with an Olive branch of a <hi>double</hi> Peace, one with a forren Prince, the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> which was solemnly sworn unto by both Kings, Sir <hi>Thomas Edmunds</hi> being Ambassadour for the one, and the Marquis of New-Castle (<hi>de Chasteau neuf</hi>) for the other.</p>
            <p>The second Peace was concluded with his own subjects the whole Body of the <hi>Religion,</hi> whom he had now reduc'd to an exact rule of obedience, having seiz'd upon, dismantled and secur'd all their prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidiary Towns which were neer upon fifty, whereof <hi>Montauban</hi> was the last that left her <hi>Mantle.</hi> So that they must hereafter depend no more upon <hi>Garrisons</hi> but Royall <hi>Grace.</hi> A mighty work, then which nothing could conduce more to make him so absolut a Monark.</p>

And this he might now do with lesse fear then formerly, having quieted and secur'd all things in France; according to the saying, <hi>Frustrà foris agit bellum, qui domi timet incendium:</hi> He vainly combats abroad, who fears combustions at home.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> being now settled in <hi>Mantova</hi> the French grew powerfull in <hi>Italy,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniard</hi> could not well disgest; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon a Ligue was struck 'twixt the Emperour and him, whereinto the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> entred afterward. The Emperor questions the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> about <hi>Mantova,</hi> though not for the <hi>Title,</hi> yet for the <hi>investiture,</hi> which he was to receive from him. Hereupon he sends an Army to <hi>Italy</hi> under the command of <hi>Colalto</hi> a great Captain, and Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> a greater, was Generall for the King of Spain, nor was the little Duke <hi>Emanuel</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> inferior to either, who after <hi>Henry</hi> the Great's death, assum'd to himself the title of the prime soldier of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now <hi>Spinola</hi> being tyred with the lingring Low Countrey Wars, and having recover'd the honor he had lost before <hi>Berghen op some,</hi> by that notable exploit of taking <hi>Breda,</hi> he procur'd his revokement from that service; Being come to <hi>Spain</hi> there was some clash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'twixt him and <hi>Olivares</hi> about accounts; yet was he sent to be Governor of <hi>Milan,</hi> and so was made Generall of this War; He struck like thunder into <hi>Monferrat,</hi> and took <hi>Nizza de la paglia,</hi> and six places more notwithstanding the opposition of <hi>Toiras</hi> (who had such successe against the English in the Isle of <hi>Ré</hi>) and was now Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor for the King t'other side the Hills, and had shut himself in <hi>Casal.</hi>

            <p>As the King of France was preparing for Italy, there were two ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favord accidents happen'd, one was that Monsieur being mightily ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in love with the Princesse <hi>Mary</hi> the Duke of <hi>Mantova's</hi> daughter for a second wife, neither the King nor his Mother would give their consent unto it; which in discontentment made him leave France, and fly to <hi>Lorain;</hi> this sudden sally was like to breed ill bloud, for he publish'd a Manifesto wherein he cast many aspersions upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Government, and the boundlesse Authority of <hi>Richelieu;</hi> but the businesse was taken up by the ministery of good heads, and Monsieur was charm'd to France again by an addition of the Duchy of <hi>Valois,</hi> which was valued at one hundred thousand Franks, yeerly to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer apannage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:98453:53"/>The other was an insurrection in <hi>Dijon</hi> the chief Parlement Town of<note place="margin">Anno 1630.</note> 
               <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where the King had erected a new Court for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his revenues; The Officers of this new Court grew odious, as all Innovations are, which made the Populasse to mutiny, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Vineyard-men, who in confused troupes came into <hi>Dijon,</hi> and did many insolences. The tumult came to that height, and was of that consequence that the King himself went thither in Person to appease it; which he did, by the assistance and sage conduct of the Duke <hi>de Bellegarde;</hi> he passd' an Act of abolition, provided that a tax should be laid upon the Comminalty for repairing the losses of some of his Officers who had their houses burn'd, and were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise damnified in this popular fury.</p>
            <p>In the interim the Cardinal with an Army of twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse (effectif men) were ready to traverse the Alps towards <hi>Italy,</hi> for it was not thought fit the King should venture his own Person in the second Expedition, because his Physicians had discover'd some symptomes of an approching sicknes in him; The Cardinal was accompagnied with three Marshals, <hi>Crequy, La Force,</hi> and <hi>Schomberg,</hi> who were all Generals of divers Squadrons; but the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was chiefest Director of the War; Nor did he wave the title of <hi>Generalissimo.</hi> Nor do there want presidents in France how Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals have bin Generals of Armies which shall be produc'd in the life of <hi>Richelieu</hi> hereunto annexed.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was somewat shy to let this Army passe through the body of his Countrey, or that there should be staples of corn erected in some Towns for the supply of it; which made the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall speak high language, demanding passage by vertue of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the late Peace at <hi>Susa:</hi> So the Duke was willing the Army should passe by the river <hi>Dovaire Susine,</hi> but not by <hi>Avigliana</hi> and through the Plain of <hi>Piemont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this appears in what a disadvantagious posture Nature hath placed some Princes, whose Territories are situate 'twixt greater Potentates then themselfs, which ofttimes puts them to weare double faces, and play with a staff with two ends. Such is the condition of the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the abruptnes, and stupendous craggednes of most part of his Countrey, is plac'd between two mighty Monarks, the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain, <hi>and is oftentimes put to his wits end how to comply with both, how to put off his hat to the one, and how to make a leg to the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Piemont</hi> came twise to confer with the Cardinall, though much ado happen'd for the place of meeting: The Prince of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in his fathers name to enter into an eternall Ligue with his most Christian Majesty against the Spaniard, <hi>upon condition they should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver disarme till they had made an entire conquest of Milan and Genoa;</hi> the Cardinal held this proposition extravagant, and illusory, and made of purpose to render the King odious to <hi>Italy</hi> by apprehensions of an endlesse war; thereupon having receiv'd a positif Commission from the King to make his passage by the sword, in case of further delay,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98453:54"/>
he marched before <hi>Pignerol,</hi> besieged it, and took it; whereby there<note place="margin">Anno 1630.</note> was a double advantage gain'd, a free passage for provision from <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiné;</hi> as also that the said <hi>Pignerol</hi> enchaining, as it were, <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> commanded all the valley of <hi>Piemont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The taking of <hi>Pignerol</hi> extremely troubled the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> therefore he had recourse to the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> to stir in the busines for an accommodation of things, Signieur <hi>Mazarini</hi> a moderate and well weigh'd Gentleman was joyn'd with him, and the Cardinal being return'd to <hi>Lions</hi> where the King and two Queens were, to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how matters stood; after much consultation and canvasing of the busines to and fro, they propounded certain capitulations which they thought reasonable to both parties. The <hi>Imperiall</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> party though they did not disapprove, yet they delay'd to give up their resolution upon the said Articles to gain time, and see what suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse <hi>Colalto</hi> should get before <hi>Mantova,</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> before <hi>Casal</hi> the chief Town of <hi>Monferrat; Colalto</hi> a little after made himself Master of <hi>Mantova;</hi> The French were mov'd at this, and that <hi>Casal</hi> was in so dangerous condition, as also that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was now arming apace; thereupon the King with his Cardinal repasse the Alps with an Army of 23000. foot, whereof there were 6000. <hi>Suisse,</hi> and 4000. <hi>Liegeois,</hi> and 2000. horse, besides volonteers; So he march'd to <hi>Chamberry</hi> who presently yeelded, where Conqueror like he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd the Dukes Senat, and established a Counsell of his own; he march'd thence to <hi>Constans;</hi> In the interim <hi>Crequy</hi> impatroniz'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of divers other places in <hi>Savoy;</hi> In the heat of these actions the King had a desire to visit the Queen at <hi>Lyon,</hi> whither he came, but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sick, and disabled to return himself, he sent the Duke of <hi>Monmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de' Fiat,</hi> who had bin Ambassador in <hi>England,</hi> with a French Army to joyn with Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> t'other side the Hills: The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> to prevent this conjunction, advanc'd as far as <hi>Avigliana</hi> with 20000. foot, and 4000. horse made up of Spaniards and Germans; The Armies met, and there were some thousands kill'd on both sides; Prince <hi>Doria</hi> was taken prisoner by the French, and divers other persons of quality, with seventeen Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which were sent to be hang'd up as Trophies in the great Church of <hi>Paris:</hi> The French afterward took <hi>Saluces,</hi> and so seiz'd upon all <hi>Savoy</hi> by degrees: The losse of his Town <hi>Saluces</hi> sunk so deep into the Dukes breast, that he sickned thereupon, and died foure dayes after; whereby was verified the praediction of <hi>Octavio Las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sani</hi> in an <hi>Ephemerides</hi> he had publish'd a few yeers before, that Duke <hi>Emanuel</hi> should die suddenly after the taking of <hi>Saluces,</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy he much spake of in his sicknes. A little after there was a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious fight neer <hi>Carignan,</hi> wherein a great number of Commanders and common soldiers were slain on both sides. Signieur <hi>Mazarini</hi> the Popes Agent stretch'd all the sinewes of his body, and strength of mind, to bring about a suspension of Armes, and so to pave a way for Peace; which he did with much dexterity: so there were Articles

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:98453:55"/>The King this yeer had a very hazardous fit of sicknes, in so much<note place="margin">Anno 1631.</note> that he was not onely prayed for generally throughout all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of France, but the extreme <hi>Onction</hi> was once ready to be applied unto him.</p>
            <p>About the same time the Q. Mother began to be averse to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, which aversenes came by degrees, to a strong animositie and violent indignation against him, in so much that notwithstanding the interposition of the Popes Nuncio, and divers others, it was found incapable of reconcilement. The ground of it, as some thought, was, that he had not only advis'd but incited the King to war with her two sons in law the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> but more of this in the Cardinals life apart.</p>
            <p>The three Armies which the King had in <hi>Italy</hi> were mouldred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way above the third part, by the sword, and sicknesses which raign'd amongst them; Besides the King was so drain'd for money, that he had scarce one thousand pounds remaining; and the soldiers being ready to disband beyond the Hills for want of pay, the Cardinal sent of his own moneys two hundred thousand Franks, this kept the French together in <hi>Italy</hi> till the Peace was concluded; which was done at last by the strenuous negotiation and new endevours of Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieur <hi>Mazarini</hi> the Popes Agent extraordinary, and <hi>Pancirolle</hi> the Nuncio by a Treaty which was appointed to be held at <hi>Querasque:</hi> Hereupon there were Commissioners interchangeably sent from the Emperour and the King of France who manag'd the whole busines, because the Spaniard would not be seen in it, for he came in only as an Auxiliary: the two main Articles of this Treaty were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantova;</hi> viz. <hi>That the first, should have fifteen thousand crowns yeerly revenu for all rights and pretentions to Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat:</hi> That the other should be <hi>put in present possession of the Duchyes of Mantova and Montferrat, and have to that purpose a compleat Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiture from the Emperour.</hi> Hereupon there were cautionary Hostages put in the Popes hands till performance of Articles on both sides; but by a secret capitulation, <hi>Susa</hi> and <hi>Avigliana</hi> which were part of the Hostage, at the violent instance of the French Commissioners were to be put into the hands of some of the <hi>Swiss-Cantons</hi> which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied to France, in whom, (though <hi>Protestants</hi>) it seems, the French King confided more in then in his <hi>Holines;</hi> this making of the <hi>Grisons</hi> Depositaries gave some discontentment to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> which was accommoded afterwards.</p>
            <p>These so often traverses ore the <hi>Alps,</hi> prov'd costly expeditions to France, both for men and money; for there was an account made of thirty Millions of Franks which were expended in these wars, and above one hundred thousand French perished by the sword, sicknes, and famine: there were multitudes also fell on the other side, and all this hurliburly was chiefly for a meere Ceremony, viz. an Investiture: and poor <hi>Europe</hi> hath often parted with abundance of her most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud for such Ceremonies, such any shadows, and formalities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:98453:55"/>The capitulations of the Treaty at <hi>Querasque</hi> were put in execution<note place="margin">Anno 1631.</note> by all parties, and the places that were depositated for Hostages in the Popes and Grisons hands were delivered accordingly on both sides at the time appointed: But the French after the expence of so much bloud and bullion were loth to part with <hi>Italy</hi> so, therefore a privat Treaty was set a foot 'twixt the King and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> about <hi>Pignerol;</hi> It was propounded, <hi>That in regard his Highnes had all his Countrey entirely restor'd unto him, though orerun by the French Armes, and that he had acquir'd part of Monferrat by the last wars which conduc'd more to his advantage then to any others. And that whereas his most Christian Majesty understood that the Spaniard remain'd still arm'd in</hi> Milan, <hi>and had some desseins a foot which did menace no small danger both to the Duke of Mantova, and the confederat Cantons of France; and that he had intelligence from good hands how there was a Civill War fomenting in France, by some mistrusts and divisions which were put between his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, his Mother, and</hi> Monsieur: <hi>therefore, lest his Highnes might be tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd withall to favor the projects of the Spaniard, to rid him of all scruples in this point, he desir'd that</hi> Susa &amp; Avigliana, <hi>or</hi> Pignerol &amp; Perousa <hi>might be put into his hands, to put French Garrisons in them, till these dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were pass'd. Servient</hi> the French Ambassador joyn'd with <hi>Toiras</hi> manag'd this busines so dextrously that the Duke accorded what was demanded for six moneths. Hereupon the Town and Castle of <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol</hi> with <hi>Perousa</hi> was put into the hands of the <hi>Suiss</hi> which the French had put formerly in <hi>Susa:</hi> And by the same Treaty his Majesty ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd himself to defend the person and states of his Highnes, if need requir'd with an Army of twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse; provided his Highnes should proportionably have in readines ten thousand foot, and fifteen hundred horse.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> fell into a fury when he heard of this accord, and call'd heaven and earth to witnes that it was an evident infraction of the Treaty at <hi>Querasque,</hi> by which the French were <hi>not to hold any place or passage into Italy within the states of the Duke of Savoy:</hi> So the Duke being lowdly reproach'd thereof by the Spaniard, the answer he gave was, <hi>That he might dispose of his own as he pleas'd, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>The six months being expir'd of holding <hi>Pignerol,</hi> a motion was<note place="margin">Anno 1632.</note> made to the Duke, that, for his own safety, the security of <hi>Mantova,</hi> and the French-Confederat <hi>Grisons,</hi> as also for freeing his Majesty of all surmises, and the better enabling him to occur all desseins and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, his Highnes would make an absolut sale and transport unto him of the Town and Castle of <hi>Pignerol</hi> and <hi>Perousa,</hi> for a valuable pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary consideration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Toiras</hi> and <hi>Servient</hi> carried themselfs with such dextrous addresses that they induc'd the Duke to hearken to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and afterwards they drew from him an absolut consent; so a Legal Instrument was made, whereby an irrevocable transport and vent was made of the propriety, possession, and soveraignty of the Town and Castle of <hi>Pignerol, Riva, Bodenasco,</hi> the higher <hi>Biacasco, Castagrande,</hi> and that which was within the confines of the said <hi>Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerol,</hi>

            <p>This pourchase of <hi>Pignerol</hi> brought with it another strong engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment 'twixt the King and the Duke, viz. a <hi>Ligue</hi> defensive and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, by vertu whereof the one was to furnish twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse as formerly; but the Duke was scrued up to a greater number then before, being to furnish twelve thousand foot, and two thousand horse, upon necessitie of conjunction.</p>
            <p>Our story hath sojourn'd a good while in <hi>Italy,</hi> we must now crosse again the Hills to <hi>France,</hi> where we find the Queen Mother and the Cardinall irreconcilable notwithstanding that the King himself la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd much in the busines; her passion went so high that she resolv'd never to sit in Counsell while the Cardinall was there. This aversnes to the Cardinal was also infus'd into <hi>Monsieur,</hi> who abetted his Mother, and espoused her quarrell; So without the Kings conge, he retires to <hi>Orleans,</hi> and thence to <hi>Lorain,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> then Governor of <hi>Champany</hi> attended him all the way through that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, notwithstanding that he had an intimation to the contrary from the King himself who followed Monsieur as far as <hi>Dijon,</hi> but he was too swift for him, and so could not be overtaken. Hereupon a Declaration issued out wherein the Count of <hi>Moret</hi> Monsieurs base brother, the Dukes of <hi>Elbeuf,</hi> of <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> and of <hi>Roanez, Puylau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens,</hi> President <hi>Coigneux,</hi> and <hi>Monsigot,</hi> and father <hi>Chanteloube</hi> were proclaym'd Traytors, for infusing ill counsels into <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and for accompagnying him out of the Kingdom without his Majesties consent; this <hi>Declaration</hi> was sent to be verifi'd by the Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Court paus'd upon't and excepting against the style and form of it delayed the verification putting the busines in deliberation, yet they all blam'd and unanimously condemn'd the ill counsels, and proceedings of Monsieur; The King taking an indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at this delay, sent for the whole body of the Parlement to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend him at the <hi>Louure,</hi> where, by the mouth of the Lord Keeper, they receiv'd a severe rebuke, and the Clerk of the Court bringing with him the Register of the <hi>Act of deliberation</hi> upon the former De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, was commanded to draw it off the file, and in the place thereof to put the <hi>Arrest</hi> of the Privy Counsell, whereby the said Act was annull'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with expresse inhibition to the said Court of Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to put in deliberation for the future any Declarations of that nature concerning affairs of State, but to proceed instantly to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification, and registring of them.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Monsieur from <hi>Lorain,</hi> and the Queen Mother from <hi>Bruxells</hi> writ to the King, and complain'd bitterly against the <hi>Cardinal</hi> how he would have <hi>removed her to</hi> Moulins <hi>and</hi> Angers <hi>where the contagion raignd, and so have thrust her into the jawes of death; she conjur'd him to think on the relation of Mother and Son, and that she was the person most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in his preservation, yet the Cardinal had pernicious intentions to make her die between fower walls; this was the cause she left France, and to journey thirty leagues without eating or drinking; she goes on in declaring how conformable she was to his will in all things, and how she respected his Authority in the hands of her enemies; and so concluds that not being suffer'd to live in France in the calm of her own innocency, the most sensible misery that could befall her was to be bereft of his presence, &amp;c.</hi> Besides this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter she sent another to the Parlement at <hi>Paris,</hi> with a Remonstrance against the present Government.</p>
            <p>The King returns her a harsh Answer, and cleers his Cardinal in all things; and publish'd a Declaration wherein he <hi>disadvowes that she was ever prisoner, but that she had liberty to choose any place throughout the whole Kingdome to live in, except</hi> Champany, <hi>and for more respect she should have the Government of the place and Province; he declares further that her departure with his Brothers, was plotted by those that are not only envious but enemies of the felicity of France; therefore he prohibits and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbids all his subjects of what quality or condition soever, to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence or correspondence with his said Mother and Brother, or with any of their domestic servants, or with those that are partakers of their Counsels under what pretence whatsoever.</hi>

            <p>These Articles being agreed upon, the King of France sent them to the <hi>Bavarian</hi> to approve of, and subscribe them, but the old Duke suspended his resolution many moneths, and then the <hi>Swed</hi> having gain'd the great Battail of <hi>Leipsic</hi> against the Imperialists and the <hi>Catholic Ligue,</hi> the affaires of <hi>Germany</hi> chang'd face: <hi>Charnassé</hi> the French Ambassador came from the <hi>Swedish</hi> Army not without some complaints to <hi>Paris;</hi> yet he was sent back with the Marquis of <hi>Brezé</hi> Ambassadour extraordinary to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to solicit still for a <hi>neutrality</hi> 'twixt his Army, and that of the <hi>Catholic Ligue;</hi> which was agreed upon, provided that the chief of the said <hi>Ligue</hi> would se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat their Forces, and retire into their own Territories; This decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of neutrality being brought to the <hi>Bavarian</hi> he was willing to sign it, provided that the <hi>Swed</hi> would restore what he had taken from the said <hi>Catholic Ligue</hi> since the Battail of <hi>Leipsic;</hi> for after that Battail he had made a monstrous progres and penetrated the heart of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> having now cross'd the <hi>Rhine</hi> (which he had promis'd not to do without the French Kings consent) and seiz'd upon the City of <hi>Metz</hi> where he now kept a Court Emperour-like; The French Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors proposing unto him a restitution of what he had taken from the <hi>Catholic Ligue,</hi> he refus'd it, whereupon there were high words pass'd twixt him, and the Ambassadors, so the <hi>neutrality</hi> ceas'd, and turn'd to hostility afterwards, and the <hi>Swed</hi> commanded all Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to void the Town of <hi>Mentz</hi> for fear they had intelligence with some Spanish Troups that were at <hi>Spire;</hi> but that order was revok'd by the mediation of the French Ambassadors; so the alliance lasted still twixt the two Kings.</p>

Secondly, That the said Duke shall not treat, or make any Alliance with any Prince or State what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, without the knowledge and consent of the said King. Thirdly, That he cause to retire out of his Countrey all such that are enemies to the King, and that he shall give neither passe nor safe conduct to any of his subjects that have gone out of France against his pleasure. Fourthly, That no Military leavies be made in his Countrey against his Majesties service, nor that any of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects serve or assist his enemies. Fifthly, That he shall give liberty and power to them who shall be sent from the King to seiz upon and arrest any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious subjects being accus'd and convinc'd of Treason;</hi> These with other Articles were agreed upon in this Treaty which the King would not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mence unles he had first deliver'd up <hi>Marsal</hi> a strong tenable place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In such a posture, as we told you before that Nature had plac'd the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>in the self same posture</hi> (<hi>the quality of the soyles excepted</hi>) <hi>may the Duke of</hi> Lorain <hi>be said to be, being situated 'twixt mightier Potentats then himself, who, as once the Lion did increpat the innocent Lamb for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the waters, may make him the subject of their displeasure and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage at any time to devoure him: But the</hi> Lorrener <hi>of the two, is in a worse condition then the</hi> Savoyard, <hi>being homageable to the Emperour and the King of France, holding</hi> Lorain <hi>in fee of the one, and the Duchy of</hi> Bar <hi>of the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Treaty at <hi>Vic</hi> 'twixt the King and the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> was in agitation, the Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> and <hi>Schomberg</hi> took <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envic,</hi> whence they marchd before the Town of <hi>Tryers,</hi> the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whose Archbishop the King had undertaken, he being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the seven Electors <hi>Lord High Chancelor of France,</hi> as he of <hi>Collen</hi> is of <hi>Italy,</hi> and he of <hi>Mentz</hi> of <hi>Germany; Tryers</hi> in a short time fell to parley, and so rendred herself upon honorable termes.</p>
            <p>In this yeer there came an Ambassador from the Emperour of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco</hi> to the Court of France, who afterwards went to his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> taking <hi>France</hi> first in his way, as she stood; he brought a Letter in Arabic to this effect.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> being thus surpriz'd, was made unable to assist <hi>Monsieur</hi> as he expected; nor could he have any supplies from Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders because of the siege at <hi>Maestrict,</hi> yet he enters France with eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred horse, most of them strangers, as <hi>Liegeois</hi> and <hi>Crabats;</hi> He publish'd a Manifesto to justifie his taking of Arms, <hi>Charging</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu <hi>with the usurpation, and dissipation of</hi> France, <hi>and that he had no other intent but to let his Majesty know how much he was deceived, and so exhorted all good Frenchmen to assist him in his laudable desseins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King caus'd a counter-Manifesto to be proclaimed, declaring them Traytors in the highest degree that should adhere to</hi> Monsieur, <hi>yet if he would lay down his Arms, and submit himself within the compas of forty dayes after the publication of the said</hi> Manifesto, <hi>he would forget all faults pass'd, and</hi> Monsieur <hi>should find such welcome that he should have cause to extoll the Kings goodnes, and detest the pernicious counsels that had bin given him:</hi> The King doubting that <hi>words</hi> would little prevail without the <hi>sword,</hi> dispatch'd Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> with ten thousand foot, and twelve hundred horse to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> because he understood that <hi>Monsieur</hi> would draw in <hi>Monmorency</hi> to joyn him, which he did, with foure Bishops more: the Duke of <hi>Monmorency</hi> then Governor of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> summons the States together, wherein he declar'd himself for Monsieur, and never to separat from his interests till the Government was reform'd.</p>
            <p>The King hearing of <hi>Monmorencies</hi> revolt was extreamly incens'd, and the more because he had sent him extraordinary Commission, and money besides to raise Troups for his service, wherewith he was now ready to bandy against him, therupon he commanded his House

            <p>
               <hi>Monsieur</hi> and <hi>Monmorency</hi> were grown so strong that the King in Person with an Army of twenty thousand foot, and two thousand horse went to suppresse them: Some of the Kings Army was about <hi>Castel nau-d' Arry,</hi> under the command of <hi>Schomberg,</hi> where <hi>Monmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi> in a martiall heat, but more in a desperat then valiant resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accompagnied with the Earls of <hi>Rieux,</hi> and <hi>Fevillade,</hi> and only eight horse more fac'd and set upon the Royalists, broak the ranks of some of them, kill'd divers, and hurt many; but after he was hurt himself in the face, and in sundry places about his body so that he fell off his horse, and cried out for a Confessor; so one of his men taking him upon his back, he was taken prisoner and carried upon a ladder to <hi>Castel nau d' Arry:</hi> In the said conflict was kill'd one of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great's base sons the Count of <hi>Moret,</hi> with the fore-mentioned Earls of <hi>Rieux</hi> and <hi>Fevillade,</hi> and the whole Army was routed.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all these provocations the King sent a gracious Message to <hi>Monsieur</hi> inviting him to come unto him, and the same day Monsieur had sent to the King <hi>Chaudebonne</hi> with these Propositions: 1.

            <p>This Letter was seconded a little after with Articles to this effect. 1. That Monsieur should acknowledge his fault by writing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire the King to forget and pardon. 2. That he give the best assurance he can not to fall into a relaps. 3. To have no intelligence with <hi>Spain, Lorain</hi> or any other strange Prince, nor with the Queen his Mother as long as she continues in the case she stands, and to sojourn in what place the King shall appoint him. 4. That he mingle not his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests with those that were his Complices and ill counsellors which must be proceeded against according to law, yet, amongst them his domesticks shall be exempted. 5. That <hi>Puy Laurens</hi> who suggested these ill Counsels into him sincerely confesse what further practises
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98453:59"/>
were intended against the <hi>State,</hi> and that he acknowledge himself<note place="margin">Anno 1633.</note> culpable, before he receive grace.</p>
            <p>To all these Monsieur subscrib'd in this forme. <hi>We</hi> Gaston <hi>son of France, unic Brother to the King, Duc of Orleans, Chartres and Valois, Earl of Blois do consent to what is propounded by his Majesty, and upon the word and faith of a Prince we promise a religious performance of all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: We promise besides to conspire with all our power to all the good des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seins of the King for the grandeur and safety of his Kingdoms, and to love them that love his Majesty, and specially our Cosen the Cardinall of</hi> Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu, <hi>whom we hold to be necessary to the Person and States of the King for his fidelity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this a Declaration was publish'd for all strangers that came in with Monsieur to quit the Kingdom within 8. dayes; some of the chiefest instruments of this sollevation were cut off by the sword of Justice, and amongst other the foure Bishops spoken of before, were legally proceeded against, by a speciall Brief from Rome wherein there were foure Archbishops nominated as Deligats to judge them, whereof the Archbishop and Prince of <hi>Arles</hi> was chief; though the ancient form of proceeding against Prelats for crimes was us'd to be by a <hi>Synod</hi> of the Gallic Bishops: Not one of the foresaid Delinquent Bishops was condem'd to die, only the Bishop of <hi>Albi</hi> was depriv'd of his Bishoprick, and confin'd to a Monastery to eat the bread of sorrow.</p>
            <p>There fell this yeer upon the Kings return from <hi>Narbon</hi> through <hi>Languedoc</hi> in a sudden showr of rain such huge cataracts of water from the Airie Region, that two hundred persons were drownd upon the highwayes, four Coches of the Queens, and fifty Carts were swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the deluge.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Monmorency</hi> being taken prisoner was carried to <hi>Tholouse</hi> where he was to receive his tryall not by his Peers but by the ordinary way of Justice, he was legally convicted and condemn'd; there were all means possible us'd for his pardon, but the King was inflexible, so with exemplary patience and piety he pai'd Nature her last tribut; he put off his doublet himself, and cut off his hair and mustachos before he came to the Block.</p>
            <p>Thus fell <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmorency</hi> Duke, Peer, and Marshall, and of the ancientest extractions of <hi>France,</hi> in so much that <hi>Henry</hi> the Great was us'd to say, that he was a better Gentleman then himself; the Motto in his Scutcheon was <hi>Dieu aide le premier Chevalier Chrestien,</hi> God preserve the first Christian Cavalier; he left no son nor male Heir behind, so this Illustrious Family went out like a snuffe, <hi>such an ill-savor'd sent Rebellion leaves behind it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur for not obtaining <hi>Monmorencys</hi> pardon, though he had prevayl'd for the Dukes of <hi>Elbaeuf,</hi> and <hi>Bellegarde,</hi> grew again discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and forsakes France; The Cardinall of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had at this time a dangerous fit of sicknes, so that a great while the infirmities of his body would not give him leave to exercise the functions of his

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> appearing more for the House of <hi>Austria</hi> then the <hi>Sweds</hi> in the German war, the King to quarrell with him, deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded homage for the Duchy of <hi>Bar,</hi> the Duke wav'd the performance of this ceremony, alledging <hi>that those homages which were pretended to be done by his Progenitors were but visits and complements, not any reall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes, there being no act upon record for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There happend another occasion of displeasure against the Duke in that the Princess <hi>Margaret</hi> was maried to <hi>Monsieur</hi> not only without the Kings consent, but expresly against his command; It being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd that Matches with that Family have bin fatall, and that <hi>Lorain milk</hi> have engendred but ill <hi>bloud</hi> in France. So he arms mainly against the Duke, and being advanced as far as <hi>Nancy</hi> the Duke and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal had conference, but in the interim his sister the Princesse went in Pages apparell out of the Town, and got to Brussels to <hi>Monsieur</hi> her husband where the marriage, which was before but clandestin, was publicly consummated; The Duke did much complement with the King, sending him word, <hi>That if the gates of Nancy were not wide enough to let him in, he would pull down the walls, to make him entrance:</hi> The Duke had a safe conduct to come to the Kings Army to treat with the Cardinal, who prov'd too hard for him, in so much that he was forc'd to yeeld that the King should enter <hi>Nancy,</hi> or remain pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner; This made him afterward tax both King and Cardinal with a contravention of their promises and faith. So <hi>Nancy</hi> was rendred for a time, and a French Garrison was plac'd there, in lieu of the old which consisted of 2300. foot, and 230. horse. After this the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish'd the Archbishop of <hi>Tryers</hi> in his estates, and so returnd tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly to <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This yeer the Duke of <hi>Crequy</hi> was sent Ambassadour to <hi>Rome</hi> in a most splendid equipage to prostrat at the Popes feet all the trophies got of them of the Religion; That Saint-like Lady the Archduchesse <hi>Clara Eugenia Isabellad' Austria,</hi> Governesse of Flanders died about this time; and Monsieur understanding that the <hi>Infant</hi> Cardinal, the King of Spaines youngest brother, was to come thither to govern, he<note place="margin">Anno 1634.</note> began to think of his return to France; besides the Spaniards began to have some sinister surmises of him, in regard he did not command a Bonfire to be made before his house in joy of the Battail at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingben;</hi> so making semblance one morning to go a hauking he posted privatly to France (leaving his wife and mother behind) without bidding any farewell, or giving thanks for his entertainment all the while, which was so costly to <hi>Spaine;</hi> so the King and he were peec'd again now the fourth time.</p>

            <p>France was in an extreme high and triumphant condition at this time; And being in a perfect tranquillity within doores, she fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the establishment of wholsome laws, therefore divers Edicts were publish'd; one for the reformation of <hi>Abbeys,</hi> another for suppressing the lux and superfluities in apparell, with an inhibition to wear gold and silver lace, and other gaudy trimmings: a third for regulating of Military Discipline, and the biliting of Soldiers: a fourth, that they of the Religion should entertain no strange Ministers. There was also a Royall <hi>Botomicall</hi> Garden made in <hi>Paris,</hi> for the culture of medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Plants, and other curiosities; Moreover there was a company of Marchants erected for <hi>new France</hi> in the Indies for the advancement of traffic.

            <p>We will finish this fifth Lustre with a remarkable passage that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in <hi>Italy. Gasper Galilei Galileo</hi> a man exactly vers'd in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematiques, of profound speculations and high reaches, having more then ordinary inspections into the motions of heavenly Bodies, (witnes that rare Prospectif of his) publish'd a Book intituled, <hi>A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue of the two Systems of the World, of Ptolomey and Copernicus;</hi> Wherein (with the latter) he upholds that the Sun is the Centre of the world standing alwayes still, and that the Earth as the rest of her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Elements together with the Planets and fixed Stars, are in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall motion: In the Convent of <hi>Minerva, Galileo</hi> recanted this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Suns repose, and the Earths motion, because it was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to holy Scripture, &amp; so by consequence a heresie; yet because he had taught it his Disciples, his punishment was to be in prison during pleasure, his penance was, that for three yeers he should repeat the seven penitentiall Psalmes once every week: a milder sentence far then <hi>Vigilius</hi> the Bishop had about the times of the Primitive Church for maintaining there were <hi>Antipodes,</hi> for which he was condemn'd to die, that opinion being held then to be a monstrous Paradox, though our modern Navigators have long since evinc'd the truth of it: It hath bin alwayes the method of providence to impart knowledge to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by certain degrees, as we find it true commonly in our Mundan negotiations, that <hi>posterior dies, est prioris Magister;</hi> I could enlarge my self further upon this Theam were it pertinent to my main histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical subject, but being not, I put a period to it, and to this fifth Lustre.</p>

            <p>THis Lustre begins with sound of Drum and Trumpet more lowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then any of the former, it begins with an open rupture of the peace 'twixt the two mighty Monarques of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> 'Tis true, there had bin formerly, ever since the beginning of the <hi>German</hi> wars, and those of <hi>Italy</hi> and the <hi>Grisons</hi> some clashings and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buffs between them, but it was in an Auxiliary <hi>collateral</hi> way, each of them (according to his severall interest) reaching his hand to his friend, and assisting his Confederat, and those which put themselfs under their protection; but this yeer you shall find there will be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic profess'd enmity by cry of Herald proclaim'd between the two Kings though brothers, each of them having one anothers sister in their beds for twenty yeers together.</p>
            <p>The House of <hi>Austria</hi> had had an extraordinary good yeer of the last, for after the Battail of <hi>Norlinghen,</hi> which was the greatest victory he obtain'd (except that of <hi>Prague</hi> against the Prince <hi>Palatine</hi>) since the beginning of the <hi>German</hi> wars, he push'd on his good fortune and invaded the Territories of the Duke of <hi>Wittemberg</hi> and Marquis of <hi>Baden</hi> or <hi>Durlas;</hi> besides he sets upon the City of <hi>Triers</hi> and seizeth upon Her, with her Archbishop the <hi>Elector,</hi> whom he carried away prisoner notwithstanding that he had put himself under the shadow of the <hi>Flower-de-luce:</hi> Add hereunto that by the advantage of yce he took the strong Tower of <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> where the <hi>French</hi> were put to the sword, and the <hi>Germans</hi> spar'd; The reduction of this place was of such consequence, that it help'd to secure <hi>Heidelberg, Manheim, Worms, Spire, Frankfort, Mentz, Crusnack, Frankindal and Treves,</hi> all which places were master'd by the <hi>Imperialists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though all these were properly the Emperours acts, yet <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> father'd them upon the Spaniard who contributed, that which is the greatest sinew of War, viz. <hi>Money</hi> to assist his <hi>Uncle.</hi> And being sensible of these mighty progresses and growth of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> they thought it high time to look about them, so there came Commissioners extraordinary from <hi>Holland</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> and a Ligue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive and offensive was struck between them to make a social con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive war in the Netherlands against the King of Spain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the most <hi>materiall</hi> Articles of which Ligue, for we are loth to stuff this History with <hi>formalities,</hi> were these.</p>

               <hi>hath receiv'd divers times from that of Spain are so well known to all the world, that it is needles to renue their memory: We have a long time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled the hatred and naturall jealousie the Spaniards have against France, whereby they have alwayes stopp'd the course of Our prosperity by secret pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises, oppressed the Princes allied to this Crown, and sought to dismember the Kingdome; Therefore with those forces which God hath given Us We have resolv'd to prevent their further desseins upon Us, and rather to carry Our Armes within their Countrey, then expect theirs in Ours, &amp;c.</hi> Then He goes on to enumerat the obligations that <hi>Spain</hi> had to <hi>France</hi> for making the last truce with the <hi>Hollander,</hi> which <hi>Spain</hi> had so much need of at that time; the good Offices he had done the <hi>Emperour</hi> upon the beginning of the troubles in <hi>Germany;</hi> so he taxes him that the first recompence which <hi>France</hi> receiv'd was the occupation of the <hi>Valtolin</hi> from the <hi>Grisons</hi> the ancient Allies of <hi>France;</hi> he complains further that the Treaty at <hi>Mouson</hi> was not executed as it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; He speaks of sundry enterprises upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> while he was Confederat of <hi>France,</hi> of the violent oppression which the Duke of <hi>Mantova</hi> suffer'd; How the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> arm'd five times against <hi>France</hi> by the suscitation of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> How the said King Treated with the chief of them of the Religion to form a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall body of Rebellion in the bowels of France at that time when he promis'd assistance against them; How his Ambassadors continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally practised to sow division between them of the Royall Family; How he assisted with men and money those that made rents and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in France; How to bring about his far fetch'd designes for the Westerne Monarchy, he made <hi>Flanders</hi> his Arcenal for Arms, not only to subdue <hi>them</hi> whom he had acknowledg'd <hi>free and soverain,</hi> but to keep <hi>France</hi> in perpetuall jealousie of surprisals by a veteran Army; therefore he thought it more honorable to attain unto a sound secure Peace by the generous strength of an open war then let his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects drop away by small numbers, and languish under a doubtfull and incertain Peace which must be conserv'd with 150000. men. Then he comes to speak of the outrage that was done to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Triers,</hi> and the jeering illusory answer which was return'd about his liberty; Then he speaks of his <hi>most deer great friends,</hi> Allies, and Confederats the <hi>States</hi> of the united Provinces with whom he had made a Ligue defensive and offensive, but with this Proviso, that what Towns or places whatsoever were taken, the <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion should not be damnified, but conserv'd still in the same condition; Then he makes his addresse to the <hi>Flemins</hi> that if within two moneths they cause the Spaniards to retire from their Towns and Provinces, they shall be joyn'd and united into a body of one free and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>State,</hi> with all rights of soveraignty: So he concluds with an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction to all his subjects to make war by sea and land, night and day against the King of Spain a declar'd Enemy to his <hi>Person</hi> and state; protesting before God and men that as he was reduc'd to the utmost

extremity to take up arms for his own defence, and for his Allies and<note place="margin">Anno 1635.</note> friends, so his main end, and only aime was to procure an universall and well grounded peace throughout Christendom.</p>
            <p>Before this Declaration was divulg'd a Herald of Arms was sent to <hi>Brussells</hi> where he publicly pronounc'd war against the King of Spain in the Market place, and so in every Town at his return to France, and he pass'd to and fro without any outrage at all.</p>
            <p>The King had five Royall Armies in motion this Sommer; the first in <hi>Lorain</hi> under the Duke of <hi>Angoulesme, &amp; de la Force;</hi> the second under the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> wherewith <hi>Bernard Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> joyn'd: The third was under the Duke of <hi>Crequy</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Savoyard</hi> and <hi>Parmasan</hi> joyn'd: The fourth was under the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Venetians</hi> and <hi>Grisons</hi> joyn'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the <hi>Valtolin:</hi> The fifth was under the Marshall <hi>Chastillon</hi> in <hi>Picardy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first did some exploits, against the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> where <hi>Ihon deWert, Coloredo,</hi> and the Baron of <hi>Clinchant</hi> took Saint <hi>Mihel</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>The second under <hi>de la Valette</hi> who had Coronell <hi>Hebron</hi> and divers Scots of his Army, and having taken <hi>Binghen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and other places, he had a shrewd conflict with <hi>Galas</hi> neer <hi>Boulac,</hi> where a great many of French Nobles and Gentlemen were slain, so that this Army made not so good returns as the first.</p>
            <p>The third under <hi>Rohan</hi> thrive well, he fortified many places in the <hi>Valtolin,</hi> and had a shrewd fight neer <hi>Bormio,</hi> defeated <hi>Sarbellon,</hi> and 3000. were slain upon the place.</p>
            <p>The fourth under <hi>Crequy</hi> performed much in Italy, divers places were taken in the Countrey of <hi>Alexandrin,</hi> but laying a siege before <hi>Valentia</hi> he was forc'd to raise it.</p>
            <p>The fifth under <hi>Chastillon</hi> had the best fortune of any, for being to joyn with the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> at <hi>Maestricht,</hi> he met in the way with Prince <hi>Tomaso</hi> at <hi>Avein</hi> neer <hi>Namur,</hi> where after a tough serious fight above 3000. of the enemies fell, 1500. men taken prisoners, 95. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and 16. peeces of Ordnance. After this exploit the French Army marchd towards <hi>Maestricht</hi> through the Countrey of <hi>Liege</hi> where <hi>Chastillon</hi> met with the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> and <hi>Bovillon,</hi> there were high acclamations of joy at the conjunction of both Armies who came to the number specified in the Treaty, all effectif men: Add hereunto that there was a third Army of the Duke of <hi>Bovillons;</hi> In so much that there was never since the beginning of the <hi>Belgique</hi> war a greater and more numerous body of Military strength at one time, an Army able to gain an Empire, for it was compos'd of neer upon 70000. combatants whereof there were above 10000. horse; but their achievements and succes was not answerable to their power, for they took but two mean Towns <hi>Tillemont</hi> and <hi>Diest</hi> and the Castle of <hi>Dormaet;</hi> the first was pittifully pillag'd, nor could the French sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers be kept within any limits of awe but they did violat and plunder
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98453:63"/>
both Churches and Convents, and committed many other strange<note place="margin">Anno 1635.</note> outrages; The Armies then march'd as far as <hi>Brussells,</hi> and took pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners out of the very suburbs, but it was held neither safe to sit down before the place, nor a thing feasible to take it, the <hi>Cardinal Infante</hi> being intrench'd not far off in a very advantagious post; therefore the Armies came before <hi>Lovain,</hi> where they presently began their batteries, the Marquis of <hi>Varennes</hi> with divers French fell there and divers more; They of the Town made a furious sally upon the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish quarters, wherein Sir <hi>Charles Morgan</hi> was hurt, and eighty more slain, but in a short space they were repell'd to the Town with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable losse; They made two brave sallies more upon <hi>Chastillons</hi> quarters a little after; but the tenth day the siege was rais'd, and the Town quite cleer'd of so vast an Army; the reasons of the raising of this siege were, first, a great necessity of provision; the second the strength of the enemy, for <hi>Piccolomini</hi> was come to <hi>Namur</hi> with a fresh Army; lastly, the ignorance they had of the quality of the place in point of strength, and her neernes to the greatest Towns in <hi>Brabant,</hi> as <hi>Antwerp, Brussells, Malines,</hi> with other.</p>
            <p>These huge Armies being retreated from before <hi>Lovain,</hi> the nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Crabats</hi> did notably plague their reeres; and carried away good booties; <hi>Diest</hi> was also repris'd, and the French Army being before <hi>Venlo</hi> news came that the famous Sconce of <hi>Schenk</hi> was taken by the Spanish Garrison of <hi>Gueldres;</hi> as also that the Duke of <hi>Saxe</hi> the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentest Prince of Germany, and the <hi>Dictator</hi> of the Protestants had made his peace with the Emperour; besides that <hi>Iean de Wert</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded, and extremely ravag'd <hi>Lorain</hi> up and down, which made <hi>Chastillon</hi> trusse up his baggage, and leave <hi>Venlo</hi> and think upon home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: Thus this formidable French Army melted away to a small number, nor could they who were left, know which way to return to France; so most of them were sent by Sea from <hi>Flushing</hi> and other places; neverthelesse had their retreat bin answerable to their first entrance into the Netherlands when <hi>Chastillon</hi> gain'd such a notable victory of Prince <hi>Tomaso,</hi> they had made a gallant Expedition of it; but it was observ'd that after their sacriledges at <hi>Tillemont</hi> the Wind blew alwaies in their faces, and nothing prosper'd with them.</p>
            <p>Besides sundry good successes by <hi>Land,</hi> the Spaniard this yeer had some prosperous gales at <hi>Sea;</hi> for the Duke <hi>Fernandin,</hi> and the Marquis <hi>de sancte Cruz</hi> took from the French, with 22. Gallies and 5. Galeons, two Islands in the Mediterranean, call'd <hi>Sancta Margarita,</hi> and Saint <hi>Honorat;</hi> which much prejudic'd the Trade of <hi>Provence,</hi> and all maritime commerce to Italy.</p>
            <p>Young <hi>Oxenstern</hi> the Chancelor of Swedens son came in a gay equippage Ambassador to France this yeer; he was treated with no common esteem, and at his departure the King took off his finger a rich Ring which he wore that day of purpose to give him; The said <hi>Oxenstern</hi> passing over to England upon the like employment, though his reception was altogether as good, and his present as valuable, yet he refus'd the latter.</p>

Gallies, of which squadron the Bishop of <hi>Nants</hi> was Director in chief, who, with him of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> left his spirituall <hi>See,</hi> to try his fortunes on the salt <hi>Sea;</hi> he was embark'd in the gran Galeon of the Duke of <hi>Guyses,</hi> of 1200.

            <p>During these traverses at Sea, there was notable doings by Land, for <hi>Piccolomini</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> enter'd and overwhelm'd <hi>Picardy</hi> like two impetuous torrents, and carried all before them, they ravag'd and plundred most lamentably the poore Pesans and Villages all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, they took <hi>la Capelle,</hi> nor could the strength the Count of <hi>Soissons</hi> had in that Province withstand them; the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> was then beating the walls of <hi>Dole,</hi> but having long layn before the Town, and having spent much powder, and a considerable number of men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, he was forc'd to raise the siege, to make head against those fearfull incursions the Imperialists made up and down <hi>Picardy;</hi> their Army consisted of divers squadrons of <hi>Germans, Polanders,</hi> and <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats; Soissons</hi> met with the <hi>Pole,</hi> and caus'd him to retire to <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg;</hi> where he took breath, and afterwards came on more furiously then before, he took <hi>Moniauban,</hi> and three places more which he fir'd, and carried away men, women and children: Prince <hi>Tomaso</hi> was chief of these flying Armies which in all consisted of above 15000. horse, and so many foot; They took afterwards <hi>Catelet,</hi> and push'd on their march as far as the River of <hi>Somme</hi> where they seiz'd on <hi>Bray,</hi> and cross'd the River, took <hi>Royé</hi> with divers other places: being thus got into the very bowels of <hi>Picardy</hi> the <hi>Crabats</hi> had a brave time of it who subsist chiefly by pillage, they rob Churches, cloisters, Convents, Monasteries, and the Altars themselfs, nor can the opinion of holines exempt any thing from rapine; a little after <hi>Corby</hi> rendred her self, and then a generall summons was publish'd in the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> name for all the Townes of <hi>Picardy</hi> to render themselfs, and they should have good quarter.</p>
            <p>This sudden inundation of so many forren people, and such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous incursions, struck an earthquake into the hearts of all men, and <hi>Paris</hi> her self trembled more then any place; many thousands of

            <p>This gave a generall alarm to the whole Kingdom, and <hi>Paris</hi> quak'd more then any place, in so much that she began to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie apace, the Burgesses by the <hi>Provosts</hi> command, and the Schollers by the <hi>Rectors,</hi> put themselfs in armes: there were extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions made, and 15000. men suddenly rais'd to go towards <hi>Picardy: Monsieur</hi> was appointed Generall, who in his march en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd daily more and more in great numbers, to make head against this formidable Invasion, or rather Irruption.</p>
            <p>The common people being thus startled and scared, one might hear up and down both in Town and Countrey whole volleys of curses discharg'd upon <hi>Richelieu,</hi> who was cryed up to be the source of all these evils, because they conceiv'd 'twas by his counsell the King had denounc'd open war against the Spaniard the yeer before; but the strong reflex of Royall favor, and the former good successes he had, took away much of the gaul against him.</p>
            <p>The Royall Army under <hi>Monsieur,</hi> who was accompagnied with the flower of all the Nobility of France, and was now neer upon forty thousand Combatants, being advanc'd far into <hi>Picardy,</hi> the first ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploit he perform'd was the reprisall of <hi>Royé</hi> by siege, then he took <hi>Bretevil;</hi> but a little before <hi>Iohn de Wert</hi> had given a smart blow to the Count of <hi>Esfeld</hi> who had a Brigade of <hi>Germans,</hi> &amp; a good number of French horse commanded by <hi>Gassion</hi> for the Kings service. The Royall Army came before <hi>Corbie</hi> at last, where a Leager was planted seven Leagues compasse, and the Town held them good play for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers moneths, whence the Spaniards made sundry notable sallies.</p>
            <p>The Imperiall Army under <hi>Galas</hi> was now got into <hi>Burgundy,</hi> where he took <hi>Mirebeau,</hi> and sundry other places which he pillag'd and burnt; in the interim the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> who commanded one of the flying Armies had lai'd siege before Saint <hi>Iohn de Lone,</hi> and <hi>Galas</hi> recruted him with men, and ammunition, but the place being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and it being now neere the dead of Winter, <hi>Galas</hi> gave out he had order to return to <hi>Germany</hi> which he did, and so the Duke of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain</hi> rays'd his siege, and sent divers complaints to the Emperor against <hi>Galas</hi> his Generall, but they came to nothing.</p>
            <p>Thus that huge deluge ceas'd in France, which did such a world of mischief that the Goths, Vandalls, or Saracens never did the like for the time, nor was this the sole disaster that befell France this yeer, for the Viceroy of <hi>Pampelona</hi> took Saint <hi>Iohn de Luz</hi> tother side the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; besides <hi>Mentz, Coblens,</hi> and <hi>Hanaw</hi> were rendred to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rialists, in all which much of the Garrisons were French: I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this yeer with the public baptisme of <hi>Madamoiselle, Monsieurs</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This yeer a more propitious Planet cast an influence upon <hi>France,</hi> then fell upon her in the former, as will appear by the succes of things; We will begin with the reprisall of the Isles of <hi>Lerins,</hi> call'd Saint <hi>Margaret</hi> and Saint <hi>Honorat:</hi> some of the Provensall Gentlemen shew'd much Passion for the honor of their Countrey to which those Islands belong'd, by divers proofs of valeur, and their names were enroul'd in a public instrument which stands upon record to posterity in the Court of Parlement; there were mighty preparatives made for the said Expedition, and sundry persons of quality parted with their bloud, and some with their lifes in the quarrell; but whether the benefit did countervail the vast charge of recovering two or three small rocks it was much question'd, yet the work was done, and it left behind it an astonishment of the navall power of France.</p>
            <p>The King had three Land Armies this Spring towards the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of the <hi>Netherlands;</hi> the first towards <hi>Cambray</hi> commanded by the Duke <hi>de la Valette;</hi> the second towards <hi>Artois</hi> whereof <hi>Milleray</hi> was chief; the third under <hi>Chastillon</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Champany</hi> and <hi>Luxemburg:</hi> The first took two or three Castles by surprize, and then sate before <hi>Landrecy,</hi> which after a stubborn siege was yeelded at last to <hi>De la Valette,</hi> the exploit was reputed the greater, because in times pass'd <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour had lain before <hi>Landrecy</hi> with thirty thousand foot, and fifteen thousand horse six moneths toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then was forc'd to steale away in the night from before the place; After this the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> took <hi>Beaumont; la Capelle</hi> was also rendred after the brunt of a short siege. But a hotter siege and soyle calls me now to the <hi>Pyreney</hi> Hills, where the Spaniards had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd themselfs strongly before <hi>Leucate</hi> a Frontier town twixt <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> and <hi>Cataloma</hi> with a resolution to carry it: The Duke of <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luin</hi> was employ'd upon this service, assisted by the Archbishop of <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> Of the Spaniards the Count of <hi>Serbellon</hi> an Italian and a great Captain was Commander in chief; there happen'd many bloudy, and exceeding hot skirmiges betwixt the two Nations, but at last the Spaniard was forc'd to quit his trenches and leave thirty two great Guns of all sorts behind him, with the losse of three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men; Amongst the dead bodies some women were found ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited like men, which being shew'd the Spaniards that were taken prisoners, and ask'd what women they were, they answer'd, <hi>Those poltrons that fled away were women, not these;</hi> with this agrees a Rodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montado a Captain left upon a wall, <hi>O Frenchmen, if you had comported your selfs in this encounter as you have us'd to do; and if we had shew'd our selfs such men as the world cries us up to be, your actions had bin ours, and ours yours.</hi> The Spaniards which were taken prisoners would salute the French Gentlemen by the title of <hi>Seno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>res Lutheranos,</hi> thinking

            <p>The King was so well pleas'd with this service that he conferr'd honors upon divers of the Commanders, and especially upon the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</hi> to whom he writ this following Letter to be Marshall of France.</p>

            <p>Questionles this was a peece of service of high merit, and of mighty consequence to France, for had the Spaniard nestled in <hi>Leucato</hi> a strong tenable place, they had had a key to enter presently into <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> at pleasure: the said young Duke of <hi>Halluin</hi> stirr'd himself no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, and going in the front of his Troups alwayes with his naked sword had receiv'd divers hurts; nor did the Spaniards who had above twelve thousand foot, and two thousand horse, shew themselfs cowards, for notwithstanding the Town pelted them on the one side, and the Royall Army on the other which was greater in number then they, yet they sallied out of their Trenches, and encountred them five severall times.</p>
            <p>This siege of <hi>Leucato</hi> was contemporary with that of <hi>Breda</hi> by the Hollanders this yeer, before which the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> lay so close and secure, that as the Cardinal <hi>Infante</hi> could not hinder his first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment, so he could not afterwards oblige him to fight; but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving twenty thousand foot, and six thousand horse, he struck into <hi>Gueldres</hi> and took <hi>Venlo</hi> and <hi>Ruremond:</hi> So <hi>Breda</hi> was given for lost, and after three moneths siege she yeelded upon the same tearms that <hi>Spinola</hi> had given twelve yeers before; though he lay five times lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger before the Town: The Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> made his entrance the ninth of <hi>September</hi> at the same gate which Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> had erected with this memorable Inscription in huge golden Characters.</p>

            <p>We will conclude this yeer with the conversion of <hi>Francis Cupif</hi> a Doctor of <hi>Sorbon</hi> to the Reform'd Religion; whereupon the <hi>Faculty</hi> of Theologie pronounc'd this rigid Decree against him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is very properly, and with great reason that the Apostle rankes He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies amongst crimes, and carnall sins, because we often perceive, that by a secret judgement of God, those use to fall, and tomble into them, who swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the vanity and confidence of their own sense, or walking according to the flesh, suffer not themselfs to be led by the Spirit of God, nor beleeve that they are tied to any rule, but they tast nothing but what pleaseth man as he is a sensitive Animal: Whereof</hi> Francis Cupif <hi>of</hi> Angers <hi>whom the Sacred Faculty had nourish'd before in her bosom, and at last unhappily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd into the number of her Doctors, to the great scandall of all good men, and the applause of the enemies of the Crosse of Christ, hath lately given a horrid, and most deplorable example. For according to the honour that was conferr'd upon him in our Schoole, not minding the law he had receiv'd from so good a mother, which might have drawn down upon his head all graces from God and men, and having quite forgot the oath which he had made so oft, and whereunto according to ancient institution all new graduats, and all such who are promoted to the degree of Doctorships are solemnly oblig'd; He is miserably fallen from the holy Catholic Church, whereby he hath drawn upon himself the losse of his soule before God, shame and infamy before men, and malediction from all parts; This imprudent son is become the grief and sadnes of his Mother, then, when by a perfidious prevarication abjuring the true Doctrin, he hath most impudently turn'd Heretic, giving up his name to impiety and falshood. But whence can it proceed, that he should so easily fall into so fearfull a precipice, but from the naturall presumption of his own judgement, and from the ardor of unbridled pleasure, wherewith they that neerly knew him perceiv'd that he incessantly burnt? Whence it comes to passe that being blinded, and walking continually according to his own covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, having shaken off the sweet and light yoak of Iesus Christ, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a voluntary slave to Heresie, which is the height of all sins. It being therefore true, that, as the Christian Emperours said, Whatsoever is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted against Divine Religion becomes injurious to all, with greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Sacred Faculty of Theologie hath beleev'd that the wrong which is done Iesus Christ, and to the Catholic faith by this degenerat child, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern her so far as to pronounce a grave censure according to the atrocity of</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:98453:66"/>
               <hi>the crime, against such a notorious infamy, and to separat him totally from</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1637.</note> 
               <hi>Her, and her noursery, though it be nothing at all to be fear'd that such Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard Plants will take any deep roots. Cursed be thou degenerat Child, which goest on after thine own counsell, not according to mine, which warpest a web, but not by my direction, which dost adde sin to sin, which goest down to Egypt, and to the Synagogue of Satan, and consultest not with me, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrest my precepts; Thou hast rejected my discipline, hoping for succour in the help of</hi> Calvin <hi>and his followers, and hast confidence in the shadow of Egypt, that is to say, in the conventicle of Heretiques; but this imaginary strength shall become thy confusion, and the confidence of this shadow, which thou followest in despising the body of the Orthodoxal Church, shall turn to thy shame.</hi> So an Anathema was pronounc'd, and publiquely fix'd up against him.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Bernard Weymar</hi> descended of the eldest House of <hi>Saxony</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1638.</note> whose Ancester was outed of that great <hi>Dutchy,</hi> for deserting Rome by <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperour, had besides his Germanes a considerable Army of French upon the Kings pay, who did notable feats up and down; he was now lay'd down before <hi>Rhinfield</hi> one of the <hi>Forest</hi> Towns (having taken two of them before) belonging to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> he had after two stormings made a breach in the walls, when <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savelli,</hi> and other choice men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd inexpectedly with nine Regiments of horse, and four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foot to raise the siege; Generall <hi>Sperheucher</hi> was also there, and two companies of <hi>Crabats:</hi> There happen'd two furious fights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, in the first <hi>de Wert</hi> had the better by taking four Canons, and three Cornets of horse, the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was in the field as a Volontier being newly come from his employment in the <hi>Valtolin,</hi> his horse was kill'd under him, and he himself wounded in two or three places; the siege of <hi>Rhinfield</hi> was rais'd for the time, but <hi>Bernard Weymar</hi> sought out <hi>de Wert</hi> the next day, and having rallied all his forces and put himself in battalia, there was a gallant though bloudy fight, and victory flutter'd a great while with doubtfull wings, but at last <hi>Iohn de Wert</hi> himself, Duke <hi>Savelli, Sperheucher,</hi> Major Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Enkenfort,</hi> with all the chief Commanders were taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; amongst whom <hi>Iohn de Wert,</hi> and <hi>Enkenfort</hi> were carried pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to France, and committed to <hi>Bois de Vincennes.</hi> So Duke <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Weymar</hi> took <hi>Rhinfield</hi> by a second siege presently after.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> being carried with his wounds about him to <hi>Swisserland,</hi> died of them within a little time, and his body was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in great pomp to <hi>Geneva</hi> where he was buried: a Duke of high descent being prime Prince of the bloud of the Kingdom of <hi>Navar,</hi> whereupon it was said of him, <hi>Rohan ie suis, Roy ie ne puis, Prince, ie dedagne. Rhoan</hi> I am, <hi>King</hi> I cannot be, <hi>Prince,</hi> I disdain it. He was excellently vers'd both in the <hi>Theory,</hi> and <hi>Prastic</hi> part of War, and other politicall knowledge, as appears by his works, and by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in the <hi>Valtolin</hi> and els where; Some there are who brand him to have bin a Pensioner to <hi>Spain</hi> receiving fourteen thousand crowns

and his Brother <hi>Soubize</hi> eight thousand from that King for divers<note place="margin">Anno 1637.</note> yeers, to puzzle France with intestin broyles: He died without male issue, and so that bloud-royal Duchy of <hi>Navar</hi> extinguish'd.</p>
            <p>There were hot doings now in <hi>Italy,</hi> one of the grounds of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell was 'twixt the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> The <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard</hi> alledg'd that by capitulations with the former Dukes, he was upon occasion of war to have the Town of <hi>Placentia</hi> for his use to put men and ammunition in during the war; The Duke disadvowed any such obligation, and was abetted by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> in the quarrell: <hi>Victor Amadée</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> who had married the second daughter of France being dead the yeer before, and the Count of <hi>Veriie</hi> his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, the Duke of <hi>Crequy</hi> came to be Commander in chief, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to releeve <hi>Breme</hi> which the Marquis of <hi>Leganez</hi> Governor of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> had closely begirt, <hi>Crequy</hi> as he was surveying the enemies trench, and vaunting that <hi>he would convey succour to the Town over the Spaniards mustachos,</hi> he was cut in the middle by a Cannon bullet, and so shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred to peeces, and the crosse he wore upon his brest was shot into his flesh, so <hi>Breme</hi> rendred her self. This Marshall <hi>Crequy</hi> was a brave man both for command and personall valour, having fairly kill'd in duel one of the bastard sons of <hi>Savoy</hi> in sight of two Armies some yeers before; there was a Latin Epitaph written upon him, which in respect of the pertinent apposit words, and the gallantry of the style I think worthy to have room in this story, for I have not met with a better.</p>

               <hi>France</hi> had better fortune this yeer by <hi>repelling</hi> the invading forces of Spain, then by entring her confines another way for revenge: We made mention a little before how bravely <hi>Leucato</hi> was preserv'd, and to cry quittance with the Spaniard, the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> had a vast high Commission to be the Kings Lieutenant General in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of <hi>Guyen, Languedoc, Navar, Bern,</hi> and <hi>Foix,</hi> with plenary

power to command all the <hi>Gentry,</hi> and make whom he would to<note place="margin">Anno 1638.</note> mount a horseback for the war, as also the <hi>Cominalty,</hi> to forme the body of an Army to invade the territories of <hi>Spain;</hi> so he pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Fontarabia;</hi> he took <hi>Iroon,</hi> and <hi>Ouyarson, Berha,</hi> with other small places of advenues in the way, and so he sate before the Town where the Pioner put presently spade in earth for a circumvallation.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> came with a mighty Fleet by Sea to second this enterprise, and the siege having lasted above threescore dayes, he offer'd with his rondaches, and by an assault Seaward to carry the Town; Hereupon a Counsell of War was call'd where the <hi>Duke de la Valette,</hi> who was Lieutenant Generall to the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> spoak very gallantly that he and the <hi>Marshall de la Force</hi> had bin the chiefest Actors in that achievment thitherto, that he had made a breach in the walls, after the springing of two mines, and done o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things towards the straightning of the place, and it was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant to reason, or agreeable to the law of War and honor, that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, now that the work was almost brought to perfection, should have the glory of their dangers, sufferings, and labours; This clash 'twixt the Archbishop, and the Duke <hi>de la Valette,</hi> to whom <hi>Condé</hi> adhaer'd prov'd to be the ruine of this great Expedition; for while they were debating the businesse after the breach was made for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall assault, the Spaniards came tumbling down the Hills and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard to be more numerous far then they really were, so after a great slaughter on both sides, but more of the French whereof divers were thrust into the Sea, the siege was rais'd; and one may say, <hi>The Town was lost, for not offring to take it;</hi> if they had presently poursued the breach. Amongst divers errors which were committed in this action, besides the weaknesse of their entrenchments, two were the quitting of <hi>Passage,</hi> without which the enemies would not have bin able to draw provision for their subsistence from Saint <hi>Sebastian;</hi> then the not erecting of a work upon the mountain of <hi>Gadaloupe</hi> which was neer the Town, and whence the Spaniard descended first; The French Army retyring to the frontiers staid some dayes at <hi>Iroon,</hi> expecting the enemy should poursue them, which he did not; whereby they inferr'd that he was not so strong as they took him to be, and so he was willing to make them a bridge of sylver; thus this Invasion came to nothing, which made the Spaniard geer them afterwards, saying, They had in this attempt discover'd the true nature of the French, <hi>viz. to enter like thunder, and vanish like smoak. De la Valette</hi> being come to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> to the old Duke his Father, after he had receiv'd relation how matters had gone, and what traverses there pass'd 'twixt him, and <hi>Condé</hi> and the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> advis'd him to get away as soon as he could to England, which he did; and 'twas time for him, for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Proces was fram'd in <hi>Paris,</hi> and he was executed in <hi>Effigie;</hi> so by this act of Justice the publique dishonour which seem'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon France in generall, was restrain'd to his person; <hi>Nor is it a new thing to sacrifice Commanders to such uses:</hi> Besides the Duke of

               <hi>Espernon</hi> being now an hundred yeers of age and odd moneths, and<note place="margin">Anno 1637.</note> having continued above forty yeers Governour of <hi>Gascony</hi> was outed of his Office, and commanded to retire to <hi>Plassac;</hi> where he died some moneths after, but before his death he had these severall disasters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell him within the revolution of one yeer; his eldest son the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> fell in <hi>Italy,</hi> the Cardinall his brother died in <hi>Savoy,</hi> his third son was in banishment in England, and he himself dismiss'd of all command, and depriv'd of this life.</p>
            <p>The judgements of men were very discrepant touching the carriage of the busines of <hi>Fontarabia,</hi> the major part imputed the fault to the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> and the <hi>Archbishop</hi> who was a creature of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals; For the first, he was content his son the Duke of <hi>Anguien</hi> should marry the Cardinals Neece a little after, which was done, as some gave out, of purpose for preventing of being question'd, and so clap'd in the Bastile; For the second, there was alwayes ill bloud 'twixt him and the Duke of <hi>Espernon;</hi> A Gentleman related unto me one facetious passage that happen'd 'twixt them: The Archbishop was to go upon an Expedition to Sea, and the Duke giving him a visit at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Archbishop sent two Gentlemen to attend him, and to desire him to entertain himself a little, for <hi>he was dispatching some Commanders and Officers that were to go instantly to Sea;</hi> The Duke (for a little pot is soon heated) took this in disdain (as he had reason being Governour in chief of the Countrey) and went suddenly away to his House <hi>Cadillac</hi> five leagues above <hi>Bourdeaux;</hi> The next morning the <hi>Archbishop</hi> went to pay him his visit, and the <hi>Duke</hi> being told he was there, he sent two of his Gentlemen to desire his <hi>Reverence</hi> to have patience a while, <hi>in regard he was newly entred into a Chapter of Saint Augustines De Civitate Dei, and he would waite upon him as soon as he had done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King besides this under <hi>Condé,</hi> had divers other Armies abroad about this time. One in <hi>Picardy</hi> under <hi>Chastillon,</hi> who pass'd the <hi>Some</hi> and entring <hi>Arthois,</hi> took all the Advenues towards Saint <hi>Omer,</hi> (old <hi>Hesdin</hi> having bin pillag'd and burnt before) and at last sate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the place; two thousand soldiers, and nine hundred peasans were perpetually at work for a circumvallation; Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> came with a considerable Army to joyn with <hi>Chastillon;</hi> but a little before Prince <hi>Tomaso</hi> had defeated two French Regiments, and <hi>Piccolomini</hi> came afterwards to second him; so there were very hot services per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd on both sides, at last the Spaniards having reliev'd the Town by taking the Fort of <hi>Bac,</hi> by which advantage they might cast in what strength they would, the French forsook their works, and so rais'd a costly siege; and march'd towards <hi>Renti</hi> which they took not without sweat and bloud, and after that <hi>Carelet,</hi> the one was quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molish'd, the other better fortified.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> was now for the King in the <hi>Franche Conté,</hi> where there happen'd divers encounters 'twixt the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> and him, and many places taken and succour'd by both parties.</p>

            <p>France was at a high cumble of felicity at this time, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it the more, the Queen was brought to bed of a Prince who made the seventeenth <hi>Dauphin</hi> of France since the first, she had a speedy delivery at Saint <hi>Germain de lay</hi> the fifth of <hi>September,</hi> the same moneth his father was born, whither divers reliques had been brought her, amongst others our Ladies girdle of <hi>Puy,</hi> which she wore during her throngs. The King was at dinner when newes was brought him, and so he went suddenly to the Queens chamber where amongst the Ladies he found <hi>Monsieur</hi> his brother, and he had good reason to be there to see what was brought into the world.</p>
            <p>This was one of the rarest passages, of this kind, that ever happen'd in France, or any other part of the world, it being little lesse then a miracle, that a young King and Queen should bed so long together and not have any issue till the twenty third yeer of their cohabitation and concumbence, for so long was this <hi>Dauphin</hi> a getting.</p>
            <p>One may easily imagine what triumphings and publique acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of joy were up and down France for this so long expected Royal Off-spring; nor was this gladnes bounded there but it dispers'd it self up and down all places of Christendom (that were friends to France) and struck a kind of wonderment into the world. In <hi>Rome</hi> there were divers inventions, and curiosities found out to expresse a congratulation.—Before the French Ambassadors Palace (who was then the Marshall <hi>De Estrée</hi>) there was a triumphant Obelisck with the armes of France and this ostentous Inscription underneath.</p>

            <p>This yeer France had also divers irons in the fire which she did so beat that the sparkles flew a great way abroad and did much mischief: <hi>Hesdin</hi> was closely besieg'd, so that when the Infante <hi>Cardinal</hi> came to relieve her she was pass'd cure; The King himself advanc'd as far as <hi>Abbeville</hi> in Person, and thence to his Army before <hi>Hesdin,</hi> which struck a greater terror into the Town, and made her come sooner to a Composition, which she obtaind upon Honorable termes; the King himself entred, and having secur'd all things he return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> in triumph.

            <p>In <hi>Brisac</hi> and other parts of <hi>Alsatia</hi> there were some incongruities, and clowds of diffidence hung between the <hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French;</hi> The young Prince <hi>Palatine</hi> was going thither through France dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd, hoping to have better fortune that way, then he had in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia</hi> not long before where Prince <hi>Robert</hi> his brother was taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner and carried to <hi>Vienna,</hi> with the Lord <hi>Craven;</hi> He was furnish'd from <hi>England</hi> with credit for considerable sums of money at <hi>Basile,</hi> but being advanc'd a good way beyond <hi>Paris</hi> in his journey, he was discover'd, restrain'd a while at <hi>Moulins,</hi> and then sent for to <hi>Paris,</hi> whence he was committed to <hi>Bois de Viniennes.</hi> The French fear'd that he might puzzle their proceedings in <hi>Brisac,</hi> and that being a <hi>German</hi> Prince and supported by his Majesty of Great <hi>Britain</hi> the Town would choose him for Governor: upon these apprehensions he was a while kept prisoner; but afterwards, by the intercession of the Queen of <hi>England</hi> chiefly (as his brother was releas'd by good offices the Empresse did who to this day doth much respect the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Nation) he was freed and receiv'd very Princely entertainment afterwards; At his departure the King gave him a very obliging farewell, by telling him, <hi>That whereas it pleased God and Nature to place him to be Umpire of this part of the World, he would not suffer him to be oppressed by any, but he would endevour, to reinvest him at last in his own Territories, assuring him that no peace should be concluded 'twixt him and the House of</hi> Austria, <hi>unlesse he were included.</hi>

she bended her brows, and wrinkled her forhead more ruggedly then<note place="margin">Anno 1640.</note> ever; A fearfull combustion happen'd 'twixt the <hi>Pyreney</hi> Hills in the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Catalonia</hi> (of old but a <hi>County</hi>), this combustion was a kind of a bonefire to <hi>France,</hi> who presently ran to warme her hands and sport about it, and she hath ministred fuel to keep it in ever since; It grew so furious that the Viceroy with his wife, and some of his family were murtherd, and his house burnt to the ground by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of a popular fury. The ground of this fearfull Insurrection was the billeting of the <hi>Castillian</hi> soldiers, and their insolencies, as they march'd through the Countrey; besides some extraordinary contributions which were demanded of that Province for the support of the King now in his extreme necessities having so many profess'd mighty enemies both by sea and land: this Tumult by degrees turn'd to an absolut revolt and defection from their Soverain naturall King; In so much that they flew to France and cri'd out for the Duke of <hi>Anjou;</hi> the French quickly hearkens unto them, so there was a Treaty at <hi>Narbona,</hi> whither they sent twelve persons of quality for hostages, and an Order issued out that he should be branded with a hot iron who spake of any accommodation with <hi>Castile;</hi> It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, that upon putting themselfs under the Royall protection of the most Christian King, he should furnish them with an Army of six thousand foot, and two thousand horse, to be maintain'd by the <hi>Catalans:</hi> Whereupon three Commissioners were sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> one for the Clergy, another for the Nobility, and a third for the Gentry and Cominalty. They who were most busy herein, and indeed the chiefest bellowes that blew this terrible fire were the Preaching Fryers and Monks, who in lieu of obedience and conformity to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and compliance with the necessities of the King having so many irons in the fire, did teach and obtrude to the people nothing more then common priviledge, and resumption of liberty, whereby the affection of the vassall was imbitter'd, and at last quite poyson'd against his Prince; whence this Aphorisme may be collected, <hi>That the best Instruments misapplied do greatest mischief, and prove most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to any State; And as of the sweetest wines is made the sharpest Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, so Churchmen, who by their holy function and white robes of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence should be the sweetest of all professions, who should breath nothing, but peace, unity, allegeance and love, if they misapply their talent, and abandon themselfs to the spirit of faction, they become the bitterest enemies, the most corroding cankers, and worst vipers in any Common-wealth, and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the Prince; In regard that they having the sway ore the conscience which is the Rudder that steers the actions, words and thoughts of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall creature, they transport and snatch it away whither they will; making the</hi> Beast with many heads <hi>conceive according to the colour of those rods they use to cast before them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The French having thus undertaken the protection of the revolted <hi>Catalan,</hi> and cut the Spaniard work enough that way, he did miracles against him about this time in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for <hi>he made the Rat to</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:98453:71"/>
               <hi>eat the Cat, and a Cow to spin out a bundle of Flax,</hi> by rendring himself Master of <hi>Arras,</hi> the chiefest Town of the Province of <hi>Artois</hi> after a strong stubborn siege; which place the <hi>Flemins</hi> held to be inpregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and as impossible to take, as it was for the Rat and the Cow to do what was above said.</p>
            <p>His Generall also in <hi>Italy</hi> the Count of <hi>Harcour,</hi> did do strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, who having entred <hi>Piemont</hi> was besieg'd by the Spaniard in <hi>Chieri,</hi> but he got through, routs the enemy, and succours <hi>Casal:</hi> This he did with 1500. horse, and a few foot, who were nothing equall in number to the Spaniards who were thrice as many: This ventrous achievement, which some interpreted rashnes rather then true valor, got him a mighty reputation; Then he marcheth to <hi>Turin,</hi> and besiegeth it, but the gates were open'd to him within a short time, so he made a glorious entrance into the Town, and returns trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly ore the Hills to <hi>France,</hi> having setled the King his Master in the protection of the Infant Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> his <hi>Nephew,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or tutele, the Emperour, seconded by the Spaniard, alledg'd did belong to him by Imperial right during his minority.</p>
            <p>There came a Messenger of State to <hi>Paris</hi> who brought notice of the Great Turks death, in the flower of his youth though of a robust huge constitution; He died by excesse of drinking some sorts of wine, wherewith he was us'd to be oft distemper'd, notwithstanding the strict law of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who us'd to preach this Doctrine, <hi>That there was a Devill in every berry of the grape,</hi> and therefore absolutly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted the use of wine in his <hi>Alchoran: But such is the power of sensuall appetit in man, that the spirit oftentimes is too weake to resist the motion of sense, though the conscience should dictat, that Hell it self stands gaping for him in the very fruition of the pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The genius of this great Potentat is very remarkable for when he came first to sit upon the throne of that mighty Empire, he was of a mild, gentle, and peacefull nature, but the Janizaries (who may in time prove the bane of that Tyranicall Monarchy) having violently cut off many of his great Officers, and committed other acts of high insolencies whereat he had conniv'd, and looked on as a sufferer a great while; at last patience so often abus'd, and stretch'd as it were upon the Tenter, turn'd to fury in him, and that in so high a degree that it came to alter and quite change his disposition, and the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of nature in him, for of a soft, easie and candid humour, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards, having bin so often provok'd by such bloudy spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles, as cruell and sanguinary, as any that ever sway'd the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire: And he order'd matters so, that he found an opportunity to be reveng'd of all those that had affronted him before, and bereft him of his Favourits and Officers; He commonly carried with him (a <hi>Ghelad</hi>) an Executioner, who at his sudden beck, and in his sight took off many heads to offer up as Victimes for the lifes of his slain servants; He grew to be so flesh'd in bloud, that he was scarce capable of any compassion, or appre hension of fear, notwithstanding that his
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98453:72"/>
predecessor had been hacked to peeces not long before by one of his<note place="margin">Anno 1641.</note> meanest soldiers, for attempting to remove his Court from <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> t'other side the <hi>Hellespont</hi> to <hi>Damasco,</hi> to be reveng'd of his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Janizaries, who would not fight the yeer before against the <hi>Pole;</hi> as also of the <hi>Constantinopolitans</hi> for refusing to furnish him with moneys for that war; Hence may be drawn this Caution; <hi>That Princes natures are ticklish things to be tamper'd withall, that it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to trench too far upon the softnesse of their dispositions, as appears in this Monark, who by often irritations fell from one extreme to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The horrid flames (we spake of before) which were kindled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those <hi>fiery</hi> Mountains (the <hi>Pyreneys</hi>) in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> (the chiefest part of <hi>Hispania Tarraconensis,</hi> according to the old division) did rage with such fury, that the sparkles of them by a strong East-wind were caried into <hi>Portugall,</hi> of old (<hi>Hispania Lusitanica:</hi>) And as one torch lights another, or any other thing whose matter is combustible and apt to take, so this other Revolt was kindled by the first; and <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall</hi> was very well prepar'd to receive it, as well for the aversnes, and strong disaffection her Inhabitants have to the <hi>Castillan;</hi> (for I have heard them complain often that the greatest misery which could befall them, was, <hi>to lose their King Don Sebastian, and to fall under the yoak of the Castillan</hi>) as also for divers other causes; First, she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd that the King neglected to protect her against the Hollander in <hi>Brasil</hi> where he had taken <hi>Fernanbuck</hi> her chief staple of Sugars; she urg'd also enhancement of toll, new exactions, and other pressures; lastly, she complain'd of strangers to be her Viceroys, as <hi>Casimir</hi> the King of <hi>Polands</hi> brother was intended for her, had he not bin inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in France; In so much that it was easie for Spain to have bin a Prophetesse of this defection; therefore her wonted policy and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight was much questioned, that she did not put out of the way, and engage in some forren employment the Duke of <hi>Bragansa</hi> who was us'd to be perpetually almost at <hi>Madrid.</hi> When the King of <hi>Spain</hi> told <hi>Olivares</hi> of this revolt, and that there was a new King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd, the Favorit slighted it, saying, <hi>Es Rey de havas,</hi> Sir, he is but a bean or twelfnight King; but we find now he was far out of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Never was there a generall Revolt perfected in so short a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of time, for within lesse then a moneth Don <hi>Iohn of Bragansa</hi> was so settled in the Kingdomes of <hi>Portugall,</hi> and the <hi>Algarves,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any opposition at all or marke of strangenes, as if he had bin King thereof twenty yeers together before.</p>

            <p>This put the King of Spain at such a stand, having on both sides of him two sorts of subjects not onely risen up, but quite cut off from him, that, as the Proverb runs in that Countrey, he could not tell what wood to make his shafts of, nor could <hi>Olivares</hi> (which was held such a <hi>Santon</hi>) know what Bead to pray upon, or what Saint to addresse himself unto. And certainly these were two mighty shocks to the Spanish Monarchy, nor could they happen in a time more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious, she having so many engagements abroad, and having met with such ilfavor'd rancounters by Land and Sea of late yeers. It is also considerable that this check at home befell her after well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer an Age of a profound unshaken peace, and desuetude of armes in Spain her self where civil war hath bin so great a stranger, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that she still bred soldiers abroad, and found means to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broyle the world alwayes in some place or other: Which makes some interpret this intestine war to be a visible iudgement fallen upon her from heaven for disturbing the peace of her neighbours. But I have observ'd it to be the genius of a true <hi>Spaniard</hi> (and I honour him for it) not to bow and hang down his head like a bulrush at every puff of adverse Fortune, nor to yeeld to the fury of the tempest, but to rouse up his spirits more stiffly to resist—<hi>Et contra audentior ire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this double trance the King was advis'd to apply his strength first to suppresse the <hi>Catalan</hi> (the sturdy <hi>Montaneer</hi>) and till that work were finish'd, to stand onely upon the defensive part against <hi>Portugall</hi> who is not esteem'd so much a man.</p>
            <p>Besides these disasters that befel the K. of <hi>Spain</hi> thus at his own doors, he had another happen'd unto him in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> for his Brother Don <hi>Fernando</hi> the Cardinal Infante died in the beginning of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at <hi>Brussells,</hi> being of about the same age as his second Brother Don <hi>Carlos</hi> was of, (about 30.) who died some yeers before: the world did take occasion to wonder that these two Princes in the flower, and prime vigour of their age should thus fall. Don <hi>Carlos</hi> the yeer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, desir'd of his brother to be Viceroy of <hi>Portugall,</hi> which was denied him; Moreover it was observ'd he drew more affection

from the Spaniards in generall by the colour of his complection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Anno 1641.</note> he was black; for one shall hear the people of <hi>Castillia</hi> sigh up and down and pray, that God would please to send them a King once again of their own colour: Moreover, besides this popular affection he was extremely well beloved of the soldiers, for whom he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready to do good offices, and they address'd themselves more to him then to any. These circumstances made odd impressions in the minds of many which gave occasion of censuring and scattering of libells up and down touching his death, whereof I thought it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to insert one here, but not to impose a beleef upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereby; It was drop'd down in the Court at <hi>Brussels.</hi>

            <p>This Revolt of <hi>Portugall</hi> was no great news to the French Cardinal, who had his spirits walking there, as well as in <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and every where els; He had this Spring wrought the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he arriv'd in indifferent good equippage considering how many bitter showers had fallen, and weatherbeaten him before; for he had arm'd five times upon severall desseins, and Fortune al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes frown'd upon him; Which some hold to be a visible judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fallen upon him, as also that he is a kind of exile from his own ancient Princely inheritance, for abandoning his first wife, (by whose right he came to the full and unquestionable possession of <hi>Lorain</hi>) and cohabiting with another: The King entertaines him with a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence sutable to his quality, and the Cardinall is as busie as a Bee to give him all outward content; The one sends him fifty thousand Pistols, the other twenty thousand in a great bason. When he came before the King he complemented for matters pass'd, and kneeling twise the King takes him up telling him, <hi>That he had forgotten all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pass'd, and for the future he would espouse his quarrells and interests</hi>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:98453:73"/>
               <hi>and make them his own:</hi> And so it seems he hath done, for he hath so<note place="margin">Anno 1642.</note> 
               <hi>wedded</hi> himself to the best Towns of <hi>Lorain,</hi> and <hi>Barri,</hi> that 'tis thought he will hardly be ever <hi>divorc'd</hi> from any of them, unlesse he be forc'd.</p>
            <p>The Citie of <hi>Paris</hi> was now full of <hi>Catalans,</hi> and <hi>Portugals,</hi> who strowted up and down the streets, their new King having sent two Ambassadors thither in joynt Commission; In the interim the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Ambassadors at <hi>Rome</hi> negotiat strongly that the Duke of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansa</hi> be excommunicated for an Usurper; if this had taken effect, it had made the King of France incapable to assist him being an excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated person: but France had such a powerfull faction in the Consistory, and the Pope himself was such a friend to her that the <hi>Catholic</hi> King could do little good in this point.</p>
            <p>There had some former counterbuffs pass'd betwixt the <hi>Cardinall</hi> and the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> who had slighted one of his Neeces for marriage; but now there was a new clash happen'd between them in the Armies, in <hi>Picardy,</hi> where the <hi>Cardinal</hi> would have advanc'd his colours before the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Soissons;</hi> The King abetted his <hi>Cardinal,</hi> hereupon the <hi>Count</hi> retires in discontentment to <hi>Sedan,</hi> and got the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> to ligue with him; They rays'd a considerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and encountred the Kings forces which they routed, but the Count being too eager, and poursuing a broken Troupe of horse which was flying, it was his hard fate to be kill'd by one of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals servants who then bore Armes; The fall of this Prince of the Bloud in the prime vigor of his virility, causd much lamentation in France mix'd with some murmurings against the Cardinal; And it was a good turn for him, in regard now that <hi>Soissons</hi> was taken away there was no Prince throughout all France able to uphold a faction against him.</p>
            <p>France was bless'd with another masculine Royall off-spring the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> which did not raise so much wonder as the <hi>Dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phin,</hi> for he, as I told you before, was two and twenty yeers a get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, this but a twelvemoneth and a few dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Marie de Medici</hi> Queen Mother and Dowager of France expir'd this yeer, who may be said to be one of the greatest Queens that ever were, being grandchild, and gran neece to two glorious Emperours, <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, wife of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> Mother to the three mighty Kings of <hi>France, Great Britain,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the ancientest Prince of Christendom, the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> She had bin Regent of France many yeers, during which time she discover'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary abilities transcending her sex; shewas afterwards twice in Armes against her sonne, and she came at last to conceive such a <hi>Iunonian</hi> indignation against the Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu</hi> who had bin chief of her Counsels, and her creature afterwards in point of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, for she first preferr'd him to the King, that the breach could never be made up between them; that one might say,</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:98453:74"/>Nec quenquam jam ferre potest <hi>Regina</hi> priorem,<note place="margin">Anno 1642.</note> 
               <hi>Richeliúsve</hi> parem.</q>
            <p>She was us'd to say, That the worst thing she ever did was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of <hi>Richelieu;</hi> In the sense of this high indignation she for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook France, and drew a voluntary exile upon her self, whereby she was so toss'd up and down to severall Countreys that she became a Tenisball to the <hi>blind</hi> inconstant Goddesse; she first retir'd to <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> where she found good respect and contentment, during the life of the <hi>Archduchesse;</hi> but then being distasted with the Spanish Ministers, she remov'd to <hi>Holland,</hi> thence to <hi>England,</hi> where she found most Royall allowance and Hospitality, and her last retirement was to <hi>Colen</hi> where she liv'd reclus'd, exercising her self in strict exercises of devotion (in her way,) and so breath'd her last. Such was her <hi>fate,</hi> I will not say her <hi>faut,</hi> that <hi>Bellona</hi> follow'd her wheresoever she went, (as also her three daughters) yet in her own nature she detested war, specially that with <hi>Spain,</hi> and that with <hi>Savoy:</hi> And this was thought to be the ground of her animosity against the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>The King of France having thoroughly undertaken the protection of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> sent a royall army, composed most of Gascons, and of them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> which rush'd into the County of <hi>Roussillon</hi> the Key of Spain towards that part of the Pyreneys; This County was once an appendix of France, but being hypothequ'd and morgag'd to the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> for a summe of money it was never redeem'd since. France had better fortune in this second <hi>Invasion</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> then she in the first at <hi>Fontarabia; Perpignan</hi> the strongest Fort of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the bignes, was besieg'd, and the King himself made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thither in person, so after a tough stubborn siege, by <hi>famine</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then <hi>force,</hi> the Town and Castle yeelded, wherein there were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 120. great Canons.</p>
            <p>The Spaniard had some requitall though nothing adaequat to the losse of <hi>Perpignan</hi> in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> about this time, for he regain'd the Town of <hi>Aire</hi> from the French: and the French took <hi>Bipalma</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Cambray</hi> from the Spaniard.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> was sick that time the Queen Mother died at <hi>Colen,</hi> yet he strain'd himself to creep to the Altar, and officia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many Church duties for her soul; From that time he was never perfectly recovered, so about the latter end of this yeer he died him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his <hi>Cardinal Palace</hi> at Paris. He was so attenuated and dried up with exces of care, and encombrances of the brain, that his body might be said to be but a sackfull of bones, and a meere Scheleton.</p>
            <p>This gran Minister being thus gone, Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of an ancient Roman extraction, was put to sit at the helm; A man of the same <hi>habit, and habilitie;</hi> as if the soul of <hi>Richelieu</hi> had transmigrated into him; He was a bosome friend, and a great intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sic Confident of <hi>Richelieu</hi> before, who had imparted his desseins, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:98453:74"/>
infus'd all his maximes into him, and open'd unto him all the <hi>Arcana</hi>
               <note place="margin">Anno 1643.</note> 
               <hi>Imperii:</hi> He had bin an active politicall instrument employ'd by the Pope before, in sundry Treaties, and difficult traverses of State, wherein he had good successe, and in all his negotiations he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to be a person of excellent addresse, and rare endowments.</p>
            <p>The King did not long survive his Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> for he fell mortally ill five moneths after, at which time this great Monarch paid <hi>nature</hi> her last debt; and what earthly Potentate is there, though never so independent and absolute, that is exempt from this tribute?</p>
            <p>He expir'd the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of May in the afternoon, the same moneth, the same day of the moneth, and about the same houre of the day that his father died 33. yeers before, but with this mark of difference, that the one <hi>went,</hi> and the other was <hi>sent</hi> out of the world about the same time. His bowels were presently carried to be interr'd at Saint <hi>Denis,</hi> the last rendevous of all the French Kings, whither his Body follow'd after in the height of all Solemnitie and Magnificence that his Queen could possibly devise, whom he left Regent; a Lady of rare temper and prudence, who to the wonder of all the world, had the comfort of two sons after two and twentie yeers expectation; And to that benediction hath another now added, to have not only the sole government of them, but the supreme sway of that huge Monarchy, which She is like to continue about nine yeers longer: A just recompence from heaven for her so long patience, as also for her wise comportment and moderation in refraining utterly to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle with any the least matters of State, while She remain'd under <hi>covert Baron.</hi>

            <head>A COROLLARY ADDED TO THE LIFE of LEVVIS the Thirteenth.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus have we attended this Great King from the Womb to the Tomb, from the Funt to his Funerall, from <hi>Fountainbleau</hi> to Saint <hi>Denis;</hi> Our <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> hath waited on him in his <hi>child-hood,</hi> in his <hi>nonage,</hi> and so ascended from his <hi>majority</hi> to his Meridian, not leaving him, tills he had clos'd his eyes at Saint <hi>Germans,</hi> which was a good while too soon, considering the ordinary longitude of time that is allowed man to live amongst the Elements; for he reach'd not unto forty three yeers compleat which in some constitutions is accounted but the noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyde of virility; In so much that when I consider the frame of his body and the actions of his life, I find that he had more obligations to <hi>Fortune</hi> then to <hi>Nature;</hi> yet was he of a comely middlesiz'd proportion, of a spare but cleer making, and though not strenuous or robust, yet active enough, and patient of toyle; for he would be most commonly in the head of some of his Armies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and take very much pains to drill and disciplin his Troups in his own Person, and sit twelve howers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on horseback; He was of a soft complexion though black hair'd, which turn'd gray before he came to thirty yeers, which put him to his dy, and the reason that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did thus outrun Time in him, was, that she had not given him a competence of radicall moisture, for seldom came any humidities from him from mouth or nostrill,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:98453:76"/>
nor was he subject to sweat, though he would agitat his body often in tough exercises, as hunting the wild Bore, and other sports wherein he would be earnest. Divers eminent vertues did cohabit in him, as <hi>piety,</hi> (in his way) <hi>chastity, temperance,</hi> and <hi>constancy;</hi> Touching the first two they shin'd in him with such a strength and lustre, that his example might have had power enough to give law to all mankind, &amp; cast the world into a new mould, had it bin capable of reformation; He was <hi>pious</hi> in an intense degree, for though he was not known to be subject to any Vice, yet would he be on his knees to his ghostly father every week, rather to <hi>refresh</hi> (as one said) then to <hi>clense</hi> his conscience by confession; nor in his prayers had he as much cause to ask for <hi>pardon</hi> as for <hi>perseverance;</hi> defects he had, but scarce any faults; those rayes which enlightned his brain from above, descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his breast and became fire, so fervent he us'd to be in his way of devotion; when but a youth he went to the Countrey of <hi>Bearn,</hi> at his entrance to <hi>Pau,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants bringing a Canopy to carry over his head, he ask'd whether there was ever a Church in Town, and being answer'd no, he said, <hi>He would receive no honor in that place where God Almighty had no House to be honour'd in.</hi> And into all other Towns where he entred as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, he would give expresse command that none should cry out <hi>Vive le Roy</hi> during the time of Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>When the Queen (now Regent) found her self quick he caus'd a solemn Declaration to be publish'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he made the blessed Virgin Protectresse under the Holy Trinity of all his estates, all which he consecrated to Her, and for an immortall mark of this consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he commanded the great Altar in the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Paris</hi> to be built anew, with the Image of the Virgin which should hold in her armes that of our Saviour, and the King to ly prostrat before the Son and Mother offring them his Crown and Scepter. The
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:98453:76"/>
Archbishop of <hi>Paris</hi> was enjoyn'd to commemorat this Declaration once every yeer, upon <hi>Assumption</hi> day at the high Altar in the Morning, and that in the Evening a generall Procession should be made wherein the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost of <hi>Paris,</hi> and all the soverain companies should be assistant with the Court of Parlement; this command extended to all other Archbishops and Bishops through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out France, that they should in every Cathedrall Church erect one speciall Altar for the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for this end, and in commemoration of this act to perpetuity.</p>
            <p>Many other instances could be produc'd what a great Zelot he was in the Religion and Ceremonies of <hi>Rome,</hi> but the adding of one more shall suffice, which was, that when the old Marshall <hi>de la Force</hi> was admitted to see him a little before he expir'd, he told him from his death-bed, <hi>That he thought God Almighty suffer'd him</hi> (meaning the Marshall) <hi>to live so long upon earth expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his conversion, as he had done that of</hi> Lesdiguieres.</p>
            <p>He put out sundry Proclamations against Swearers, against Pride in apparell, for he himself went usually very plain; as also against Duells, and the last was so strict that both the appellant and defendant whosoever did survive, should suffer death without mercy, and be depriv'd of Christian buriall, but both rot upon the gallowes with their heels upwards.</p>
            <p>As he was thus pious (in a general way) so was he to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his parents in particular; For when he had pass'd <hi>nonage,</hi> he sayed, <hi>I am now a major to all the world except my mother, to whom I shall be still a minor.</hi> When he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <hi>Vitry</hi> order to feiz upon the <hi>Marshall of Ancre,</hi> yet he gave him a private instruction <hi>not to touch him in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lodgings.</hi> She was twice in actuall armes against him, yet, though he routed and broak her partisans, and might have crush'd them all to peeces, he pardon'd them all at her request; his brother started out often against him, yet such was his indulgence, that he alwaies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him, and receiv'd him again into his bosome; But
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98453:77"/>
when the Cardinall came to sit at the stern, he had such strong influxes upon him, that he postpos'd both frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love, and maternall duty, to his affection towards him, or rather towards his kingdom as he term'd it; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that amongst other short memorandums he sent her word, that <hi>it concernd him more to conserve France, then to content Her</hi> (viz. his mother.)</p>
            <p>Touching his continence and chastity he was a great example, for he was not subject no not as much as in <hi>thought,</hi> much lesse in action to the contraries of these, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the relatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of some of his neerest servants; nor did this proceed from impotence, as some would make the world beleeve, but out of vertue and conscience, for he was said to hate the very <hi>names</hi> of such vices more then others do the vices themselfs. Whereupon it was said, while his <hi>Southern</hi> brother in law sported in the pavilions of <hi>Venus,</hi> he was busie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>in the tents of <hi>Mars,</hi> and took Cities faster, then the other did Maydenheads.</p>
            <p>He was also temperat in a high degree, nor would he ever wrong nature with the least exces, or debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Moreover he was wonderfully constant in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, where it was once settled; which is rare in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verain Princes, (especially in them of that Clime) who have such a variety of choice, and who have no other ground of fastnesse for their affection, but their own fancy: Not all the world could alienat his favor from <hi>Luynes,</hi> though the greatest Princes of France did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally attempt to pluck him away from him by Armes; nor after him from the Cardinal, towards whom his love was in <hi>grain,</hi> and would never lose colour. Nor was he constant onely in his affection, but to his own ends when once settled, and resolv'd upon; to attain which he was so actif and hot, that when he went about it, he not onely apply'd, but gave up himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to the thing. Furthermore he was marvellously modest in an opinion of himself, and so conscious of his own judgement, that he resign'd his very faculty of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98453:77"/>
reason, and transmitted all his intellectualls to others; a high point of prudence, for that Prince who steers his course by the Compas of Counsell, though he be himself but of indifferent abilities, is a far wiser man, then he who, albeit never so politic and able of himself, doth guid his affaires by his own fancy, sole opinion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the worst kind of rule in Government. And he was as fortunat as judicious in the choice of his Counsellors, and chiefest ministers both of State and War; He would not send an <hi>Ajax,</hi> where he should employ an <hi>Vlysses;</hi> nor a <hi>Saintre,</hi> where <hi>Bouciqualt</hi> was fitter for the turn; The two last were the most famous men that <hi>France</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bred, one for the Gown, the other for the Sword, according to the verse I have read in an old Manuscript.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>So many high signall vertues which were naturally inhaerent in him were unquestionably the cause that he prosper'd so much; So that 'tis a question whom For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune lov'd better, the Father or the Son; 'Tis true his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fought four great Battails wherein he prov'd victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and so may be said to have come to the Crown of France by Conquest, as much as by Succession, yet all these and other exploits of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great's</hi> were within the bounds of France, and nought els but domestic achievments; But France was too narrow a compas, to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:98453:78"/>
comprehend and confine the exploits of the <hi>Thirteenth Lewis,</hi> for besides <hi>thirteen</hi> severall Civil Wars<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>France</hi> her self and <hi>Navar</hi> which he suppress'd, and most of them in Person; so many Battailes were fought in <hi>Spain, Italy, Savoy,</hi> amongst the <hi>Grisons,</hi> in <hi>Lorain,</hi> and in high and low <hi>Germany;</hi> He had at one time in the yeers sixteen hundred thirty five, and thirty six, no lesse then 130000. foot by Land and Sea, and 8000. effectif horse, in six severall Armies; whereas <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great</hi> never had above 40000. horse and foot at once in all; never any made France know her own strength so much, and to find the length of her weapon, as this King did; He went a horseback betimes, for at thirteen yeers of age he suppress'd in Person two Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, one in <hi>Poitou,</hi> and another in <hi>Britany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> so that he began to triumph in those yeers that others begin to handle their armes, and learn how to sit a horse in an Academy.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he was forc'd to get his Queen by the sword, and to bring her into his armes by <hi>Armes,</hi> there being three severall Armies to stop her passage.</p>
            <p>He then repells the English who had so boldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded France, whereby he gain'd a greater addition of credit and fame, then he did by worsting Spaniard, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, or German, in regard of the admirable Victories that the English carried home from France in times pass'd, by taking one of their warlik'st Kings prisoner, and oftentimes by discomfiting whole Troupes with a handfull of men.</p>
            <p>After this he beleaguers, takes and batters the chiefest rampart of the Religion, the impregnable Town of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi> after a stupendous siege by Land and Sea, where a prodigious Dike was cast up which serv'd as a bit in <hi>Neptunes</hi> jawes, and whereby he may be said to have curb'd all the Elements.</p>
            <p>No sooner had he shaken off the dust of <hi>Rochell,</hi> but behold him cover'd with snow on the horrid Alpian
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98453:78"/>
Hills almost in the dead of Winter, where he broke open his way with the point of the sword to relieve the Duke of <hi>Mantova,</hi> he got Forts accessibly onely by birds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst those clowd-topping Hills, and so returns tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant having done the work, and overcome the rocks in this expedition, as he did the Sea at <hi>Rochell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then goes on to perfect that mighty work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing his subjects of the <hi>Religion</hi> to an exact condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obedience, by dismantling their Towns, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had neer upon three hundred in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var,</hi> by casheering their Garrisons, and bringing them to relye for the future upon royall favor; a work which his five immediat Predecessors attempted to do, but could not effect in seventy yeers, whereas he did it in far lesse then so many moneths.</p>
            <p>Then behold him Lord of all <hi>Lorain,</hi> and of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of <hi>Alsatia,</hi> by being Master of <hi>Brisach, Rhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi> and other places: Then trace him to the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and you shall find him in the ancient Town of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,</hi> and divers other places his predecessor <hi>Francis</hi> the First had given for his ransom.</p>
            <p>Lastly look after him tovvards the Pyrenean Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, &amp; you shall see him boldly invade Spain, entring the County of <hi>Roussillon</hi> like lightning, and battering the vvalls of <hi>Perpignan,</hi> which after a tough siege, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing she had above 120. great Cannons, and ten strong Bulvvarks, he reduc'd to his will, whereby he hath redeem'd vvith lead (I mean good bullets) that Countrey w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> one of his predecessors morgag'd for gold in times pass'd: Thus hath he got three such keys that none of his progenitors (not Emperors) ever had: <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan, Pignerol,</hi> and <hi>Brisach,</hi> one to enter <hi>Spain,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Italy,</hi> and the third to rush into <hi>Germany</hi> at pleasure.</p>
            <p>Look upon him in his City, Tovvn, Vniversitie, and Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> and you shall find him enlarging her skirts and lacing them about vvith nevv vvalls, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the custome of <hi>Rome</hi> (once the great Mistresse
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98453:79"/>
of the vvorld) vvho upon the encrease of her Empire extended also her vvalls upon any nevv acquest.</p>
            <p>Nor must you behold him only on Land, but cast your eyes upon him at Sea, and you shall find him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more potent then all his progenitors, the French formerly waded like <hi>sheep,</hi> but now they may be said to swimme like <hi>Elephants;</hi> Before, France could hardly without borrowing, put twenty Sayles of men of War to Sea, but now she can rig a hundred well appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fighting great Vessells in Galleons and Gallies in both her Seas at a short warning.</p>
            <p>But having done with the <hi>pro,</hi> let us see what may be said to the <hi>contra,</hi> touching this Great King; It must be granted that Fortune did not alwaies sit at the helm of his proceedings.</p>
            <p>At the Treaty of <hi>Lodun</hi> he was il-favor'dly baffled by his own subjects, who gave him law, and set the dice upon him: but than you'l say he was young, and let it suffice for an excuse: Before <hi>Montaban</hi> he lost five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Gentlemen, and five times as many soldiers, and then was forc'd to trusse up his baggage and be gone, and to suffer this Motto upon the gate, <hi>Roysansfoy, ville sans peur.</hi> In <hi>Italy</hi> he lost first and last an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand subjects. Before and about Saint <hi>Omer</hi> ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand. At <hi>Fontarabia</hi> he had a foul repulse: At <hi>Theon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> he lost seven thousand French; before <hi>Hesain,</hi> there fell little lesse; and the succouring of <hi>Scales</hi> prov'd a <hi>tart</hi> peece of service; The first Army he sent to joyn with the <hi>States</hi> which came to thirty thousand horse and foot got little credit at <hi>Tillemont,</hi> and lesse before <hi>Lovain,</hi> and divers thousands of them died without an enemy, and came home by <hi>weeping crosse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching his Appellation or Epithet of <hi>Iust,</hi> there are divers Critiques, and some of his own subjects give out, that it doth not so well quadrat with him; They instance in the maner of Marshall <hi>D'Ancres</hi> death in the dawnings of his raign: Moreover when he pass'd by
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98453:79"/>
               <hi>Saumur,</hi> he sent for the keys of the Town and Castle to <hi>Du Plessis</hi> promising upon the word of a King he would deliver them him again, which was not done; only a Gentleman of the Religion was left Governor of the Castle for the time: The <hi>Rochellers</hi> complain'd that he often promised to raze <hi>Lewis Fort;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> spoak high language, and charg'd him with breach of Article that he was not sent for, and admitted to the Treaty at <hi>Monson;</hi> The Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> more then any, chargeth him (nor hath he reason to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with him therefore, for <hi>losers must have leave to speak</hi>) that his safe conducts before <hi>Nancy,</hi> and at other times turn'd to enforcements, his Treaties to traps; The <hi>Emperour</hi> knows not how he fell out with him; And the <hi>Spaniard</hi> swears by his mustachos, that he first infring'd the Sacred bonds and Capitulations of Peace so solemnly sworn betwixt them, and corroborated by a double Nuptiall knot: Nor saith he, will the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against the Archbishop of <hi>Mentz</hi> serve to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie him, for he was a Rebell to the Emperour, before <hi>France</hi> had undertaken his protection.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> chargeth him further that he would have dissolv'd and nullified the marriage 'twixt <hi>Monsieur</hi> and his Sister, she being a better woman then his first wife, who was daughter to a vassal of the Crown of France; &amp; being also of as good extraction as himself, having lineally descended from <hi>Charlemayne,</hi> and in one respect of a better condition then his Brother was, when he married her, she being a Virgin and he a Widower. Nay he taxeth him of impiety that he should offer to make the Eternal Law of God touching mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to be baulk'd by a humane and temporary politic Constitution of <hi>France</hi> alterable at mens pleasures, which is, that the Heire Apparant of the Crown should not marry without Royall consent; and being married according to the Rites of the Church, to make this latter law to be of more force then the former.</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:98453:80"/>Poore <hi>Germany</hi> complaines that he hath plung'd her in an eternall war by bringing in the <hi>Swed,</hi> and by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting him ever since within her bowels: The <hi>Iesuits</hi> have also a saying to him, that his prime Confidents and Confederats were opposit to the <hi>Roman Catholic</hi> Church, as the <hi>Hollander,</hi> the <hi>Hessian,</hi> the <hi>Grison,</hi> the <hi>Swed,</hi> which cannot choose but be derogatory to the <hi>most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> King; The <hi>Spaniard</hi> saith further that he upheld not only old but new Rebells against him, as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talan</hi> and the <hi>Portugall,</hi> and that he need not glory much of his doings against his Monarchy, for <hi>France</hi> of her self had bin able to have done him little hurt, had she not ligu'd with, and employed his own revolted Vassals, as the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and the other <hi>two</hi> mentioned a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, against him; And therefore what mischief and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits <hi>France</hi> hath perform'd against him, was by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with these his subjects, otherwise she had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin able to have trodden as much as upon his toe.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the poore Pesans of France pitifully cry out that they are transform'd to meer Asses, that his wars were not onely maintain'd with their persons, but nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd with their bloud, with their very vitall spirits and livelihoods; that for many yeers he made them to soften and steep their bread in teares, which flow'd in such plenty, that there were enough to quench all the Bonefiers of triumph that have bin made since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Raign; the smoakes whereof were so thick that they hinder'd him to see their pitifull, meager looks, and grinded faces; and the clashing of his armes so great, that he could not hear their cryes. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that they are now so habituated to new impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s and inventions tending to slavery, that like <hi>Milo's</hi> beast, their burthen is grown up fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a calf to an ox since these wars; Yea they cry out that they are grown worse then Asses, they are become meer Dromedaries who not only receive the burden, but kneel down to take it up.</p>
            <p>To all these accusations somthing may be said in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:98453:80"/>
For his faylings with his subjects of the Religion, there are some that would cleer him by recrimination of them, for he never promis'd any thing categorically, but upon condition that they should also performe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, and the obligation of the one depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the performance of the other, so there were faylings on both sides.</p>
            <p>Touching <hi>D'Ancre</hi> he had so involv'd and mingled his own particular interests with those of the State, that an ordinary way could not separat them; He had likewise so distasted all the Princes, that he was like to be pernicious and destructive to his Kingdom, yet it was not his mind to have him suddenly assassinated in that manner; though on the other side, <hi>Wallestein</hi> was made away so by Imperiall warrant, and the act justified.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> he alledg'd neglect of homage, (which was unquestionably due unto him) and conjunction with his enemies, as also breach of promise that <hi>Monsieur</hi> should not mary his sister, and the giving of shelter to all Fugitives.</p>
            <p>For the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> touching the Treaty of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> though the Duke was not there in Person, yet his businesse was dispatch'd with as much advantage to him, as if he had bin there present, by the French Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors; nor had he as much cause of grievance, as he had of many high obligations of gratitude, to have his Countrey and Towns restor'd unto him which had bin so often overrun by the French armes.</p>
            <p>Concerning his colleguing with Protestants, <hi>Spain</hi> may be upbraided as well; for <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed <hi>Lutherans,</hi> whom he call'd his <hi>black bands,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> her self, and that by the advice of his Theologues: This present King <hi>Philip</hi> had pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat intelligence with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who pay'd him (and his brother) a yeerly Pension, to keep <hi>France</hi> in action by Civill Wars, and had entred into a Treaty
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98453:81"/>
with him accordingly consisting of divers capitulations; Moreover the <hi>Catholic</hi> Kings have had, and have to this day friendship and confederacie with divers Pagan Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and amongst others with the King of <hi>Calecut</hi> (who adores the Devil) for a little <hi>Pepper</hi> or such like Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities: Nor are there wanting examples how in the time of the <hi>Moores,</hi> the King of <hi>Aragon</hi> made use of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riscos</hi> against another Christian King. Another makes an odd Apologie for this King why he confederated with Protestants, and employ'd them so much in his wars, which is, that he made use of them against the greatnes of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> only, whom they su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and perfectly hate: And touching his subjects of the Religion in <hi>France,</hi> it was never out of any affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto them, or out of any conceit of fidelity he had of them, that from time to time he gave them Honor and offices in his Armies, but out of a politic end to diminish, and destroy them by degrees, for a greater number of them, then of <hi>Papists</hi> perish'd in his wars.</p>
            <p>For breaking with his Brother in law the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> he did it meerly out of political interests, and pure reason of State, which is now grown to the highest point of subtilty, and swayes the world more then ever; It is well known that <hi>France</hi> (as all <hi>Europe</hi> besides) hath bin for many yeers emulous of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and suspectfull of her greatnes, for she hath bin still growing and gathering more strength any time these hundred yeers; In so much that considering her huge large limbs she was become a Giant in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of all her neighbours; <hi>France</hi> was fearfull of this unproportionable hugenes of hers more then any, and therefore being somewhat distrustfull of his own strength to cope with her single, he enters into confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with others, as the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and <hi>Swed;</hi> So that this war of <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Spain</hi> is meerly <hi>preventive;</hi> Nor is <hi>preventive</hi> war a new thing, but we have warrant for it from Antiquitie; I am sure it is as old as that of <hi>Pele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponnesus,</hi>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:98453:81"/>
the ground whereof, was to keep the power of <hi>Athens</hi> within its wonted channel, which went daily swelling ore the old banks; this gave the first alarum to the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> to stand upon his Guard, and to put himself in Armes; whence afterwards issued that long liv'd war which History renders so famous to posterity. <hi>Alphonso</hi> K. of <hi>Castile</hi> made war against the <hi>Moors,</hi> and the rest of the Spanish Kings (for there were divers then in <hi>Spain</hi>) finding him encrease in power collegu'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; and the reason the Historian gives is, <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam satis fida principum potentia finitimis est, occasionem proferendi Imperii avidè arripiente natura mortalium.</hi> The Decree of the College of <hi>Sorbon</hi> is, <hi>That the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant greatnes of a neighbouring Prince may be a just ground for a war.</hi> 'Tis well known how watchfull those three <hi>Geryons</hi> of their times, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight of England, and <hi>Francis</hi> the First of France, were to keep their power in <hi>aequilibrio;</hi> they had alwayes an eye upon the Scale to see which way it panch'd and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pois'd: And it hath bin us'd to be the old policy &amp; power of <hi>England</hi> (though now crosse winds have long blown upon her) to question any of her neighbours touching their encrease of strength in shipping.

The last makes me think that it is high time for the <hi>Hollander</hi> to look about him considering the late acquests of the French in the Netherlands, and to be warnd by the old Proverb, <hi>Aye le François pour ton Amy, non pas pour ton voisin.</hi> Have the French for thy friend, not for thy neighbour.</p>

then formerly, by addition of the <hi>Palatinat, Triers,</hi> and other places in Germany: France took Armes to make him mew these new feathers, and she had those three things, which one said were requisit to make her eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, favourable unto her, viz. <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel:</hi> Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the Eight had his breeding there twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeers together and so was a friend to her; she had a competent number of Ships, and for Counsell she had <hi>Richelieu</hi> for her Pilot: He was not like your Countrey Wasters that <hi>Demosthenes</hi> writes of, who were us'd to grow skilful in defending those parts of the body where they had bin hurt, but he could foresee and fence away the blow before it was given: And for others, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried matters so that some of them found their hands sezi'd upon when they were ready to strike. This caus'd him to make his King the first aggressor of the war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Spain; wherein he had wonderfull successe, and done such feats (as hath appear'd already in the body of the story) that as they have struck an amazement in the present age, so they vvill breed an incredulity in the future.</p>
            <p>Touching the last complaint against him that he peel'd and poll'd the Peasan, 'tis true he did so; but he who is vers'd in the humour of that people, vvhat boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brains, and perpetuall inclinations they have to noveltie, and to break out into motion, if they be pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd with peace and riches, will conclude, that there is a necessitie to keep them short in point of wealth, vvhose ordinary effects are pride and insurrections: Yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve there may be other more laudable vvayes of policy us'd for prevention of this then <hi>poverty;</hi> It being a true maxime in the Academy of Honor, that it is more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious for a Prince, to be King of an opulent free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then of a slavish and beggerly: And the greatest reproach that Forreners cast upon the French Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is, that the vvealth of the Countrey should be so unequally dispenc'd, the King, Clergy, Nobles, and

Officers svvallovving up all, vvhile the common people have scarce that competency which beasts use to have to satisfie the necessities of Nature: for there is not upon earth a more plentiful Countrey, and a poorer people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, then the Pesantry of France. There vvas another reach of State vvhy the common people vvere kept so poore and indigent, vvhich vvas, that he might be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with soldiers to furnish his Infantry for the vvars, vvhereunto necessity vvill drive any one; At the sound of his Drum they came alvvaies in multitudes to serve him because he had alvvayes store of treasure to pay them; He had at one time above 120000. of them in severall Armies, nor vvere there ever such services per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by French <hi>foot,</hi> vvho formerly had but small re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute in the vvorld; vvith these and his cavalry he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd such exploits that as I said before, posterity must have a strong faith to beleeve them; such exploits that <hi>Mars</hi> himself (the ascendent of France) might have bin invited to partake of his triumphs;</p>
            <q>—vel et ipse vocari Iupiter ad praedam posset.</q>
            <p>With these he drew the overwhelmings of <hi>Spain</hi> into a narrower channel, and put her to cast her policy into a new mould, for whereas before she was for many yeers upon the conquering and <hi>offensive</hi> part, she is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to stand upon her guard, and put her self upon the conserving and <hi>defensive</hi> part.</p>
            <p>By these performances of France against the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of <hi>Spain</hi> it visibly appears, what advantage a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle body that hath his joynts well knit and compacted, and hath also his radicall moisture and radicall heat (the two gran columns of life) dispers'd in equall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion throughout all parts to actuate the whole and make it vigorous, (for such is France) may have over a huge unweldy bulk whose members by vast uneven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances are so loosly kept together as the <hi>Spanish</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98453:83"/>
is known to be; which, were she as closely knit as France, or the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire either which extends two and thirty hundred miles and but the (<hi>Hellespont</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween) in one continued peece from <hi>Buda</hi> in <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Bagdad</hi> or <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> I say, if the modern Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of Spain were so closely united, she might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the greatest that hath bin yet upon Earth.</p>
            <p>And now will we put an absolut period to the history of the life of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth. Which we have <hi>il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated</hi> in the best manner we could, as also to this Corollary and short transcurrence of his raign, which lasted thirty three yeers, and his whole life hardly reach'd to forty three, a time which as was said before, in a well dispos'd body is accounted but the Meridian of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; whether nature posted away, and hastned thus her course in him and made him old before his time by her own weaknes, or by accident, (as some mutter) we will not determin, but rather give faith to the first cause, and to divers dangerous sicknesses whereof he had pass'd the brunt formerly, as also to exces of care and intentivenes of mind, and personall pains in the war: He had a long time to study the art of dying, his disease being a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, which afforded him space enough to set his House in order; He spoak oft times of the troubles of <hi>Great Britain</hi> in his sicknes, and once he was overheard to say that it was a just judgement, because his Brother of <hi>England</hi> would have assisted his subjects once against him.</p>
            <p>So this great King died in the highest glory of his actions, for his sayles swell'd with prosperous winds till he came to his last port. He had settled all things so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, that when he came to die, he had nothing els to do, but to die, which he did so gently, that it was rather a soft dissolution then death; By his high exemplary vertues, and strangenes to vice he was a <hi>Saint amongst Kings</hi> on <hi>earth,</hi> and now may be a <hi>King among Saints</hi> in heaven, whither he went on <hi>Ascension day:</hi> For his acts
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98453:83"/>
of prowesse he deserves to have the <hi>Alps</hi> for his tomb, &amp; the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Mountains for his monument, for he made them both to stoop unto him: He left his Queen (a yeer and some moneths younger then himself) <hi>Regent,</hi> as it was her due by Saint <hi>Lewis</hi> law, which she might have clam'd by merit, as well as by right, for she had bin mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailously complying, carefull and indulgent of him; A Lady of admirable sweetnes, moderation, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, for she never tamper'd with the Government in his time, nor would she meddle with the Election of any Officer or Minister of State, nor interpose in any thing, but in matters of mercy and pardon, and then she would be sure to have an inkling how the King was inclin'd (which made her receive few denials) so that being much importun'd for <hi>Monmorency's</hi> pardon (whose first crime, was the last action of his life) she would by no means attempt it. The young King was foure yeers and eight moneths old when his father died, so that the Queen is to rule in chief till he be fourteen, whereby France, <hi>in statu quo nunc,</hi> may be said to have fallen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of Strangers, the Queen Regent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and <hi>Mazarini</hi> the Prime Minister of State an <hi>Italian.</hi>

When his father <hi>Francis De Plessis</hi> died he was but five yeers old, and so remain'd under the tutele of his Mother <hi>Susanna de Porta,</hi> who gave him all the advantagious breeding that could be in <hi>Paris</hi> (where he was born) both in an <hi>Academy</hi> for riding, and handling of armes, and in the <hi>University</hi> for learning; he made choice of the Colledge of <hi>Sorbon</hi> to finish the course of his studies, where he took the profession of a <hi>Theologue,</hi> and so became a <hi>Sorbonist</hi> Doctor. He had two brothers, <hi>Francis,</hi> the eldest, was kill'd by the Marquis of <hi>Themines</hi> in duel; <hi>Alphonso,</hi> the second, being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Bishop of <hi>Lusson</hi> forsook the pomp of the world, and betook himself to the austere life of a Carthusian (whose rule is never to eat flesh) and so resign'd the Bishoprick to his youngest brother <hi>Armand,</hi> whose life we write: But afterwards, by his meanes, the Carthusian Fryer was brought to accept of the Archbishoprick of <hi>Aix</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> then of <hi>Lions,</hi> and so ascended to be Cardinal.

               </hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he was us'd to call him <hi>his</hi> Bishop. For divers yeers he applied himself altogether to the function of his Ministery, and us'd to preach often in the Kings Chappell: In the Assembly of the three States he was chosen Orator for the Ecclesiastiques, where his pregnancy of wit first appeer'd publicly in matters of State: Where upon he got footing afterward at Court, and was made <hi>great Almoner:</hi> Then his abilities discovering themselfs more and more, he was nominated Ambassador extraordinary for Spain to accommode the differences then a foot 'twixt the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Mantova;</hi> when the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces started out in discontent, and put themselfs in armes to demolish the Marshall of <hi>Ancre,</hi> some Privy Counsellors were outed of their Offices at Court, amongst others Monsieur <hi>Villeray</hi> had his Writ of ease for being any more Secretary of State, and the Bishop of <hi>Lusson</hi> was thought the fittest man to succeed him, and to receive the Seales, which he did, and this diverted him from his forren employment to <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the Marquis of <hi>Ancre</hi> was Pistol'd, and his wife beheaded, there was a new face of things at Court, another generation of Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers grew out of the corruption of the old, among others, <hi>Villeroy</hi> steps in to be Secretary of State again in the room of the Bishop of <hi>Lusson,</hi> yet was the King willing he should sit still at the Counsell Table; and Monsieur <hi>de Vignobles</hi> brought him an intimation of the Kings pleasure to that purpose: But the Queen Mother retyring from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Blois,</hi> he chose rather to go with his old Mistresse, then stay with a young Master as the pulse of the Court did beat then; By some ill offices that were done 'twixt the King and his Mother, by factious spirits, many jealousies were dayly fomented between them; Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Bishop of <hi>Lusson,</hi> had order to withdraw himself from her Court; so he retir'd to his Priory of <hi>Caussay,</hi> but that distance being thought not sufficient, he betook himself to his Bishoprick at <hi>Lus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and that place also being suspected to be too neer, he was sent to

               <hi>Avignon</hi> the Popes Town, which might be call'd a banishment, for it was out of the Dominion of France.

The Queen Mother was fled thither from the Castle of <hi>Blois,</hi> and by means of the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> with others had considerable forces a foot: Here was a brave opportunity offer'd for the Bishop to shew his head-peece in atoning matters 'twixt the Mother and the Son, for which end he was inordred to repaire thither: He negotiated the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines so succesfully by his dextrous addresses, and flexaminous strains of eloquence that he took away the inflamation of the wound, and so made it easily curable: A Treaty was agreed upon, and the Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being drawn he brought them to the King, who receiv'd him with much shew of grace; and so all matters were accommoded: But this accommodation did not heale quite and consolidat the wound, for it had not search'd it to the bottome, therefore it began to fester, and more putrified matter broak out of it then formerly: The Mother and the Son take up armes again, and the Bishop of <hi>Lusson</hi> was one of the prime Instruments to re-compose the busines, which was done at last very effectually. The merit of these high services got him a Red Hat, and the dignity of Cardinal, though some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and many delayes interven'd before the finall dispatch came from <hi>Rome:</hi> Then was he chosen <hi>Provisor</hi> of the ancient Colledge of <hi>Sorbon;</hi> where he procur'd of the King that a new Chair of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie should be erected. He also repair'd and much beautified that Colledge; Then, upon the instance, and by the advice of the Queen Mother, he was elected <hi>Prime Minister of State,</hi> and <hi>Director</hi> in chief under the King of all matters concerning the public Government of the Kingdome, so he came to be call'd the <hi>Argos</hi> of France.</p>
            <p>The first great action that was performed by his guidance, when he was clim'd to this <hi>Plenipotentiary</hi> power was the Mariage with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the Marquis of <hi>Vieu ville</hi> had been employ'd in this great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines, but the Cardinal got some of the Capitulations better'd and more to the advantage of France, alledging that it was not fit his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being the <hi>Eldest Son</hi> of the Church should have conditions infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to those of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this <hi>Match</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> there was an <hi>alliance</hi> also made about the same time with <hi>Holland</hi> for a summe of Money. These were the two first <hi>Coups d' estat,</hi> stroaks of State that he made, and it was done with this forecast, that France might be the better enabled to suppres them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> which the Cardinal found to be the greatest weaknes of that Kingdom: Some of them being Pensioners to other Princes to embroyle France upon all occasions.</p>
            <p>He found then that the House of <hi>Austria</hi> had got some advantage, and encrease of power, by certain holds it had seiz'd upon in the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolin;</hi>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:98453:86"/>
He adviseth his King to ligue with the <hi>Venetian</hi> and the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyard,</hi> which he did and so spoil'd the design of the Spaniard that way.</p>
            <p>The King being told that upon the beheading of the Count of <hi>Chalais,</hi> and the imprisonment of the Marquis of <hi>Ornano</hi> about Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs Mariage, his Cardinal had thereby got divers enemies, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him a band of Soldiers for his guard; After this he was made <hi>Super-Intendent Generall of the Marine,</hi> a new Office, and such, that there was never any of the like latitud of power erected in France, for thereby he had authority to supervise not onely all the Sea Ports and shipping of in both the Seas, but to do any thing that might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duce to the regulating and advance of Trade: so he fell presently to work, and fortified <hi>Haure de grace, Brouage,</hi> the Isle of <hi>Ré, Oleron, Verdun,</hi> with divers other. Afterwards happen'd the Siege of <hi>Rochell</hi> where in the Kings absence he was made General a while, and that famous Sea Dike was ascrib'd to his invention in chief, after fifteen moneths siege the town was reduc'd, having bin driven to the utmost extremities of want, as to eat nefandous meats, the leather of Coches which serv'd before for Instuments of pride, did now preserve them from starving; at last they petition'd the Cardinal to be their Intercessor to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie for them, who got them more favourable conditions then was expected.</p>
            <p>The King went thence to <hi>Italy</hi> with the same Army for the most part, and having cross'd the <hi>Alps,</hi> he took the passe of <hi>Susa,</hi> and rais'd the siege of <hi>Casal</hi> only with the fame of his Person and Armes, and so reliev'd the Duke of <hi>Mantova,</hi> having had besides some dispute with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> about his passage, he left the Cardinal behind to see all things settled: Who returning afterwards to France found the King in <hi>Languedock</hi> having debell'd almost the whole body of them of the <hi>Religion,</hi> but the Plague being hot in that Province, he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and left his Cardinal to perfect the work, which he did at <hi>Mountauban,</hi> which was the last Town that was surrendred, and so may be said to have bin the key of the whole work.</p>
            <p>Being return'd to <hi>Paris</hi> there came news that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> abetted by Imperial and Catholic armes poursued still his interests against the Duke of <hi>Mantova;</hi> In prejudice as was pretended, of the late Articles 'twixt him and France; The Cardinal was appointed <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of two Armies, wherewith he travers'd the Alps again, took the Town and Castle of <hi>Pignerol;</hi> and returning to <hi>Lion,</hi> to give account of his service he found the King sick, and powerfull enemies at Court, but especially he found the Queen Mother averse to him; He perceiv'd the faction so strong against him, that he fell on his knees before the King desiring that he would please to dispense with his attendance any more at Court, and that he might be permitted to retire to his devotions and the functions of his Ministery; the King being now indifferently wel recover'd, went to visit him the next day, and absolutly denied him leave to depart the Court, saying, <hi>There</hi>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:98453:86"/>
               <hi>was no reason he should forsake them who loved him, to humor the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chios of those that did not love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kings Army which he had left in Italy under <hi>Schomberg</hi> was at this time at an extreme low ebb, and upon point of mutining if not disbanding for want of pay, and there was scarce one thousand pound then in the Kings Coffers; yet, notwithstanding the branling hazardous stand he was at, by reason of the Kings sicknes, and the potent combination which was a foot, and banded so eagerly against him, he, of his own store, sent two hundred thousand Franks to keep life in the Army, and this was before the Kings recovery, or assurance of the continuation of his favor.</p>
            <p>He was afterwards made <hi>General</hi> of the Order of the Abbots of <hi>Premonstré,</hi> and he had also the attribut of <hi>Eminence</hi> given him, which was solemnly confirmed by <hi>Rome,</hi> to distinguish and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarize him from other Cardinals, and Princes of the Church: nor would he receive any Letters, or speak with any Ambassadors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they would give him that Title: The Queen Mother utterly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking his aimes of policy, which tended to put the Princes, her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, together by the eares, forsook <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Monsieur</hi> followed her. He return'd with a considerable strength of horse, and <hi>Monmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency,</hi> the popular'st man of France, joyn'd with him, to reform the State, and to ruine the Cardinal, who was us'd to call the said <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morency</hi> his <hi>son,</hi> but they miss'd of their ayme; Afterwards the Count of <hi>Soissons,</hi> joyn'd with the Duke of <hi>Bovillon</hi> attempted the like, and had <hi>Soissons</hi> liv'd it was probable they might have done something, for they had utterly routed the Kings Army, but <hi>Soissons</hi> being kill'd, it quail'd the whole plot. The last attempt to destroy him was by Monsieur <hi>le Grand,</hi> who had intelligence with the Spaniard, but it was detected, and so crush'd in the shell, and he with Monsieur <hi>de Thou</hi> beheaded. There were also divers privat attempts upon him, <hi>Alfeston</hi> would have pistoll'd him, <hi>Chavagnac</hi> and <hi>Barnard</hi> would have poison'd him, <hi>Gargan</hi> and <hi>Bouchard,</hi> who were reputed Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, would have bewitch'd him, but they had all ropes for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: so nature ran out her course in him without violence, for he died in his bed, and at his house in <hi>Paris</hi> about the dead of Winter in the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> a little after the King had visited him, and bad him his last adieu, having not reach'd 58. yeers; His right arme began to mortifie many moneths before, and his whole body was grown so lanke and thin as it look'd like an Anatomy.</p>
            <p>He principally recommended to the King Cardinal <hi>Iulio Mazarini,</hi> to whom he had open'd all the boxes of his breast, together with Monsieur <hi>Chauvigny &amp; Noyer,</hi> advising his Majesty to steer his cours by their Counsell, and he should still prosper and triumph: He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath'd his body to the Colledge of <hi>Sorbon;</hi> And touching his estate, which was valued at neer upon sixty millions of Franks, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it to sundry Legacies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he gave the Marquis of <hi>Pont de Courlay</hi> the Duchy of <hi>Richelieu</hi> together with the government of <hi>Brouage:</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:98453:87"/>
To the Marquis of <hi>Brezé</hi> the Duchy of <hi>Fronsac</hi> estimated at an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Franks yeerly rent, together with the government of <hi>Haure de grace:</hi> He bequeath'd to the Duchesse of <hi>Eguillon</hi> his House at <hi>Ruel</hi> with fifty thousand Franks rent. He gave Monsieur <hi>du Plessis Chinee</hi> twenty thousand crowns a yeer. His <hi>Cardinal</hi> Palace in <hi>Paris</hi> where he expir'd he bequeath'd to the King, with all the Plate and Housholdstuffe thereunto belonging, and a Jewel valued at two hundred thousand crowns: To the young <hi>Dauphin</hi> he gave his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary rated at fifty thousand crownes: To every one of his Praeto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian soldiers he bequeath'd two hundred crowns apeece, and preferr'd them all for a guard to the <hi>Dauphin;</hi> By this vast estate it appears that though he was so active in his Masters busines, yet he did not neglect his own, so that the Kings service was not the <hi>sole Center</hi> of his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as he was usd to say often.</p>
            <p>Such was the emigration out of this world of <hi>Armand Iohn du Plessis Cardinal of Richelieu, Duke, and Peer of France, Knight of the holy Spirit, and Super-Intendent Generall of the navigation and commerce of France, Principall Minister, and Director in chief of all affairs both of State and Warre, &amp;c.</hi> having bin thrice General, and once <hi>Generalis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo</hi> of three Royall Armies.</p>
            <p>Questionlesse he was a man had a rare talent, and rich intellectualls, of a notable vivacity of spirit, and constancy of resolution, of a prompt, yet profound imagination, of a subtill discours, yet solid judgement, (things which seldome meet in one subject under that Clime) of pressing and powerfull reason, and a tenacious memory, in so much that all the faculties of his soule being summond to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult seriously upon any businesse, they were enough to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Senat of themselfs. Add hereunto that he had an admirable gift of elocution attended with state and gravity, and very swaying as it went along: Many examples could be produc'd hereof, but we will instance in three only; In a <hi>Complement,</hi> in a <hi>Letter,</hi> and in an <hi>Oration</hi> of his, which may serve to make a judgement of the rest: For the first, when he had receiv'd the Cardinals Hat from <hi>Rome,</hi> he attended the Queen Mother and told her, as if he had been surpriz'd with a kind of amazement,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam, I want words to expresse the thankfulnes of my heart to your Majesty, all that I can say, is, that I will spend my best bloud, and all my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in your service, and this Scarlet, which I weare by your goodnes, shall make me always remember this vow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the second, when the Queen mother was retir'd to the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> out of a high displeasure against him, he writ to her this ensuing Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <p>Madame, I know my enemies, or rather the enemies of this <hi>State,</hi> not contented to have discredited me unto your Maiesty, do endeavour also to make my attendance neere the King, to be suspected; as if my neernes to his Person tended to remove him from you, and to separat what God and nature
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98453:87"/>
hath so closely conjoyn'd: I hope by the goodnes of God that their malice will be discoverd, that my cariage will be shortly justified, and that my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence shall triumph over calumny.</p>
                  <p>Neverthelesse Madame, I shall account my self still infortunat, in that I am made to cease from pleasing your Majesty, and life it self is irksome unto me in the state I am in, finding my self depriv'd of the honor of your favor, and of that esteem which I valued more then all the greatnes of the earth, and as those which I possesse proceed from your liberall hand, so I cast and prostrat them all at your Royall feet. Excuse Madame your own work and creature, whatsoever shall proceed from your Majesties pleasure, shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by me without murmuring, and accepted with a thousand thanks. But Madame, out of that piety which is inhaerent in you, be pleased to spare the purple of the Church wherewith you have adorn'd me, which will lose its esteeme and lustre, if your Majesty cast upon it such black spots: How can it, be that the most oblig'd of men, should prove the most ingratefull? And that my conscience, my first inclination, and interest binding me to your service, I should now separat my self from it, and thereby draw upon my self the name of Traitor to the best and greatest Queen upon Earth?</p>
                  <p>This, Madame, well consider'd should absolve me from all crime, and free me from all suspition before your Majesties tribunal, where I am almost condemn'd without being heard: I appeal not from it, in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect obedience I beare to your will, I only blame my misfortune, but will not dispute with my Soverain Mistresse, nor ask reason of her for what is pass'd, nor do I intend to make use of the Kings favour, or any ministers of his, or of the remembrance of my former services, against the bent of your indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: the very thoughts hereof would be a crime, and opposit to my hopes, which are to find glory in fidelity, and safety in innocence: I desire lesse to dragg my fortune in France, or to cary it to <hi>Rome,</hi> to see more lamentable ruines then mine own: Wheresoever your Majesty shall be, if I be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted accesse, it will be death unto me; and wheresoever I go, it shall be to go out of the world; yet I desire for my reputes sake, and for the rank I hold in the House of God, that it might be after the vindication of my innocence, and, if it be not too great a boldnesse, after the recovery of your Majesties favor: If fortune afford me this, I shall little resent my going out of the Court, nor out of the world, because I die a thousand times a day, since your Majesty gives out, that I am not the same, I was, which is</p>

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:98453:88"/>
of the old Assembly of the three Estates, the King himself sitting there in Majesty.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sir;</hi> 'Tis needles in my judgemetnt to represent unto this Illustrious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, the great Actions your Majesty hath perform'd within this yeer, as well in regard the Lord Keeper hath acquitted himself very worthily of that task, as also because they speak cleerly enough of themselfs; And there is no man but sees that God hath been pleas'd to make use of that piety, prudence and courage which he hath infus'd into your Majesty, to work those advantages to France in so small a time, which some held impossible to be done in an age: Nor is there any need to let them know the vast expence these high actions have caried with them, because every one knows, that in matters of State, great atchievements cannot be done with little charge, and the numerous troupes of Combatants which your Majesty hath bin enforc'd to entertain at one time in sundry places, as well within, as without your Kingdom, afford understanding men occasion to magnifie your power, as well as to admire your vast expence.</p>
               <p>There is not any amongst you my Lords, who knows not with what pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse this treasure hath bin issued, and what necessity there was of it; the probity of those who manag'd the finances justifieth the first point: and the oppression of the Allies of this Crown, and the rebellion of them, who are Traytors to God in this Kingdom do sufficiently assert the truth of the second: the desseins of some having bin no sooner projected, then form'd, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his Majesty in reducing France to her first splendor: In so much that this State considering the utility she receives thereby together with her Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, have more cause to approve, then complain of these charges.</p>
               <p>Matters, thanks be to God, are now at a good point, but one cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that they will continue so alwaies, and it were to want judgement to think that they must not be push'd on further; Of necessity this Kingdom must be left expos'd to the attempts of those who daily meditat the abasing, if not the ruine thereof, or there must be means found to secure it. The Kings intentions are to rule it so, that his government may equall, if not surpasse any time pass'd, and serve for an example for the future. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailous assistance which it hath pleased God to afford him hitherto, when his affairs were in the most deplor'd case, gives us hope that he will still per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severe: Being seconded with the sage counsels of the Queen his Mother, with the concurrence of <hi>Monsieur</hi> his Brother, who I may truly say is so fastned to his Majesties will, and the interest of the State, that nothing can separat him: I see no reason at all to doubt of it, since none but God Almighty can produce things of nothing, therefore to come to so good ends, of pure necessity, either the ordinary expences of the Court must be diminish'd, or the public receits augmented, or perchance both must be done.</p>
               <p>It is not fitting you'l say, to meddle with the necessary expences, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the State, the very thought thereof were a crime: yet his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty preferring the public before the privat, is willing out of his own motion to retrench his House in things that touch his own Person, leaving you to judge how the rest will be employ'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:98453:88"/>One might think that such retrenchments were not seasonable at this time, because they use to alienat sometimes the affections of hearts: But as the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse will be carried, great and small shall find their account and therein their satisfaction; the most austere rules seem sweet unto the most tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous spirits, when they have, not in appearance only but in reall effect, the public good and incolumity of the State for their sole aime.</p>
               <p>Sir, the Queen your Mother, prayes that you would think it good to let her do that, which your piety towards her would not permit you as much as to think of your self, which is that she be reduc'd to a lower revenue then she had in the late Kings time; it being true that she had not better'd her condition then, when during your Majesties minority she rais'd the fortunes of others for the advantage of your Majesties service. Different times require different and sometimes contrary courses, that which is proper at one time may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent at another.</p>
               <p>In great tempests one must share his goods with the Sea, to lighten the Vessell, and avoid shipwrack; prudence requires it, that the whole perish not, for casting away part: the interest of particulars obligeth no lesse then that of the public; there being nothing more true then what an ancient Prelat of this Kingdome said, <hi>That 'tis impossible the riches of private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons can subsist when the State it self is poore and necessitous:</hi> By such husbandry the ordinary expences may be lessen'd by three millions.</p>
               <p>It rests then to augment the receits, not by such impositions that the people are not able to beare, but by innocent means which gives place to the King to continue what he hath practis'd this yeer in easing his subjects by diminution of tallies. To this effect we must come to the redemption of lands, to Notaries, and Registers, and other morgag'd rights which amount to twenty millions, a thing not onely profitable but just and necessary.</p>
               <p>If this dessein take effect, the people who contribut more of their <hi>bloud,</hi> then of their <hi>sweat</hi> to the expences of the State, shall be eas'd.</p>
               <p>If there be need to resist a forren Invasion, or some intestine Insurrection, (if God for our sins permit any more) or to execute a dessein that's profitable and glorious for the State, want of money will be no losse of time; there will be no need to have recours to extraordinary wayes, to Court partisans, and put hands in their purses who have them oft times full of the Kings moneys: One shall not see the Soverain Courts busied to verifie new Edicts: Kings shall appear no more upon their beds of justice, unlesse it be to undo what they had done some other time: In fine, all things shall be at such a passe, that hath bin long since desir'd by all good men, and may continue so whole Ages.</p>
               <p>One will say, and perchance I may think so my self, that 'tis easie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose good desseins, and as pleasing a thing to speak of them, but the execution is difficult: Yet neverthelesse, I dare speak it in the presence of the King, having well thought of it, there may be expedients found whereby within the compas of six yeers one may see the end and perfection of this work: The King, my Lords and Gentlemen, hath Assembled you expresly, to search and find them out, to examine things, and concur with him in resolution, his
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98453:89"/>
Majesty assuring you, that he will readily and religiously execute what shall be determin'd for the restauration of this State.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The sick sometimes die, by too many remedies, as well, as none at all;</hi> I am bound to tell you this by the by, that to restablish this State in its first splendor, ther's no need of <hi>many Ordinances,</hi> but real executions; by this means this Assembly may close more speedily, though she may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall for the fruit she shall produce: few words and many deeds will testifie both the good intentions, and judgements of them whereof she is compos'd.</p>
               <p>The King doubts not but you will do what concerns your duty in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence: You shall know by the event that his Majesty will surpasse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to procure the good of his Kingdome, the glory of reviving it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd to the vertu of so great a Prince: you are much bound to his goodnes, that he hath vonchsaf'd to make you partakers thereof, and for my parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular I should be much bound to God, if he presently took me out of the world upon the accomplishment of so high, so glorious, and holy a work.</p>
            </q>
            <p>As thus in things premeditated, so in ordinary extemporall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, he had a pressing way of eloquence, and exaggeration of speech, which came from him in such a grave serious accent that it mov'd all along, In so much that by his garb he seem'd to be rather an <hi>Italian</hi> then French; seldom or never would reason thrust be out of her throne by any impetuous irregular motions; seldome would his passions make any furious sallies; the greatest fit of distemper that ever was discover'd in him was, at the news of <hi>Wallesteyns</hi> death, with whom he had held intelligence for betraying the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army, &amp; so to pave a way for France to ascend the Empire: He would easily break out into tears, and tendernesse of spirit. The prime perfection in him was his forecast, he was quick-sighted and Eagle-ey'd in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of christendom; He had Ecchoes in every Court which sounded unto him all the affairs of State, in so much that he knew as well what was done in the Junta's of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the Consistory at <hi>Rome,</hi> in the Cabinet Counsels of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> as if he had bin Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of all their Counsels; He had his beagles abroad every where, which were excellent to find the sent of things, and amongst others one <hi>de Lope</hi> a Jew was his chiefest Spy: A little before the revolt of <hi>Catalonia</hi> and <hi>Portugall,</hi> he was overheard to say, <hi>That shortly he would give the Spaniard such a bone to gnaw, that should shake all the teeth in his head:</hi> And touching the troubles of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> he was us'd to say, 'twas easie for one with half an eye to have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen them.</p>
            <p>He had an excellent invention to devise wayes to get money, in so much that when the Cow slack'd, he had a way to presse her nipples, so that all the time of his sway the King never wanted Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: he us'd France like <hi>Prospero Colunnas</hi> Goose, pluck the old fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the new ones will grow the faster.</p>
            <p>He gave her likewise all sorts of Physick, sometimes he would give
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98453:89"/>
her a purge, sometimes a vomit, then would he often Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize her, and by sweating and fluxing do away the peccant humors: He held that Principle a vain thing, which calls the <hi>peoples hearts, the Kings best Exchequer:</hi> He verified the saying, that</p>

            <p>He thought often upon that Maxim that <hi>populus aut humiliter servit, aut superbè dominatur</hi> The common people serve slavishly, or rule proudly; they are like fire and water, <hi>Good servants, but ill Masters;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he kept them under, by impositions and poverty: It was long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King took him into his bosome, though he had always a great conceit of his abilities: A good while when he saw him come to Court, he was us'd to say sometimes, <hi>Voycy venir le Fourbe,</hi> Here coms the cunning Companion; but afterwards he so fastned upon his affections, that whereas to others, Kings favours are but as Tenacies at wil, the Kings favor to him might be call'd a stable possession, 'twas not as brittle glasse, but as firm as Diamond: Thus for twenty yeers together he sayl'd securely upon the Ocean of Royall favour, which useth to be full of rocks, shelfs, and Quicksands, but he knew the use of the Compasse so well, that he avoyded them all.</p>
            <p>He was marvailously constant to his ends, assiduous and sagacious, whereby he took off from the Frenchman that reprochfull saying, which defines him to be an <hi>animal sine praeterito et futuro.</hi> He fitted his projects so aptly to the means, and the means to the ends, that he sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome fayl'd of his expectation: He stird all the Caecodaemons of hell against the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and a little before he died he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pull the King of Spain out of his <hi>Escuriall;</hi> such was his forren Intelligence, that he did the Enemy more mischief by discovering of his Counsels, then by discomfiting his Armes. He had such a nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehension, that he oft times would find out truth at first search, the prime motions of his thoughts being so conclusive, that what discours he form'd upon them afterward, was but an approbation of the first Idaea, which needed no addition.</p>
            <p>He was no great zelot in his own Religion, but as he made her sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to his politicall ends; nor would he ever employ Jesuit: he had a moderate opinion of the <hi>Reformists,</hi> which made him to be call'd the <hi>Huguenot Cardinal.</hi> And he would have often in his mouth this saying, <hi>Maneat moralis benevolentia, inter discordes sententia.</hi> Yet he writ a book against them, which is extant. He did them more mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98453:90"/>
by complementing with them, then by combating; He was overheard to say that he had taken <hi>Rochell</hi> in <hi>despight of three Kings,</hi> meaning his own for one, for it was a great while before the King could be induc'd to that expedition: Saint <hi>Martin</hi> was beholding to him for his <hi>cloake,</hi> els the English had taken it away from him at the Isle of <hi>Ré:</hi> with which cloake 'twas said, Saint <hi>Martin</hi> cover'd him afterwards in many Battailes.</p>
            <p>He was a great cherisher and promoter of vertuous men, and would find them out wheresoever they were, in so much that he gave every yeer in pensions little lesse then an hundred thousand Franks. He e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected two Universities, one in <hi>Paris</hi> call'd <hi>L'Academie de beaux Esprits,</hi> where the prime wits of the Kingdom met every Munday; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Richelieu</hi> where the Mathematiques and other Sciences were read in the French Language: the difficulty of the Latin deterring many from the study of them in other places. He did so oblige all the wits of the Kingdom, that they strove who should magnifie him most; and there were never such hyperbolicall expressions of any man and not without some mixture of profanenes, which shews that there is no <hi>Inquisition</hi> in France. Some said, <hi>That God Almighty might put the government of the world into his hands: That France in God, and the Cardinals hands were too strong:</hi> that, <hi>What the soule was to the body, the same he was to France.</hi>

            <p>Master <hi>Iohn Sirmond</hi> shall take the qualitie of the Duke of <hi>Sabin,</hi> and of the Marquis of <hi>Cleonville;</hi> he shall clap a sword at his side, and take for his train five or six of the <hi>Gazetic</hi> Academy, which we have made hardy lyers: Above all things they shall be instructed in the prayses of my Lord the Cardinal Duke, and to that effect they shall cun by heart all the Poems, Epigrams, Acrostiques, Anagrams, Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and other peeces made by the Latin and French Poets of the Times, which they shall disperse up and down gratis as they passe, but for fear that this Merchandize be not forestall'd, and this false money cryed down, we command the said Ambassador to depart as soon as possibly he can, because our affairs do presse us, &amp; we may chance take our measures short in regard Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> terming himself Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> is nimble because of the nourture he hath had in France; and the Germans, being now tyr'd with the troubles we have brought
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98453:91"/>
in amongst them may end the war; the Spaniard also resents our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries more then ever, and those Devils the <hi>Crabats</hi> advance towards our Frontiers.</p>
            <p>The Ambassador shall speak neither good nor ill of the King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Majesty knowing nothing of this Ambassy may chance dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advow it: He shall accommode himself to the beleef of all Princes, Republiques, and people, and shall make semblance to be of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or Sect of them with whom he is to treat; He shall extoll the prayses of the <hi>most eminent among mortals,</hi> he shall call him a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God, the tutelar Angel of the Univers, the Spirit that moves the heavens and stars, the happines of the world, the supreme intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the Phoenix of the earth who never had, nor is like to have his equall, &amp;c. If he find that it be taken ill that we have injur'd all the Princes of Christendom, he shall study some reasons to make them digest all: If he find perhaps that any books have been printed in Flanders against my Lord the Cardinal, he shall avouch that they are abominable, and to be burnt by the hangman, if he speak with any that detest Magic, he shall assure them that these books are full of such stuff; If he find that Champagnie trembles, and that there is a dessein to shake off the yoak in <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Alsatia,</hi> he shall swear and all his followers besides, that my Lord the Cardinal hath rais'd 150000. foot, 20000. horse, 10000. pioners, and so many cariage horses, 300. Canons, with a proportionable number of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, 100. millions in gold to give the law to all <hi>Europe:</hi> That besides landforces he hath 500. Galeons of war at Sea laden with 50000. men more, and that there is bisket, beverage &amp; fresh water which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not corrupt to nourish them for ten yeers: That there are engins which will reduce instantly to ashes any Town that resists; that there be Vessels that can sayle between two waters, and that can go under other ships to blow them up into the Air, or sink them: That he hath found out <hi>Archimedes</hi> his griping irons, whose vertue is to grapple a ship a thousand paces off: In fine, my Lord, the Ambassador shall omit nothing that may give security to Champagnie, and strike a terror into <hi>Lorain,</hi> and he shall cary the busines so, that the same argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may serve to raise fear and hopes.</p>
            <p>He shall passe as speedily as he can by <hi>Strasburg, Frankfort, Nurem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> and other Imperiall Towns, which have not so much knowledge of the artifice of my Lord the Cardinal Duke, and if he thinks fitting he shall conceale his quality, and disadvow his Countrey, he may say he is an <hi>Englishman,</hi> to which effect he shall make use of his Latin, and counterfeit as well as he can the English accent.</p>
            <p>If he is bound to enter into the states of the Duke of <hi>Saxe,</hi> and of the Marquis of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> he shall passe as speedily as possibly he can, because those wretches have half spoild our mystery, in making their own peace, then, when we thought to have made them perish with us; and since they would not do so, they have rendred themselfs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the good grace of the <hi>most eminent amongst mortals,</hi> and let
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98453:92"/>
them be assured <hi>that the Spirit which moves the stars</hi> will cast ill influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences upon them.</p>
            <p>Then shall he passe to <hi>Poland</hi> to find the King, whom he shall salute in the name of the <hi>most eminent among mortals,</hi> he shall assure him of his friendship, and swear unto him that he will hold good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with him, provided that he enter in person with his forces into <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to make war against his Uncle: It is here that my Lord Ambassador shall display all his eloquence to shew that to gain further security and further encrease of power ther's no <hi>kinred,</hi> and that amongst Soverains the Soverain law ought to be that which force of armes gives the weaker. The expedients requir'd to ruine the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> shall be propos'd in this maner: That the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> doth promise ten millions of gold to the King of Poland, assuring him of the Imperiall Crown: If he saith that we have no Electors on our side since the Archbishop of <hi>Triers</hi> was so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily taken away: my Lord Ambassador shall assure him, that we are so strong the t'other side of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> that we shall constrain the three Ecclesiastic Electors, and the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to do whatsoever we please. There is no question for that, but to afford us means by a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diversion to settle our Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia,</hi> according to the Cart that <hi>Bertius</hi> made to the <hi>most eminent among mortals,</hi> and which is always at the ruel of his bed. It is an Empire that's design'd for his Eminence, who scorns to be call'd Cardinal Duke, and would be King at any rate. This Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia</hi> contains all the Country 'twixt the <hi>Mose</hi> and the <hi>Rhin,</hi> to begin at the French County, and to end at the source of both the Rivers. We have already <hi>Lorain, Alsatia, Monbeliard,</hi> some part of the lower <hi>Palatinat, Mentz,</hi> and something of <hi>Triers;</hi> we have when we will the French <hi>Conté, Luxemberg, Liege, Colen, Iuliers, Cleves,</hi> and <hi>Gueldres;</hi> we shall agree well enough with the <hi>Hollander</hi> for what they hold, and so we shall make a Kingdom for the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> of 160. Leagues long, rich and well peopled, which shall be given in mariage to the most accomplish'd Lady on earth the Neece of that spirit which moves the heavens, who calls her self Madame <hi>de Combalet.</hi> My Lord Ambassador may shew her picture to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and if he likes her, he may promise him for a dowry the Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia,</hi> the Duchy of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> thirty places more in France, and ten millions of good gold without the false money of the same allay which we gave the <hi>Swed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the King of <hi>Poland</hi> say, that the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> cosend the last King his father, and that in the yeer 1630. <hi>Charnassé</hi> came in the behalfe of his <hi>Eminence</hi> to treat of a Truce 'twixt the Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Swethland,</hi> to give thereby opportunity to the latter to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Pomerland,</hi> and thence to <hi>Germany,</hi> as it appears by the Letter and Instructions of his <hi>Eminence</hi> in the moneth of <hi>Iuly</hi> of the same yeer: If it be alleg'd that the same time that <hi>Charnassé</hi> treated of these things in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Swethland, Cormolin</hi> was in <hi>Moscovie</hi> for his <hi>Eminence,</hi> to invite the <hi>Russe</hi> against the <hi>Pole</hi> which he effected; If these
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:98453:92"/>
people, which are so simple as to give credit to any thing, do accuse us of perfidiousnes, he must then disclaime the actions of <hi>Cormolin,</hi> and swear that he had his head chop'd off for making the <hi>Muscovit</hi> arme against <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If my Lord Ambassador advance nothing in <hi>Poland,</hi> where it's like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are too well known, he shall go to <hi>Russia,</hi> and let him take heed that the Barbarians treat him not ill among those woods: He shall go streight habited like an Englishman or a Hollander to <hi>Mosco</hi> to find out the Emperour, to tell him the reasons which hindred him to send in the yeer 1633. the supply of men and money which his <hi>Eminence</hi> had promis'd him, and that the Turk was not made to enter into <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as the Basha of <hi>Buda</hi> made his <hi>Eminence</hi> beleeve: He shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that if he please to break the treaty of Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> that Prince shall be engaged far in <hi>Germany:</hi> Besides my Lord Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor notwithstanding any denial shall sweare that the party is made and tyed already, and so the <hi>Moscovit</hi> shall have a brave time of it in <hi>Poland.</hi> If these savages cry out, that the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> is the cunning'st among mortals, and that he caus'd the <hi>Moscovit</hi> to lose his repute before <hi>Smolensko</hi> where they were beaten like so many dogs which made them part with two Provinces, and make a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Peace; If they add that the <hi>Turk</hi> will attempt nothing on <hi>Poland</hi> because of the knowledge the Gran Signor hath of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of that invincible King, then my Lord Ambassador shall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, for fear he receive some affront.</p>
            <p>We do not judge it necessary that my Lord Ambassador go back to <hi>Buda</hi> to treat with the Basha, to make him surprise some places in <hi>Hungary,</hi> his Predecessor having had his head chopt off for having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriz'd some things against the intentions of the great Turk, and for receiving the moneys we sent him; It may be feared that he who commands at present may command two of his Janizaries to put my Lord Ambassador on his back and to give him an hundred stroaks with a Bulls pizzle upon his belly, as Monsieur <hi>de Saney</hi> was us'd in <hi>Constantinople</hi> for a peece of roguery he did. Besides we hope the great Turk will break the peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> and the truce with the Emperour, to which purpose we have employ'd Monsieur <hi>de Thou</hi> to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> whither he hath caried provision to make that great Army the Turke hath at Sea to descend into <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> or to <hi>Malta;</hi> he hath also in charge to interpose for a peace 'twixt the <hi>Turk</hi> and the <hi>Persian,</hi> and to unite them if he can that they may destroy Christendom.</p>
            <p>We leave it to the discretion of my Lord Ambassador whether he see the Vayvod of <hi>Transylvania,</hi> but if he resolve to go thither, he shall represent unto him that the whole earth wonders that he attempts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing against the Emperour, he shall exhort him to imitat his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor the valiant <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> and tell him that all the good Houses of France have his pourtrait in their Galleries, with that of the King of <hi>Swed,</hi> and that his Highnes should do well to send also his in doing
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:98453:93"/>
some act of courage; If he say that he hath an alliance with the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and friendship with <hi>Hungary,</hi> and that for a Picture he will not hazard the Originall, in this case the Lord Ambassador is to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself hansomly.</p>
            <p>Then shall he enter <hi>Tartary</hi> where 'tis probable we shall manage our busines better, because that people know us not so well, withall they are fitter for our turn, in regard they place all right, in Armes as we have hitherto done: That they stay not long in one place, like the <hi>most Eminent of mortals,</hi> my Lord Ambassador shall go visit <hi>Chamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cublay</hi> the great <hi>Cham,</hi> wheresoever he be. He shall not wonder at that faire Palace of Marble, Porphiry, and Jasper which hath half a league in every corner; He shall esteem it, but not in such a maner but that his <hi>Eminence</hi> hath Houses which approch in some kind those of <hi>Cambalu:</hi> Above all things the Duke of <hi>Sabin</hi> shall take heed that he pull off his hat very low before the great <hi>Cham;</hi> he must remember that <hi>Dracula</hi> caus'd three Turbans to be nail'd to the Turks Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours heads, which drive their Embassie out of their braines. He shall tell the gran <hi>Cham</hi> that the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> is desirous to keep good quarter and correspondence with him, and so shall present unto him his Credentiall Letters; and that 'tis fitting his great <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian</hi> greatnes should do some gallant thing, the Field being now open for him in regard of the Cowardise of the <hi>Transylvanian,</hi> and the affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> with the <hi>Swed,</hi> and of the troubles 'twixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and some of his Vassals, in so much that 'tis easie to invade the estates of these three Princes, as also to restrain the Turk whom we have a long time engag'd in armes against the Christians. If the gran <hi>Cham,</hi> who is a Christian though of the Greek Church, doth imagin that by this last article we are enemies to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sabin</hi> must endevour to perswade him, that Religion is but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publiques servant, and 'twill be expedient to translate for him a book entituled the <hi>Catholic of State</hi> compos'd by Monsieur <hi>Ferrier,</hi> if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it not, then the Ambassadour shall labour to gain by promise of vast sums the Governors of the twelve Provinces who are the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Counsellors, and represent unto them that they are within a Countrey too subject to thunder, snows, and sudden changes, in so much that oft times one shall feel the foure seasons of the yeer in one only day, whereas in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Austria</hi> there is for the most part a pleasant temperature, and that excellent Wines grow there.</p>
            <p>In regard that the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> hath a curious spirit, and that he desires all the rarities of the world to embellish his House, Gardens and courts, the Ambassador shall procure from some Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in <hi>Tartary</hi> the Plant <hi>Boraneth,</hi> which is like a sheep, and eates round about him all the hearbs and grasse, so that there may be no need of a Gardner to make clean the circle of his Courts; And that would serve for an excellent Emblem, to shew what his <hi>Eminence</hi> hath done to all his neighbours in <hi>Richelieu, Paris</hi> and other places: He is also desirous to find out all the strange Birds and animals that
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98453:93"/>
can be had, being resolv'd to make a faire lower court in the Horse Market, which he hath clos'd within <hi>Paris,</hi> together with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs of Saint <hi>Honoré,</hi> which hath cost the public at least a million of gold: The Ambassador shall also cause a good number of those Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian Hens to be bought, which in lieu of feathers are cover'd with black skins, and lay certain egges which are purgatif, whereof his <hi>Eminence</hi> hath much need to mitigate his heat, and clense the ordures of his blood.</p>
            <p>When the Lord Ambassadour shall have taken order for all these rarities, he shall embarque himself for <hi>Cambalu,</hi> to go for <hi>China,</hi> he shall stay a while to observe the stupendous wall that is twixt Her and <hi>Tartary;</hi> he shall take all the dimensions of the wall very exactly, and send a survey thereof to his <hi>Eminence;</hi> that, if need be, he may raise such another in his Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia;</hi> and that, having already in his hands all the Ports and Havens of France, he may also erect such a wall from <hi>Calais</hi> to <hi>Bayon,</hi> and because he may want no workmen, he hath a purpose to employ all those that shall be found to speak ill of him to finish the work.</p>
            <p>Then the Lord Ambassadour shall embark himself upon the great Chanel that goes to <hi>Peguin,</hi> the chief City of <hi>China,</hi> and so shall send notice of his arrivall to the Emperour: In his audience he shall entitle him, <hi>Son to Apollo, a Lion crown'd in the throne of the world, and King of thirty two Realmes:</hi> He shall say that of that people whom they call <hi>Caffres,</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> attempting to ravish him of these faire Titles, and having the <hi>Lion</hi> in his Scutcheon, the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> not enduring that this wrong should be done his Majesty, sends to offer him his power, and to propose him a way how to be reveng'd upon the <hi>Caffres</hi> in the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> specially to take from them their Mines of gold and sylver.</p>
            <p>Having visited all the Kings of the East, my Lord Ambassadour shall return by the road which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great took to enter into the <hi>Indies:</hi> And in regard the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> is very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in moveables and other exquisit things for the adornment of his Houses, my Lord Ambassadour shall procure what may be possibly had for that service; He must try whether in the ancient Town of <hi>Tazila,</hi> there be left any old peeces of <hi>Porus</hi> made by <hi>Zeuxis, Apelles, Polignot,</hi> or <hi>Euphranor:</hi> He shall endevour also to bring some of those savage Asses that are neer the River <hi>Hyphasis,</hi> which have a horn in the forehead, that his <hi>Eminence</hi> may make his entry upon one of them into his Kingdom of <hi>Austrasia,</hi> and then put her to breed in his stables at <hi>Mirebalais;</hi> He shall also endevour to enchant by Scarlet colour, and letters of gold certain Dragons, which are in that Countrey, and to that effect he shall cary that robe of red Sattin embroder'd with gold, which the Cardinal of <hi>Lion</hi> wore, then, <hi>when he beleeved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be God the Father.</hi> If we had a dozen of those Dragons we might draw a great advantage for the security of his <hi>Eminencies</hi> Person, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they say that in their heads there be certain stones found like
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98453:94"/>
that which made <hi>Gyges</hi> invisible. The Lord Ambassadour shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himself also at <hi>Paruca,</hi> if the Inhabitants do yet understand the Language of Beasts, which would be advantagious to his <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> because he daily hears multitudes whom he hath transform'd to simple animals.</p>
            <p>My Lord Ambassadour shall be carefull to informe himself of the Indian <hi>Brachmans,</hi> and know whether they are such great Magicians as they are reported to be; If they are so, he shall confer with them, and learn of them, which way to turn those strong places his <hi>Eminence</hi> holds into inchanted Castles, if he be constrain'd to retire to any of them; To this purpose he shall learn what were the enchantments of those Philosophers who overcame the <hi>Egipeans</hi> when they assaulted them, and made them leave behind them up and down the Rocks the pourtrait of their ill-favour'd faces, ugly beards, and double nayles.</p>
            <p>If the Lord Ambassadour finds that he cannot do our busines with these kind of Philosophers because they are too austere &amp; peaceful, he shall find out another Sect call'd the <hi>Oxidraques,</hi> who are Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers which use to discompose the humours of men, and make them rush out every where into war, such are most fit for our purpose; If my Lord Ambassadour cannot dive into their mysteries, he must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boush one of them, and promise to make him compagnon of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Father <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who is already vers'd in some of the Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes of this goodly Society, and useth to sow war every moneth, that he may gather something all the yeer long.</p>
            <p>He must also make an exact research for the curious books of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagenes,</hi> wherein he teacheth how to compound a beuverage whereby to make a judiciary Astrologer, and take the Circle of the seven Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which knowledge would be very usefull for the <hi>most eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong mortals</hi> to foresee what will become of him, and to be able the better to prevent his enemies; for the Europaean Astrologers have cousen'd him in divers praedictions, specially in that of the ruine of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> and in the translation of the Empire; They had also assur'd him that in such a yeer he should be Pope, and in such a yeer King of <hi>Austrasia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Ambassadour shall try to get the Beast <hi>Marticora</hi> which is of a red colour, and hath the head of a man lancing out sharpe pric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles from behind: The <hi>spirit which moves the stars</hi> shall take this for his Crest.</p>
            <p>The Lord Ambassadour shall not faile to enquire if it be possible to recover the pourtrait of the Great <hi>Talamoque,</hi> or that huge Galeasse, which the Egiptiens sent two thousand yeers since to the Indian Seas, because the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> would build the like, having already cut down a good part of the Forests of Britany, to make such an Engine that may be able to crush the English Ships, by being higher deck'd then the tops of their Masts; It shall be call'd the Great <hi>Armand,</hi> which shall be able to swallow all the Bottomes on the Ocean: whereon the Picture of the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> shall
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:98453:94"/>
be put, who cannot live but amongst waves, amongst troubles and tossings and tumblings, besides he fears nothing more then the <hi>earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then shall the Lord Ambassadour passe by the <hi>Persian</hi> Gulph, and then to the red Sea, and so through the Deserts of <hi>Lybia,</hi> he shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Egypt, and so advance to Ethiopia to see <hi>Prester Iohn;</hi> He shall endevour to perswade him that he being of the Race of the Q. of <hi>Sheba,</hi> he ought to have a curiosity to come to hear the wisdom of the <hi>most eminent among mortals,</hi> who knows more then <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If my Lord Ambassadour passe by <hi>Fez</hi> and <hi>Morocco,</hi> he shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to incite them also against the Spaniard.</p>
            <p>When his <hi>Excellence</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sabin,</hi> Ambassadour extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> to all the Great Monarques of the World, shall be return'd to Christendom, he shall advertise all Princes as he passeth along, that his <hi>Eminence</hi> is resolv'd there shall be no Peace in <hi>Europe,</hi> specially 'twixt <hi>France</hi> and the House of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi> (howsoever that there may be a way given for Treaties to amuse the world) untill both parties become equall in power, therefore as he shall passe through Italy, the foresaid Lord Ambassadour shall procure one of those Scales wherein <hi>Cosmo de Medici</hi> balanc'd all the Princes of the Western World, for the <hi>most eminent among mortals</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to do the like most exactly, and weigh every <hi>State</hi> to the least grain, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This was</hi> the substance of the rambling Instructions that were given the <hi>Chymericall</hi> Ambassadour, which kept more noise in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom then any thing that ever was written of him; Another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares him to <hi>Hercules,</hi> and the Q. Mother to <hi>Iuno,</hi> whose animosity put <hi>Hercules</hi> to quell Monsters, and perform his twelve labours, which were held impossibilities in others; At Sea <hi>Hercules</hi> himself did not so many feats as he, for being High <hi>Admiral,</hi> his Galeon the great <hi>Armand</hi> broak often through his <hi>pillers;</hi> He rays'd every day new tempests, wherein <hi>Dolphin</hi>-like he lov'd to tumble and sport, and by this restles humour of motion, he drive his Master into a vast O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of trouble and danger, his sayles having no other wind to fill them but ambition, and ayrie hopes of honor; And while he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd thus to have his great Masters name and his own, to fill future <hi>story,</hi> some doubt, whether they were not expung'd out of the <hi>Book of life;</hi> in regard they pass'd to their last Port through a <hi>Red</hi> Sea, the one a <hi>young</hi> man upon the matter (being but 42.) the other <hi>not old,</hi> (being but 57.) and the reason may be drawn out of the Sacred Text, <hi>That the bloud-thirsty man shall not see half his dayes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Sanguinary humor in him, was sutable to the colour of his <hi>habit;</hi> which more incited, and praecipitated the French and others his Confederats to Armes; as we read it to be the custom of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, to present Scarlet colours, and other bloody red objects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98453:95"/>
their Elephants, to make them more furious when they are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the wars: This made him turn the very dust to soldiers as he pass'd, and make swarms follow him, as well for the <hi>colour</hi> of his coat, as also for that <hi>holines</hi> which some held to be inhaerent in it. I will conclude all kind of Satyrs of him with these Latin ones, which may be <hi>instar omnium,</hi> for they give a shrewd Character both of his nature, his actions, and of his whole life; and tis in forme of an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph, and penn'd by one of the prime wits under that Clime.</p>

and Commanders who mislik'd him, spent their own and others bloud, while he joyn'd his with the Kings: In the same Counsell <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>janus</hi> fell, had he also fallen, had he not tane away the Royall Prince <hi>Soissons:</hi> The prints of so destructive a power, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, but France principally will scarce deface in a whole Age: He took pleasure in his own Countrey mens and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours miseries, that he might pluck the hairs of the one, and teare the entrailes of the other: Neither was he tender of the Sacred health of his King, which he shook while he exhausted his own by cares, and various anxieties of mind: The Divine vengeance first corrupted his arm which he had lifted up against heaven, then he lost the use of his right hand, which had subscrib'd so many bloudy warrants, the one putrified in eight moneths, the other dried away: And, which is a fearefull thing, he who thus felt the revengefull hand of God, did scarce acknowledge him, which may be inferr'd out of this, because he exercis'd his fury more eagerly upon his privat enemies: And that upon the point of death by Politicall prudence rather then Christian piety he recommended his own to the King, more then himself to God: besides a few dayes before the catastrophe of his tragic life, he would have a Play acted of his, call'd <hi>Europa Triumphans</hi> in Royall magnificence though he himself could not be at it: Moreover he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the Church being a Cardinal, he shed bloud being a Priest, he never forgat injuries being a Christian, he scarce thought himself mortall being a man, although those foule wormes which issued out of his ulcers might have warn'd him to what a fraile and faetid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption he was subject unto: Having by all, even impious means run to his own privat ends for eighteen yeers, at last he came to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon end of mankind by a gentle death in shew, and slower far then was wish'd: He expir'd at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was born, being 57. yeers and odd moneths old: Now leaving France, and his own House, he seem'd to have a will to set both on fire, the one by extorting a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration against the Kings brother, the other, by making his last Will at the will of a woman: Never did plentifull France bestow upon any one so much, nor, being somewhat impatient by nature, did she endure any one longer; neither, being a lover of peace, did she ever cary any one to his grave more joyfully: Discreet Passenger this I openly avouch, which thou haply doest privatly suspect. If thou meetst with any yet doubting, entreat him, that he give no cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to flatterers either corrupted or deceived, but to me deriving truth from its true source: But I would have all mortals beleeve, that with God the least dram of Justice prevailes more then an Ocean of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, nor is true Fame esteem'd by the extent but by the goodnesse. That to embroyle many things, is not to do much; 'tis more, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose troubles, and more then that, to prevent they may not happen: The Vulgar give the names of vertues, to lucky villanies, but be thou of another mind, and think nothing more unhappy, then fortunat mischiefs: <hi>Richelieu</hi> the egregious Artist of fraud, deceiv'd many for a
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:98453:97"/>
time, but himself haply for ever: Alas, what he hath shatter'd, can never be put again in order, who thought that Peace which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his nature, was not convenient for his fortunes, hence issued all those mischiefs which have afflicted the Christian world so many yeers: pray, that God avenge not himself on the author, who wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mercy in so many great crimes: O Christian stranger do thou se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously consider, what a nothing 'tis, what passeth away in a moment; none of those whom thou beholdest purpled all over, are happy in that, no more then those that a stage assignes a Scepter or stately Robes unto, with the spectators they likewise go out, are unbuskin'd, and return to their old stature: <hi>Seneca.</hi> Behold what a few ashes he makes, who was so huge a fire, he is become now a black smoak, who lately like a coruscant lampe dazled all eyes: God grant he be not a firebrand to himself in the other world, who was such a one to poore <hi>Europe,</hi> which hath hopes of Peace, now, that the tinder is spent: I could with thee, O passenger, wish peace to so great an enemy of peace, even to his own, while he lived, if I feared not that thou would'st do him an ill office, to wish him that which he most dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted: yet pray, because thou art commanded to love thine enemies, if peace go not to him, it will return to thee: So Christ commands, in whom live peacefully, that thou may'st rest in him eternally: In the interim farewell.</p>

            <p>Thus was this great man the subject of every mans censure, a thing incident and inevitable to all Favorits, and Minions of Princes, <hi>who like wooden popagayes fastned upon high poles, are marks for every one to shoot at;</hi> they are expos'd to unsavory, as well as to sweet breaths, to rough blasts, as to gentle brizes: But our Cardinal had taken such deep rooting in his Masters heart, that for many yeers no crosse winds, though never so impetuous and violent, were able to shake him: Add hereunto that he strongly fortified himself by alliances, and had in his hands the tenablest places of <hi>France,</hi> by Sea and Land; So that he seem'd to be like a tree planted upon the Mount <hi>Olympus,</hi> transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all meteorologicall impressions, and those frog-vapors, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ayres which use to hover in the <hi>lower</hi> Regions, and if there hung any, his Masters countenance, like the Orient Sun, would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently dispell them.</p>
            <p>Considering, as the world knows, a directing minister of <hi>State</hi> was requisit in France, certainly the King could not light upon a more ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous instrument, for he was cut out for a States-man, his brain was alwayes at work, and his thoughts still grinding something; his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were <hi>oracles,</hi> and his desseins <hi>mysteries,</hi> till put in execution, and then they turn'd to <hi>exploits</hi> most commonly: He was not only <hi>wise</hi> but <hi>politic;</hi> Now, <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>policy</hi> (as it is taken in these times) though they both agree in their <hi>ends,</hi> yet they differ in the <hi>means</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to attain their <hi>ends;</hi> the first goes the plain direct high road, the other useth now and then some odd by-paths: Never any brought the principles of policy, which are generall and confus'd, to a greater certainty; they are easily prescrib'd, but practis'd with more difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie then those of any other Art; The <hi>Navigator</hi> directed by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe is sure to come at such a height, and arrive to such a Port: the <hi>Mathematician</hi> can exemplifie, and really demonstrate the truth of any of his principles; The <hi>Architect</hi> by his Model and instruments can
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:98453:98"/>
exactly (having materials accordingly) raise such an edifice; The <hi>Musician</hi> scruing up his strings to such a height, is sure to hit upon such a tune; The <hi>Physitian</hi> knowing the vertue and operation of his drugs, is sure they will restringe or purge, open or obstruct; It is not so with the <hi>Polititian,</hi> who though he adapt and apply his principles never so dextrously, yet he cannot assure himselfe of the effects: which must be imputed to the world of contingencies, obstacles, and inexpected accidents which use to attend the negotiations of men, specially mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, and War: yet this great Minister brought them to as much certitude as could be; In so much, that before the breach with <hi>Spain,</hi> he was us'd to say, that <hi>the Almightie and irresistible hand of heaven was only able to ranverse his desseins, not any humane power;</hi> And it prov'd true, for the <hi>Austrian</hi> tree (which was the ayme of all his policies) was never so shaken: nor France never so secur'd; so that take the Theoric, and Practic part of policy together, <hi>Olivares &amp; Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enstern</hi> his contemporaries, yea <hi>Machiavil</hi> himself (taking him in the best sense) had he bin living, might have bin his apprentices. And it was the more easie for him to bring such things to passe, in regard that he had the power of disposing all things entire and so concentred in himself, that he met with no opposition, with no crosse counsels or contestation; for the King had resign'd not only his power, but his judgement, and all the faculties of his soul unto him alone, nor would he listen to any advis'd him otherwise; which was no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the cariage of things, for, though <hi>in the multitude of Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors there be safety,</hi> yet, in the conduct of State affaires (specially Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall) wherein <hi>secrecy</hi> and <hi>speed</hi> are so essentially requisit, that they may be said to be the two poles whereon they move, I say, in the tracing and managery of such actions, where oft-times the <hi>ball must be ta'ne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bound, too great a number</hi> (of Counsellors) <hi>is an encomber,</hi> and makes the dessein subject to discovery, or delay, to be retarded or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd, and so to miscarry, and misse of the end: yet this solenesse and singlenesse of counsell may be thus qualified; <hi>Quod fieri debeat, cum multis tracta; quod facturus es, cum paucissimis.</hi> But whereas many cast in his dish, that being a Cardinal, and a <hi>Bishop</hi> Cardinal too, he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be a Captain generall, it may be answer'd that 'tis no new thing in the Roman Church, no not in <hi>France</hi> it self, where divers examples may be produc'd: <hi>Arnaud de Pelegrue, Clement</hi> the fifts kinsman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cardinal, was General of an Army in the yeer 1330. <hi>Andoin de la Roche</hi> Abbot of <hi>Cluny</hi> and Cardinal was the like 1360. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Alby,</hi> otherwise call'd the Cardinal of <hi>Arras</hi> commanded in Chief the Army of <hi>Lewis</hi> the xj. Nor can <hi>Spain</hi> reproach him of this for Cardinal <hi>Albornost, Kimenes,</hi> and <hi>Carvaial,</hi> all three, were Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals for the Kings of Spain, and <hi>Charles</hi> the fift employed Cardinal <hi>Pompeo Colonna</hi> often in that nature. And t'other day Cardinal <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando</hi> this King of Spains brother, was his <hi>Generalissimo</hi> in the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> having fought <hi>Norlinghen</hi> battell in his way. Nay, not only <hi>Cardinals,</hi> but we read of <hi>Popes</hi> themselves that personally command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

their armies in chief, among others <hi>Iohn</hi> the tenth, <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, <hi>Paschall</hi> the second, <hi>Urban</hi> the second, <hi>Victor</hi> the third, <hi>Lucius</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, <hi>Innocent</hi> the second, and <hi>Iulius</hi> the second.</p>
            <p>But of all Cardinals I have read of, our <hi>present</hi> Cardinal may be most properly compar'd in disposition to <hi>Ximenes</hi> of Spain, and <hi>Wolsey</hi> of England; to the first, for his inclination to war, for Cardinal <hi>Xi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> was us'd to say, <hi>that Gunpowder gave as sweet an odor in the field, as incense at the altar.</hi> To the second, for his magnitude of mind: <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> had for his Motto</p>
            <q>—non haec sine numine Divûm Eveniunt. Richelieu <hi>had</hi>—mens sydera volvit.</q>
            <p>But in magnificence <hi>Wolsey</hi> surpass'd him, 'tis true this late Cardinal had a band of souldiers perpetually attending him, but nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to the other for domestic attendance; when <hi>Wolsey</hi> was mounting his Mule at <hi>White-hall</hi> gate to go sit at the <hi>Chancery,</hi> the first of his train all along would be by that time at <hi>Westminster Hall:</hi> He went to France with 1000. horse Ambassador, and was Arbiter of most of the Debates twixt the Emperour and <hi>Francis</hi> the first. <hi>Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licu</hi> gave his King, his <hi>Cardinal-Palace</hi> for a gift; <hi>Wolsey, Hampton Court</hi> all furnish'd worth foure of the to'ther, a gift as one said, <hi>too great for a Subject to give, and a King to receive. Richelieu</hi> repair'd the <hi>Colledge of Sorbon,</hi> erected a few <hi>Schooles</hi> for reading the Sciences in the vulgar language: built the <hi>Cardinal-Palace</hi> in Paris, and the <hi>Palace of Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu</hi> in the Countrey: <hi>Wolsey</hi> built <hi>Whitehall, Hampton Court,</hi> the huge Colledge at <hi>Ipswich,</hi> and <hi>Christ-church</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the greatest Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that kind in the world; besides a tombe he had intended and three quarterd finish'd for <hi>Henry</hi> the eight his Master at <hi>Winsor,</hi> which, had it been perfected <hi>Europe,</hi> had not had the like, nor would his sonne or any of his two daughters be at the charge of finishing it. And as in magnitude of mind, so in a constancy and fastnesse to himself he sympathiz'd with English <hi>Wolsey,</hi> (who amongst other properties was specially observed for that;) For when his affections fixed upon any thing, he would employ the whole man to compasse it; his mind was like a stone hurl'd into the water which never rest's till it comes to the bottome: So when he desir'd any thing he would leave no stone un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stirr'd, (as they say) no wayes untry'd, but he would attain it: A Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of qualitie told me a passage of him, that a Marchant of Paris brought him a jewell of high price to shew and sell, he was so taken with it, that he offerd 50000. crownes for it, the Marchant demanded 15000. more and would not go a peny lesse: A few dayes after the Marchant carrying the jewell to a great Lady to see, was suddenly in some place of advantage surpriz'd, muffled and so unjewell'd: A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle after the Marchant going to the Cardinals Secretary upon some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther businesse, the Cardinall hearing of his being there, sent for him, and making grievous mone for his jewell, the Cardinal fetch'd out of his Cabinet a box, and drew thence a jewell, and ask'd whether that was his; the Marchant in a kind of amazement answer'd, I dare not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:98453:99"/>
say 'tis mine, because 'tis in your Eminencies hands, but were in it any other hand I would sweare it were mine: Go, saith he, and keep a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conscience in your dealings hereafter, for I know what this jewell is worth as well as you, and out of that I have offerd you already, you may draw very faire gaines; so he gave order his 50000. crownes should be payd him, and the busines was hush'd up. We draw now to an end, and to bring our Cardinal with a sweet odour to his grave, and take away something of the ill favour of those Epitaphs that went before, we will adde this upon him in Sorbon.</p>

            <p>This Epitaph gives a full compensation for the tartnes of the two former, which were inserted expresly thereby to enfranchise the judgement of the Reader, to discover the impartiality of the story, and make truth more perspicuous, for it is a good rule in Logic, that <hi>Contraria juxta se posita magis elucescunt,</hi> the confrontation of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries makes things appear more clearly; I know there is a saying in French, that <hi>vent coulis,</hi> a cranny wind is more hurtfull then an open; such are reproaches 'twixt prayses; But let not the Authour of this story be mistaken that he intended to derogat (but only for the ends above mentioned) from the merit of so brave a man whom his very
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:98453:101"/>
enemies admir'd for his fagacity, and cloquence, for his admirable forecast and penetrating judgement, for the vivacity of his spirit, and quicknes of apprehension, for his affiduity and indefatigable vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, for his excellent addresse, and sinewy expressions, and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous way of dispatch, for his rare policy and prudentiall parts, and lastly for the stupendous succes of his counsels; These atributes, as it is no <hi>flattery</hi> to give him, so it were <hi>injury</hi> to deny him; By these he made France formidable to the world, he made his Master Arbiter of his own interests, an Avenger of all affronts, and supporter of his Confederats; by these he got him three <hi>keyes</hi> of invaluable advantage, <hi>Brisack, Pignerol,</hi> and <hi>Perpignan,</hi> the first to enter <hi>Germany,</hi> the second <hi>Italy,</hi> the third <hi>Spain</hi> at pleasure; By these he made him the most absolute and independent Monark that ever raign'd in that Kingdom, and freed him from all fears to receive the law from his subjects ever hereafter.</p>
            <p>But by ascribing so much to the <hi>Minister,</hi> let us not derogat from the <hi>Master,</hi> who was as active in his way, and concurr'd to achieve all these things; We have an axiom in Philosophy, that <hi>Sol et Homo generant Hominem;</hi> The Sun and man beget man; the one by his Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall influx, being the <hi>fountain of heat,</hi> the other by <hi>Naturall organs;</hi> So we may say the King and Cardinal produc'd all these actions, the one by the influence of his high power and Regall authoritie, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his instrumentall activity.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal <hi>de Richelieu's</hi> Armes were three <hi>Chevrons</hi> in a field argent, 2 <hi>plain</hi> and simple coat, therefore the more <hi>ancient;</hi> which Armes, with his Purple <hi>Hat</hi> (which supported that great <hi>Crown,</hi> and made the <hi>Lillies</hi> flourish and swell so many yeers) we will lay upon his Tomb, with this Distic for a finall farewell.</p>
