         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas We are given to underſtand, that many falſe Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
and ſcandalous Letters, are ſpred up and down
amongſt the Reformed Churches in forraign parts, by the
<hi>politique,</hi> or rather the <hi>pernicious</hi> induſtry of ſome ill-affected
perſons, that We have an inclination to receed
from that Orthodox Religion which We were born,
baptized, and bred in, and which We have firmly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
and profeſſed and practiſed throughout the whole courſe of Our
Life, to this moment, and that We intend to give way to the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and publike exerciſe of Popery again in Our Dominions: Which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture,
or rather moſt deteſtable calumny, being grounded upon no ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
foundation, hath raiſed theſe horrible Tumults, and more then
barbarous Wars throughout this flouriſhing Iſland, under pretext of a
kinde of Reformation, which would not onely prove incongruous, but
incompatible with the Fundamentall Laws, and Government of this
Kingdom; We deſire that the whole Chriſtian World ſhould take notice,
and reſt aſſured, that We never entertained in Our imagination, the leaſt
thought to attempt ſuch a thing, or to depart a jot from that holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which when We received the Crown and Scepter of this Kingdom,
We took a moſt ſolemn Sacramentall Oath, to profeſſe and protect. Nor

Our Armies, and the publike atteſtation of our Barons, with the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection

Alliance of Marriage, We contracted betwixt Our eldeſt Daughter, and

Our intentions herein; by which Nuptiall engagement, it appears further,

Proteſtant Authors, as well Germanes, as French; as well Danes, as
Swedes and Switzers; as well Belgians as Bohemians, do with many
elogies (and not without a kinde of Envy) approve and applaud in their
publike writings, particularly in the tranſactions of the Synod of Dort,
wherein beſides others of Our Divines (who afterwards were Prelates)
one of Our Biſhops aſſiſted, to whoſe dignitie all due reſpects and prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

to Our utmoſt power, and laſt period of Our life, to keep entire

the tenour of the aforeſaid moſt ſacred Oath at Our Coronation, that all
Our Eccleſiaſticks in their ſeverall degrees and incumbences, ſhall Preach

            <p>The Contriver of this Declaration, whether it was <hi>Digby</hi> or who ever

and there upon came theſe Warrs to be raiſed. But if His Maieſtie

they will iuſtifie for us that it is the Hierarchie, &amp; the Hierarchicall

                     <hi>Alexander Henderſon</hi> (a Brother ſo justly approved by you, and honoured by

You w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re then pleaſed to give us fair grounds to expect that Brotherly advice
and endeavours, which the common cauſe of Chriſt, and the mutuall intereſt
of the united Nations, command us now again to ask, if not to chalenge. We
doubt not but your experience, together with your intelligence, abundantly
informs you of our condition, what various administrations of providence we
have paſſed thorow, and we ſtill lie betwixt hopes and fears, a fit temper for
working, the God of all grace inable us to improve it. As our hopes are not
ſuch as may make us ſecure; ſo neither do our fears prevail to the caſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of our confidence. Your own late condition, together with this Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our preſent, may acquaint you with the certain, though ſubtle Authors
and Fomenters of theſe our confuſed conflicts, which we conceive to be the
Hierarchicall faction, who have no way to peace and ſafety, but through the
trouble of others. Our prayers and endeavours according to our meaſure have
been, and ſhall be for the ſupplanting and rooting up whatſoever we finde ſo
prejudiciall to the eſtabliſhment of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the peace of
our Soveraign. And that this Declaration of our ſelves may not leave you
unſatisfied, we think it requiſite further to expreſſe, That the deſire of the
moſt godly and conſiderable part amongſt us, is, That the Presbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
which hath juſt and evident foundation, both in the Word of God,
and religious reaſon, may be eſtabliſhed amongſt us, and that (according to
your intimation) we may agree in one confeſſion of Faith, one directory for
worſhip, one publique Catechiſme and form of Government, which things,
if they were accompliſhed, we ſhould much rejoyce in our happy ſubjection to
Chriſt our Head, and deſired aſſociation with you our beloved Brethren:
For the better effecting whereof, we thought it neceſſary, not onely to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with what our deſires are in themſelves, but alſo to You, that is,
That what ſhall ſeem moſt fit to the wiſdom of that grave and Religious Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
may be taken for the furtherance of our endeavours in this kinde.
We underſtand that our Parliament hath been before-hand with us in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation,
and it cannot be but our duty, who are ſo much concerned in the
buſineſſe, to adde what power the Lord hath given, with you, to the ſame
purpoſe. This deſign and deſire of ours hath evenneſſe on the left hand, and
diſſenting Brethren on the right; but we doubt not that as our hearts juſtifie
us that our intentions are right, and ſuch as we conceive tend moſt directly to
the glory of God, and peace of the Churches of the Saints: So (by your

            <p>In the next place, the contriver of this Declaration goes about to make
the world beleeve, that our fear of the bringing in of Popery, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon no imaginable Foundation. But the truth of it is, we had great
cauſe to fear it; For there were Cardinals appointed in <hi>Rome</hi> to come
over, and Vicker-generals, Archdeacons, Deans, Prieſts and Fryers, not
onely choſen, but planted in all places throughout the Kingdom of
<hi>England,</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and all of them had approbation
from <hi>Rome,</hi> before they could be received by Authority of the Romiſh
Church in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, for more fuller ſatisfaction, That all the World may
know how His Majeſty hath been miſled by a pernicious and wicked crue
of Papiſts, Prieſts and Fryers; and how neer this Kingdom was brought
to be ſubjected to Popiſh Religion. Here followeth a Catalogue of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites,

            <p>A Meſſage not much unlike this Declaration, was ſent from the King
to the Parliament, in <hi>September,</hi> 1642. At which time, the Lords and
Commons ſent this Petition following to His Majeſtie.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">
               <body>
                  <opener>May it pleaſe Your Majeſtie;</opener>
                  <p>WE the Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled, do
preſent this our houble Anſwer to your Majeſties Meſſage
of the eleventh of this inſtant Moneth of September. When
we conſider the oppreſſion rapine, firing of houſes, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
(even at this time whileſt Your Maieſtie propounds a Treatie) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon Your good Subjects by your Souldiers in the preſence, and
<pb facs="tcp:50811:4"/>
by the authority of their Commanders, being of the number of thoſe
whom Your Majeſtie holds your ſelf bound in honour and conſcience to
protect, as perſons doing their duties, We cannot thinke your Majeſtie
hath done all that in you lies, to prevent or remove the preſent diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor ſo long as your Majeſtie will admit no peace, without ſecuring
the afithors and inſtruments of theſe miſchiefs from the juſtice of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which yet ſhall be ever diſpenſed, with all requiſite moderation, and
diſtinction of offences, although ſome of thoſe perſons be ſuch, in whoſe
preſervation your Kingdom cannot be ſafe, nor the unqueſtionable Rights
and Priviledges of Parliament be maintained: without which, the power
and dignitie thereof will fall into contempt: We beſeech Your Majeſty
therefore to conſider your expreſſions, That God ſhall deal with you
and your poſterity as your Majeſtie deſires the preſervation of the juſt
rights of Parliament, which being undeniable in the trying of ſuch as we
have declared to be Delinquents, we ſhall beleeve your Maieſtie, both
towards your ſelf and Parliament, will not in this priviledge we are moſt
ſenſible of, denyus that which belongs unto the meaneſt Court of Iuſtice
in this Kingdom: neither hath Your Majeſtie cauſe to complaine that
you are denyed a Treaty, when we offer all that a Treaty can produce,
or Your Majeſtie expect, Security, Honour, Service, Obedience, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and all other effects of an humble, loyall, and faithfull ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
and ſeek nothing but that our Religion, Libertie, Peace of
the Kigdome, ſafety of the Parliament, may be ſecured from the open
violence and cunning practiſes of a wicked partee, who have long ploted
our ruine and deſtruction: And if there were any cauſe of Treatie, we
know no competent perſons to Treate between the King and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
And if both cauſe and perſons were ſuch as to invite a Trteay, the
ſeaſon is altogether unfit, while Your Majeſties Standard is up, and your
Proclamations and Declarations unrecalled, whereby your Parliament is
charged with Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>If Your Majeſtie ſhall perſiſt to make your ſelfe a ſhield and defence to
thoſe inſtruments, and ſhall continue to reject our faithfull and neceſſary
advice for ſecuring and maintaining Religion, and Liberty with peace of
the Kingdome, and ſafety of the Parliament, we doubt not but to indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
judgements, it will eaſily appear who is moſt tender of that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
blood which is like to be ſpilt in this cauſe; Your Majeſtie who by
ſuch perſiſting doth endenger Your ſelfe and your Kingdomes, or we who
are willing to hazard our ſelves to preſerve both.</p>
                  <p>We humbly beſeech Your Majeſtie to conſider how impoſſible it is,
That any Proteſtation, though publiſhed in your Majeſties Name, of your
tenderneſſe of the miſeries of your Proteſtant Subjects in <hi>Ireland,</hi> of your
reſolution to maintain the Proteſtant Religion, and Lawes of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
can give ſatisfaction to reaſonable and indifferent men, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb facs="tcp:50811:5"/>
 time divers of the Iriſh Traitors and Rebells, the known favourers
of them and the Agents for them, are admitted to Your Majeſties preſence
with grace and favour, and ſome of them imployed in your ſervice; when
the Cloaths, Munition, Horſes, and other neceſſaries bought by your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and ſent for the ſupply of the Army againſt the Rebells there, are
violently taken away, ſome by Your Majeſties command, others by your
Miniſters, and applyed to the maintenance of an unnaturall War againſt
your people here.</p>
                  <p>All this notwithſtanding, as we never gave Your Majeſtie any iuſt
cauſe of withdrawing Your ſelf from Your great Counſell, ſo it hath ever
been, and ſhall ever be far from us to give any impediment to Your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
or to neglect any proper meanes of curing the diſtempers of the
Kingdome, and cloſing the dangerous breaches betweene Your Majeſtie
and Your Parliament, according to the great Truſt which lyeth upon us.
And if Your Majeſtie ſhall now be pleaſed to come backe to Your Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without Your forces, we ſhall be ready to ſecure Your Royall Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
Your Crown and Dignitie, with our lives and Fortunes; Your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
in this Your great Counſell being the onely meanes of any Treaty
betwixt Your Majeſtie and them, with hope of ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>And in none of our deſires to Your Majeſtie ſhall we be ſwayed by any
particular mans advantage, but ſhall give a cleer Teſtimonie to Your
Maiſtie and the whole world, That in all thing done by us, we faithfully
intend the good of Your Majſtie <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

not be diverted from this end by any private or ſelfe-reſpect whatſoever.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>One thing more is much to be taken notice of, which reliſheth rather
of <hi>Digbies</hi> ſpirit, then of His Majeſties Penning, which is this; The
Declaration which is publiſhed in Engliſh, ſaith thus, <hi>This moſt holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
with the Hierarchy and Liturgie thereof, we ſolemnly proteſt, &amp;c.</hi>
But in the Latin (<hi>with the Plierarchy and Liturgie</hi>) is left out: ſo that
indeed it ſpeaks one thing to us, and another thing to forraign Nations:
And whereas thoſe of His Maieſties ſubiects are deſired to uphold this
Proteſtation when opportunity and time ſhall be offered. I could wiſh
that His Maieſtie would be pleaſed to remember thoſe many Covenants,
by which He is bound to return to His Parliament, and ſeek the peace and
ſafety of His people, and not by protecting a few Popiſh, Prelaticall,
Jeſuiticall, Incendiaries, and Delinquents; bring Himſelf, His Poſterity,
and Kingdom to ruine. God Almighty be pleaſed to put it into the Kings
heart, to conſider the bleeding condition of His poor people, and cauſe
Him to return to comply with His Parliament, to the ſtopping of this
great effuſion of blood, and the ſetling of the Church, and Kingdom in
peace aud tranquilitie; which God grant.</p>
