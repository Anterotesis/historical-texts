            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THe wondrous Happineſs, that <hi>England</hi> once reap'd, from the Uniting of the <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>White Roſe,</hi> in the Marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, to the eſtabliſhing the Peace of the Kingdom, by Reconciling the Bloody Wars between the Houſe of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> are Bleſſings infinitely inferiour to the larger Portion of National Happineſs we are deſtind to enjoy, in the Illuſtrious <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Princeſs</hi> of <hi>Orange's</hi> Acceſſion to the the Imperial Crown of <hi>England.</hi> For in the <hi>Former</hi> Union, the Fewds of two Corrival Families were only appeaſed; but in the <hi>Preſent</hi> more Glorious Union, we have that Great work, which Ages have been labouring for, Compleatly finiſht and perfected. <hi>viz.</hi> In that unſhaken and laſting Foundation of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Liberty</hi> (the neareſt and deareſt concern of mankind,) ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid, that the power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Gates of Hell it ſelf, ſhall never prevaile againſt them.</hi> And more and above the ſecurity, Peace, and Happineſs of the People ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely conſumated, we have likewiſe the Glory of the Nation exalted above all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Grandure of preceding Ages; that is in the unity of all Hearts, to ſtrengthen the Royal Arm; and 2dly, by Rivetting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Intereſt, Our Naval walls, and Maritime Strength, will ſoon render Us the Terrour of the World, and make Us once more the <hi>Arbiters</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> A Title which our long frenchify'd Intereſt, and Alliance before, had ſo meanly and ignobly loſt Us, by giving up the Reins to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiate Ambition of that wild Ravager of the Chriſtian World, and plague of all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, the <hi>French Tyrant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There onely wanted this Bleſſed Day to perpetuate the Security of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion and the Liberties of <hi>England.</hi> And to our no little Satisfaction, and Delight the welcome Tidings of her Arrival is our only remaining Felicity.</p>
            <p>Accordingly the Guns of the <hi>Towre,</hi> and the General Ringing of Bells, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proclaimed Our Univerſal Joys: and the whole Court, the more immediate ſharer of ſo Divine a Bleſſing, is fill'd with the Higheſt Tranſports ſuitable to Her Royal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
