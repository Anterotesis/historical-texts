         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Or shall any be cheated into delusion by a flourish of most ambiguous words of his Majesties resolution to be ever ready to ratify, so soone as it shall please God to put him in his power according to the advise of the supreame Judicatories of this Kingdome, all what has beene done by his royall Father in order to our peace? To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that the League and Covenant and the Union betwixt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and the whole worke of Uniformity, is here cut off at one clap, though yet we trust that these things will be dearer to all the Lords peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Land, then their Estates or lives: The words are so empty and doubtfull, as may suffer any interpretation men list to put upon them, and may consist with the utter undoing of all that has been done in this Land for asserting the purity of Religion, and the liberty of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

               <p>We thinke we need not desire any man to consider what could be the case of Religion, and of all that love is in this Land, if it were in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of that persidious and proud Atheist, to modell the supreame Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories of the Kingdome according to his minde: hee who hath so far forgotten his Covenant and Oath, in which he enterd in so publick and solemn a way, as to call all that is contained therein, and has flowed there from violent and most unjust desires, and the worke of Reformation, from the beginning Rebellion, will not spare the overturning and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying thereof, and the bringing back this poore Nation to the licking up of the vomit of prelacy, the ceremonies and the Service-Book, for making way to a fuller compliance with the Church of Rome: which we have the more cause to feare, for that the free excercise and full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Popish Religion is granted by his Majesty to those bloody Rebells in <hi>Ireland.</hi> To us it is above question, that as the alteration of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the establishing of an arbitrary and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Experience hath proven throughout all the tract of the word of God, that many hath fallen off from day to day, and that new trialls have produced new discoveries of the hollownesse of the hearts of some, concerning whom many did promise to themselves better things; none can be stedfast in the Covenant, but those, whose hearts are right with God: we wish therefore every man to search and try his wayes, and as to repent of all his former provocations, so in the strength of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator Jesus Christ, to study to walk with God, and to order his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation aright; then may we be confident that the Lord shall establish us, and that no Weapon that is formed against us shall prosper, and that every Tongue that riseth against us in Judgement we shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn.</p>
