            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SPEECH MADE BY SIR <hi>EDWARD DEARING</hi> KNIGHT AND Baronet, in the Commons house of Parliament concerning the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Master <hi>Wilson,</hi> upon the tenth day of <hi>Novemer,</hi> 1640.</head>

               <salute>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. SPEAKER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YEsterday the affaires of this House did borrow all the time allotted to the great Committee for Religion. I am sorry that having but halfe a day in a whole weeke, wee have lost that.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> It hath pleased God to put into the heart of his Majestie (for the Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord) once more to assemble us into a Senate, to consult up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44117:3"/>
the unhappy distractions, the sad dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, &amp; the much feared ruines of this last flourishing Church and Kingdome. God be praysed both for his goodnesse, and for his severity wherewith hee hath impelled this meeting; and humble thankes unto his Majestie whose parentall care of us his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, is willing to relieve us.</p>
            <p>The sufferances that wee have undergone are reducible to two heads. The first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Church</hi>: the second belonging to the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> The first of these must have the first fruits of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as being the first in write and worth, and more immediate to the honour of God and his Glory, every dramme where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is worth the whole weight of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
            <p>The Common-wealth (it is true) is full of apparent dangers. The sword is come home unto us, and the two twinne-Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons united together under one royall head, breathren together in the bowells and the bosome of the same Island, and which is above all imbanded together with the same Religion (I say the same Religion) by a devillish machination, like to bee fatally imbread in each others blood, ready to digge each others grave <hi>Quantillum ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44117:3"/>For other grievances also, the poore disheartned subject, sadly groanes, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to distinguish betwixt Power and Law. And with a weeping heart (no question) hath prayed for this hower, in hope to bee relieved, and to know hereafter, whether any thing hee hath, besides his poore part and portion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ayre he breathes, may be truely cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his owne.</p>
            <p>These (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) and many other doe deserve and must shortly have our deepe regard but <hi>Suo gradu,</hi> not in the first place: There is a <hi>unum necessarium</hi> above all our worldly sufferances and dangers. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the immediate service due unto the honour of Almighty God. And herein let us all be confident, that all our consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will prove unprosperous, if wee put any determination before that of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For my part, Let the sword reach from the North to the South, and a generall perdition of all our remaining right and safety, threaten us in open view, it shall bee so farre from making me to decline the first setling of Religion, that I shall ever argue, and rather conclude it thus. The more great, the more iminent our perills of this world are, the stronger and quicker ought
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44117:4"/>
our care to bee, for the Glory of God and the pure Law of our soules.</p>
            <p>If then (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) it may passe with full allowance, that all our cares may give way unto the treaty of Religion, I will reduce that also to bee considered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two heads: first of Ecclesiasticke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, then of Ecclesiasticke causes. Let no man start or bee affrighted at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/> at the immagined length of this consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will not, it cannot take up so much time as it is worth.—This it is God and the King, this is God and the Kingdome, nay, this is God and the two Kingdomes cause.</p>
            <p>And therefore (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motion is, that wee may all of us seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, speedily, and hartily enter upon this, the best, the greatest, the most important cause we can treat of.</p>
            <p>Now (Mr. <hi>Speaker</hi>) in pursuite of my owne motion, and to make a little entrance into this great affayre, I will present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the petition of a poore oppessed Minister in the County of <hi>Kent</hi>: A man Orthodox in his Doctrine, conformable in his life, laborious in the Ministery as any we have, or I doe know.</p>
            <p>He is now a sufferer (as all good men are) under the generall obliquity of a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44117:4"/>
Puritan, as with other things was excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently delivered by that silver trumpet at the Barre. The Pursivant watches his doore, and divides him and his cure asunder, to both their greifes: For it is not with him as (perhaps) with some that set the Pursivant at worke, gladded of an excuse to bee out of their Pulpit, It is his delight to Preach.</p>
            <p>About a weeke since I went over to <hi>Lambeth,</hi> to move that great Bishop (too great indeede) to take this danger off from this Minister, and to recall the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sivant. And withall I did undertake for Master <hi>Wilson</hi> (for so your Petitioner is called) that he should answer in any his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, of the Kings Courts at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bishop made me answer (as neare as I can remember) <hi>in haec verba,</hi> I am sure that hee will not bee absent from his cure a twelvemoneth together, and then (I doubt not) but once in a yeare we shall have him.</p>
            <p>This was all I could obtaine, but I hope, (by the helpe of this house) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this yeare of threates runne round, <hi>His Grace</hi> will either have more <hi>Grace,</hi> or no <hi>Grace</hi> at all. For our manifold griefes doe fill a mighty and a vast Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumferance, yet so that from every part
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44117:5"/>
our lives of sorrow, doe leade unto him, and point at him the Center, from, whence our miseries in this Church, and many of them in the Common wealth doe grow.</p>
            <closer>Let the Petition bee read, and let us enter upon the worke.</closer>

            <head>A SPEECH AT A Grand Committee of the whole house for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>YOu have many private Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, give mee leave (by word of mouth) to interpose one more generall, which thus you may receive. Gods true Religion is violently invaded by two seeming enimies: But indeede they are (like <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi>) fast friends for the destruction of Truth. I meane the Papists for one partie, and our Prelating faction for the other. Betweene these two in their severall progresse, I observe the concurrence of some few Parallells, fit (as I conceive) to be represented to this Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable House.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:44117:6"/>First with the Papists, there is a severe <hi>Inquisition</hi>: and with us (as it is used) there is a bitter high <hi>Commission</hi>; both these (<hi>contra fas &amp; jus</hi>) are judges in their owne cause: yet herein their <hi>Inquisitors</hi> are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then our <hi>High Commissioners</hi>—They (for ought I ever heard) doe not (<hi>saevire in suos</hi>) punish for delinquents and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, such as professe and practice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Religion established by the Lawes of the Land where they live.</p>
            <p>But with us how many poore distressed Ministers? nay how many scores of them, in a few yeares past, have been suspended, degraded, deprived, excommunicated, not guilty of the breach of any our established Lawes. The petitions of many are heere with us, more are comming: All their prayers are in haven for redresse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, with the Papist, there is a Mysterious artifice I meane their <hi>Index ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatorius</hi> whereby they clippe the tongues of such witnesses, whose evidence they doe not like.—To this I parallell our late <hi>Imprimatur's</hi>: Licences for the presse: so handled that the Truth is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, and Popish pamphlets fly abroade <hi>cum privilegio</hi>: witnesse audatious and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling Pamphlets against True Religion; written by <hi>Pocklington, Heyling, Dow, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44117:6"/>
Shelford, Swan, Reeves, Yates, Hausted, Studley, Sparow, Brown, Robertes, Iron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,</hi>—Many more: I name no Bishops, but I adde, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Nay they are already growne so bold in this new trade, that the most learned la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of our ancient and best Divines, must be now corrected and defaced with a <hi>Delea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> by a supercilious pen of my Lords young Chapline; (fit perhaps) for the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chincall arts, but unfit to hold the Chaire for Divinity.</p>
            <p>But herein the <hi>Roman Index</hi> is better then are our <hi>English Licences</hi>: They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by doe preserve the current of their owne established doctrines: a point of wisedome. But with us our <hi>Innovators</hi> by this artifice doe altar our setled Doctrines; Nay they doe subinduce points repugnant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant. And this I dare assume upon my selfe to prove.</p>
            <p>One Paralell more I have, and that is this. Among the Papists, there is one acknowledged supreme Pope, supreme in honour, in order, and in power: from whose judgement there is no appeale.—I confesse (<hi>M. Speaker</hi>) I cannot altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther match a Pope with a Pope: (yet one of the ancient titles of our <hi>English</hi> Primate was <hi>Alterius orbis Papa.</hi>) But
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44117:7"/>
thus farre I can goe, <hi>Ex ore suo.</hi> It is in Print.—Hee pleades faire for a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archtae: And for such an one, whose judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he (before-hand) professeth ought to bee finall: and then (I am sure) it ought to be un-erring.</p>
            <p>Put these together and you shall finde that the finall determination of a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch will want very little of a Pope—and then wee may say—<hi>mutato no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine de te</hi>
               <q>Fabula narratur—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hee pleades Popeship under the name of a Patriarch. And I much feare least the end and toppe of his Patriarchall plea may bee as that of <hi>Cardinall Pole</hi> (his predecessor) who would have two heads, one <hi>Caput Regale,</hi> another <hi>Caput Sacerdotale:</hi> a proud parallell, to set up the Miter as high as the Crowne.</p>
            <p>But herein I shall bee free and cleare, if one there must bee (bee it a Pope, bee it a Patriach;) this I resolve upon for my owne choyce (<hi>Procul a Iove procul a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</hi>) I had rather serve one as farre off as <hi>Tyber,</hi> then to have him come so neare me as the <hi>Thames.</hi> A Pope at <hi>Rome</hi> will doe mee lesse hurt then a Patriarch may doe at <hi>Lambeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:44117:7"/>I have done, and for this third Parallell I submitt it to the wisedome and conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of this grand Committee for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the meane time I doe ground my motion, upon the former two, and it is this in briefe.</p>
            <p>That you would please to select a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committee of a few, and to impower them for the discovery of the numbers of oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Ministers under the Bishops tyranny for these ten yeares last past. We have the complaint of some, but more are silent: some are patient and will not complaine, others are fearefull and dare not, many are beyond Sea and cannot complaine.</p>
            <p>And in the second place, that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committee may examine the Printers what bookes by bad Licences haue beene corruptly issued forth: and what good bookes have beene (like good Minsters) silenced, Clipped or cropped.</p>
            <p>The worke I conceive will not bee diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, but will quickly returne into your hand full of weight.</p>
            <closer>And this is my Motion.</closer>

            <head>A SPEECH AT THE DELIVERY of a Petition out of <hi>Kent,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the present Government of the <hi>Church.</hi>

            <p>YEsterday we did regulate the most important businesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: and gave them motion, so that our great and weighty affaires, are now on their feete in their progresse, journing on towards their severall periods, where some I hope will shortly finde their latest home.</p>
            <p>Yet among all these I observe one, a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry maine one, to sleepe <hi>sine die</hi>: give mee leave to awaken it; It is a businesse of an immense weight, and worth; such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves our best care, and most severe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection. I meane the Grand Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on long since given in by many thousand Citizens against the dominering Clergy.</p>
            <p>Wherein (for my part) although I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approve of all that is presented unto you, yet I doe clearely professe, that a great part of it, nay the greatest part thereof, is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44117:9"/>
so well grounded, that my heart goes cheerefull along therewith.</p>
            <p>It seemes that my Countrey (for which I have the honour to serve) is of the same minde, and least that you should thinke that all faults are included within the walles of <hi>Troy,</hi> they will shew you
<q>Iliacos intra muros peccatur &amp; extra.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The same greivances which the Citty groanes under, are provinciall unto us, and I much feare they are nationall among us all.</p>
            <p>The Pride, the Avarice, the Ambition and oppression, by our ruling Clergy is <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidemicall,</hi> it hath infected them all. There is not any, or scarce any of them, who is not practicall in their owne <hi>great cause in hand,</hi> which they impiously doe mis-call, <hi>the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the times,</hi> but in truth, so wrong a Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that I am bold to say,
<q>In facinus jurasse putes.—</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here in this Petition is the disease repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, here is the cure intreated.</p>
            <p>The number of your Petitioners is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, being above five and twenty hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred names, and would have beene foure times as many, if that were thought mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall.</p>
            <p>The matter in the Petition is of high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port: But your Petitioners themselves are
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44117:9"/>
all of them quiet and silent at their owne houses, humbly expecting and praying the resolution of this great <hi>Senate,</hi> upon these their earnest and thrice hearty desires.</p>
            <p>Here is no noyse, no numbers at your doore: they will bee neither your trouble nor your jealousie; for I doe not know of any one of them this day in the Towne: So much they doe affie in the justice of their Petition, &amp; in the goodnesse of this House.</p>
            <p>If now you want any of them heere, to make avowance of their Petition, I am their servant. I doe appeare for them and for my selfe, and am ready to avow this Petition, in their names, and in my owne.</p>
            <p>Nothing doubting, but fully confident, that I may justly say of the present usage of the Hierarchy in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as once the Pope (Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> as I remember) said of the Clergy in his time: <hi>A vertice capitis</hi> and <hi>plantam pedis, nihil est sanum in toto ordine ecclesiastico.</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>I beseech you reade the Petition, regard us, and relieve us.</closer>
