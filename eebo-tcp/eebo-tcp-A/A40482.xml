            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THOMAS Earl of <hi>VVeſtmorland,</hi> Baron <hi>le Deſpenſer</hi> and <hi>Burgherſh.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is the fate of Honour and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, my Lord, to be lyableto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of troubleſome Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; among which, I am apt to think, a Dedication ſometime to be none of the leaſt; eſpecially when the Author comes with his imaginary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels between the Patron and the Work, and by a far-fetch'd Relation, would plead a neceſſity for his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>There is no danger, my Lord, of my taking that Method, the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Work, and the Merit of
<pb facs="tcp:100310:3"/>
the Perſon I Addreſs it to, will not permit me to think of any ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. And I am ſenſible that if that was always ſtrictly to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, Men would be at a loſs to find out an Offering worthy ſuch a Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, as doth viſibly appear, even in this your Tender Age; and which (if it pleaſes the Almighty to continue his Favours to you, and to give you an Addition of Years) will appear with ſo great a Luſtre, and ſuch a ſhining Brightneſs, that it will not need to be pointed out, but will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that Commendation from the World, which if I ſhould give, might probably be thought a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. For what leſs can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my Lord, when all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire to make you truly Great? Your Birth, your Natural Gifts, your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and your Predeceſſors great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; ſo that you need only have an Eye upon Them, and make but a Common Improvement of your good Diſpoſitions, to make you
<pb facs="tcp:100310:3"/>
become, with the Bleſſing of God, a Pattern of true Greatneſs and Virtue to Poſterity.</p>
            <p>If I then preſume to offer this to your Lordſhip, it is not for any Right it can have to your Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but becauſe I hope it may give you an uſeful Entertainment at Vacant Hours. And if, my Lord, it prove any way Acceptable to you, either for the Variety of the Subject, or the Intention of the Dedicator, you will give a ſingular Inſtance of your Generous Condeſcention, in taking it as (it is meant) a mark of the ſincere Reſpect wherewith I am,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Author gives an account of his mighty deſire to travel. Of his Country and Profeſſion. He ſets out on his Travels, and paſſing firſt thro' ſeveral Countries of</hi> Europe, <hi>he comes at length to</hi> Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: <hi>Where he makes his application to the</hi> Eaſt-India <hi>Company to be admitted into their ſervice, and is accordingly choſen one of the Surgeons.

Reflections on the Voyage, and thoſe that undertake it.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>EVer ſince I came to years, that I could tell my own inclinations, I found the chiefeſt of my deſires was to travel and to ſee ſtrange Countries. And whilſt, by reaſon of my youth, and my more abſolute dependance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to my Parents, I could not think of moving in perſon; yet, in my thoughts, I was often tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from one Country to another: And by the help of Books, I did in ſome meaſure enjoy that ſatisfaction in imagination which I hoped one day to enjoy in reality; and that too as ſoon as might be; for the more I read Voyages, Journals,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100310:10"/>
and other ſuch Books, which gave me an account of ſtrange Adventures, places, things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Men had met with in thoſe more diſtant parts of the World; the more my deſires encreaſed to ſee thoſe things, they gave ſo pleaſant a deſcription of. Nor did the greateſt of dangers, which thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts repreſented to me, ſo much affright me from the like undertakings, as the joyful deliverances out of them, encouraged me to truſt ſo much the more firmly in Divine Providence. And I propoſed to my ſelf ſo much the greater a degree of ſatisfaction, in as much as I might be induced ſo much more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually thereby to admire the great power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; which, tho' viſible enough every where, yet are more conſpicuous in thoſe wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of Nature, which being leſs common and leſs familiar to us, are more apt to raiſe our admiration and love of him, who is the Creatour of them all.</p>
               <p>As ſoon then as my years and affairs did fairly permit me, I prepared my ſelf to be gone, and to ſpend the beſt part of my time in Travels.</p>
               <p>In order therefore to put my reſolution into practiſe, I ſet out from home in the year 1677. on the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> and took my ſhorteſt way to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the chief City of the Empire; from whence I went and took a view of moſt part of <hi>Hungary;</hi> after that I went into <hi>Bohemia, Moravia, Sileſia, Saxony,</hi> and other Countries adjacent; thence I went into <hi>Swiſſerland,</hi> where I ſpent about ſix months at <hi>Zurich.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my earneſt deſire to be a travelling ſomething farther would not permit me to ſtay, and afford my ſelf much eaſe at any of theſe neighbouring Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; but I went away for <hi>Baden;</hi> taking a Boat that carried me all up the River <hi>Limat,</hi> which is a little River that flows from the <hi>Zurich-Zee,</hi> and paſſes thro' the Country of <hi>Zurichgow,</hi> and below
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100310:10"/>
                  <hi>Baden</hi> runs into the River <hi>Aar.</hi> Above <hi>Waldſhut</hi> I took a Boat on the <hi>Rhine,</hi> which carried me all down that River to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> whence I went by Land to <hi>Utretcht,</hi> and from thence by Water to <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> where I arrived about <hi>Chriſtmas, A. D.</hi> 1679.</p>
               <p>The vaſtneſs and beauty of that famous City, and my being a ſtranger there, made me not a little to ſtand amazed, and look about me; as well to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the rarities, that offer'd themſelves to my view every where, as to conſider whither I ſhould go firſt, and where it was moſt likely I ſhould meet with what I ſought after, which was, a fair opportunity of undertaking ſome Voyage to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While I ſtood in this doubtful manner conſidering what I ſhould do next, a good Woman (in all appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) obſerving me to be a ſtranger, and full of thoughts, askt me whom I wanted, or whither I would go? I told her that the firſt thing I was to ſee after, was a Lodging; for I was but juſt come, and the night was drawing on apace: But withal I told her, what ſort of one I wanted, for I had not much money left: Upon which ſhe very compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately told me, I ſhould be very welcome to her poor Apartment (as ſhe call'd it) if I pleaſed. I did not ſtand long to conſider of the matter, but took hold of the opportunity, and went ſtraightway with her to her houſe: Being come in there, ſhe bid me ſtay a while till her Husband came home. It was pretty late at night 'ere he came; being abroad at work, a Bricklayer by Trade; when he came, he ſhewed himſelf very courteous; and being all ſate down, we fell a talking, and he asking me ſeveral queſtions, as it is natural to do to a ſtranger, and amongſt others, to what intent I was come thither: I told him the truth of the matter, and the only thing I propoſed to my ſelf was, to find an occaſion to go to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi> and begg'd his aſſiſtance and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the better to go about my deſign and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:100310:11"/>
The honeſt Man did not ſeem a little ſurprized at my deſign, and endeavoured by all means he could to diſſuade me from it, by ſetting before me all the dangers I was to run, <hi>viz.</hi> of hardſhips, exceſſes of heat, hunger and thirſt, and oftentimes of loſing life it ſelf. But the more lively he preſented all theſe and other kind of dangers to me, the more eager it made me to go thro' 'em, and the more it eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in my reſolutions, as if the dangers had been the only charm that drew me. Which my honeſt Landlord obſerving, he found it was in vain to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to turn me from my deſign; and upon that turn'd all his perſuaſions into a friendly promiſe, that he would aſſiſt me to the utmoſt of his power; and he accordingly recommended me to ſome of the Chief Men of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and did me very conſiderable ſervice.</p>
               <p>Having in this friendly manner broke the Ice for me, and prepared ſome of the Gentlemen to receive my applications, I went chearfully to wait upon them my ſelf, and told them, that it was my deſire to be employed by thoſe honourable Members in any ſervice ſuitable to my profeſſion, which was Phyſick. They carefully examined the reaſons that induced me to go the Voyage, and adviſed me to weigh well what I was about, before I fixt my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; that I might not have cauſe to repent of my raſhneſs when it was too late; and withal they told me that I muſt expect to engage my ſelf for five years. I told them that I had not wanted lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to conſider of it, and that I was fully ſatisfied of the reality of my intention, and that there was no danger of my repenting, or of performing with any regret a thing I had reſolved upon with ſo much deliberation. At which they were very well ſatisfied, yet could they not chuſe but wonder to find me, who was but a Youth, ſo undaunted, notwithſtanding the dangers, which they themſelves repreſented to me.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100310:11"/>
I was then appointed to appear before the Chief Phyſicians, and to undergo an examination; which I accordingly did, with twelve more with me, who were, like me, Candidates to ſerve in ſeveral parts, out of all which there were but ſix to be choſen, three being deſigned to each Ship, of which there were but two to go this Voyage.</p>
               <p>Having been all examined, we retired to the Hall belonging to the Hoſpital, where we were order'd to wait for our anſwer. The expectation and hope which every one of us were in, of being one of thoſe that were choſen; and on the other ſide, the fear of ill ſucceſs, and of diſappointment, made us all very uneaſie. We were not put out of our ſuſpence that day, but we were bid to come again and make our perſonal appearance before the Commiſſioners the next day following; which we did, and I was one of them that were choſen, and my Poſt was aſſigned me aboard the Ship called the <hi>(Ternate)</hi> which was the only one that went the Voyage in company with the <hi>Europa.</hi> I was not ſo very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie as the reſt were during the time of our ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, becauſe I was prepared againſt all diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments in relation to my particular Profeſſion; for I was reſolv'd to go upon any account rather than not to go at all; and a Man ſo reſolved may eaſily find admittance into ſome Poſt or other. And indeed I utterly deſpaired of ſucceſs as to my being choſen for a Phyſician, being I was ſo very young, and the number of the Candidates ſo very great; but beyond all expectation I was one of the ſix Perſons that were called in to give in their Names, tho' indeed I was but the laſt of them: And being all order'd to ſtand by the Secretary, we were eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one askt ſeverally the ſecond time whether we would promiſe faithfully to execute our Office, and ſtrictly to obſerve all and every the Articles enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Company. There were enter'd with the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100310:12"/>
other Phyſicians, and my ſelf a Surgeon for each Ship, and to each of them a Mate, who ſerves as a Barber. So that we were ſix in number, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all in the affirmative, were ſworn, and a Declaration was made to us of the ſeveral Offices we were all accepted into, and what Salary each of us was to expect; <hi>viz.</hi> Each Phyſician was to have 42 Gelders <hi>per</hi> month, and his Table, and a Shoar inſtead of it 6 Ricksdollers. The Surgeons 28 Gilders, and Diet, and on Shoar 3 Ricksdollers. The Barbers 14 Gilders a month, and their Diet, and on Shoar an allowance proportionable to the others inſtead of it. Then we all ſubſcribed to their Articles, and the Caſh-keeper paid us two months Salary before hand; and three Dutch Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings every day while we ſtayed on Shoar; which was eighteen days.</p>
               <p>After which, a review being firſt made of all the Ships Crew, we were all put on board three long flat Boats (which are for that purpoſe, and tho' ſmall, yet ſo cloſe Deckt, that in a rough Sea they will go quite under the waves and retain no water) they carried us from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Texel,</hi> where the two Ships, bound for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> lay. <hi>Texel</hi> is a Sea Port lying on the open Sea, about 16 miles from <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> we had a very freſh gale of Wind (I call it ſo now, tho' then I reckon'd it a hard Storm) but it was not fair for us; ſo that we made ſomething more than four days, before we could reach <hi>Texel:</hi> Whither being come, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to do but to Sail, I will in the mean while give my Reader an account of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that thoſe Ships generally make for this great Voyage.</p>
               <p>Before they go off from <hi>Holland,</hi> they take a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral review of every perſon that belongs to the Ship, and each Man hath two months pay advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him: But the full and regular pay begins only
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100310:12"/>
after they are paſſed the <hi>Tonnen,</hi> which is a place ſo called, about a League out at Sea; from that time the full pay is to continue whether the Fleet go forward, or is forced back again by contrary Winds, as they frequently are; and ſometimes kept there a great while, inſomuch that in the Winter they are laid up for ſeveral weeks, the Water being frozen all about them, ſo that they cannot ſtir; and when that happens, they do ſometimes diſcharge their Ships Crew to leſſen the charges which would otherwiſe be very great.</p>
               <p>But when the Wind is fair, and the Fleet hath been two or three days under Sail, then there is diſtributed to each perſon, little and great, 5 Dutch Cheeſes as a Preſent from the Company: Then muſt all and every Officer, Soldier and Mariner, make his appearance upon Deck, to be divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſeveral Quarters, which are two: The one of them is called the <hi>Prince's Quarter,</hi> the other <hi>Count Maurice's.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Each perſon is aſſigned into one of theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in which he is always to be found on any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; and there he is to keep the Watch by turns. And that all may know to what part every Man belongs, the names of them all as they are divided is affixed to the Main Maſt, on two diſtinct Tables; where alſo is ſet the order and time that every Man is to watch in. The <hi>Prince's Quarter</hi> hath the firſt turn, and is therefore called the firſt Watch. There is a Provoſt, whoſe Office it is to call them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to ſet the Watch; each Quarter watches four hours, and then is relieved by the other. <hi>Count Maurice's</hi> Quarter hath the ſecond Watch, and is alſo called the <hi>Dog-watch.</hi> There is a Bell in the Ship, by which notice is given them of the time. It is rung at the ſetting of the Watch, and with a loud voice charge is given by the Provoſt to every one to take care not to be drunk upon pain of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100310:13"/>
puniſhment. There are Hour-glaſſes put up conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently for him that ſtands Centinel, and the Helms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſee; and as ſoon as the firſt Glaſs, which is but of half an hour, is out, they ſtrike one ſtroke on the Bell; when the ſecond is out, they give two, and ſo on, adding one for each half hour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Bell is rung again. Then another Officer comes and calls his Men together out of his Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and releaſes the other.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe one Man or two always to ſtand on the Main Top-Maſt head; but the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that go to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> are always free from that ſervice, tho' in their return from thence Home, that duty lies upon them equally with the Sea-men. Yet (if they can afford it) they may buy it off with a matter of 25 Ricksdollers, tho' the Voyage ſhould be a year in compleating.</p>
               <p>When there are a great many ſick in the Ship, then thoſe that are in health are again divided, that they may have the duty as equally ſhared between them as may be: And when a Storm threatens them ſo as to be forced to hand their Sails, all hands muſt be at work and help; and ſo likewiſe when the Ship is forc'd to clap upon a Wind, ſo that ſhe muſt tack every two hours.</p>
               <p>When any one neglects his turn, or is negligent in his duty, his puniſhment is to have a 100 or 200 (or ſometimes more) blows on the breech with a Rope's end. Every one that doth not come every morning and night to the Prayers that are conſtantly made twice every day, loſeth for that day his portion of Wine and Brandy: There is a Pſalm alſo ſung every night, and for that purpoſe a Pſalm book is preſented by the Company to every perſon in the Ship.</p>
               <p>Smoaking of Tobacco is ſtrictly forbidden at night below Decks, to prevent any miſchief that might be cauſed by it, the Beds being all ſtuft with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100310:13"/>
very good Cotton; but every where elſe it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: And there is a great ſquare Cheſt with a Pin in the middle, about which there is 10 or 12 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom of Match, where any one may light his Pipe.</p>
               <p>At the third Watch it's the buſineſs of one of them to take care to call up the Cook, who, as ſoon as Prayers are over, goes about the Dinner. Three Meals a day are allowed to all, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after Prayers they ring the Bell, then every one comes for his <hi>Quantum</hi> of Brandy, which is about a <hi>quartern</hi> of our meaſure.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Saturday</hi> each Man receives five pound of Biſcuit, about a quartern of Oil, and double that quantity of Vinegar, and half a pound of Butter, which a man muſt husband as he thinks beſt; it is to ſerve for the whole week. Three times a week are Fleſh-days, <hi>viz. Tueſdays, Saturdays</hi> and <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days,</hi> on which days each Man hath three quarters of a pound of Beef or Pork, but moſt of it is ſo ſalt, having lain in the Salt it may be five or ſix years, that when it is dreſt it hardly weighs half a pound.</p>
               <p>As for the Drink: At the ſetting out the Beer is in common as long as it laſts, which is not very long; when it is out, then every one is reduced to his meaſure of Water, which is about a large quart to a Man, and very well too; but when they come into the <hi>Indies,</hi> if they chance to be commanded away to any other parts, they are often forced to be ſatisfied with half that quantity, and then you may imagine what a value a Man ſets upon his Liquor; and a Man may as well ſteal all ones mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as a drop of Water from any one.</p>
               <p>There is a very great ſeverity exerciſed over the Malefactors, of which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak more particularly hereafter. In the mean while to inform the Reader of the general Cuſtoms, they are as follow.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:100310:14"/>
If any one wounds another with a Knife, or other Weapon, he is forced to hold up his hand againſt the Maſt; and the Barber takes a Knife, and ſtrikes it thro' his hand a little below the fingers; and ſometimes as the fault is greater or leſs, thro' the middle of his hand, and there he leaves if ſticking in the Maſt; ſo that the Offender muſt pull his hand thro' if he deſigns to have it to himſelf again. He that ſtrikes an Officer, or Maſter of the Ship, is without hopes of pardon to be thrown into the Sea faſten'd by a Rope, with which he is thrown in on one ſide of the Ship, and drawn up again on the other, and ſo three times together he is drawn round the Keel of the Ship, in the doing of which, if they ſhould chance not to allow Rope enough to let him ſink below the Keel, the Malefactor might have his brains knockt out. This Puniſhment is call'd <hi>Keel-halen,</hi> which may be call'd in Engliſh <hi>Keel-drawing.</hi> But the Provoſt hath this Priviledge more than the other, that if any one ſtrikes him on Shoar, he forfeits his hand, if on Board, then he is certainly <hi>Keel-draw'd.</hi> Part of the Provoſt's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is diligently to obſerve the behaviour of the Soldiers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and to ſee that they be exerciſed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day by ſome diſciplined Soldiers that have been the Voyage already. Puniſhment alſo is inflicted by his orders on the Soldiers that are catch'd at Cards or Dice, which are ſtrictly forbid; but Tables and Draughts are allowed, yet muſt they not play at them for Money.</p>
               <p>All I ſhall add concerning the manner of going about this Voyage, is by way of directions to thoſe who have a mind to undertake it. There are occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions enough for any Man among the Dutch, French, Engliſh and Portugueze, and every Man muſt take his choice which he will go with, according to the Nation he is of. But for the Dutch (if not for the others too) the beſt way is to go to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:100310:14"/>
whence a Fleet is diſpatched three times every year, which for management of their affairs at Sea yields to no Sea-men whatever, and therefore is moſt ſafe and convenient; they go off about <hi>June, September</hi> and <hi>December.</hi> But they will hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Paſſenger, as ſuch; and therefore for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, he muſt enter into their ſervice, into ſome Poſt convenient for him, at leaſt for the Voyage.</p>
               <p>Indeed when one comes to Great <hi>Java,</hi> which is by <hi>Batavia,</hi> one may quit their ſervice; but the Rules which their Articles bind a Man to obſerve, makes it a freedom not much different from the ſervice, by reaſon of the great reſtraint the Company will lay upon a Man. For firſt, He muſt oblige himſelf not to ſtir out of the Country in leſs than ten years time: Nor muſt he Traffick in ſeveral goods, as he would deſire; nor with ſuch Countries as would pleaſe him beſt: For he is only permitted to deal with ſome ſmall part of the Country, at the Iſlands of <hi>Molucco:</hi> And if a Man tranſgreſſes theſe Injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, he doth not only forfeit all he is worth, but alſo his honour and reputation.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that deſign then to give themſelves up wholly to the ſervice of the Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, muſt bind themſelves to them for five years, beſides the Voyage forwards and backwards; and take his chance for what part of the Country he is to live in: For it doth not lie in his power to chuſe this or that part, as a Man might wiſh; ſome parts being ſo much more healthy than others are, and ſome much more advantageous than the reſt; for that he muſt take his Lot as it falls. It ſeldom happens too, that any one is removed from the place into which he is ordered at the firſt: but it falls hardeſt of all upon thoſe that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to ſtay all the while at Sea on board; tho' indeed it is more profitable for him.</p>
               <p>Any one that goes thither cannot have any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100310:15"/>
of advancing himſelf much, unleſs he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands Trade very well, and the Dutch Tongue; and hath Friends there, that are able and willing to help him. For when the Company take men into their ſervice, they take 3 or 4 times as many Men as they have Employments for, and out of them they employ thoſe only that have good recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations. Some men indeed by their Induſtry and good Fortune, or rather I ſhould ſay, good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, have advanced themſelves conſiderably from nothing, or very mean beginnings; but there are abundance who want neither parts, nor induſtry, who notwithſtanding do not move a ſtep towards Preferment all the while they ſtay there: Which hath made ſeveral of them to deſpair, and betake themſelves to very ill courſes. The condition of life wherein a Man meets with leaſt diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under them, is that of a Soldier; where he hath four Ricksdollers a month and his meat; tho' the latter is very mean and ſparingly allowed, both in the Ships and in the Garriſons, inſomuch that it is a very hard and uncomfortable employ for any one that hath any thing of Education.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers receive their Pay as follows; one half of it is paid at two payments in one year; and that not in full, but one part in Cloths, which are reckon'd to him at a ſufficient high rate, and the other half is paid him when he is come home again. He receives for his Subſiſtence (beſides his pay) 40 pounds of Rice (inſtead of Ammunition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bread) <hi>per</hi> month, and ¾ of a Ricksdoller.</p>
               <p>Beſides, all the Countries where the Company hath any footing are very unhealthful, except <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandel, Batavia,</hi> and ſome few others, and moſt very ill provided with neceſſaries, much leſs with conveniences, for life.</p>
               <p>The Soldiers that remain on Ship-board, are yet worſe uſed than thoſe that are at Land, and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100310:15"/>
of the Foggs they are often in, are more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſickneſs; and beſides, both there and on Shore, there is more ſevere Juſtice exerciſed on Offenders than in Europe, and a ſmall matter brings a Man to open and ſhameful puniſhment.</p>
               <p>All this being well conſidered, I preſume no Man can be very fond of going to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> on thoſe terms, unleſs he is reduc'd to Poverty, or driven to it by ſome other neceſſitous occaſion. But my advice would be to any one that hath a mind to ſee the Indies, and to try his Fortune with freedom, to go among the Engliſh, who with more honour and generoſity give a Man the liberty to advance himſelf, or to paſs his days there as he thinks moſt convenient, and to as much ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction as his circumſtances will permit him, which are left to a Man to improve as he is beſt able, and may then comfortably enjoy the fruits of his Labours and Induſtry.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>A Review of all our Ships Crew being made, which was three hundred and fifty perſons, on the laſt of <hi>May</hi> 1680. We weighed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and ſet out with a good Wind, and the other Ship with us. And the next day about Sun-riſing
<pb facs="tcp:100310:16"/>
we paſſed between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice,</hi> which are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Leagues diſtant from each other. The ſame day five Fly-boats from the <hi>Maes</hi> joyned us, they were bound for <hi>Portugal,</hi> by which we were to paſs.</p>
               <p>The third and fourth day we ſtill had <hi>France</hi> on the left of us, and kept <hi>England</hi> in ſight on the right, and ſailed ſucceſsfully, ſave that one of the Maſter's Boys going to eaſe Nature at the Ships Stern (whereas the Bowgh is the uſual place) dropt into the Sea; and tho' we hall'd out our long Boat immediately, yet the Ship ſailing ſo very faſt, they could not come at him; ſo the Boat was hoyſted in again. The Wind continued good for us till we came within ſight of the Iſland <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagues,</hi> where we loſt our Companion the Ship <hi>Europa,</hi> which had ſteered another courſe. In the mean time the common Articles which are to be obſerved at Sea, were read; to inform every one of his duty upon all accidents and occaſions; and alſo what allowances every Man was to have.</p>
               <p>We paſſed by the ſaid Iſlands, tho' with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Wind, which obliged us to tack three or four times a day, till we at laſt at three weeks end got in ſight of the Canary Iſlands, and with a ſide Wind at N. N. E. ſailed thro' between the two Iſlands. There we ſaw that vaſt high Hill call'd <hi>Pico de Canaria,</hi> or the <hi>Peak of Teneriff,</hi> which is of ſuch an incredible height, that none in the World is to compare to it. 'Tis admirable to ſee, how far it ſtretches it ſelf above the Clouds. It was at that time ſo exceſſive hot about us in our Ship, that we were forced to have a ſail ſtretched, and that continually kept wetting, to keep us a little cool; and defend us from the Sun's piercing Beams: And yet you might ſee through the Clouds, the top of that mountain covered with Snow.</p>
               <p>Here our Maſter died, being upwards of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years of Age, and having made three Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:100310:16"/>
to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies:</hi> Upon which, a Council be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called, one <hi>Peter Peters</hi> was choſen in his Place. This old Gentleman was the firſt I ſaw buried after the Sea-faſhion, which is in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: They take the dead Body and tye it on a Board, and faſten two Cannon-Balls to their Feet, and ſo throw them over-board, juſt as Morning-Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are over. In this manner they ſerved the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. But my Comrade had not all this pother made about him; for without a Salute or a Cannon-Ball he was barely ty'd to a Board, and thrown over; ſo that he floated a great while. This Solemnity gave occaſion to a Diſpute among ſome of our Seamen, concerning the dead Bodies that were thus thrown over-board; ſome affirming, That when they were looſe, floating upon the Water, you might turn them how you would, and they would ſtill turn again, with their Face or Head towards the Eaſt: Upon which, one of thoſe who could not give Credit to that Opinion, went down (the Water being pretty ſtill) and with a Pole turned the Corps about, which immediately turn'd again, by what Cauſe I know not, but it convinced him, That the other's Aſſertion had ſomewhat of Truth in it.</p>
               <p>Such dead Bodies float till ſome Shark, or ſuch like great Fiſh, devours them: But I do ſuppoſe they ſpit out the Plank again. Theſe <hi>Sharks</hi> we as often call <hi>Men-Eaters</hi> in Dutch, becauſe they are very greedy of Mens Fleſh. They have a large Mouth, which they open very wide, and Teeth of great length, and exceeding ſharp, which ſhut into one another; ſo that whatever they get be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, they bite clear through. They are about 20 or 24 Foot in length; and they keep about the Ships in hopes of Prey; but are much more frequent in the <hi>Indies,</hi> than in the Way; where they do abundance of Miſchief among the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:100310:17"/>
Seamen when they go to ſwim, as we afterwards found, when we came in the Road near <hi>Batavia;</hi> where one ſwimming at a diſtance from the Ship, a Shark came up to him, and drew him under Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and we never could hear of him more, or ſo much as ſee any remnant of him; which made all the old Seamen wonder, who ſaid, They never knew a Shark take any more of a Man, than a Leg, or, it may be, a good Part of the Thigh with it: But for this Man, we did not perceive ſo much as the Water bloody. Near <hi>Japara</hi> we had a Man, who had loſt a Limb by this means, under our Hands to cure; and he lived ſeven Days after it; but at the end of that time he died, being mightily tortured with a vehement Cramp. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, at the Iſle of <hi>Onruſt,</hi> about eight Leagues from <hi>Batavia,</hi> our Ship being layed up to mend ſomething of the ſide of it, the Carpenter going to do ſomething to it, about a Knee deep under Water, had his Arm and Shoulder ſnap'd off. I took him and bound him up, but to no purpoſe; for in leſs than three Hours time, he was dead.</p>
               <p>But now to return to my Purpoſe; which is, To give you an Account of our Voyage.</p>
               <p>We had now been above eight Weeks at Sea, and had had very favourable Winds; in which time moſt of our Proviſions of Brandy, Cheeſe and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, being conſumed; and the Heat daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing; to which we muſt add, That many were not uſed to ſuch ſort of Sea-Diet (and that at laſt we could hardly get neither) <hi>viz.</hi> Bacon as ſalt as Brine, Gray-Peaſe half boyl'd, Grout and ſtinking Water: Our Ship became a meer Hoſpital, ſo many fell ſick. The chief Diſtempers were, the Dropſie, the Bloody-Flux and Scurvey. Upon this the ſick were divided from the reſt, and had the Larboard ſide allotted them, which is the ſide on the left<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand. The Starboard was for the others. Thus we
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:100310:17"/>
continued our Courſe, till we reached the Iſland call'd, <hi>The Iſland of St. Paul,</hi> which we left about 30 Miles off on the left-hand, and ſteered our Courſe for the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After about ſeven days ſail from the ſaid Iſland of <hi>St. Paul</hi> with very little Wind, the number of our ſick increaſed daily, and the diſtempers that now reigned moſt, were the Scurvy, and the Small-Pox; which carried off almoſt all the oldeſt of our Men, but the younger ſort quickly recover'd. Many were light-headed, and ailed nothing more; which was occaſioned, as I preſume, only from the exceſſive heat we ſuffer'd, as we paſſed under the Line, and came to the other ſide of the Globe. In this diſmal condition we went on; our only hope being that we ſhould not be long ere we ſhould reach the <hi>Cape Bonne Eſperance,</hi> or the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our hopes were ſtrangely fruſtrated: for we quite loſt our courſe: For the Snow fell ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thick (as it is uſual about <hi>Africa)</hi> that our Men could not ſee one another the length of the Ship. Then our Maſter gave Orders that one ſhould go up the Main Top-Maſt head, and keep ſtrict watch; becauſe we were continually in expectation of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Land. Early the next morning I got me above Deck, and went to take my allowance of Brandy at the uſual place: After which my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, and I, who had been old acquaintance before we went to Sea, and between whom an inviolable friendſhip was contracted, we agreed to go and ſmoak our Pipes, and fell into a chearful confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence about our approaching Joy of ſetting our feet on dry ground.</p>
               <p>While we were thus talking, we heard of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cry of Land, Land, which mightily increaſed our Joy; little knowing after what manner we were drawing nigh to the Shore. But we quickly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100310:18"/>
ſaw our miſtake, when the Maſter upon this out-cry, comes out, and with death in his looks crys our, Oh my poor Ship! we are all undone! At which we ſtood in amaze, not knowing what to ſay, or to take in hand to help our ſelves.</p>
               <p>All this while the Ship was running violently to ſhore, the Wind being very high, and having no time to hand our Sails, we were forced to cut the Gears, upon which the Wind carried off our Sails over-board, with ſuch a violent noiſe, that one would have thought Heaven and Earth were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together. While we were all running hither and thither, in a miſerable confuſion, the Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to crack; which made us all cry out with a loud voice, to Almighty God, to receive our poor Souls. It is eaſie to imagine what a diſmal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were in, with the noiſe the Ship made, and the crying and ſighing that ſo many of us made; for we were ſtill 343 perſons on Board, and the Ship kept ſtill cracking more and more, till at laſt the After-part broke, and the Sea beating in violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſunk our Stern in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>None now expected to eſcape, and we ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but death round about us, by reaſon of the depth of the Sea on one ſide, and on the other the Shore ſo high, that it was inacceſſible. Yet every body was willing to try what they could do; and to prolong their lives as long as they poſſibly could. We reſolved therefore to leap into the Sea; and, if poſſible, to make to Shore, which was near enough to us, if haply we might reach it: But we fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw it almoſt impoſſible to come to it, by reaſon of its ſteepneſs, and the violent beating of the Waves.</p>
               <p>Thus recommending my ſelf to Almighty God, and having implored his pardon and aſſiſtance, I committed my ſelf to the Sea, and ſtrove with the utmoſt of my power to get to the Rocks. I toucht them twice or thrice, but the Waves carried
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100310:18"/>
me off again; by this time ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany were got out ſafe, and they could not help us any otherwiſe, than by calling to us, and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us what was beſt to do; which was no ſmall help to thoſe that ſwom: for the directions they gave from the Shore, was a great guide to thoſe poor people who were ſtill in the Sea, and whom fear made ſo inſenſible, and ſo haſty, that they could not of themſelves think to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they might have done, had they been leſs terrified.</p>
               <p>After I had been carried off again from the Rock, ſo far, that I had little or no hopes of ever reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it again, it pleaſed God that I was thrown on again, and I luckily ſtruck my hand into a claiy part of it, and thus got ſafe to ſhore.</p>
               <p>Seven more got out after me, and 35 before, ſo that 43 of us only eſcaped; <hi>viz.</hi> the Maſter, the Steers-man, two Surgeons beſides me, three Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, the Cook's men, the Swabber, the Gunner, 22 Sea-men, and eight Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The reſt, 300 in number, miſerably loſt their lives.</p>
               <p>Here we all fell on our knees, and returned our hearty praiſe to the merciful God who had ſo boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully deliver'd us from ſo great a danger; after which we went to look a little about us; but none of us knew where we were; which added much to our ſorrow; beſides that three of our men were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt dead with the cold cauſed by the Sea-water.</p>
               <p>The Ship ſunk down-right, ſo that we could not ſee the leaſt part of her, nor had we ſaved the leaſt thing about us. Her Cargo was worth above 328000 <hi>Ricksdollers</hi> in ready Caſh, and many thouſand Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in goods beſides, which were all loſt.</p>
               <p>Finding out at laſt that it was the falſe <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> we were got upon, and that we were at 40 Miles diſtance from the right one, where the Duth Garriſon lay; we were forced to go further
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100310:19"/>
into the Country, which was the more tedious, by reaſon of the ſick men we had with us. We knew that the Country had good ſtore of admirable fruits, which we wiſhed to come at; and at laſt we got ſome excellent good Water-Melons, which ſerved us for Meat and Drink.</p>
               <p>In this poor condition we ſaw ſome Hottentots at a diſtance, whom we could not come to ſpeak to; for they run away from us. But it was to fetch ſome of them that could ſpeak Dutch; and when we had made our caſe known to them, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately went and acquainted the Governour with it, who ſtreight ſent another parcel of theſe Hotten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots (who are the wild Inhabitants of that Country) together with ſeveral Files of Soldiers to fetch us. They took up our ſick men, and carried them on their ſhoulders upon Beds made of Reeds; and we were comfortably entertained with good Canary, good Rice, Bisket, and all ſorts of excellent fruits; all which were extreamly welcome to us.</p>
               <p>When we came to the Cape, our Maſter and the Streers-man went immediately before the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to clear themſelves from whatever might be laid to their charge, for the loſs of the Ship, and of ſo many mens lives; and there alledg'd, that it could not be imputed to their negligence, or want of due care; but that it was the good pleaſure of Providence to afflict them in that manner. After which we were all lodged within the Caſtle, and furniſh'd with the uſual allowance, and there wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the <hi>Europa</hi>'s coming; which was no leſs than three weeks: So that we gave that over for loſt too, fearing it had undergone like fate with ours. What obſervations I made in this Country, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time of our ſtay, I will now give you an account of.</p>
               <p>In the year 1650 a Fort was built by the Dutch in this Cape, and ever ſince all the ſhipping that comes
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100310:19"/>
thither, whether French, Engliſh, or any other Nation, muſt pay Tribute at their firſt Landing. This Land, for its ſituation and fruitfulneſs, is very commodious for all that go from any part of Europe to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> for refreſhing of themſelves, and recruiting of Proviſions, and taking in of freſh Water, which comes out of the Rocks and Mountains of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Within the Land, it is richly adorn'd with abundance of Fruit-trees; but near the Shore, there are few, or none, by reaſon of the terrible Winds and Hurricanes, that beat upon it in a fearful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which come generally down from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called by the Dutch <hi>Tafel-bergh:</hi> And by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of theſe ſtormy Winds, this Cape goes frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with us by the name of the <hi>Storm Cape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dutch, that are there in Garriſon, have planted good Orchards and Gardens, which afford all ſorts of Sallads, Cabages, Turnips, Cowcum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all ſorts of Kitchen Herbs: All which are great refreſhments to thoſe that come from Sea. And likewiſe the free Inhabitants, of which there were already ſome hundreds when I was there, have Land which produces good Corn, Wheat, and Oats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Vineyards: So that one finds there plenty of good Beer, Wine, excellent Bread, and ſuch ſort of things as well as in Europe.</p>
               <p>I dieted at one of theſe Free-men's houſes, and I had a very good Dinner of Meat, roſt and boil'd, and Fiſh, with excellent Sallad, and Butter, and Cheeſe, and delicate Beer, all for one <hi>Skelling,</hi> (which is but ſix pence Engliſh) but Wine I was forced to pay for, after the rate of half a Ricks-doller the quart.</p>
               <p>Beſides the great ſtore of Fruits which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Europe. There is great plenty of admirable Lemon and Orange Trees, which afford a very beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proſpect.</p>
               <p>The Haven is called <hi>Tafel-Baey,</hi> which is to ſay,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100310:20"/>
Table-Bay, ſo called from a vaſt Mountain juſt by the Shore which is called <hi>Tafel-bergh,</hi> in Engliſh <hi>Table-bill,</hi> from its figure, which is ſeemingly ſquare and flat at top: It is ſeen a vaſt way off at Sea; and it lies about five Miles from the utmoſt point of the Cape; between which, lieth the Hill <hi>Lewen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergh,</hi> or <hi>Lion's-bill,</hi> ſo call'd, by reaſon of its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a Lion in ſhape; the head comes quite up to the Table-hill, and the tail comes down into the Sea.</p>
               <p>I had a great deſire to go up to the top of that Hill e're I went from the Cape: So having got ſome others who deſired it too, we got leave, and ſet out the next morning early. It is about a Mile diſtance from the Caſtle; we went up it a good pace for a matter of four hours, and yet we were not near to the top: We were pretty well tired, and more afraid of being too long about it, and of being belated; for in the evening it is extraordinary dangerous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, by reaſon of the wild Beaſts that then come abroad; ſo we e'en reſolved to go back again to get in by day-light: For we thought if we had fallen under their clutches, we ſhould not have been much the better for our experience: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a Cloud came over us which wetted us to the Skin, whereupon we returned back ſtreight, and came into the Caſtle about half an hour before night; ſo that we could not compaſs our deſire, nor could ever yet hear of any one that had been up to the top of it.</p>
               <p>Proviſion is here ſo plenty, that the Dutch have it mighty cheap, for a little Copper-wire, for Brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, for Tobacco, and for any ſuch trifle; ſo that a large Beaſt doth not ſtand a man in more than a conple of Shillings.</p>
               <p>There are a great many Lions and wild Boars. In the Governours Hall are two Lions Skins. The one was of a Lion, that one of the Hottentots ſhot with his Arrow: The other was kill'd by a Boar. This laſt
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100310:20"/>
Creature, I mean the Boar, hath on its back a ſharp ſort of Prickle; near a ſpang long, and ſo hard, that they ſerve many Trades-men for Bodkins. And the Lion falling furiouſly upon this Boar, the Boar ſtruck him with his prickly Briſtles into the belly, and made him bleed to death, tho' the Boar periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed likewiſe in the fight; and they were found dead by one another, and both their Skins were hung up for a <hi>memorandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are many Elephants in that Country, and a ſort of Beaſt they call <hi>Bavians,</hi> the ſame we call Baboons; which very much reſemble aged Men. Some of our Men had orders once to go into the Wood to cut down part of it. Amongſt them was one Comical fellow, who had beaten one to death in a quarrel at <hi>Tirol;</hi> and being forc'd to fly, had liſted himſelf a Soldier in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, and ſo made his eſcape. He ſtaid a little after the reſt to eaſe Nature; and laid his Satchel down at ſome diſtance from him; we ſaw one of thoſe Baboons coming towards him, which made us ſtand ſtill to ſee what he would do; and laying hold on his Satchel, away he went with it, and robb'd the fellow of all his proviſion of Bread, and Cheeſe, and Tobacco; which made very good ſport for the reſt. Oſtridges are here alſo very common; the Eggs whereof are very good to eat. And among many other ſorts of Birds, which they have, that are uncommon with us, there are a ſort called <hi>Sea-Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi> but of theſe there hath been account enough given by ſeveral Writers.</p>
               <p>In the Sea, all round this place, one may ſee abundance of great Fiſh called <hi>North-Capers,</hi> but none of them are catched about the Cape; they have a ſnout like that of an Hog, thro' which they throw up Water as high as an houſe, and in ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, as to fill almoſt a ſmall Veſſel, and it comes down like a violent ſhower of Rain: They are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100310:21"/>
to be ſeen about the Cape, but they do no manner of harm.</p>
               <p>There is a prodigious quantity of other ſorts of Fiſh, both in the Sea, and in the Rivers too. We went one night with a Net to have ſome ſport, and at two pulls we had ſo many, we could not carry the tenth part of 'em. The Fiſh we caught were made very much like our Carps; and here are alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Tortoiſes.</p>
               <p>The natural Inhabitants of this place, are called <hi>Hottentots,</hi> meer Heathens; of no extraordinary ſize; for the moſt part very lean, and meagre; their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage very unpleaſant, rattling like Turkies when they ſpeak. They go ſtark naked, only having a Sheeps Skin about them, the Tail whereof comes before their Privities.</p>
               <p>When a Ship is new come in, aſſoon as the Boat lands any of the Men, they get in as it comes back, to beg Bisket of the Sea-men, which they love ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; when they ask for it, they cry <hi>Broqua,</hi> which ſignifies Bread.</p>
               <p>It is their cuſtom to cut out one of their Teſticles when they are young. Their chief Ornaments (if ſuch may be ſo called) is on their Legs; they take an Ox, or Sheep's guts, and thruſting out the excrements a little, juſt to let them lye cloſe and flat; and while they are moiſt, they wrap them about their Legs, and there let them ſtick. Theſe very guts is part of their food too; for juſt in this ſame pickle, they broil them a little over the fire, and eat them. So that it may properly be ſaid, that they are meat and cloth to 'em: But to ſee them uſe-it either way, might very probably give any man beſides them, a vomit. They uſe to beſmear their body with all manner of dirt and naſtineſs, which makes them ſtink worſe than a Goat.</p>
               <p>Upon their heads they ſtick all ſorts of little Sea-ſhells, and ſmall Copper Rings, that come from
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100310:21"/>
                  <hi>Neurenbergh,</hi> which the Sea-men bring with them, to give them: And for one of them they will ſhew you ſome of their Tricks; among which one is, to throw a Dart or long Stick, with which they'll hit within the compaſs of a farthing a mighty diſtance off.</p>
               <p>As for their Religion, little can be ſaid of it, their Language, it not being underſtood by any, that ever I heard of. They uſe commonly to get together near to the Sea-ſhore in the morning by Sun-riſing, and there they get in a Ring, holding each other faſt by their hands, and dance about upon the Sand, looking up towards Heaven, ſaying ſomething in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; and then write ſome ſtrange unintelligible characters and figures in the Sand, and ſo depart; all which undoubtedly is intended in honour to ſome Deity. I have asked ſome of them that could ſpeak a little broken Dutch, what thoughts they had of a God, and whom they believed in; they anſwered, that they thought that there was one above, that had made the Hills, and that Sea which we ſaw, and all that was in them; and that Homage was due to him; but I could not learn any thing further.</p>
               <p>They are very good Footmen, and run very ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which make the Dutch keep always a Troop of Horſe there, to catch them in caſe of any Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For they dare not truſt them in the leaſt. In miſchief they are cunning enough, tho' wonderfully ſtupid in any thing elſe. If they are not hungry, they'll not work, tho' you would beat them to death; but when their belly incites them to it, they'll work like Horſes. It is not ſafe to break ones word with them; and if one ſhould not give them what was promiſed, when their work is done, a man would go in danger of his life.</p>
               <p>Their Habitations are moſt on green Meadows, and grounds that bear ſweet Herbs for Paſture for their Cattle. Their Houſes are made of Sea-Reeds joyn'd together, and faſtned at top; juſt like our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100310:22"/>
Hop-poles, when they are laid up for the Winter; and when their Cattle hath eaten up the Paſture all about them, then they remove their Houſes, to ſome freſh place, and ſettle there again for ſome time.</p>
               <p>As to what belongs to thoſe we call Free-men, of which I made ſome mention before, they are ſuch of our Men, as have ſerved the Company in the ſtation of a Soldier, or any other way during the ſpace of ten or twelve years, and then deſired to ſettle there, to trade or plant, which they may then do, paying a certain ſum of Money, and all Impoſts and Cuſtoms to the Company. Theſe have dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſes built after a manner like as in <hi>Holland,</hi> but not ſo high nor ſo fine.</p>
               <p>The chief Commodities which the Company trades in, to quit the Coſts of their Garriſon there, is Sea-Dogs, which are catched here in vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities. They boil the fat out of them, and the Skins are hung up to dry, which they ſend afterwards to <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When any Ship comes there, an Order is read to all the People that are on Board, forbidding them all to buy any thing of the Hottentots, except Oſtridges Eggs, and other like trifles. All Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of any uſe or value, as Rhinoceros Horns, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants Teeth, and Sea-Dog Skins, are wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed by the Company.</p>
               <p>Juſtice here is very ſevere, in reſpect to any of theſe Heathens eſpecially; one inſtance whereof I was an eye-witneſs of, while I was there; Three of them having raviſh'd a Chriſtian Maid-ſervant, were hung up by the heels on a Gibbet, and ſo ended their lives, after they had hang'd there about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or fourteen hours.</p>
               <p>There are four Seaſons of the year here, tho' in a quite different time from ours: For our Summer is their Winter; and in <hi>September,</hi> which was the time I was there, it was their Spring-ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:100310:22"/>
Their Winters are cold, and always foggy and miſty, but there is never any Froſt or Snow. Thus far will ſuffice to inform the Reader of the nature and cuſtoms of the <hi>Cape de Bona Speranza.</hi> I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed now with the continuation of our Voyage.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFter we had ſpent a pretty while here, and were very well recovered from our late Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, we prepared our ſelves to be gone in the <hi>Europa,</hi> which by this time was come, and ready to ſail off again for <hi>Batavia;</hi> and with the firſt fair Wind we ſet Sail, and in the name of God we ran out of <hi>Taſel-Bay,</hi> leaving only one Engliſh Fly-Boat behind us at the Cape, which was come thither, ſince we.</p>
               <p>All that day, and the next, the ſame fair Gale continued, which blew us along ſo briskly, that on the next day we were got out of ſight of <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> and came into the Main. We had this brisk and fair Gale for eight days together, which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us merrily along beyond the Iſland called
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100310:23"/>
                  <hi>St. Maurice,</hi> about which place men ſeldom fail of a Storm and bad Weather; ſo that it was no ſmall joy to us, to have ſo fairly eſcaped it: But alas! our joy was ſoon palled; and our ſecurity proved very deceitful, while we fooliſhly took the meaſures of our ſafety, more from the Climes and Latitudes we were in, than from <hi>His</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to whom the Winds, and Seas are every where ſubject; for when we leaſt thought on't, the Sky darkned all of a ſudden, and ſuch a Hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican roſe upon us, as made us all tremble. No ſooner had it given us the firſt toſs, but our Ship out-did almoſt the noiſe of it, with the dreadful cracks it gave, inſomuch that we expected nothing but to ſink in the inſtant. All the while the Clouds grew darker and darker, and the Wind increaſed to that degree, that we could not hear one another ſpeak. The Sea gaped ſo hideouſly, that it could not be thought we ſhould ever eſcape being ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up; our Ship ſometimes mounted on the top of a Wave, plunged down with ſuch a terrible force, as it had been down a Precipice, that we expected every moment to be overwhelmed with it. And no ſooner had we eſcaped one Gulph, but we were raiſed up again to fall into another. All this while, what with the Sea daſhing in upon us, and what with the great Gaps that were in the Ship, we were ſo full of Water, that we were all forced to pump like Slaves, for three days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; all which yet was little enough. I for my part, who little thought to have been in any ſuch employment, yet was forced to fall to, and ſtick to it for four hours together, which would have been intolerable to me at any other time: But on ſuch occaſions a Man doth not much ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Niceties: And I do not remember that I was ſo much as tired with it, for the hopes we had that God would ſtill caſt an Eye of pity upon us,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100310:23"/>
and relieve us out of our miſery, was now all the comfort we had left. But the Weather ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, or, rather indeed, grew worſe, ſo that mounting our Ship up an end, one of our Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was toſs'd out of his Cabin, and had tumbled directly into the Sea, had not one of the Sea-men luckily caught hold of him. I tryed ſeveral places to get a little reſt in, and, amongſt others, I got in by ſome Sheep that we had brought from the Cape with us, which I found almoſt dead, never a one of them being able to ſtand on its Leggs. Not finding my ſelf ſafe there, without holding faſt by the Boards, which was very tireſome work, I went to the Gunner's Room, where the Surgeons Cheſts always lye, to try to get into a Hammock: But all the Cheſts there were turned topſie turvy, and in ſuch a confuſion, that I could not get to the place I deſigned for 'em; ſo I ſate me down: But I had not been there three minutes, but I heard a low broken voice juſt breathing out the Name of God; at which, being mightily ſurpriſed, I looked and found our Provoſt, an old Man, lying under thoſe Cheſts that were jumbled together, and cruſht to pieces with the vaſt weight of 'em. I ran up to acquaint our Maſter, who in the hurry took little notice of it, only order'd ſome of the Men to throw him over-board, which was immediately done, without any formalities, or ſo much as a Plank; for we had no time to tye him to one, as it is uſual; but over they threw him, cloaths and all on.</p>
               <p>It was now the fourth night that we had been in this condition; and that we gave our ſelves for gone every moment of that time: So we were all called to Prayers, and every one got out upon Deck with much ado, and held faſt, ſome by one thing, ſome by another, to hear our Miniſter, who very earneſtly ſent up moſt devout Prayers to

Heaven, that God would in his mercy deliver us; or, if it were his good pleaſure, to receive our poor Souls unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>To thoſe who are altogether ſtrangers to the Sea, the Affliction we were in is altogether uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable; and for my own part, tho' I have been oftentimes in great dangers by Sea and by Land, and upon many occaſions have, with Courage enough, ſtood before the Enemy; yet did none of theſe dangers ever terrifie me comparably to this, where death doth not only ſeem ſure and inevitable, but comes attended with all the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour imaginable, and dreſt in its moſt hideous and terrifying ſhapes.</p>
               <p>But by how much the greater our danger was, ſo much the more admirable was the power and goodneſs of God towards us: For on the fourth day in the morning the Winds fell, the Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſerene, and the Sea calm, which reſtored us all, as it were, to life again. We then, as in du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bound, firſt fell to praiſing of God, whence our help came; and with Hymns and Pſalms to rejoyce in him for his goodneſs, and our miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deliverance.</p>
               <p>After which we went to ſet things to right about us, and to mend our tattered Ships. To this purpoſe we put all the heavy Cannon on one ſide of the Ship, to raiſe up the other, that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters might get at it to work; which they went about immediately: But the Calm did not laſt long enough for them to do half what we wanted. We had a brisk Gale, which was very fair for us, it's true; but having ſo many Leaks unſtopt, we were forced to keep our Pumps going continually. This Wind held us ſix days, during which we paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Latitude of <hi>St. Maurice,</hi> and got in ſight of <hi>St. Paul de Amſterdam;</hi> which we left about ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100310:24"/>
Miles on the right off us, and ſteer'd right up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Great <hi>Java,</hi> whereof <hi>Batavia</hi> is the chief Town. In all this time we had a great many of our Men ſick, and ſeven of them died, and were caſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
               <p>The Wind being ſo fair for us, the allowance was large, and there was no ſtint of any thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt: Yet we wiſh'd heartily to be aſhore, and the more, for the ſake of our Sick: But we want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more than a hundred Miles ſail to the place we were to go to. But by God's aſſiſtance we reach'd it, beyond our expectation; for, by Sun-ſetting, a Sailor cryed out, Land; which cauſed a ſudden joy amongſt us all; and the Maſter ſtraight preſented him a Ducat, or two Ricksdollers, two Cheeſes, and a Bottle of Canary, according to cuſtom.</p>
               <p>Upon this we fell to tricking up our ſelves, painting our Long-Boat and Shalloop, and making our Ship very fine: We faſtned our Anchors, and made all preparations to go to Shore, which was not now above forty Miles from us. By the next morning we got within two hours ſail of it; but we over-ſhot it by above thirty Miles on the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it; ſo that we were forced to tack about to the Eaſt; and after ſome days ſail we came up to ſome ſmall Iſlands that lye within five Miles of Great <hi>Java;</hi> there we caſt Anchor immediately, hawl'd out our Boat, and went on Shore, to fetch ſome Coco's, which we divided among the reſt on Ship-board. Three days after this, we came into the Road of <hi>Sunda,</hi> wherein a great many little Veſſels came to us (which they call <hi>Prawen,</hi> which ſail prodigious ſwiftly) and brought with them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of fruits, as Coco's, Piſang Figgs, which are a long kind of Figg, Eggs, and ſuch like. Laſtly, On the laſt day of <hi>November</hi> we arrived ſafely at <hi>Batavia,</hi> where we caſt Anchor before the Caſtle, having loſt thirteen of our Men, and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:100310:25"/>
about 20 ſick ſtill aboard. Here we return'd God thanks for our ſafe arrival; embraced each other heartily, and diſcharged our Cannon very briskly. After which the Maſter taking ſome company along with him, went immediately to Shore, to wait on the General, who was the <hi>Heer John Speelman,</hi> at that time Governour of all the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Fiſcal</hi> came to our Ship, to take a view of all the Men, and to demand all their Letters: After which the Men were landed, and the Ship unladen: The ſick were put into the Hoſpital, and thoſe that were in health marched in good order into the Caſtle of <hi>Batavia;</hi> where being drawn up before the Generals Apartment, he came out to them, and kindly bad them welcome; and ordered the Major to divide them amongſt the Militia; but firſt they had three days free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom given them to reſt and take their eaſe: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they were obliged to gather together every day without fail on a place appointed for them to exerciſe, until they were well vers'd in it, and made thorow-pac'd Soldiers of, and fit to be ſent on any Expedition to any part of the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For my part, I went to Shore ſeveral times, and diverted my ſelf very well, until I received an Order from the Surgeon general to take my Poſt in a ſmall Fort, about a Mile or ſomewhat leſs, from <hi>Batavia;</hi> where I found an Enſign, two Serjeants, two Gunners, to eight Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and ſixty private Soldiers. I was mighty well pleaſed with my Station here; the Place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very finely and advantageouſly ſituated, with the Sea on the one ſide, and a very pleaſant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver on the other, which came down from <hi>Batavia,</hi> upon which there were continually a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Prawen</hi> ſailing to and fro with Chineſes,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100310:25"/>
going to a certain place, about half a Mile from thence, where their <hi>Moſque</hi> is, wherein they ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice at ſeveral times in the year to their Idol, called by them <hi>Jaſgin,</hi> and by the Dutch <hi>Joſic;</hi> and there they perform all their Religious Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, which are very diverting to a ſtranger to ſee.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Batavia,</hi> the City and Caſtle are as well worth a deſcription, as they are a Man's ſight: And truly mine was raviſht with it; for I muſt confeſs, that I think them yet finer even than <hi>Amſterdam</hi> it ſelf. It is five or ſix Miles in compaſs. The River <hi>Jacatra</hi> runs thro' moſt Streets of the Town, and almoſt encompaſſes it. Upon theſe Canals the Inhabitants have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of going in Boats to their Gardens and Pleaſure-houſes: The ſides of them is wall'd up with good ſquare Stone, and all along each ſide of it, there goes a Row or two of fine Cedar, Coco, or Figg trees, where the Free-men uſe to walk at night under a moſt pleaſant Shade.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle ſtands toward the Sea. It hath four Baſtions, two of them to the Sea, called the <hi>Ruby</hi> and the <hi>Pearl;</hi> the other two to the City, which go by the name of the <hi>Saphir</hi> and the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is in the whole exact ſquare, and from top to bottom built up with excellent good ſquare Stone. On each of theſe Baſtions are ſixteen half Culverins planted: Beſides this, they are full of fine Trees, ſuch as Lemons, and Mango's, which makes them look moſt ſweetly. While I was there, there was a third Gate built to the Caſtle, which before had but two. One of the Gates looks toward the Sea, thro' which the Goods come in from the Ships into the Ware houſes, and it's call'd the Water-Gate. The other goeth
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100310:26"/>
into the City, which therefore they call the City-Gate.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the Caſtle is the Generals Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and over againſt it are the Houſes of two of the Council-men. The reſt, (which are four more) live in the City.</p>
               <p>The Government of the <hi>Indies</hi> lies upon theſe ſix Men. The General's Retinue is not very ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: He had but twelve Halbardiers, dreſt much after the manner of our Yeomen of the Guard, but in Red and Yellow. One of theſe is always to ſtand Centinel an hour before his Chamber. When he rid out, he was attended by a Troop of Cuiraſſiers, and a company of Foot-men, and ſix Halbardiers. But all this is nothing to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, which exceeds that of ſeveral Princes of Europe.</p>
               <p>There are in the Caſtle many other Inhabitants, ſome of the chief Merchants; ſome Aſſiſtants, and Book-keepers; alſo ſeveral Handycrafts men, as Gun-Smiths, Lock-Smiths, Joyners, and ſuch like, that are to be employed in any Military bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. The Soldiers have their ſtandings under the Gates, and on the Baſtions: Sometimes more, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, as they have occaſion to ſend them abroad, or call them home again. Every day about four in the afternoon, they muſt come to the Parade, and paſs by the General's houſe three times; ſometimes he comes out, and takes a view of them, to obſerve their carriage, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and to ſee whether their Arms are kept in good order.</p>
               <p>When any one neglects the Parade, he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſeverely puniſhed; for the Military Diſcipline is moſt ſtrictly kept up there. If any one ſhould chance to ſleep upon Centry; for the firſt time, his puniſhment is to be loaden with
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100310:26"/>
heavy Arms, for ſome days; the ſecond time he is whipt; and the third time it is death, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>The Caſtle is encompaſſed with very wide Grafts or Canals; over one of which there is a fine Stone-Bridge of one and twenty Arches, that goes into a large Field, which is called the <hi>Galg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veld,</hi> that is, the <hi>Gibbet-field;</hi> where Malefactors are executed. There is a Gibbet, a Wheel, and a Whipping-Poſt; all which are frequently made uſe of. Croſs this Field is another ſmaller Bridge, (where a Centry always ſtands) which leads to the chief Street of the City, which is called the <hi>Heere-ſtraet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Within the City are Shops for all kind of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and very good and reaſonable Victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſes: The Inhabitants are of all Nations, as Amboineſes, Malabarians, Mardigarians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bur the Chineſes, being the chief and greater part, I ſhall paſs by the others, and give you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them only.</p>
               <p>They exceed all the others by far, in cunning and policy; and are very good Mechanicks; and there are of them of all Trades, excepting Clock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work, or Watch-work, and they dive into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Commerce whatever.</p>
               <p>They wear moſt commonly White or Blew. Their Coats are very large, and the Sleeves ſo long, and wide, that they fall over their hands. Their Breeches likewiſe of the ſame colour, are very wide, and come down to their feet. They wear a ſort of broad Slippers, like Hungarian Shoes: But they are only made of Paſt-board; ſo that when they are to go thro' any wet or dirt, they take their Slippers in their hands; then waſh their feet at the next Canal, and wipe 'em; ſo put their Slippers on again: But in bad Weather, if they are to go thro' a great deal of dht, they wear
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:100310:27"/>
woodden Shoes, ſuch as the Country People do in <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They are very neat in their Hair, which they have trimm'd and comb'd every week by their Barbers; they do 'em up with a Bodkin, and ſtick a ſmall Tortoiſe-ſhell Comb in it behind, and ſo put a Coif over it, made of Horſe-Hair, like a Net; ſo that at the firſt, a ſtranger would take their Men for Women.</p>
               <p>Their Hair they value at the higeſt rate, ſince it is the laſt thing they will ſtake at play. They are the greateſt Gameſters that ever were known; inſomuch that they'll play away their Wives and Children, when they have loſt all their Wealth: And when their Houſes and Family are loſt, then goes the very Hair off of their heads: But if one loſes that, he loſes with it all his Credit and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and is lookt upon as a Slave, and is forced all his life long to work and ſell for other People. Their Beards are very extraordinary, both for their length, and thinneſs. I have ſeen them with only five or ſix Hairs on their chin, and thoſe hang down to their feet.</p>
               <p>Their Women are moſt of them Slaves, bought out of the Iſland <hi>Baly</hi> and <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> not very black, but of a deep tawny; ſhort and very well ſett. They may have as many of them as they are able to keep. When a Chineſe dies, his Heir ſells all his Wives away again; except that one that he loved beſt, who is by his Will made free. This makes them Gentlewomen, and their Heirs after them are likewiſe ennobled. Such as theſe are eſteemed as the right Chineſes; and they are but rare in the Country; for while I was there, there was not above twenty of them. They have none but Sons, almoſt; it is rare to ſee a Daughter in a Family. I was very curious to know whence that might proceed: But in vain did I imagine
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100310:27"/>
many things, to be the natural cauſes of it. But being intimate with one of them, the cruel and barbarous method they take was made plain to me, which is, that they deſtroy their Females; and to this purpoſe, as ſoon as their Big Bellies begin to be perceived, they keep within doors, ſo that none knows of their being delivered, unleſs they bring forth a Male. At the ſame time this diſcovery was made to me, I was entruſted with the life of the diſcoverer, and therefore I was made to promiſe all the ſecrecy imaginable. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry morning their cuſtom is, to waſh their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in the River.</p>
               <p>Their Weddings are kept openly. The Men and Women go in Proceſſion, and the Relations among them carry all their Preſents to the Young Couple, and all their Riches openly before them. Before the doors, where they are to have their Entertainment, is a fine Scaffold made up, where their Muſick ſtands, which conſiſts of ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments peculair to the Country; as the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumma,</hi> which is a kind of Drum, and a ſort of Muſick they make with little Bells, which is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enough. All the way they go, as alſo the houſe they are to come into, are ſtrowed with all ſorts of Greens and Flowers: Or ſometimes they go by Water in their <hi>Prawen,</hi> on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals that run thro' the City, with their Hair down about their Ears, or hanging down in the Water. When they are come home, the firſt thing they do, is to ſacrifice to their Idol; which is done after this manner. In a corner of the Room they have an Altar ſet out with abundance of pretty little Trinkets, upon which is an Image made of Clay, about a ſpan long. The face of it is very broad, with a large pair of Eyes; it is black, and painted with ſome round ſtreeks of Red; a vaſt large Noſe, and a long white Beard:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100310:28"/>
On the head ſtand two Horns painted, with all ſorts of Colours. This Image they call <hi>Joſgin;</hi> to this they bow, and make many ſalutations; clapping their hands altogether, begging it to keep them from all harms, and to take care that no evil may happen to them.</p>
               <p>They own that there is a powerful God, that hath made the Heavens and the Earth: But they ſay, that he is of a good nature and diſpoſition, and that there is no fear of harm from him: But that all their fear is from the Devil, whom they appeaſe by their Offerings and Prayers under the ſhape of that Image: Therefore they are very careful to pleaſe him, and will not ſail at night to light Candles made of red or yellow Wax, which they ſet before it: And there they bring Meat and Drink, and all ſorts of Fruit, which is all taken away the next day, and then it is eaten by the People of the houſe, and other freſh Meat ſet in the room of it.</p>
               <p>But to return to their Feaſts; the Men and the Women eat always apart. They take up their Meat with an Inſtrument made of two pieces of Wood, which go croſs one another, ſomething like that which the Gold-beaters uſe with us to take up their Leaves of Gold or Silver, which they uſe very dextrouſly to take up their Meat with; This ſerves them inſtead of Forks, and they keep them very neat and clean. They ſit on the ground croſs-legg'd: And if at any time they do ſit on a Chair or Stool, they ſtill ſit down with their Leggs croſs-wiſe under them, and by that means they have them ſo pliant, that they can lay them on their Polls, with as great nimbleneſs and eaſe as we can our hands.</p>
               <p>But now to make an end of the Deſcription of the City of <hi>Batavia.</hi> That is likewiſe encompaſs'd
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100310:28"/>
with a ſtrong Wall, above forty paces broad, and Earth thrown up againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Baſtions are like thoſe of the <hi>Sluys,</hi> built with large cut Stone, and all ſquare and well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Guard-houſes on all ſides of it, where the Soldiers have their Quarters, and none of them dares to be abſent one night from them, without eſpecial leave, and that is but very ſeldom grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Beſides this, there are Canals on each ſide the Wall all round. The Cannon is always ready to turn, as well upon the City it ſelf, as upon an Enemy without, in caſe of any Inſurrection or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance amongſt the Inhabitants, which are of all Nations. So that to be the better prepared, if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, every Street hath a Baſtion that commands it, from whence they could immediately cut off any Party that ſhould be made in any part of the Town againſt the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>The ſame care hath been taken, and the like proviſion made in all places in the <hi>Indies,</hi> that are in poſſeſſion of the Dutch, and they are always well provided with Europeans, Chriſtians, in the Service of the Company; and there is of courſe a conſiderable number of ſuch as are ſettled there, and are married, ſome to European, and ſome to Indian Women. And of what Nations ſoever they be, they are permitted to keep the ſame Religion, Manners and Cuſtoms, as they have in their own Country.</p>
               <p>The Magiſtrate conſiſts of perſons that are in the Service of the Company, and of Burghers, which are Free-men; made ſuch after they have ſpent that time in the Company's Service, as was agreed upon betwixt them. The Preſident is one of the Council, but cannot direct in any thing of moment without the conſent of the General.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100310:29"/>
Each of the other Nations have alſo a head and chief of their own: But when there is any thing in hand that concerns the Publick; or if they cannot agree among themſelves, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to appear before the Magiſtrate of the City, And in all things their Government is very well and prudently eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>The four chief Gates of the City are called by the names of the <hi>Utrecht,</hi> the <hi>Delft,</hi> the <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and the <hi>New-Gate,</hi> ſo called, on the out-ſides of which, are the Suburbs, which are large and ſpacious, and very fine, and inhabited moſt by Chineeſes: A vaſt number of which have been forced by the Wars they had with the Tartars to retire, and ſeek a Refuge in the <hi>Indies,</hi> over which they have ſpread themſelves: And eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in all Maritine Towns, where they are fallen into Trades and Commerce with admirable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>The River <hi>Jacatra</hi> is no ſmall Ornament as well as Advantage to <hi>Batavia;</hi> beſides which, it is beautified with abundance of very fine Orchards, Fruit-gardens, and Pleaſure-houſes, which are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neatly contrived and kept. There is but very little Rice all about it; tho' it is their ſtaff of life. And, as in all the other parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> the only thing that ſerves inſtead of Bread; but yet there is never any want of it, it being always brought in great quantities, and the City ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently furniſh'd with it from <hi>Bantam, Japara,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Rivers thereabouts are much peſtered with Crocodiles. While I was there, as we uſed to go a walking in the Evenings, we obſerved one of them for ſeveral nights that uſed to run out of the hedge into the River, as ſoon as it ſpied or
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100310:29"/>
heard us coming towards him: Upon which a deſire took us to try to catch him if we could; which we did in this manner.</p>
               <p>We took a long Rope, to which we faſtened a ſtrong double Hook, full of beards: And inſtead of arming it with Wires, we did it with Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thread; which being looſe about it, gets in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween its Teeth, and hinders him from ſnapping the Hook off: This done, we tyed a Dog to this, with the Hook under his belly: And ſetting him upon a Board, thruſt him out into the River, and faſten'd the Cord to a Tree: Quickly after, the Dog fell a barking and howling, and the Croco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dil did not fail to come to him; and very gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſwallowed him in: Upon which the Hook ſtruck into his Throat, and had him faſt. We had ſo good ſucceſs with this, that we afterwards caught a great many of them. The biggeſt we caught was twenty ſeven foot long; and when we opened it, we found two <hi>Steen-Bockiens,</hi> and the head of a black Boy in his belly. We were forced to knock him on the head with great Iron Bars, after we had fired ſeveral Muskets upon him to little purpoſe. When the Soldiers kill one of theſe Creatures, they get ſome Blacks to carry it for 'em to the General; who immediately gives them ſix Ducatoons, for their pains. The only advantage I ſought for, was to have ſome of their Fat, it being very good for ſeveral operations in Phyſick and Surgery.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants uſe to catch them with Nets; which is very dangerous, as I my ſelf have ſeen; at <hi>Bantam,</hi> on ſuch an occaſion, a Crocodil bit off both the Leggs of a Javan; yet do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue that way ſtill, and go often to catch them in that manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100310:30"/>
Beſides theſe Crocodils, there are abundance of other ſorts of Wild Beaſts in the ſaid Iſland of <hi>Japatra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fort where I was order'd to be at my firſt coming, was very near to the Foreſt, and juſt in the way to it, from <hi>Batavia;</hi> ſo that the Hunts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men coming by us, I often went out with them, and ſaw them catch moſt ſorts of thoſe Wild Creatures that the Country affords, It will not be amiſs to give the Reader an account of ſome of 'em; and firſt of a ſad accident that befell the Hunts-men one day.</p>
               <p>We had two Hunts-men that were made free by the General, and had the liberty to go abroad for that purpoſe, to catch what they could. Theſe being gone one day to get ſome game for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; which was commonly Wild Pigeons, and other ſorts of Wild Fowl, and Wild Boars, and a ſort of Creature they call <hi>Steen-Bockiens,</hi> which is made much like a Hare, and differs only in that it hath ſmall Horns, and the Meat of 'em is far more delicate; while they were only prepared for the purſuit of things of this kind, and ſat down to reſt under a Tree, a Tyger fell in a moſt furious manner upon them. They were pretty much uſed to be followed by them; but they uſed to be in ſuch readineſs to receive them, that they were the death of them whenever they did but offer to come near them.</p>
               <p>But being now ſurpriſed by this more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary fierce Creature, coming of a ſudden upon them: It was as much as the one could do to lay hold of his Fowling-piece, while the other had nothing to defend himſelf with, but his lighted Match in his hand; which he ſhook about, but to no purpoſe: The other had no ſooner got his Gun, but in a hurry he fires upon him; but not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good aim, did not do any execution, but what
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100310:30"/>
ſerved to enrage him the more; him the Tyger throws down under him; and ſeizing the other by the hand, bit off three of his Fingers; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, he luckily ſeizing his Gun, fired it, and by good providence laid the Tyger flat on the ground. Upon this he bethought himſelf of what he might do for his beſt ſecurity, for the night coming upon him, the danger increaſed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that he was now alone, for his Companion was by this time expired, being miſerably torn. He took up the Corps, leſt it ſhould become a prey to the reſt of them; and climbing into a Tree, drew him up with him: There he remained in great fear and exceſſive pain cauſed by his wound. When he had been there a while, there came a couple of Wild Boars, which he could not ſee: But he heard them ſcratch and tear at the bottom of the Tree, which they did the more furiouſly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the blood of his dead Companion was ſpilt about the place; ſo he ſhot upon them at random, and hit one of them, ſo that he fell dead ſome few paces from thence.</p>
               <p>The day being come, and the Coaſt clear, he gets down, and leaving his dead Companion upon the Tree, the Tyger and the Wild Boar on the ground, comes forthwith to our Fort to me, to have his hand dreſt: Which being done, he gave us the account of this Adventure. Our Enſign went to acquaint the Major General with it, upon which Orders were given immediately to a Serjeant, to go with ſix Soldiers, and ſix <hi>Negro</hi> Slaves, with a Bier to the place where this Slaughter was, and the wounded Hunts-man went with 'em, to ſhew them the place. There they found all according to the Information he had given. The Man was brought to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and decently buried in the <hi>Malaiſh</hi> Church-Yard; and he that was come off, had for a Reward twelve Gilders given him,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100310:31"/>
and a ſettled Table for his life, beſides his former Pay, and withal a Corporal's place.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide of the Fort, is almoſt all Woods, which are cut down every other Year by the Soldiers. Theſe Woods harbour vaſt numbers of Monkeys, which make there ſuch a ſtrange noiſe, that one would be amazed to hear it. We made it almoſt our daily diverſion to go a Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after them; and we uſed to catch ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of them, that a Man might have one of them for a Pipe of Tobacco. They are a very docile ſort of Monkeys, and not in the leaſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to thoſe that are brought out of <hi>Africa</hi> and <hi>America</hi> for playing of Tricks; but they come but ſeldom over hither, being very tender, and not able to bear the change of Climates, nor the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of ſo long a Voyage: For at my return I took a couple of them with me, but as ſoon as ever we came on this ſide the Tropick, where we begun to feel a change of Air, they were ſeized with the Bloody-Flux, fell lame, and died.</p>
               <p>One way to catch them was, by taking of Coco-Nuts, which are very plentiful there; and making a ſmall hole in 'em, juſt big enough for 'em to force their Paws into; we hung them up all about the Trees where they came. As ſoon as they eſpyed the hole, they wanting to get at the Kernel, would ſtrive hard but they would get their Paws in: And when they go to take them out again, they have not the ſenſe to ſqueeze their Claws together to ſlip their Paws out, as they had to get them in: Beſides that, the ſurprize which the perſon cauſes, who watches them, makes them leſs able to rid themſelves of their Manacles; and as they went to run down, they fall with the very weight of the Nut, which is it may be five or ſix pound weight. But this way there was no hopes of catching any more than one at
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100310:31"/>
one time; for when the others ſee one of their company thus caught by the Legg, they won't come near the Coco-Nuts all that day.</p>
               <p>I went out once for a fancy after them with a Fowling-piece, but I found it impracticable; for after I had ſpied one of them, and got my Shoes and Stockings off, becauſe the place was a kind of a Mooriſh ground; but he had his Eye upon me too, and led me ſuch a dance, that I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtuck in the Slough, for want of minding my way: And ſince that time, I never went after them again; for they are ſo ſhy, that it is almoſt always labour loſt. And if one doth happen to ſhoot one of them, if he doth not kill him dead upon the ſpot, they'll run and ſtop up their wounds with graſs, and ſo get ſar enough from you, tho' they drop in the long run, and go and die in ſome hole where you cannot get at 'em.</p>
               <p>My chief Recreation was to take a walk to the City, which was a moſt delicious walk indeed, all along ſhaded with fine large Coco-trees. Sometimes I took a Boat, and went to the Fort <hi>Jacatra;</hi> where lay a whole Company of Soldiers, of the number of which our Men was a ſort of a Detatchment: It lies about two Miles more to the South, and is the chief Paſs into the whole Country of <hi>Java,</hi> in the direct way to <hi>Japara</hi> and <hi>Kartiri.</hi> Near this Fort flows the famous River <hi>Jacatra</hi> (from which the Fort had its name) which thence running thro' <hi>Batavia,</hi> empties it ſelf into the Sea about half a Mile below it. There are by the Fort three Powder-Mills upon that River, which I uſed to walk to frequently, being very well worth ones ſight for their largeneſs and ingenious contrivance.</p>
               <p>The outward parts of this Country, and that for a conſiderable way within too, are very well cultivated, and richly ſet out with abundance of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100310:32"/>
fine noble Gardens, which produce all manner of fruits, for refreſhment and for ſuſtenance. There are of all ſorts of Figg-Trees; ſome of which are the moſt delicious fruit that ever was taſted: So that with its lofty Cedars, which over-top the fruit-bearing Trees, and look ſo ſweet and green, and what with their more uſeful Coco-Trees, and other fruit-trees, which are always verdant, and afford a cool retreat, and pleaſant ſhade; beſides that their fruits are all of them moſt delicious, I think truly, it may be called an Earthly Paradice, and that no Country in the World can out-do it for gratifying the Eye and taſte.</p>
               <p>But of all the fruits that the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce (now I am about 'em) I think it will not be amiſs to give you a deſcription of three of the chiefeſt of them.</p>
               <p>That which deſerves the firſt place amongſt them, is the fruit which they call the <hi>Manges Tanges;</hi> of the bigneſs of a common Apple; the ſhell is of a dark brown colour, in which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained four Kernels, of a fleſh colour, ſticking to each other, which melt like Butter upon the Tongue, and of ſo fine and refreſhing a taſte, that I never met with any fruit comparable to it, in any other part of the World. It is generally ſerved up at the greateſt Tables, as the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Diſh that can be made; dreſt with Sugar, Spice and Sack, and put into fine China Diſhes. It is alſo a moſt pleaſant and infallible Remedy againſt the Bloody-Flux, when boiled in Water. The Tree that bears this, is about the bigneſs of a Mulberry-Tree, and very flow of propagation: For when you have planted it, you muſt never expect to ſee it bear; and if it doth chance to bear any fruit within the life of him that planted
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100310:32"/>
it, it comes to nothing; but withers away: But then there ſhoots out a little ſhoot, which you take and plant very carefully, and that becomes your Stock.</p>
               <p>The next to this is the Coco-Nut. The Tree is all ſmooth and even from the bottom to the very top; where the Leaves ſpread themſelves all in a fuff, and the Nutts under them, twenty or thirty on a Tree. The Country people have a pretty Art of Tapping theſe Trees, with long <hi>Bamboe</hi> Canes, that will hold two or three quarts, or more, which they very artfully ſtick into the Tree, and let them fill themſelves with the Juice: When they are fill'd, they put it into Veſſels to keep, or elſe they go away with it to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and ſell it freſh there, as it comes from the Tree. This they call <hi>Suri,</hi> which is to be ſold at the <hi>Suri-houſes,</hi> and is a very pretty refreſhing Liquor, and extream pleaſant; eſpecially when the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is very hot. With this Liquor they make the beſt Vinegar, and their <hi>Arack</hi> or Brandy, which goes far beyond our beſt Rheniſh Wine for ſtrength, taſte and colour: And mixing it with Water and Wine, with Sugar and Lemon-Juice, it makes an excellent ſort of Limonade, which they call Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack and Burabols, but ſufficiently known in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh by the name of Punch.</p>
               <p>The Leaves of this Tree ſerve the Inhabitants for a common covering for their Houſes, and keep them as dry as our Tiles. The ſtalks of them they bind together, to make Brooms; and they uſe hardly any thing elſe throughout all <hi>India.</hi> The outward Coat of the Nutt is good to make Match, which burns better than that we uſe in Europe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Sap ſerves for Oyl to burn. The Kernel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſt, yields a Milk, of which they make a very pretty kind of Cheeſes; and it is good for ſeveral other uſes, as our Milk is. The Shell is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100310:33"/>
good to make Cups, Spoons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It would be too tedious to relate the many uſes every part of this Tree is good for: Beſides that, it hath in a great meaſure been done already by other hands.</p>
               <p>The third fruit I was to mention, is the Biſſang-Figgs, which is mighty common amongſt them; and ſo cheap, that when a Ship comes out of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, it is the firſt fruit that is brought to 'em, and you buy it for a trifle; notwithſtanding it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent; it is in ſhape pretty much like our Pine-Apples. The Tree is ſomewhat like our Elder-Tree; and bears all the year in abundance. The Leaves are ſo large, that one of them will ſhelter a Man from the Sun and Rain, being about two Cubits in length, and one or more in breadth: Which makes ſome people apt to believe they were the Leaves which <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> made their Aprons of, after the Fall. They are likewiſe made uſe of inſtead of Paper to pack up goods.</p>
               <p>Theſe I have only taken notice of, as being the moſt conſiderable fruits of the <hi>Indies,</hi> and muſt paſs by ſeveral others, which might be worth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, both for their excellency and variety, that I may not be too tedious.</p>

An exact account of that Expedition from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it to the end of it, which proves very advantageous to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving been now four months in this little Fort, an Order came to me to remove from this place, to take the care of the Men that lay ſick in the City, and the Hoſpital, which was very welcome to me; not but that the Poſt I was in was profitable enough, and very genteel, and the place extraordinary plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly ſcituated: But it being a token of the reſpect the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company had for me, and withal more advantageous, I accepted of the Invitation with much ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>About a Fortnight after there came a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Order for all that were in the Company's
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100310:34"/>
Service, to make their <hi>Rendezvous</hi> in the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution-field; ſo that you might ſee there all their Forces drawn up together; excepting thoſe only, that were abſolutely neceſſary to ſtand Centinels at the Gates and Redoubts. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a finer ſight of that kind could no where be ſeen; for there were ſome thouſands of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, which were all very luſty, tall, proper, well-choſen Men; and almoſt as many of other different Nations; as <hi>Amboineeſes, Malabars, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, Mardikers</hi> and <hi>Balingers.</hi> Theſe were all mixt into ſeveral Companies, which had their own reſpective Officers; and after they had all paſs'd Muſter, they took the Oath of Fidelity in the preſence of the General, and the Council. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the General made a very Eloquent Speech to 'em, in order to encourage them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly to prepare themſelves for the Action, which was then in hand; and to make his Speech more truly Rhetorical and perſwading, he gave to every Man a month's pay <hi>gratis.</hi> Then one half of theſe Men were order'd to march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to <hi>Dangerang,</hi> which is a Paſs to it, which they found very well fortified. The other half march'd thro' the Caſtle to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Gate, whence they were carried off in little Praw's, or ſmall Boats, on Board the Men of War, that lay in the Road, about half a League from thence, and ſo they were immediately embarkt. And the Wind blowing then juſt full Eaſt, as fair as they could have wiſh'd, they ſtraight weighed Anchor, and ſteered directly to the Royal City of <hi>Bantam.</hi> But</p>
               <p>It will be proper to give you ſome account of that place, before I go any further, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with the cauſes and motives of this Undertaking.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:100310:34"/>
Firſt, Then you muſt know, that this large Kingdom of <hi>Bantam,</hi> being in it ſelf of great ſtrength, hath of late much improved it ſelf, by the numbers of Foreigners that are come thither from all Nations; and among them conſiderable numbers too of Engliſh, Danes, Spaniards, Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes and Dutch, which hath made it a very troubleſome and dangerous Neighbour to the Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company; inſomuch that their Ships that came from <hi>Europe,</hi> or any other places thither, did not dare to come by the Road of <hi>Bantam;</hi> but were forced to take a vaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of three or four hundred Miles; keeping to the Northward.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> had made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Attempts upon <hi>Batavia,</hi> both by Sea and Land. Tho' he was always forced to retire with great loſs, and without doing us any great damage. But tho' he could not accompliſh his deſire, and the Company could not fear a total overthrow; yet they were ſtill apprehenſive, that he being ſo much more powerful than they were, would prove very fatal to them in the end, and by little and little bring his deſigns to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Thus they were always very uneaſie, by reaſon of their troubleſome Neighbour: But not finding themſelves able to declare open War againſt him, they endeavoured to gain him by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and a ſpecious ſhew of Friendſhip. Theſe means did not prove altogether unſucceſsful, but they were never at good underſtanding with each other long together. For the King of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> beſides that he was very fickle and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in his Nature, having ſo many Foreigners about him, who were no Friends to the Dutch
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100310:35"/>
Intereſt, he was eaſily perſwaded by them, to break Friendſhip with the Dutch upon the leaſt occaſion. And this the Engliſh and Danes were the chief Inſtruments of, who made there a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Body, were rich, and enioyed great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and a moſt flouriſhing Trade; ſo that they with eaſe ſet the King upon us, in hopes of rooting the Dutch out of their holds.</p>
               <p>The Dutch therefore were always forced to be upon their Guard; even while there was the greateſt appearance of a ſettled Friendſhip; for they were ſufficiently informed, that he was always contriving how he might at once fall foul on them, and drive them out of <hi>Batavia:</hi> Upon which, they on the other ſide, reſolved to countermine his deſigns, and thought it the beſt Expedient to divert him from that Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, by finding him ſome Employment with ſome other Neighbours; and accordingly made it their buſineſs to create an ill underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and the King of <hi>Japara,</hi> hoping that the ſilent Fire might in time break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an open Flame. This they effected at length; but it proved little or no advantage to them; for they lay ſo far aſunder, that it never came but to a few little Skirmiſhes; which did not damage him much, nor profit them: So that they fell very ſhort of what they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed themſelves; for they were fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Emperour of <hi>Japara</hi> would have ſoon been induced to purſue the King of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> with the utmoſt vigour; eſpecially, when there was ſo great a motive to ſpur him on, as the rejoyning of that Kingdom to his Empire, from which it had been divided. The Iſland of Great <hi>Java,</hi> of which I have already made
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100310:35"/>
mention, did likewiſe belong to him once, and altogether made but one Empire, under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Great <hi>Mataran,</hi> but now it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three Kingdoms, to wit, <hi>Japard, Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi> and <hi>Jacatra,</hi> or <hi>Kartiri;</hi> of which <hi>(i. e. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catra)</hi> the preſent <hi>Batavia</hi> is a part, and did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore belong to the King of <hi>Jacatra;</hi> from whom the <hi>Portugueezes</hi> took it. After that, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> got it from them: And laſtly the <hi>Dutch</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Dutch,</hi> having all this while made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Attempts upon the King of <hi>Jacatra,</hi> which had proved very advantageous to them; they at length ſubdued him: Having firſt made the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour of <hi>Japara</hi> unable to reſiſt them, or to ſtand up in the defence of his Neighbour; over whom they carried a total Victory a little before I came to <hi>Batavia.</hi> And having all this while received freſh ſupplies yearly from <hi>Holland,</hi> which, together with <hi>Germany,</hi> enjoyed a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Peace, and therefore could, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly furniſh them with large Recruits of choice good Soldiers: The <hi>Duth Eaſt-India</hi> Company thought they might be able to cope with <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> and accordingly made preparations againſt it.</p>
               <p>Now while theſe things were in agitation, and they big with the deſign and hopes of infallible ſucceſs, the faireſt opportunity, that could be wiſh'd for, offered it ſelf to them unexpected, and therefore ſo much the more welcome, which was a ſudden falling out between the old, and the two young Kings of <hi>Bantam.</hi> The occaſion whereof was this: The old King being weary with the Burden of the Government, and deſirous
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100310:36"/>
to ſpend his remaining days in eaſe and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, made over his Kingdom to his younger Son; the eldeſt having dedicated himſelf to a ſpiritual life, was a <hi>Bangerang Babay,</hi> ſomething like an Archbiſhop with us; and having thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted his younger Son with the Regal Power, he retired to an Old Caſtle called <hi>Dortjaſſe,</hi> the old place of his reſidence, about four Miles from <hi>Bantam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The young King having Reigned ſome years, his People began to grow weary of him, ſpecially the Nobles, the <hi>Bourgerang</hi> and <hi>Kirria;</hi> and they made their Complaints to the old King, that he oppreſſed his Subjects; and that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden'd them with his Recreations, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Hunting; and by his requiring ſo much At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and Service to be done him; ſo that they were no longer able to bear the Yoke. He did not Govern as other Heathen Kings uſe for the moſt part to do, but after the Model he had taken from the European Countries; ſome of which he had been in, as <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and would have gone to <hi>France, England, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> if his Law had permitted him; and as far as that had given him leave he had Travelled, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Muſcovy, Schiras, Iſpahan, Japan, Siam;</hi> from which ſeveral places he had taken thoſe Methods of Government, which he thought moſt convenient to introduce into his own Dominions. But his Subjects being diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with theſe Innovations, conſpired at laſt together, and Depoſed him; and ſet his Brother the <hi>Bangarang Babay</hi> in his ſtead.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Old King came with a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Retinue, and his Main Guard, before the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100310:36"/>
Caſtle; which is in the middle of <hi>Bantam.</hi> The young King, having notice of this, commanded the Gates to be ſhut againſt him, and ſent to know what he wanted. The old King ſent him an Anſwer, which did not pleaſe him: Upon which, without more ado, he gives Orders to Fire the Great Guns from the Caſtle upon the City, and particularly, that ſome of them ſhould play upon his Fathers Quarters; againſt which ſixteen Pieces of Demi-Cannon were planted, which were fired briskly upon him by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Orders, and ſome of them too by his own hand.</p>
               <p>Being thus ſatisfied, that his Fathers Intentions were to Depoſe him, he wholly forgot all Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſent him word by one of his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, that he did not reckon himſelf now bound to him in any Bond of Duty; and that he would pay him no other Homage, but Powder and Ball, which he would not ſpare, for he had enough of it, and that ſhould be at his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Beſides the Meſſage that had made him ſo deſperate, he relied much upon the ſtrength of the Caſtle, which was very well fortified with very good Walls, lined with Earth, like thoſe of <hi>Batavia,</hi> and very ſtrong Baſtions upon them, beſides very large Canals round them, with Draw-Bridges. Neither did he want Proviſions or Ammunitions; and the Baſtions were provided with very good heavy Cannon. But the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his Men was not above three hundred; yet with them he had reſolved to ſtand it out to the laſt. So that his Garriſon was not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable as his Court, which, as it chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of Women, according to the general Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of Heathen Princes; ſo he had of them
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100310:37"/>
no leſs than one thouſand two hundred that were his Concubines.</p>
               <p>With this continual Firing, the City was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ſhatter'd, and lookt like a Wilderneſs; for every Man had got away that could, and all the Engliſh and Danes, together with the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the moſt conſiderable Inhabitants, went over to the old King. And having formed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Body, they went and beſieged the Caſtle; raiſed ſeveral Batteries, and planted their beſt Cannon upon them; and then fired briskly in their turn upon the Caſtle. Notwithſtanding all theſe preparations, the young King remained undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and only applied himſelf to get ſupplies and ſupport abroad; and by Advice of two Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were of his Party, and who had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly run away from <hi>Batavia,</hi> to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from Juſtice, he reſolves to ſend to the Company of <hi>Batavia,</hi> for Aſſiſtance. One of theſe Dutch-men was appointed for the Negotiation; and immediately was let down from the Wall of the Caſtle; and having paſs'd the Canals in a little Boat, that uſed to lye there, he came to the Enemies Army, thro' which he was unavoidably to paſs; but he being very ready in the <hi>Javan</hi> and <hi>Malleiſh</hi> Languages, having been fifteen years in thoſe Countries, and having been Circumciſed at his Abjuration of the Chriſtian Religion, he eaſily paſs'd thro' all difficulties, and came to the General at <hi>Batavia;</hi> and by word of mouth, without any further Credentials, delivered his Meſſage to him in the young King's name.</p>
               <p>This was an opportunity which the Dutch had long wiſh'd for; ſo that the Meſſenger needed no great Rhetorick or Art to induce them to take
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:100310:37"/>
it by the forelock. But immediately Orders were diſpatched; and the Forces had their Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous appointed. I my ſelf had Orders to attend the Major General <hi>St. Martini</hi>'s own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and was in the whole Expedition, ſo that I may juſtly ſpeak of the matter, and be the more particular in the relation of it.</p>
               <p>The Major General above mentioned, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the whole Fleet; and one Captain <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> of <hi>Caſſel</hi> had the whole command of the Land-Forces. Both ſet out at one time, as I ſaid before; the one march'd out ſtraight upon <hi>Dangerang.</hi> The Fleet went directly to <hi>Bantam.</hi> Captain <hi>Hartzing</hi> was forced firſt to Attack <hi>Dangerang;</hi> by which means he reckon'd he ſhould have drawn off the old King and his Army from <hi>Bantam;</hi> but found himſelf very much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken: For the place made ſuch a vigorous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, that it appeared they neither wanted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Aſſiſtance, nor Courage. We loſt there a great many of our beſt Men, inſomuch that we found our ſelves forced to Intrench, left they ſhould have routed us quite; ſo we made our Lines of Approach, which we fortified with as good Palliſado's as we could, and ſo ſecured our ſelves, that the Enemy could not come at us.</p>
               <p>In the mean while we continued our Approaches with all the diligence that might be, till we came within Musket-ſhot of the Fort. There we made uſe of a cover'd way, with which we came up cloſe to the Enemies works, and in ſome meaſure within them: And having finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Mines, we ſet them on fire, with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100310:38"/>
that as ſoon as they ſhould blow up to any purpoſe, we would aſſault them. One of our Mines made a breach that three or four Waggons might ſtand abreaſt in. Upon which it was order'd we ſhould immediately enter: And ſo we did, but ſo with much ado, that we had reaſon to fear, we muſt have retired; but after a little reſiſtance, they ſeeing us pour in ſo thick upon them, took their heels, and moſt of them threw down their Arms. All this while we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, and made the moſt heavy ſlaughter amongſt them that ever any Hiſtory can ſhew. For, the Gates of their Caſtle, or rather their Doors being ſo little, that one could not go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them without ſtooping; they were all forced, almoſt, to creep thro' them one by one; and as they were all in a cluſter, and unarm'd, to the number of near five thouſand, we fired continually upon them, ſo that they lay like heaps of Stones one on another, which made the moſt diſmal fight in the World: And to prevent the Air being infected with them, we made our Blacks to carry them off, and throw them in the River <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerang.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having gotten this Poſt, we fortified our ſelves in the beſt manner we could; for we were ſure that we ſhould not enjoy our reſt there long; and that we were to be upon our Guard.</p>
               <p>In this ſix weeks time that we had beſieged this place, we had loſt a great many Men, and a great many were fallen ſick by reaſon of the bad Water, which had much of the taſt of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> in it; which made Captain <hi>Hartzing</hi> at a ſtand, whether we ſhould go on or not. At laſt he thought it beſt for us to ſtay there, till we could
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:100310:38"/>
hear of the ſafe Arrival and Landing of our Fleet before <hi>Bantam,</hi> which we did in a few days after.</p>
               <p>Major General <hi>St. Martini</hi> being come before <hi>Bantam</hi> with twenty ſtout Men of War, each of which carried between four and five hundred Men, beſides a hundred Fire-ſhips, Tenders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> gave Orders for their Landing about two a Clock the next Morning: But firſt he took a general Review of the Men, and a Gill of Brandy was given to every one of the Soldiers; and after that ſix and thirty of the luſtieſt Soldiers were provided with a good quantity of Powder; and ſome hundreds of Sea-men were ſet out with Pole-Axes, or Hatchets, and eight or nine Hand-Granado's to each Man; all which were to Land with the Army.</p>
               <p>We lay within Cannot-ſhot of the Town, and we could both hear, and ſee, the old King, who kept continually firing upon the Caſtle; and he had raiſed his Batteries above the tops of the houſes that were in the City, ſo that the Enemy might ſee us with eaſe; ſo they immediately prepared to prevent our Landing, and for that purpoſe order'd the Main Body to march to the Sea-ſhore; and there raiſed Batteries to hinder our coming any nearer. In the mean while it was not a little ſatisfaction to the young King, to ſee our Fleet ſo near at hand, as well as to hear of our Forces by Land. And beſides, it gave him ſome time to take breath, and freed him from the danger he was in continually of a Storm, for the Walls being almoſt all down. But now the Enemy could not go on with that Deſign, having enough to do to look after us. They took moſt care of a certain place, where they thought we deſigned to Land, as indeed we did: But in the night
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:100310:39"/>
time we weighed Anchor, with all the ſtilneſs that might be, and ſaild on about a League higher; and drawing as near to the Shore as we could poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, we let fall our Anchors again. Our Cannon on Board was all loaden, and all things were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd ſo, that where-ever we Landed, we might fire them upon the Enemy, and upon the City. The Tenders, and other ſmall Veſſels were all Mann'd immediately for Landing; ſome with a hundred Men, ſome more, ſome leſs; all which went with all ſpeed to Shore. The Enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving notice of this, were ready as ſoon as we, but had not time to raiſe any Batteries there againſt us, or to fortifie themſelves; for 'ere the day begun to peep, we had got all things ready for our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>Major General <hi>St. Martini,</hi> with his Life-guard, which conſiſted of ſixty Men, and the Surgeons, came into my <hi>Schappon,</hi> and ſtood ready to give Order for the Signal, by Drums and Trumpets, for the whole Body of our Army to Land all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: But the Enemy made a very vigorous Defence; and being advantageouſly Poſted in a Wood that was there, they charged us after ſo terrible a manner, that what with their Fire, and what with our Great Guns, that played all this while croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon the City, there was need of more than ordinary Courage to ſtand it out: Beſides that, we all this while being ſtill up to the knees in Water, had a very great diſadvantage.</p>
               <p>In this condition we Charged them for three hours, and could not come to Land all that while; at laſt five of our Companies were quite routed, and of the twelve Surgeons that we brought with us, there were but five left; and we that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, were not able to do any great feats, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we all this while ſtood in the Water. When we ſaw that we could not get any ground,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100310:39"/>
we got ſome ſmall Veſſels, which fetch'd us ſome Haubitzes, (which is a kind of Field-Piece to load with ſmall Shot,) with which we rattled ſo upon the Javans, that we obliged them to give ground enough for us to get on upon dry Land; and at laſt we forced them to quit the Wood, and to to retire to their Breaſt-works; ſo we remained Maſters of the Field that night: And the next morning at break of day, we marched to Attack them in their Intrenchments.</p>
               <p>The Major General, conſidering that the Dutch Companies were mightily weakned, commanded Captain <hi>Jochem,</hi> who led the Blacks, to march in the Front; and he ſell upon them ſtraightway with admirable Courage and Conduct. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General behaved himſelf like a true Soldier, and gave ſuch tokens of his Invincible Valour, Wiſe Conduct, and Indefatigable Diligence, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be well deſcribed. And tho' he had the miſ-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to have two of his Fingers ſhot off from his right hand, as he was Riding to and fro to give Orders, he could hardly afford himſelf time to have his hand dreſt; and I had no ſooner done, but he ſtraight mounted again.</p>
               <p>The beſt of this Engagement was, that moſt of the Enemies Bullets flew over our heads. But I found that they did not all of them take the ſame courſe, and was a little ſurprized, when talking with the Sergeant of our Company, and jeering them for not being good Marks-men, a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let came and laid him dead at my foot.</p>
               <p>In the mean while our Men made but little on't: And the Captain was not able to do any thing more, than juſt to keep his ground againſt the Enemy. Wherefore the Major General, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given ſome new Orders, and briskly encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the Soldiers, by telling them, that the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemy out of that place, would be the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:100310:40"/>
chief part of their work, and the ſure fore-runner of a total Victory, promiſing to the three firſt that ſhould break into the Enemies Camp, an hundred Gilders, two Slaves, and a Pipe of Sack for a Reward; and having by ſuch like Speeches and Promiſes, infuſed, as it were, new Spirits into them, he took upon him the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Front himſelf, and drawing out Captain <hi>Bleutner</hi> and Captain <hi>Winkler</hi>'s Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, together with ſome others, he led them in Perſon; fell upon the Enemy with ſuch fury, that we ſoon carried the day; for he had ſo animated the Soldiers, that every Man was worth two. Our Men being now come too near to uſe their Muskets, took their Cutlaces in one hand, and their Hand Granado's in the other; and when the Blacks ſaw the Dutch drive ſo hard upon the Enemy, they took ſuch heart too, that with their Sword and Buckler they poured in upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and drove all before them: So that the Slaughter we made of the King's Army in this place, was nothing leſs than that of <hi>Dangerang.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Enemy was wholly put to flight, and left moſt of their Arms behind them. And we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained that Poſt, the Admirable gave Orders that the Ships ſhould no longer Fire upon the City, leſt we our ſelves might receive ſome of their Shot amongſt us.</p>
               <p>All this while we puſh'd on forward to their Palliſado's, and came to the Forr which they called <hi>Speelwick,</hi> where we found a great many of the King's Men; but yet moſt of our Officers found that we ſhould quickly become Maſters of it. We ſent for ſome heavy Cannon from our Ships, and batter'd it down in a very little time. The Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men forced open the Gate with Hammers and Axes, and ſo enter'd, throwing of Granado's: But all the Javaus being fled, we became Maſters of it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further oppoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:100310:40"/>
This ſerved our purpoſe mighty well, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us the trouble of any further Entrenchments, except a few Gaps that we made up with Wood, which our Blacks cut down and brought to us.</p>
               <p>Here we took a little breath, and reſted that night, and the following day; and a portion of Biſcuit, Sack, and Brandy, was diſtributed to each Soldier in the Army. After this fine Refreſhment, the Army was put into a new Order, and the Right and Left Wings formed anew, and provided with Field Pieces, loaden with ſmall Shot. Then we march'd againſt the Enemy, who lookt at firſt as if they were able to have eaten us all up for a Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, they being above thirty thouſand of them. But our Officers were not in the leaſt diſmayed at their numbers, but very couragiouſly Attack'd them on the two ſides of 'em; yet taking ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that we could joyn together again at any time. I muſt own, I never expected the Dutch ſhould have eſcaped a total overthrow, conſidering the vaſt diſproportion of Men; and while I was in this contemplation, on a ſudden the Javans ſallied out upon us with ſuch a terrible and horrid Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry, as their Cuſtom is, that one would have thought it had been a Hurricane, rather than a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Men: But for all that our Men ſtood their ground bravely, and gave Fire continually upon them. We had ſo order'd our Army, that behind each Rank of Muſquetiers we had a Rank of Pikes, leſt they ſhould break in upon us: And all the while we played ſo thick upon them, with ten or twelve Field-Pieces, that they fell like Bees before us. Our other Wing obſerved the ſame Order; and we at laſt joyned together again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body. Having ſuſtained this for near 3hours they ſent ſome of their <hi>Muck Speelers</hi> amongſt us, which are a ſort of giddy, reſolute Fellows, that are ready to be hired upon any kind of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100310:41"/>
Exploit, how raſh and miſchievous ſoever it be; be it to ſtabb a Man for any private Affront, or any thing elſe of that kind: And the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Cut-throats they be, the more they value themſelves on their Reputation of being ſuch. Before they go upon any ſuch ſort of undertaking, they eat of a ſort of Herb which they call <hi>Avion,</hi> which for a time makes them giddy, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſenſible of any danger; ſo that they are as fool-hardy, as they are dangerous. They rnſht in upon us with an incredible Fury, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable of conſulting their own ſafety, they came running head-long againſt our Men, and ſpitted themſelves upon our Pikes, and deſtroyed themſelves without doing us any hurt. And in a little time after, having killed ſeveral thouſands of the King's Party, we utterly routed them, and made them leave all their Arms behind them. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we fell from fighting to plundering.</p>
               <p>After this, the Major General went, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with his Life-guard, and others, to the Caſtle, where the young King was; who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon his approach, opened the Gates, came to meet him, and with all the humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment fell down at his feet, and afterward em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, with all the demonſtration of a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſincere Affection.</p>
               <p>Before this, the Admiral had given Orders for the Army to Encamp all round the Caſtle, and the Gunners to be ready in their Poſts with the Artillery, which conſiſted of above three hundred Pieces of Cannon.</p>
               <p>After this the Army having had 3 days reſt, and all the refreſhment that might be, was order'd to march into the City, and there they had the chief Poſts in their hands, as the <hi>Boom,</hi> the <hi>Speelwick,</hi> and other Baſtions, and the reſt were quartered
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100310:41"/>
in the Engliſh, Daniſh, and French Quarters. Some were order'd likewiſe to keep Garriſon in the Caſtle; ſo that all places of conſequence were ſufficiently ſecured, in order to make the whole our own, when time ſhould ſerve a little more commodiouſly.</p>
               <p>Here I received Orders to repair to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, where I had five Surgeons under me. But there being ſo many ſick and wounded, that we could not well look after them; the beſt part of them we ſent to <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The old King, after this Overthrow, retired with his ſhatter'd Army, to his 'Fort <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> where having made ready ſome hundreds of Prawen, and ſmall Veſſels, he reſolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged on us: And having the conveniency of the two Rivers, <hi>Dorjaſſe</hi> and <hi>Bantam,</hi> which run from that Fort into the Sea; he Mann'd them in order to go as far as <hi>Batavia,</hi> and to do us ſome miſchief, which accordingly he did. For being come into the Road of <hi>Batavia,</hi> they ſet fire on ſome of our Ships; and either kill'd the Men, or took them Priſoners, and went on Shore on the little Iſland call'd <hi>Onruſt,</hi> and made ſad Havock of the few Inhabitants that were there. To prevent their doing any further miſchief, ſome of the largeſt of our Men of War were ſtraight got ready, beſides a conſiderable number of Prawen, and ſmall Veſſels; all which were as well Mann'd as we could wiſh: And with theſe we went in ſearch of the Javians. In this Expedition I was made Captain of the Ship call'd the <hi>Europa;</hi> which had eight hundred. Men and three Surgeons; and one Captain <hi>De Ruiter</hi> commanded the whole Fleet. We ſtraight put to Sea, and with our whole Fleet we made directly to <hi>Bantam,</hi> and <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> the two Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which I told you, lay ſo conveniently for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100310:42"/>
the Javians to run in and out at; and there we lay, to cut off their Paſs, when-ever they ſhould attempt to come in there for ſhelter.</p>
               <p>Being come there, one half of the Fleet was order'd to ſtay there, and the other half of which number I was, went in ſearch of the Enemy. The next morning, as we were come about the Iſland call'd the <hi>Toppers Hoadie,</hi> we ſaw them about a League off of us, with more than a hundred Prawen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cruiſing to and fro. Our Admiral <hi>De Ruyter</hi> judged himſelf ſtrong enough to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them; ſo having call'd a Council, it was reſolved to fall upon them. Upon this a Gill of Brandy, (the beſt thing in the World to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire Courage into a Dutch-man) was given to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of them: And we were divided into two parts, with Inſtructions, that upon the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal given, we ſhould fall upon them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All that day we lay ſtill; but on the Evening we did ſo ſurround our Enemy, that they had no way left them by the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to fight their way thro' us, or elſe be forced to ſhelter themſelves on a little Iſland call'd <hi>Schlepſe;</hi> but that being not above a League in compaſs, and beſides, ſo barren, that it would not afford them any Proviſion or Relief; they were neceſſitated to Attack us; and indeed they were not long reſolving upon it, having four times at leaſt the number of Men that we had. They ſtood to the Windward off us; ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that advantage too over us, they came ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry briskly upon us with twenty Prawen well Mann'd, and with forty Double Haekken, hoping with them to lay faſt hold of our greateſt Ships firſt, and ſo to board them, and then the ſmaller would eaſily be diſpatched. The Admiral all this while did not let us fire one Shot, and had
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100310:42"/>
order'd a kind of Breaſt-works to be got ready upon the Deck by the Main Maſt, and under Deck in the Fore-caſtle. Our Prawen and ſmall Veſſels kept behind us, ready to fall upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, when-ever he ſhould Attack us. We had planted ſome of thoſe <hi>Haubitzen</hi> I made mention of before, behind thoſe Breaſt-works, which we had made, which were to pour ſmall Shot upon them; and there were Men ready beſides theſe with their Granado's, Fire-Pikes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to give them a welcome at their entrance. All this while the Javians continually fired upon us, but did little Execution: And being come up cloſe to us, they ſcaled us, and in an inſtant our large Ships were filled with Javans, who upon their Boarding of us, ſet up ſuch a <hi>Huzza,</hi> or rather an Out-cry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their manner, that it made the Air to tremble. But we ſtraightway falling to our works, opened our Breaſt-works, and fired our ſmall Shot upon them, together with our Granado's; ſo that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were Men deſtroyed after that rate. Thoſe that were ſtill coming up, and thoſe that were in the Prawen, we ſwept down like a ſwarm of Bees, with our Fire-Pikes, and other Fire-arms, and Hand-Granado's, into the Sea; all that remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed begun then to Provide for running off. But out Prawen and light Veſſels followed them ſo cloſe, that they killed infinite numbers of them, and took up ſome that were fallen into the Sea, and made them Priſoners; who we immediately hang'd up altogether upon the ſaid Iſland. The Sea all about us was pure Blood, and we were all in a Cloud of Smoke, tho' we had not fired one Great Gun. There was no leſs than two hundred and ſixty of the Enemy lay dead Aboard my Ship the <hi>Europa.</hi> The dead and wounded we threw one with another over-board; which cauſed a bitter Out-cry among thoſe who were yet ſenſible,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100310:43"/>
or but ſlightly wounded. After this great Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our Ships came all together again, and upon a Review, we found our loſs to be two Maſters of Ships, ſeven Steers-men, eight Officers, and about three hundred and eighty private Soldiers, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred of our Blacks. We loſt two Ships, the <hi>Victor</hi> and the <hi>Ameland,</hi> beſides eighteen Prawen, three Galliots, and ſeven Fire Ships; all which were burnt. But of the Enemies Ships, which were a hundred and twenty in number, there did not one ſingle one eſcape; their Men were computed to have been 24000.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Fleet comes together again, and falls upon the Javians at Sea. The Author is order'd to <hi>Bantam,</hi> to take care of the wounded, that were ſent thither. The Council reſolves to purſue the Javians. Their Malice and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Hatred againſt the Dutch. Several Skirmiſhes with them. The Expedition of the Dutch from <hi>Bantam</hi> againſt <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> which was the old King's reſidence. A Bloody Fight mantain'd by the Dutch againſt the Javians, with a great loſs of the former. Some Javian Nobles ſent to deſire a Peace, which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed. The Garriſon of <hi>Dorjaſſe</hi> ſet fire on <hi>Dorjaſſe</hi> and fly. The Dutch plunder what was left of it. The Author diſcovers a very conſiderable Treaſure buried under ground, but receives little advantage from it. The Admirals Expedition in purſuit of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, where he meets with an unlucky accident.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving put our ſelves into a pretty good poſture again, our Men had all the Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that could be, with great plenty of Brandy, Sack, Biſcuit, and ſuch like. The next thing we did, was to diſpatch a Ship to <hi>Batavia,</hi> to carry the news of our Victory to the General.</p>
               <p>After this we went to joyn the reſt of our Fleet again. The Javians all this while made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral offers to come out of the River <hi>Dorjaſſe:</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:100310:44"/>
But, our Fleet lying juſt in the mouth of it, they could not attempt it with ſafety; but were forced to make their way out at ſome other ſmall Rivers; ſo that ſome of them came in ſight of us; but we no ſooner made towards them, but they retired. Yet were we obliged to keep Cruiſing between that place and <hi>Batavia,</hi> to prevent their doing us any miſchief. So that there was continually ſome little Skirmiſh with them; but never any Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worth ſpeaking of. In a matter of two months, the greateſt part of our Ships, and the beſt of our Men, were ſent again to <hi>Bantam,</hi> the reſt of 'em kept ſtill Cruiſing before <hi>Dorjaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Bantam,</hi> under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Captain <hi>Jochem,</hi> the Men were put on Shore, and Quarter'd amongſt the others that were in the Fort. It fell to my ſhare to be of the number too. So I took my Lodging in the <hi>Chineeſen Straet,</hi> where I was very commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated for my buſineſs. There were alſo two Aſſiſtants with me, and three Under-Surgeons, who were Lodged in their ſeveral Quarters, for the better looking after their Patients. Thoſe were obliged to come to me ever and anon to give me an account of thoſe they had under their hands, and to fetch the Remedies, which were all in my cuſtody, and to take my directions. Only thoſe other neceſſaries, as Linnen for Plaiſters, Arack, Sack, Salad Oyl, and ſuch like, were to be fetched from the Steward, who had them in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but they were never delivered without I ſent an eſpecial Order under my hand. The number of our Sick and Wounded was great, and that of the former increaſed, by reaſon of the Flux, which was very rief among them: And ſome were ſeized with a Lameneſs in all their Limbs; ſo that we had enough to keep us in employment.</p>
               <p>All this while we were making all preparations
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100310:44"/>
for carrying on the War with utmoſt vigour, both by Sea, and Land: But we wanted Men; wherefore we were forced to ſtay till our Recruits came from <hi>Batavia.</hi> We had an eſpecial Eye upon the Royal Fort <hi>Dorjaſſe;</hi> for we ſaw very well that we laboured in vain, while that ſtood; and we had reaſon to think, that if we did but once ferret them out of their ſtrong hold, we ſhould not find it difficult to give them a total Overthrow.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that beſides the pleaſure I had out of a publick love for my Country, to ſee them in a fair way of overcoming their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and enlarging their Territories: I had alſo a ſecret ſatisfaction to ſee that they were the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians that were the Object of our Conqueſts; they being the moſt faithleſs, treacherous and baſe of all the Indians. They are fit for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of miſchief; but never fit to be employed in any action that's noble or generous. In ſhort, they are skill'd in nothing, but in cheating, filch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all manner of knavery. I have often found it to my coſt, but that which was moſt notorious, tho' of no great moment, was the trick they put upon me at my firſt coming, which was this. When our Ship was juſt arrived from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, ſome of theſe Javians came to meet us, as it is their uſual manner to come and meet all Ships, that are newly come in, to welcome them, and to ſell them fruits, freſh meat, and other refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

Their way is to Truck for ſome of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities; ſo I agreed to what they ask'd me for the Fiſh, which was ſome Nails, Thread and Tobacco-Pipes; which I immediately fetch'd for 'em, and gave to the Javian, who was then buſie about ſomething that others had bought likewiſe. I was ſo pleaſed with the thoughts of the rare Feaſt I was to have, and withal in ſuch haſte to be at it, that I could not ſtay any longer; but bidding the Fellow leave my Fiſh, with any of our Men, I ran down in the mean while into the Cook's Room, to get me ſome Water hung on ready, and I think never went ſo chearfully about any buſineſs in my life. But no ſooner had I turned my back, but the Dog puſh'd off his Boat, and went off with my Diſh of Fiſh, and left me to Dine on my Water; and I muſt confeſs, that from that time I could never have a hearty love for one of the Nation. It was a ſort of a ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to me, that in three or four days after we were Landed, I had an opportunity to be revenged on a Javian, which I never let ſlip, for his ſake, when ever it offer'd it ſelf. They are generally very great lovers of Shooting, tho' they are ſo ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, as never to underſtand it as they ſhould do: And as I was one day Shooting at a Mark, one of them comes up to me, and wanted mightily to have a Shoot. I told him he ſhould: So I ſhot, and loaded again with a double Charge of Powder, and a vaſt deal of Paper, which I took care to ram down as hard as ever I was able, and then offer'd it him: He very joyfully recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it, and went to fire it: But the Piece recoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo furiouſly, and gave him ſuch a knock on the ſhoulder, that down fell my Booby, and could hardly ſtir his Arm for a fortnight, or three weeks after it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:100310:45"/>
But to return to our purpoſe, all our Affairs were in a very good poſture at <hi>Bantam:</hi> And there was a very good underſtanding between the young King, and our Major General <hi>St. Martin.</hi> But the Javans were ever and anon upon us in ſmall Bodies, and came quite up to our Rampiers: So that we had many Skirmiſhes with them; but ſo inconſiderable, that they were not worth the ſpeaking of.</p>
               <p>One would admire how quickly our Recruits were made at <hi>Batavia;</hi> for in a few months we had again a conſiderable Army on foot, and they had got together Men from all parts of the <hi>Indies,</hi> which were all ſent to us with ſpeed. And as ſoon as they were got together, it was reſolved to go directly againſt the Royal Fort of <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Major General <hi>St. Martin</hi> left Captain <hi>De Ruyter</hi> to Command <hi>Bantam,</hi> in his abſence, and himſelf went ſtraightway with ſome of the beſt Ships thither; and in ſome days after ſent Orders for the reſt of the Fleet, and moſt of the Men to follow him, leaving only what was neceſſary in <hi>Bantam</hi> for the ſecurity of the Place, which had little to fear from the Enemy without, and leſs to ſuſpect from the young King within, who had but a very inconſiderable number of Men of his own with him. So three thouſand Men were order'd to be imbark'd and of that Squadron I was, and had that time the Command of the Ship call'd the <hi>Middleburgh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we had joyned the Major General, we made together a very fine Fleet; and indeed ſuch a one, as had never been ſeen before in thoſe parts of the World. For we had there fifty two fine large Men of War, beſides ſome hundreds of Prawen Fire-Ships, Tenders, ſmall Boats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General <hi>St. Martin,</hi> ſoon after theſe were
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100310:46"/>
all come together, went back to <hi>Batavia;</hi> and we continued our way under the Command of the General and Admiral, whoſe name was <hi>Tack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as we came to caſt Anchor before <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> the Javians got together in prodigious numbers to the Sea Shore, and covered the ground for ſeveral Miles, which was all level from the Sea to the Fort, and all Fields of Rice. Juſt by the Shore were ſeveral Sconces at ſome diſtance from each other: Some big, ſome little, but all vaſtly ſtrong, being all made with a double Row of Trunks of Coco-Trees, that were ſet very deep into the ground, and the ſpace fill'd up with Earth ram'd down ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard. The ſpace between each of theſe Scon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was all Ditches and Rampiers, with Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſado's. The Sconces were ſo broad, that two or three Waggons might drive abreaſt upon them. In the middle of them within, were the dwellings for the Soldiers: Some of them were built up ſquare, and flat at top; for the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers to ſtand there and fight. From all theſe places the Javians were continually firing upon us, but to little purpoſe, becauſe we were far enough out at Sea; yet were we near enough to hear them make many hideous Out-crys, and to ſee their Troops hurry from one place to another.</p>
               <p>In the mean time we made all ready to Land. Admiral <hi>Tack</hi> going all the while from one Ship to another, to give Orders to the ſeveral Captains. Which done, we went to Prayers, and then the uſual portions of Brandy, Sack, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were diſtributed with ſtrict Injunctions to be all ready. Preſently after they brought us ſome <hi>Schappons</hi> or <hi>Pontons,</hi> which is a flat ſort
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100310:46"/>
of Boat like a Horſe-Ferry-Boat, which were fenced with a kind of Breaſt-work; and four Pieces for Small Shot to each, and to theſe, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners a ſufficient number, with ſome Sea-men, with Hand-Granado's. Then went in the Soldiers. After this manner we kept our <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which was now come, but was none of the merrieſt for us. The third day after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> we unladed ſeven large Ships, and ſunk them in the place where we had a mind to Land at: And upon them we raiſed Batteries, upon which we planted above forty heavy Pieces of Cannon, to ſhelter us when we Landed, and to annoy the Enemy and their Sconces.</p>
               <p>The next day after, about two of the Clock in the Morning, the Signal being given, we all in general left the Ships; upon which I went down into the Boat with the other Surgeons, which were above ſeventy in number, upon our Veſſel, which was attended always by two or three ſmall Boats, that were ready in caſe of any wounded, that they might carry them off to any place, and upon ever ſo ſhallow a Water.</p>
               <p>All this while we kept a hideous Shooting with our great Cannon, which was all we fired; under the ſhelter of which we drew all the while ſtill nearer and nearer to Land, from whence the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my kept firing very hotly upon us. When we came to have no more than knee-deep of Water, we got out; and then our Gunners played the more freely from their <hi>Schappons,</hi> upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the Sea-men could then make the better uſe of their Hand-ſhells.</p>
               <p>In this manner we Charged for above two hours, and loſt a great many of our Men: Their Sconces lying ſo high, that they had a great command of us; and we on the other ſide could hardly reach them. Seeing that we could make but ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100310:47"/>
this way, the Council of War met and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to fall upon their Works altogether.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Front marched forward directly towards the Enemy, and the Sea-men ſucceeded in our place, landing, and taking poſſeſſion of the ground, which the Army occupied before. We carried ſome of their Forts by Storm in a few hours time, tho' with the loſs of a great many of our Men. As ſoon as the Javians ſaw that they had loſt ſome of their Holds, they ſet fire in moſt of the others, and betook themſelves to their heels, but did not quite run away from us neither; for they kept moving in the Rice-fields on the ſides of us, with a reſolution to charge us all in a Body. We had yet a very conſiderable Army, tho' nothing in compariſon to theirs; but we having by this time got together our Artillery, and planted it very advantagiouſly, we were ready for 'em.</p>
               <p>The Admiral gave Orders we ſhould play upon them with our Artillery, without intermiſſion, which we did. The Armies being now come in reach of each other, the <hi>Javians</hi> fell upon us with the greateſt fury imaginable; the manner of which I could not ſee, being then in the midſt of our Men; but I heard their uſual Out-cry at their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on.</p>
               <p>Our Army opened it ſelf to the right, and left; and then our Artillery, which was ready for 'em, was all at once diſcharged upon them, which made a hideous Slaughter amongſt them. After which our Men cloſed in again, while it was charging again: Our Front moving always with movable Palliſado's before them, which was a very great defence to our Men, and enabled them to keep their Order the better.</p>
               <p>All this while, tho' thouſands of their Men dropt, they would not give ground an Inch, nor
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100310:47"/>
did we. And the day was now ſo far ſpent, that we were both forced to give over; yet were we whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet upon purſuing the Stroke, and hoped that the night ſhould prove rather more commodious and ſucceſsful, than the day had done. As ſoon as the night drew on, we begun to play upon them with our Mortars, and ſent ſuch a quantity of Bombs among them, and at the ſame time fell on one of their Wings ſo furiouſly, that we gain'd ground; and pouring our Shot ſo thick upon them, we put them into ſuch a conſternation, that they were not able to defend themſelves, ſo that we thought of nothing more, but to prepare to purſue them; but they did not deſign to put us to that trouble; for we could hear ſome of them in the front of their Army cry, <hi>Dida mou boggel ada orang Hollando;</hi> which is as much as to ſay, I will fight no longer againſt the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. This was made known to Admiral <hi>Tack,</hi> and further confirmed by ſome of the chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Enemies Army, which the Admiral had permitted to come to him, and were ſent to parley, and to beg him to grant a Truce, or rather make a Peace. The Admiral durſt not do any thing in this matter of his own accord; but was obliged to ſend to the General at <hi>Batavia,</hi> who ſent him word again that he ſhould be ſure not to hearken to any Propoſals of Peace.</p>
               <p>During this Suſpenſion of Arms, I converſed much with thoſe Javian Deputies, and I found them very inquiſitive, and curious to know what our Army was compoſed of; whether of real Men, or of Devils in humane ſhapes: We told them, they were only Men, but brave Men, and moſt Germans; and indeed they behaved themſelves with ſuch inexpreſſible Bravery, that it might have amazed a polite, and well-diſciplin'd Nation, and much more might it do ſo, with a Barbarous, and Heatheniſh People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:100310:48"/>
When the Admiral had received his Anſwer from the General at <hi>Batavia,</hi> he told the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties that the Dutch would not hear talk of a Peace, and ſo ſent them away; and bid them tell the old King, that they would now have as little regard for him, as he had formerly ſhewed for <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which our Artillery was fired again, and we charged them with greater fury than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo that we put their whole Army to flight, which they took directly towards <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> and there we put them all in confuſion, totally routed them, and made a moſt dreadful Slaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. We did not purſue them as we might have done; for we thought beſt to keep together, and to continue in our Entrenchments, while we made all the preparations requiſite for a more effectual purſuit of 'em, and in order to Attack the ſaid Town of <hi>Dorjaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here our Men reſted three days, and had all the uſual Refreſhments; and in that time our Dead were buried. But in the third night, about twelve of the Clock, we ſaw the City of <hi>Dorjaſſe</hi> in a blaze, and heard the blowing up of ſome of their Building and Fortification, great pieces of which fell into our Camp, which was half a Mile from thence; all which was very agreeable to our Admiral, and to our Army too, becauſe it would have coſt us a great many brave Men's Lives, if we had been put to fighting for it.</p>
               <p>We ſent immediately a Party towards the place, to ſee what they were doing there, and in what condition they were. But when they came near to the place, the old King withdrew with all ſpeed, and paſſed over the River <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaſſe,</hi> with all his remaining Forces; and fled to the Blawe <hi>Peperbergh,</hi> which was about four Leagues from thence; ſo that our Men found
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100310:48"/>
                  <hi>Dorjaſſe</hi> quite empty, and the Coaſts all clear. As ſoon as the Admiral had Advice of it, he march'd thither with the greateſt part of the Army. We found nothing there, but Houſes rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; moſt of them ſtill ſmoaking, and no Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, but a vaſt parcel of Ducks and Hens, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Streets to ſeek a habitation; which our Soldiers were very glad to ſee, and regaled themſelves bravely with. I went to take my Rounds in the City, and as I came near to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of Ducks, I fired amongſt 'em, and ſhot a good many of 'em, and the reſt ran into a Houſe there hard by: So I followed them with my Fuſil in my hand, deſigning to knock them down with the Butt end of it; But as ſoon as I came within the doors, I ſaw an old Woman ſitting on a Bedſtead with a naked <hi>Kriz</hi> in her hand. But ſhe ſeeing me come with a Gun in my hand, fell down dead for fear.</p>
               <p>Our Men found a great many Javians, that were hid in corners and holes, who could not flee away with the reſt, being exceeding old, or otherwiſe diſabled. Our Soldiers were Quartered upon the Baſtions. The Admiral took his Quarters in the middle of the City, in the Court of the <hi>Old Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> which before was the greateſt place for Trade.</p>
               <p>The chief of my care was, to ſee if I could not get ſome Plunder, which, while I was looking for, about the <hi>Old Palace,</hi> I diſcovered a place in a dark Entry, which was not Paved firm, but the Stones only laid looſe; and knowing it to be their cuſtom to bury their Treaſures in time of danger, I went to examine the place more narrowly, and made ſhift to dig down a matter of two foot; but finding nothing but a few <hi>Staefiens</hi> or <hi>Stiftiens,</hi> which were about a quarter of a Yard long, I grew
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:100310:49"/>
weary of my work, not knowing the value of 'em. Thoſe I got I gave away to a Free-man, who went privately among the Free-men, and ſold them for a <hi>Crown.</hi> As ſoon as ever I knew the worth of 'em, I went in all haſte to the place again, and got a pretty good parcel of them: But as ill luck would have it, 'ere I could carry them off, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, who was come to take a view of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines of the Palace, came juſt that way, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what it was, engroſſed it to himſelf, and ſent for Men immediately to dig there; and there they found as many of them as filled eight Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, which were ſold for 700000 Gilders: All which went into the Admiral's Pocket. However he preſented me with a hundred Gilders for being the diſcoverer.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, others got ſeveral good Booties, as Perſian Quilts, and Perſian &amp; China Silks, with many other rich Furniture and coſtly Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that were left in the Palace. And I who had found the greateſt Booty, came off with the leaſt ſhare.</p>
               <p>By what I could ſee of the ſtrength of this place, it is certain the Javians wanted nothing but Courage to keep us out; for if that had not been wanting, they might have defied double our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: For tho' the Town was four or five Miles in compaſs, yet there was but two Avenues into it, which was hardly wide enough for two Carts to go abreaſt, the reſt being all Mooriſh grounds, where Rice grew, but where no Army could have come: And inſtead of a Wall, the Town was fenced with a Line of Coco-Trees ſet cloſe to one another, and filled up with Earth; ſo that our Cannon would never have been able to batter it down, or ſo much as to make a breach in any part of it. The Buildings within were all built
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:100310:49"/>
with Bamboo-Canes, except the Palace, and the Noble-Mens Houſes, which were of Stone.</p>
               <p>Upon the twenty eight Baſtions of this place, we found three hundred and odd large heavy Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cannon, tho' moſt of 'em Iron; but no Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Bullets; which gave us occaſion to think, that thro' ſome careleſneſs the Magazine took fire, and ſo ſet fire on the whole Town, as indeed we found it true afterwards, by the account which ſome of the Inhabitantss gave us.</p>
               <p>The Fortification of this place, was ſo ſtrong, that all the Canonading in the World could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make a breach in it; for the outſide of it was all of Coco-Trees, ſet as cloſe together as might be, and behind them was all Earth thrown up: And it is impoſſible for a Bullet to batter any of thoſe Trunks of Coco-Trees, being of ſo ſpungy a nature, that a Bullet will ſtick in them, and go no further.</p>
               <p>In this place was a high Hill caſt up by the King's Order, and a few Hutts built at top of it; from whence he uſed to go, and ſpy the Army when it lay before <hi>Bantam,</hi> and take a proſpect of the Fleet, the Country lying all level between thoſe two places.</p>
               <p>Two Rivers run thro' the Town, the little, and great, <hi>Dorjaſſe;</hi> which unite their Streams a little below the Town, and make up a fine River. It runs thence thro' the pleaſant Vales of the <hi>Blawen Peper Bergh</hi> into the Sea, and divides the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Bantam,</hi> from that of <hi>Batavia,</hi> or <hi>Jacatra,</hi> all along in its courſe.</p>
               <p>When we had laid ſtill here ſome few days, our Admiral went out with ſome Companies to viſit ſome of their <hi>Negeryen,</hi> or <hi>Villages.</hi> We plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd all as far as the Plain of <hi>Banta,</hi> which is juſt by the River <hi>Bantam,</hi> and leads towards <hi>Tangbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rang,</hi> a Province belonging to the Kingdom of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100310:50"/>
Here we ſaw ſome Naekens or ſmall Boats ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other ſide of the River; but neither ſaw or heard any body therebouts. The Admiral had a mighty fancy to go over, and ſo had ſome others of the chief Officers: Wherefore he offer'd ſix Rixdollers to any that would venture to ſwim over and fetch ſome of thoſe Naekens over. Tho' the River was about a mile wide, yet there were four Seamen that proffered themſelves immediately, and ſeveral Blacks, who are generally excellent ſwimmers; but it was thought ſufficient to ſend the Seamen only, and two of the Blacks, who brought over ſix <hi>Naekens;</hi> and having got ſome Oars to 'em, they went with them, and fetch'd all the others, which were twenty and odd. When they were all come, the Admiral went into one of 'em, and all the Boats were filled with Men. When we were got over, we found nothing but whole flocks of Hens, and Ducks; ſo that our Men divided themſelves, ſome one way, and ſome another, to ſee if they could find any Body. One of theſe Parties met, by misfortune, with a parcel of Amboineeſes, who were come out to get ſome Coco-nuts; and theſe going dreſt like Javians, our Men took them for ſuch, and falling upon them, kill'd ſome of 'em, and would certainly have kill'd more, had not another party of ours come in of a ſudden upon the back of theſe poor Amboineeſes, who hearing them cry out for quarter, and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them to be Amboineeſes, put a ſtop to the ſlaughter, and prevented further miſchief being done.</p>
               <p>We were all well provided with Powder and Ball, and kept on to the end of the Plain; where we found ſome little Works, Redoubts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all abandoned. In one of them were four or five pieces of Cannon, which we took, and carried over the River, and from thence drew them to <hi>Dorjaſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:100310:50"/>
Our Admiral was now thinking to get over the River again, and yet deſirous to know what was become of the Enemy; but truly his curioſity coſt us very dear; for we had not yet reach'd our Boats, when we perceived a great number of Prawen, full of Javians, making towards us, with ſuch ſpeed, that we could hardly get our Arms ready. All we could do was to fire upon them, and hinder them from landing juſt in that place. But they paſt by us quickly, and came to another landing-place, that was more convenient. As ſoon as they had got hold of the Shore, they came upon us in a trice, and ſo encompaſſed us, that we had no way left but to yield, or throw our ſelves into the River. The firſt of theſe could not pleaſe us, and the latter was almoſt as dangerous, for thoſe who could not ſwim very well, ſo that they who had little or no hopes of ſwiming over, reſolved to ſtand it out, and to ſight to the laſt drop of Blood. Our Admiral eſcaped with five Boats, and ſome others followed them as faſt as they could, and ſwam over after them. I, for my part, finding I could not eſcape death, if I ſtaid there, threw away my Arms, and my Surgeons Box, and leapt into the River, tho' with little hopes of getting over; however it gave me a chance for my Life, and it pleaſed God to carry me over ſafe to Shore, where our Men were got, and ſtood ſpectators of the dreadful ſlaughter, the Javians were making among the poor Dutchmen, that were left among them on the other ſide. There was no leſs than two hundred of 'em, who were all cut in pieces, but behaved themſelves with an unparallel'd bravery, as Men in ſuch deſperate conditions uſe to out-do themſelves; and as they held it out a long while, ſo they ſold their Lives at the deareſt rate that ever men did.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:100310:51"/>
The Admiral exceedingly concern'd at this ſad misfortune, and deſirous to revenge the loſs of ſo many brave Men, took the reſt who had made their eſcapes, and marched with them in all haſte to <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> with a deſign to go over with a Body of Men, and purſue the Enemy. It was upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration found impracticable, being we had no way of paſſing the River, for it was very broad every where, and we had not above three or four ſmall Boats: So that we were forced to quit our deſigns; but that we might not go altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revenged, we ſet fire to all that remained ſtanding in <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> after we had ſtaid three or four days in it. The main Body of our Army continued along the Sea Coaſt, very well entrenched, under the Command of Captain <hi>Harzing;</hi> while the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral went, with ſome ſmall Ships, and ſome Men, down the River <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Bantam</hi> by Sea.</p>

I was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to go to my old Poſt in the Hoſpital: But another Order came, not long after, to me, to get ready to go to Captain <hi>Ruiter,</hi> to view the Country along the River <hi>Tangburang,</hi> which runs thro' the Province of that Name, and comes by <hi>Bantam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In our march we ſaw very pleaſant <hi>Negeryen</hi> on both ſides the River, tho' all without Inhabitants. But one Night as we were very ſilent in our march, we were ſurprized with a ſudden alarm, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry in one of the neighbouring Villages. We were not very much corncerned at it, becauſe we were 400 of us; however we ſtood all to our Arms, and moved, according to our Captains Orders, towards the Village, and there we met with 'em upon the march, but it was not intended againſt us. Some of our Front only could fire upon them, yet that ſerved to bring down ſeveral of the Javians; but the Blacks or Amboineeſes, of which we had a Company with us, purſued them ſo long, that they brought us ſeventy Heads of 'em, when they came back to us the next Morning; according to the Cuſtom of all thoſe Nations, whether they fight for us, or againſt us; which is always to cut off the Heads of as many of their Enemies, as they kill, and to bring them to their Commanders, as tokens of their Valour.</p>
               <p>Having had good ſucceſs thus far, our Captain was for moving forwards, and purſuing our good Fortune; which we did, till we came to a ſmall River that runs into <hi>Tangburang:</hi> There we found ſome Forts, and ſome Negeryen, well provided with Men. We were about going over to them, and we could have done it, the River not being very deep; but our Captain did not think it ſafe;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100310:52"/>
becauſe we did not know what Numbers there might be of the Enemy, or whether they might not lie there in ambuſcade. He immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd ſome of our Men to <hi>Bantam,</hi> to Admiral <hi>Tack</hi> for Recruits; and according to his deſire he had the very next day three Companies of Dutch ſent him, and two of Blacks, that were Banda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeſes.</p>
               <p>With this Reinforcement we croſſed the River briskly, and marched directly towards their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Forts: But we had not marcht long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Front, (which was hardly got in rightorder, after paſſing through the River,) but a parcel of about a hundred and fifty of our Men fell in with a Party of near four hundred of the Enemy; they would at firſt have been glad to have been a little farther off, but there being no retreat, they enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ſo vigorouſly, that they killed above an hundred and ſeventy of 'em, and wounded ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, and made the reſt retire to <hi>Tangburang.</hi> As we purſued them, we took ſome of them, who had deſerted the others, and hid themſelves in the Woods; who all told us, that all the Enemies Force was within three or four miles of us, and more than eight thouſand ſtrong. That it was the ſame Army which had continually been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Old King, and that they lay there in order to hinder our coming over that River.</p>
               <p>Upon this information, our Captain ſent ſome Expreſſes with all ſpeed to <hi>Bantam,</hi> to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it to the Admiral, who, without delay, ſent ſome hundreds of Men more, and ſome Field-Pieces likewiſe. Then were all the Officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to take eſpecial care, that all their Men might be well provided with Powder and Ball. All our Body was divided into five Parties, each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of four Companies, and all the neceſſary Orders were given; then all our Army went
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100310:53"/>
to Prayers, after which we marched ſtraight upon the Enemy.</p>
               <p>A Lieutenant with fifty Men was ſent out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to ſec what he could diſcover of the Enemy, and ſo to give us information. We had not moved half an hour, e're we had an account that the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians were coming to give us battle, and that they were eight thouſand ſtrong. All our Parties put together, made but four thouſand; yet were we in hopes that we might encompaſs them, as indeed we did in a very little while, and made the place ſo hot for 'em, and ſowed the ground ſo thick with their dead Bodies, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to their Heels, and fled in all haſte to <hi>Anier,</hi> which is a ſtrong and well-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied place, about two miles from thence, and is the chief Paſs into the Province of <hi>Tangburang.</hi> Wherefore we provided our ſelves immediately with Breaſt-works, to ſecure us ſelves from the Enemies ſallies. Every one that work at the caſting them up, had a Rix Doller as a preſent.</p>
               <p>The next day, when we had hardly finiſh'd them, the Enemy made a ſally upon us, which turned much to our advantage; for being pretty well prepared for 'em, we made ſhift to cut off ſeven hundred of 'em, and took ſome of 'em priſoners, whom we gave quarter to for ſix or ſeven days; and then took them into a Wood, and cut them in pieces. The next night we raiſed three Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, upon one of which we planted four large Pieces of Cannon, that were ſent us from <hi>Bantam,</hi> together with two thouſand Men. Theſe were loaden immediately with Small Shot, in caſe of their ſallies in the night time; and in the day time we drew 'em out again, and loaded with Bullets, to ſend into the Enemy's Works.</p>
               <p>When we had lain here about ſix days before the Town, we began to make our Lines of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:100310:53"/>
and a General Aſſault was agreed upon. In three days time we put it in execution: We had a Water to go over, which we paſſed with great eaſe, by means of ſome Faſcines which our Blacks cut and laid for us; but we found ſo brisk a reception, that we were forced to retire with a conſiderable loſs of Men on our ſide. If the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had made the beſt of their opportunity at that time, they might, with the greateſt eaſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable, have cut moſt of us off, and raiſed the Siege; but it pleaſed God they did not purſue us any further than their Works: And this was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly to ſome Engliſh, who were amongſt them, and who perſuaded them, that this was but a Sham-Aſſault of ours, and not the Body of our Army, and that that lay in the Trenches to cut off thoſe that ſhould ſally out; which if they had done, they would have utterly routed us, for we were at firſt but five thouſand ſtrong, (reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two thouſand Men ſent us with the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) and of them we had above an hundred killed, and an hundred and twenty wounded. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this repulſe and diſadvantage, we ſtill continued in our Reſolution of carrying on the Siege.</p>
               <p>In the mean while our wounded Men were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a place about a mile diſtant from us, where there were ten Surgeons to look after them; and thoſe that were not dangerouſly ill, were ſent to the Hoſpital at <hi>Bantam,</hi> and with them Captain <hi>Ruyter</hi> ſent a Letter to the Admiral, to deſire him to ſend him a recruit of about a thouſand Men; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that with that he did not doubt but he ſhould get maſter of the Town in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>Three days after our Aſſault we begun ſtill to make good our Approaches to the Town, being our number of Men increaſed; and being come
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:100310:54"/>
pretty near to it, the Blacks came over to us in in abundance out of the Town. We did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them into our Army, but poſted them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Lines and the Town: However, this gave us hopes, that the beſieged were weary of us. Wherefore we begun to make ready ſome Mines, which being finiſhed, we again reſolved to make another Aſſault.</p>
               <p>While we were deliberating on theſe matters, an Engliſh Man, with his Arms, came over to us out of the Garriſon, and gave us a good account of their condition, and withal told the Captain, that the Beſieged ſeem'd now to wiſh for nothing more than that we would attempt another Aſſault; and that in order to receive us, they had pulled down the Houſes in the Streets, and levell'd that part of the Town; that they had guarded all Avenues and Streets with double Palliſadoes, and that behind them they had planted ſeveral Pieces of Small Shot to receive us: And likewiſe that they had laid ſeveral Mines ready to blow us up. We on the other ſide were in hopes that we ſhould ſurmount all theſe difficulties. We mounted Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars upon our Batteries, and ſent ſuch a number of Bombs and Granadoes into the Town, that we thought it impoſſible they ſhould keep within it long, and ſo it proved; for by and by we heard a ſudden Alarm, the Beſieged having a mind to try the ſucceſs of a ſecond Sally upon us. But we, who were well prepared for 'em upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, did ſend ſuch ſhoals of Hand Granado's amongſt them, that we forced them to retire with very great loſs, and all the while we purſued them to the very Town.</p>
               <p>This being done, and our two Mines being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and having laid ſeveral hundred weight of Gun-powder in each of them: Orders were given to ſet fire to 'em, which was accordingly done:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100310:54"/>
And in an inſtant, the Mines, having been dug very deep in under the Town, (as we might do eaſily, the Town being ſcituated pretty high,) we ſaw half the Town in the Air, and ſome part of it, and of the Men came tumbling into our Camp; and within ſome thouſands loſt their Lives at that one blow.</p>
               <p>No ſooner was this done, but we, who ſtood all ready, and in expectation of this, ruſht in furiouſly upon them, while they were in this confuſion and diſorder, and put all to the Sword that came in our way, except thoſe that we ſaw were Europeans. Two of them we took, who were Dutchmen, that had deſerted the Dutch Company, but theſe we immediately hung up without any further exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as it is the conſtant cuſtom, which the Dutch obſerve when-ever they catch any of their Deſerters. But beſides that they deſerved this death by Law, they doubly merited this from us; for knowing that there was no pardon to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from the Company, they had been great inſtruments of the obſtinate reſiſtance we met with here; for their condition being deſperate, ſo was the advice they gave to our Enemies, to hold out longer than they would have done. I could not but be exceedingly ſorry at the fate of one of'em in particular, being one of my intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and who came over with me from <hi>Holland.</hi> He was of a very good Family, his Father was an eminent Merchant at <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Norway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being now Maſters of this Paſs, we fortified our ſelves with the greateſt diligence, it being the ſtrongeſt In-land fortification, and the direct Paſs from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Batavia</hi> by Land. We had already got all the Sea-port Towns and Forts in our Hands; and having likewiſe poſſeſſed our ſelves of this, we did not doubt but the Javians would be obliged to come and ſurrender themſelves, ſeeing they
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100310:55"/>
could not come at the Sea. Yet in caſe there ſhould be ſome ſmall deſperate Parties abroad, Captain <hi>Ruyter</hi> commanded fifty Men to go and ſtroul a little about the Country, and I deſired I might be one with 'em.</p>
               <p>We marched about for a matter of an hour or or two, thro' nothing but Woods and Coco-Trees, and then we came to a River, but we could not paſs it; ſo we continued moving along the ſide of it till night; and then not meeting with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of paſſing the River, we took up our lodging there that night; but for fear of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, we hardly durſt ſpeak or ſtir all that night.</p>
               <p>The next morning early we heard a noiſe not very far from us, and we began to fancy, that we might inſenſibly be got round upon our Army again; but when we were got a little further, we diſcovered the Enemy on the other ſide of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as buſie as might be, cutting of Coco-Trees, with a deſign to go and raiſe ſome new <hi>Bachers,</hi> as they call 'em, that is, Fortifications. The Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was very narrow, but very deep; and ſeeing they could not come at us, and that we could ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily retire (if need was) to our Army, which was but a mile from us; we took a reſolution, and fired ſo briskly amongſt them, that we fetch'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of 'em down off the Trees.</p>
               <p>They, on the other ſide, did not fail tomake good uſe of their Engliſh Firelocks, and to give fire upon us; ſo that four of our Men fell. Two of them that were only wounded, I brought away, and appli'd what was requiſite to their wounds; and having done that, I went forward to overtake the reſt of our Men; but I was no ſooner come up to them, but I my ſelf received a wound in my Thigh, from a Black, that was upon a Coco-Tree, and the Ball lodged within me. The ſmall Skirmiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, ſome of our Men took me up, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100310:55"/>
me to <hi>Anier,</hi> where the Army was; and from thence I was carried to the Hoſpital at <hi>Bantam.</hi> There I was the daily care of the chief Surgeon of that place, who was a very able Man, named <hi>John Hanſs</hi> a Leydener.</p>
               <p>He uſed his utmoſt endeavours to get the Bullet out of the wound, but all in vain: And after I had undergone a long and grievous pain, and had all the Splinters clear'd out, we were forced to leave the Bullet in, and to let the wound heal over it.</p>
               <p>In two months time I was fully recover'd, and found no pain; nor did my Bullet ever trouble me, till I came into <hi>Holland</hi> again.</p>
               <p>I was now got again to my Employment, in the Hoſpital that was committed to my care, where we enjoy'd our ſelves with great ſecurity: Only for fear of the worſt, we took care to man our outward Garriſons, and to fortifie our Frontier Places. But e're three Months were at an end, we were ſufficiently ſatisfied that there was no great need of fortifying our ſelves any more; for the Javians came over to us in mighty numbers: And to convince us of their ſincerity, and entire ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to us, they ſent us ſome hundreds of Carts full of Muſquets, Lances, Pikes, Bows and Arrows, and other Warlike Inſtruments.</p>
               <p>After this, ſome of their Nobility, and ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of greateſt Note, who had great Eſtates in thoſe parts, came to ſurrender themſelves, and to beg for Pardon of the Dutch Company. But for that time the Company thought fit to leave that to the diſcretion of the Young King, who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf willing to receive them graciouſly, and to pardon all that was paſt. But he having got ſome of 'em into his power, he forgot his Royal Word, and commanded ſome of them to be caſt to Tygers, ſome to Venemous Serpents, ſome to be

ſtrangled, others were drown'd, others had their Throats cut by his eſpecial Command; and all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and miſerably put to death. Things being come to this paſs, the Company thought it was high time to put a ſtop to ſuch Barbarity: And therefore they acquainted him with their reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this his baſe dealing, and made him ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the great imprudence, as well as baſeneſs he had been guilty of; ſeeing he ought to have been glad, to have ſeen theſe Perſons come to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to him, and furniſh him with Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which he was now like to want; and that ſo he might have his Towns and Cities once again raiſed, and filled with Inhabitants. The reſt of them that came in, being hereupon more civilly uſed, and kindly treated; inſomuch that in the eighteen Months time that I was there, all the Places were rebuilt, and made finer than they were before. For then the Chineeſes, who are willing to be under the Dutch Government, came and ſettled there in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter numbers than ever. For as they love to live among the Dutch, becauſe of the Priviledges they give them; ſo the Dutch are very glad of their company, becauſe where-ever they are among them, they cauſe a brisk Trade, which turns to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the Dutch, as well as of the Chineeſes themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Country being now again pretty well Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with Neighbours and Forreigners, and by the coming in of the Javians; I thought it high time to look about me, and to try to recruit my Pockets, which were now very low, all Proviſions being exceeding dear; and I had had no opportunity in a great while to get a Farthing by my Profeſſion, any other than what my Salary brought me in. So I applied my ſelf to the Javians, among whom I thought there might be a great many wounded, and accordingly I found pretty much practice
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:100310:57"/>
amongſt 'em. With all this help I made ſhift to live handſomly enough, but truly it was as much as I could do: For conſidering the ſcarcity there was, and the great fatigues I had born, as well as the reſt, I thought it the prudenteſt way to look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Health, and to afford my ſelf what my Conſtitution required, rather than pinch my ſelf, and contract a fit of Sickneſs, as ſeveral, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed moſt People do, who go over to the Indies with no other deſign but to enrich themſelves at any rate. Tho', by the by, after all the pinching, ſaving and ſcraping together, that is not ſo eaſily done, as People imagine: For nothing is more common than the vulgar opinion, that there's no more to be done to get an Eſtate, than juſt to go to the Indies; from whence they reckon they may come home with a burden of Gold, Pearls and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds, as if it was but picking them up and come away. But it may be worth the while, ſeeing we are ſpeaking of this Vulgar Error, to ſhew that theſe pretious things are ſo far from being thus ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to come at, that it is even a very dangerous thing to attempt to carry off any of thoſe things, if a Man hath got any of them in his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>I my ſelf went once to <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and got inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted there with a Sergeant, that had lived about nineteen years in that Country, and was an Overſeer over ſeveral Blacks, that work in <hi>Preſs-Mills.</hi> We came to trucking at laſt, and I exchanged ſome of my Cheeſe, Tobacco, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for for ſome Oyl of Cloves; of which I purchaſed ſeven Bottles of near two Quarts a piece. This exchange of ours was to be kept as ſecret as any Robbery one ſhould commit in Europe, for both our Lives lay at ſtake. Fortune favour'd me ſo far, that I came away undiſcover'd, and brought 'em ſafe into the Road of <hi>Batavia;</hi> where I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to have ſome hopes of running it aſhoar, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100310:58"/>
pleaſed my ſelf with the thoughts of what it would yeild me among the Chineeſes, and the Engliſh. But I reckon'd without my Hoſt there; for no ſooner was I got into the Boat, in order to get to Shoar, with one of our Seamen, whom I had made privy to the buſineſs, and who underſtood that Trade, but the <hi>Fiſcael</hi> made towards us with his <hi>Caffers.</hi> The Seaman had ſo contrived the buſineſs, that the Bottles were under water well ſtopt, and tied to a Cord; but when we found the <hi>Caffers</hi> came direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to us, the Seaman who ſtood ready with a Knife in his hand, cut the Cord, and dropt the Bottles into the Sea. The <hi>Caffers</hi> were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately with us, who ſearched our Boat very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and then with their Hooks groped all round the outſide: They found nothing but the end of a Cord, which made them give us an Ugly Look, but it was not ſufficient to bring us into any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble. But immediately upon this a poor Gentleman had much harder fortune than I had; for theſe <hi>Caffars</hi> going from us to a Ship, that was come along with us from the Weſtern Coaſt, they caught a Lieutenant there, that had got a piece of Gold of ſome pounds weight: And the <hi>Fiſcael</hi> carried him ſtrait away to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and in two days time he was hang'd up in the <hi>Galgeveld.</hi> This poor Man's hard Lot made me not regret my loſs ſo much, I rather hug'd my ſelf that I had let my Tartar go. But it cured me from ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any thing of that nature. This may ſerve to let you ſee, how dangerous ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings are; and that ſuch Counterband-Goods are not ſo eaſily brought off. So that if Men have no other end in going to the Indies, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe them as a Friend, to ſtay at home while they are well.</p>

But now to return again to where I was: I ought not to omit giving the Reader an account, which will not be unacceptable, tho' the action will rather amaze than delight, and muſt needs fill the Reader with horror: For of all the Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty I ever heard of there, I never met with any that could compare with this, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in my time, tho' I muſt confeſs I think the Puniſhment that was inflicted on the Malef<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Some of our Men went one day a little way up into the Country, rather out of neceſſity than for pleaſure, deſigning to ſhoot ſome Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding they might know well enough, that it was not very ſafe, being we were not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reconciled with the Javians. They were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected back at night, but three days paſt, and no news of 'em, which occaſioned many conjectures; but moſt were of opinion, that ſome Javians had faln upon them, and murdered them. Upon which <hi>Minheer Tack</hi> commanded a Lieutenant, with ſome Men, to go in ſearch after 'em. Having wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd a matter of two hours, they came to a loneſome place, whereas they were thinking to go back, and take ſome other Road. They heard a piteous out-cry, which made them go forward to ſee what it was, and there they found 'em all ſix, and diſcovered the moſt diſmal Spectacle that ever was.</p>
               <p>One of them was ſtretch'd out between two Trees, with his Arms tied to the one, and his Legs to the other, about three or four yards high from the ground, with a great Fire ſtill burning under him; but he was quite roaſted when we came.</p>
               <p>Another hung by his Privities upon another Tree, with his Arms and Legs tied together under his Back; this was dead alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:100310:59"/>
The third was ſpitted upon a Bamboo-cane, in at his Fundament and out at his Mouth; he was dead too.</p>
               <p>The fourth was buried up to the Neck, his Eyes put out, and his Noſe and Ears cut off; this was not quite dead.</p>
               <p>The fifth and ſixth were tied faſt Back to Back, each of them had their Right Eyes put out, and their Privities thruſt into the holes; both theſe were ſtill alive.</p>
               <p>Our Men were ſo ſurpriſed at this ſight, that they were ready to ſink down; and finding no other remedy, they came with all ſpeed to <hi>Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heer Tack,</hi> to give him this tragical account, who ſent ſtraight ſome Blacks with a Barrow to fetch theſe poor Creatures, and bring them to <hi>Bantam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were not a little concerned at this ſtrange accident, but what was an addition to our trouble was, that we could not learn from theſe Men how they came to be thus ſerved, becauſe they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Inſtrument of Speech.</p>
               <p>Admiral <hi>Tack</hi> ſent immediately ſome Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Young King to acquaint him with all this, and to deſire him to have a ſearch made among his people, and to uſe all means poſſible to diſcover the Authors of this Fact. This he did, and with ſuch good ſucceſs, that in leſs than a fortnights time, we found the Rogues out; and all of 'em (being ſixteen in number) were apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and eight of them were forthwith condemn'd to be thrown to Serpents.</p>
               <p>The manner of theſe Serpents deſtroying of Men is thus. They catch hold of a Man, and ſwallow him near half up, and then ſuck all the Blood out of his Body, then they tear him peace-meal, and eat him up.</p>
               <p>The other eight were confined to one Room, where they had very good Diet afforded them, but

that was only in order to prolong their Pain; for there were Men always attending them with Scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and as ſoon as ever theſe Criminals begun to nod, they laſhed them ſeverely, and this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a fortnight; and then they begg'd that we would knock them on the Head, or put 'em to any ſpeedy death they pleaſed, tho' it were the moſt cruel they could invent.</p>
               <p>But all their begging was in vain, for the Young King was wonderfully pleaſed, that he had found out ſuch a Puniſhment, as would probably terrifie the reſt from committing ſuch frequent Murders as they uſed to do.</p>
               <p>Thus they continued in that miſery, and lived till the fifth Week; then they fell aſleep in ſpight of all their Whipping; and continued ſo notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they were pincht with red hot Tongs, and ſo they ended their miſerable Lives. So, that how barbarous ſoever their Fact was, yet it met with a Puniſhment, which, I think, did rather out-do the Fact it ſelf in Barbarity.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How inſolently the Javians behaved themſelves at firſt towards the Dutch, and how civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed. The Dutch get the total Government of the Country into their Hands by conſent of the Toung King. The Old Kings Surrender, Confinement and Death. Rebuilding of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> and it's flouriſhing Condition. Its Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick, Commodities, Fruits and Proviſions. Tygers there in great numbers, how catch'd. Elephants taken after a like manner in <hi>Cey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and <hi>Aracan.</hi> The ſeveral Games and Paſtimes at the Weddings of the Chief Javi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, together with ſome Cuſtoms and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies uſed on thoſe occaſions. A deſcription of Pepper, and its growth. The Author's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Bantam</hi> to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and thence to <hi>Banda.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Javians could hardly bear the <hi>Hollanders</hi> for a great while, and truly their antipathy againſt us was not altogether without ſome grounds, ſeeing that we, being Forreigners, had invaded their Territories, and taken poſſeſſion of all they had, and then lorded it over them. They being a very ſilly ſort of People, had no other way to ſhew their Spight and Reſentment, than by making Mouths at the Dutch as they paſſed by, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Spitting upon them. To break them of that ungainly Cuſtom, we made a reſolution amongſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100310:60"/>
us, never to let any paſs by that did ſo, whether Old or Young, Man or Woman, without giving them a good Box on the Ear. This cured them of their incivility ſo effectually, that you'ld have wonder'd to ſee how courteouſly they behaved themſelves towards us; for all of a ſudden there was ſo great an alteration, that there was no paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by 'em, but they would greet you very civilly, give you good morrow, (in their Language, <hi>Dobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Sinior)</hi> clapping their Hands together, and holding them up to their Forehead; and when they were willing to ſhew themſelves more cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and officious, they would add, <hi>Manna Bigi Sinior,</hi> that is, where are you going Sir? which was as much as offering their ſervice and aſſiſtance, which we frequently made uſe of.</p>
               <p>Admiral <hi>Tack</hi> was all this while lodg'd in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment which belonged before to the Engliſh, where the Young King uſed to come to viſit him almoſt every day, and maintain'd a faithful Friendſhip with him. In a little time, things being ſettled, a Propoſal was made to the Young King by the Dutch, that if he would reſign intirely all claim of Power and Juriſdiction over his People, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and turn over the whole Government in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Hands, they would allow him ſuch a Sum as would enable him to keep up his Grandeur, and live like a King, (a titular one, that is,) and would be obliged to pay him ſome thouſands of Gilders every Month. To this he condeſcended; whether thro' fear, or thro' indifference, I cannot well ſay; and a certain Penſion was likewiſe ſettled upon his two Young Princes, all which was duly paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to agreement. The reſt of the Nobility, and Chief of the Land, remained in the poſſeſſion of their Goods and Lands, as before, only that they were now ſubject to the Dutch Government. Thus the Dutch compaſſed their whole deſign by force
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100310:61"/>
and policy; and by fair means became Maſters of that Kingdom, which was, and had been ſo long flouriſhing, and famous for its vaſt Trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick; and that in ſo little time, as from 1682 to 1685, that I believe Hiſtory will hardly afford an inſtance of a more ſudden change of Affairs in ſo great a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Old King all this while having wander'd up and down on the <hi>Blawen Peper Bergh,</hi> whither he had been forced to retire when he was defeated; and being there forſaken by moſt of his People, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved alſo to come, and ſubmit himſelf to the Dutch Company; and accordingly, after near two years, he came and ſurrendred himſelf, having firſt ſent ſome of his Servants to Admiral <hi>Tack</hi> for his Pardon, which was granted him. Upon which he appeared in Perſon, and came to <hi>Bantam,</hi> with a very ſmall Retinue; there they aſſigned him a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſet Guard upon him, and in a little time after ſent him to a ſmall Iſland, where he ended his days.</p>
               <p>Thus all being quiet, all Hoſtilities ceaſed, and all reduced to one Government, <hi>Bantam</hi> flouriſhed again in a more perfect manner than it had ever done; and did, like a Phoenix, ſpring up out of its own Aſhes, but more beautiful and ſtrong than it was before. Its Borders were now vaſtly enlarged, by reaſon of the vaſt number of Foreigners, which daily flocked thither, and were all indifferently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, except the Engliſh, French and Danes, which were not admitted, but were ſent with their Ships to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where they were permitted to trade, and to take Houſes and Ware-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief Traffick of <hi>Bantam</hi> conſiſts in <hi>Pepper, Salt-Peter, Salt, Ginger, Cotten-Cloth</hi> plain, and wrought with <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold;</hi> alſo <hi>Fine Linnen,</hi> and <hi>Flowerd Stuffs,</hi> which are the common wear of the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:100310:61"/>
The Country about it is exceeding pleaſant, and produces all manner of neceſſary Proviſions. There are all manner of tame Fowls, Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and their Eggs very cheap. All ſorts of Fiſh. Great ſtore of Cows and Buffels, but the Fat of theſe laſt is not much eaten, becauſe it taſts ſo much like Tallow. Many Wild Boars there are alſo, but the Tameſt of that kind that ever was, becauſe that the Javi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans never hunted them, by reaſon that their Law doth not permit them to eat the Fleſh of 'em; ſo that they uſed to come ſo cloſe up to our Works, that I have ſhot three or four of 'em in one day, and ſold them for little or nothing.</p>
               <p>But the worſt Cattle thereabouts is the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which are in great numbers near <hi>Bantam,</hi> which the Javians uſed to be frequently ſent out to catch or kill: And they did it after this manner.</p>
               <p>Thouſands of Javians go together to the place where the Tygers lie; and there they ſpread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves round the place in about three miles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, and ſo march gradually to center and meet upon the Tyger, keeping ſtill their <hi>Naſſingayen</hi> before them; ſo that if the Tygers come out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the circumference they make, they are ſo frighted, that they run back again; and ſo they keep them running to and fro, and retiring, till at laſt they are ſo cloſely encompaſſed, that they muſt of neceſſity be forced to throw themſelves into ſome of their Traps, which are ſomething after the manner of our Wheel-nets, but incomparably ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bigger; for they are of ſtrong Wood, made leſs and leſs, and ſeveral Partitions; and in each Partition a Trap-door that ſhuts upon 'em, till at laſt they come into the narroweſt of all. There they let him alone a good while without Meat, then they get a Rope about his Neck, and put him into a ſmall Coop, upon a Cart drawn by Buffels; and theſe are always brought to the King,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:100310:62"/>
who keeps always ſome of 'em in his Palace, and looks upon that as a piece of great State. And when one of them brings forth a young one, it is ſo much taken notice of, that all the Cannon round the Caſtle are diſcharged, and great Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cings and Paſtimes are made upon the occaſion.</p>
               <p>They do breed very often, but tho' one might expect to bring the young ones to be perfectly Tame, as indeed ſome do pretty well come to it, yet it is never ſafe to truſt them too far; for while I was there, two of 'em, which they thought as tame as they could wiſh, broke looſe and run thro' the Town, and tore ſeveral People to pieces, and would have deſtroyed ſeveral more, had not ſome Javians come upon them, arm'd with their <hi>Naſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingays,</hi> who killed one of them, and took the other.</p>
               <p>There is another way of catching them in Traps, laying a Bait for 'em, but then you can't have them alive; ſo there is ſhooting of 'em, but not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very great danger.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Ceylon, Pegu</hi> and <hi>Aracan</hi> they uſe to catch Elephants much after the ſame manner. It is worth while, upon this occaſion, to undeceive thoſe ſimple and credulous People, who believe that the way to catch them is, to ſaw ſome Trees almoſt thro', againſt which the Elephants come to lean to take their reſt; and ſo the Tree falling, they likewiſe fall, and are not able to get up again, being very clumſie, and without Joynts in their Legs. Whoever gives credit to this Fable, is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſed upon, for conſidering the Bulk of 'em, there is not a more nimble and active Creature than they are; and nothing is more ſure, than that when they are uſed in War, there are never any Ladders made uſe of, to help up the three or four Soldiers, which they carry; but they are taught to kneel, or rather couch down, while they get
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100310:62"/>
upon their Backs. But their Agility is ſo obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable from what we have ſeen ſome of 'em do in Europe, that I will not go about to deſcribe them any further. But for one inſtance of their Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and Aptneſs to be taught any thing, I cannot but ſet down here what I was an Eye-witneſs of my ſelf, done by an Elephant which one of the chief Merchants of the Company kept of his own, that had abundance of Tricks. And when he had a mind to divert himſelf, or ſome ſpecial Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, he would have him brought out by the Men that lookt after him, and knew how to manage him. This Elephant once was brought out upon a Bridge, which was over a very deep River, and a great Loaf was given him in his Mouth. The keeper gave him a ſign, and fell a beating upon a Copper Inſtrument; upon which the Elephant went back, as in a fright, and tumbled down backwards into the River, with a moſt hidious plunge, and kept ſo long under water, that he eat up his Loaf there, and he ſtaid ſo very long under the water, that no body expected ever to have ſeen him come up again, except thoſe that were uſed to this trick; at laſt up he came and ſwam to Shore, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving paid his reſpects to his Maſter, he threw up the Bread he had eaten, and near a Barrel full of water. Many other Tricks he ſhewed, but this is the only one that I thought worth relating, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat ſtrange and uncommon.</p>
               <p>I uſed to frequent many Javians of my acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to paſs away the time, and to obſerve ſome of their moſt particular Cuſtoms and Humours, and to ſhare of their Diverſions. Of th' latter none pleaſed me more, than to ſee their <hi>Balliar</hi> Dances, performed by Women who were kept for that purpoſe, by Perſons of the greateſt Quality. Theſe Women are of an extraordinary ſmall ſize, but of the moſt exquiſite Form and perfect Shape
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:100310:63"/>
that ever was ſeen: Their height is but between five and ſix Spans, their Skin as white as the driven Snow; and taking them all together, one would ſooner take 'em for Angels, in the likeneſs of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than for Women themſelves; for beſides their natural Beauty, there is all the artificial Dreſs that can be contrived. Their Garments are of the ſineſt Silks, wrought with Silver and Gold, and their Treſſes neatly adorn'd with the rareſt Orient Pearls, all which doth ſtill add to their luſtre. Their manner of dancing is in Maſquerade; they have in their Hands ſome Ebbony Balls ſtrung upon a String, with which they keep time very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly with the Muſick, inſtead of our Caſtanets; and ſometimes they ſing with their dancing, which is yet more charming than the reſt, their Voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonderful ſweet. One of theſe Women coſts generally two or three thouſand Gilders, they are fetch'd out of the Province of <hi>Babylon,</hi> about forty miles from <hi>Jerico</hi> the leſs; and no other Women are fit for theſe kind of Paſtimes and Dances but they: So they are much made of by the Indian Kings, and Nobility, who ſpare no pains nor charge to get 'em. Some of theſe I have ſeen alſo at <hi>Surat</hi> and in <hi>Perſia,</hi> when I lay before <hi>Wond Artz,</hi> with the Ship called the <hi>Gelderland,</hi> where we took in Silks in lieu of our Pepper and Spices.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of Sport they have is Cockfighting, which being ſo common here, needs no further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</p>
               <p>Theſe Sports and Paſtimes are frequently ſeen amongſt 'em, but eſpecially at their Weddings, which are never held without them, together with ſeveral other Recreations, and ſtrange Ceremonies, of which I will give you ſome account.</p>
               <p>In the time that I was there, a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Son to one of the Principal amongſt 'em, was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:100310:63"/>
married; and being intimately acquainted with him, I was invited to that Wedding. His Wife's Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was conſiderable, and proportioned to the Young Gentleman's Fortune. The Father gave with his Daughter, thirty Men, forty Women, and twenty Young Maids, all Slaves, beſides two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand <hi>Cujax,</hi> which amounteth to about ſixteen Rixdollers, for twelve thouſand <hi>Cujax</hi> are only the value of a piece of eight. All theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men-ſlaves, the Man may lie with if he pleaſeth, but the Children that are thus born, are not at his diſpoſal, but at his Wives, who may ſell them, or diſpoſe of them as ſhe thinks fit. But thoſe Slaves Children, which are given in Dowry to the Wife, are in the power of the Husband to order as he will.</p>
               <p>When a Marriage is on foot among them, both the Young People confine themſelves within, for about ſix Weeks or two Months: The Parents in that time ſet out their Servants and Slaves, and make 'em as fine as they can againſt the Wedding. The Bridegrooms Apartment is all ſtrewed with Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Then on the Wedding day he mounts on a Fine Horſe, which is ſet out in the fineſt manner, and thus goes to his Bride, where all her Friends meet him, attended with the Slaves, Preſents and Houſhold-ſtuff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then a great Dinner is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, where each of the Young Peoples Parents are to be preſent, and to make merry. In the mean while the Young Couple are lead to a Room with a fine Bed in it; where they are ſhut in, and left to their liberty, after which the Bridegroom comes out to the Gueſts, but the Bride is not ſeen of any Man after that time.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rejoycings uſually laſt four days, during which there are ſome Comedies acted after the Chineeſe manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:100310:64"/>
Among all their Sports, there is their baiting of a Buffle, which pleaſed me very well, but that it ſo frequently occaſions much miſchief; becauſe their way is to leave them looſe, and to ſet ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Engliſh Dogs upon them. I ſaw my ſelf once two Buffels let looſe in a ſmall incloſed piece of ground, with five Dogs againſt 'em. One of the Buffels deſended himſelf very well of the firſt Dog that came at him, and toſſed him up a vaſt height; but a ſecond coming upon him, before he had well rid himſelf of the firſt, and ſeizing him faſt by the Teſticles, it ſo enraged the Buffel, that he run directly to a little Shed, that ſtood there in a Corner, upon which three Blacks and two Dutchmen had got, the better to ſee the Sport; and throwing all down before him, and the Dogs ſtill holding him faſt, three of them, <hi>viz.</hi> two Javians, and a Dutch Carpenter, were trampled to death, and indeed almoſt all to pieces: And the other Javian, with the Admiral's Baker, came off luckily with no other wound, than what they got by their fall: They had no other way to put an end to this, or to part 'em, but by firing upon them altogether; for now the other Buffel was deeply engaged too: So that with their Muſquets they killed the two Buffels, and two of the Dogs, and unfortunately another Javian. So that this Sport ended very tragically, and it generally proves ſo, thro' their want of management.</p>
               <p>The next day another ill accident happen'd; for as there was in that place a great Maſt, which the Engliſh had taken formerly out of a Ship, and ſet up there, in order to get up, and ſpy the Ships a-far off at Sea. One of our Seamen would needs go up for a frolick, and being come almoſt to the top, one of his holds broke, and let him down, and was (as you may well imagine) killed with the fall. Upon which Admiral <hi>Tack</hi> immediately
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:100310:64"/>
ordered this Maſt to be cut down, and another to be ſet up upon the <hi>Speelwick</hi> Baſtion, which was much leſs than the other, and not near ſo high, but commanded a farther proſpect, the Baſtion it ſelf being very high, and upon a much higher ground.</p>
               <p>While I reſided in the Hoſpital at <hi>Bantam,</hi> which was ſome Months, ſeveral of our Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which we had left at <hi>Dorjaſſe,</hi> dropt in by degrees, having deſtroyed all in their way; and being all come in, they were almoſt all ſent back again to <hi>Batavia,</hi> eſpecially all the Blacks; ſo that there were not left, both within, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Caſtle, above five thouſand Men to keep the Garriſon; which was little enough for ſo great a place, it being as far as I can judge four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or. fifteen miles in circuit: and the number of its Inhabitants was computed to be 700000, beſides the Foreigners, which might amount to half the number more.</p>
               <p>Towards Land the City lies open, but to the Sea it is guarded by a very ſtrong Wall ſix yards broad; beſides ſome hundreds of Baſtions, little Forts, Redoubts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are very well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with Cannon.</p>
               <p>All things were now in good order, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment very prudently managed, ſo that all thoſe that were in the Companies Service, even the Soldiers themſelves, had no reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. But their Condition was much mended, their Proviſions were cheap, and their Uſage and Treatment very civil; and I muſt confeſs, that I had all the enjoyment I could well wiſh: But notwithſtanding all this, I was ſtill diſſatisfied and reſtleſs, and wanted to be going to viſit ſome other parts of the Indies. But it was in vain to wiſh, for I was under Obligations not to move yet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:100310:65"/>
The time now drawing near, that our Captain was to return to <hi>Batavia;</hi> a Council of War was held, where it was reſolved, that a general Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould be made, and that thoſe who had ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out their time, ſhould come out and claim their liberty: But withal notice was given them, that if they would engage themſelves afreſh, they ſhould not only be kindly received, but ſhould have their Pay raiſed by four Gilders.</p>
               <p>Then our Captain <hi>Tack</hi> went back to <hi>Batavia,</hi> to be Preſident of that City, and Captain <hi>Harzing</hi> ſucceeded him in his place of Governour of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About this time the <hi>Muck Speelers</hi> were very troubleſom about the City, and daily committing great diſorders. Their way is to make themſelves mad by eating of the Herb they call <hi>Avion, i. e.</hi> Opium: Then ye ſhall ſee 'em run about the Streets, like Men diſtracted, and kill all they meet. But our cuſtom was, as ſoon as we ſpied them a coming, to cry out <hi>Amuck, Amuck,</hi> upon which every body ſtood ready with his Weapon in his hand; and theſe Blockheads would run themſelves upon a Pike, or upon a Muſquet, and be ſhot through, and in the heat of the Fury, run it may be an hundred or two hundred paces before they dropt. And theſe Diſorders could not by any means be prevented, tho' the Company had made it death for any one to be found with any of that Herb about him, in any part of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There being now no more Action here, nor any Novelty that this Place afforded me, I was very deſirous to be gone. But I found the only way to attain my wiſh, was to get ſome Sea-Surgeon in the mind to exchange Places with me. Wherefore I waited impatiently for the coming in of any Ships that were to go to <hi>Batavia:</hi> And in a little time the <hi>Tidor,</hi> from <hi>Bali,</hi> came into the Road of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:100310:65"/>
                  <hi>Bantam.</hi> She had no ſooner caſt Anchor, but I was with her to welcome her, and to feel the Pulſes of her Surgeons; but I found their Deſigns were much the ſame as mine, and they were all diſpos'd for a longer Courſe; ſo that I found no hopes there of ſucceſs: But being told that they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Ship in toward night, if the Wind did not croſs 'em, wherein were four Maſter Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; my hopes quickly revived, and I reſolved to ſtay there that Night; in the Evening the Ship came in according to their expectation, and the next Morning early I went on board of it; and after the uſual ſalutations, I applied my ſelf to the Maſter Surgeons, and freely declared to 'em my Intentions. One of 'em, a Gentleman of <hi>Delf,</hi> at firſt liked my Propoſal, and after ſome further diſcourſe, was fully in the reſolution of changing with me, which did not a little rejoyce me. The thing being thus agreed upon, he asked leave of the Captain, after having acquainted him with his deſign; and having got his leave, he came away with me to Shore My buſineſs now was to have leave my ſelf, which indeed I had moved for at a diſtance before, but not doubting of having leave given me when-ever I ſhould deſire it, becauſe I had behaved my ſelf well; and what made more yet on my ſide, I had now and then greaſed the Chief Surgeons Fiſt: I deferr'd ſpeaking for it directly, till I had met with one that would change with me. No ſooner had I declared my Mind to the Chief Surgeon, but he gave me an ample and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable <hi>Teſtimonium</hi> to carry to the Governour, who with a Complement of Thanks, gave me a Paſs, and entred the other in my Place. So I took my leave of 'em all; and having got my Cheſt and Hammock ready, I got me a-board my new Ship, called the <hi>Enckhuyſen,</hi> it was laden with nothing but Rice, and had but twenty eight
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:100310:66"/>
Seamen, beſides the Officers, and us four Maſter-Surgeons.</p>
               <p>I parted very chearfully from <hi>Bantam,</hi> the only thing that I was loath to part with was, a little Summer-Houſe I had order'd to be made in the Garden of the Hoſpital, which was very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. It was made of Bamboos, and ſo contrived, that I might have removed it very well; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I could not move that with it, which made it ſo extream pleaſant, I left the whole ſtanding for my Succeſſor to enjoy, but not without grudging it him heartily. The Top of it was cover'd very neatly with Fig-leaves, and the Sides were ſweetly ſhaded with Pepper-planks, which hung like a Vine over the Windows, and made it extreamly agreeable. But now that I am ſpeaking of this Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, it will not be amiſs to give you a deſcription of its growth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This part of <hi>Java</hi> is the moſt famous for it, and the great <hi>Blauwe Peper Bergh,</hi> which I have ſo often mentioned, hath its denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from it, and ſignifies <hi>Blew-Pepper-Mountain,</hi> it being full of it; there the beſt of all grows. Indeed <hi>Malabar, Malacca</hi> and <hi>Sumatra</hi> do produce vaſt quantities of it too, but it is all white and long, like the <hi>Canary</hi> Pepper, and is not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the <hi>Javian</hi> Pepper for goodneſs; and for that reaſon hardly any but the latter is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <p>They plant it at the bottom of other Trees, to which it clings in the nature of our Hops, and winds round as that does, but higher. Its Leaf is like that of the Orange-Trees, but leſs, and of a more pleaſant Green, and taſts pretty ſharp if one bites 'em. The Fruit grows much like Grapes, tho' (every one knows) much ſmaller, and cloſer to one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are ever green till they dry, which is in <hi>November, December</hi> and <hi>January,</hi> at which time they gather 'em, and ſpread them upon
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100310:66"/>
Mats in the Sun to dry; then they run 'em thro' a Sieve, and pack 'em up ready for the Merchants to take away.</p>
               <p>Now, tho' Pepper is as plenty in <hi>India</hi> as Stones in the Streets, and only ſerves for Ballaſt very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and to pack up other Goods tire; and altho' ſometimes ſeveral whole Shiploads of it be thrown into the Sea, and many hundred thouſand pound weight of it burnt; yet dares no Man in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Company take one ſingle Corn of it, but every one is obliged to buy it of the Indians, who deal with the Company for it: And the ſame rule is obſervable in reſpect to other Spices. But now the <hi>Enckhuyſen</hi> lay ſtill but one day, ſo that the next morning after I had boarded her, we weighed Anchor and ſailed to <hi>Batavia,</hi> with a half wind. It lies but ſix Leagues from <hi>Bantam,</hi> yet were we ſeven days before we could reach it, for we were ever and anon forced to caſt Anchor and weigh it again, which fatigued our Men mightily.</p>
               <p>Being now come before <hi>Batavia,</hi> our Maſter went immediately on Shore, and the next day our Ship was unlading. I went to Shore too with all ſpeed in a Chineeſe <hi>Praw,</hi> and went to wait upon the Head Surgeon there, one Mr. <hi>John Streckel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berger,</hi> who was my old Acquaintance; but I found him now raiſed to the higheſt pitch of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment the Profeſſion is capable of there, which was the place of Overſeer General over all the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons in the whole Indies, in the place of Dr. <hi>Kle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer.</hi> I told him upon what deſign I had left <hi>Bantam</hi> to come to <hi>Batavia,</hi> which was in order to get me a Deputation to ſome other part of <hi>India,</hi> that I might travel farther ſtill. He ſeemed very ready at the firſt, but afterwards he deſired me to come again in three or four days time.</p>
               <p>In the mean while I went to viſit all my old Acquaintance in the Fort where I once lived, and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100310:67"/>
to divert my ſelf with 'em. But unhappily I took out an old Gentleman with me, one day, to go to a ſmall Iſland hard by, where there were a great many Oyſters; we had got a good many, but as we were coming back, it blew at ſo exceſſive a rate, that our Boat was turned over. The poor old Gentleman could not reach the Shore, meerly for want of ſtrength, and ſo loſt his Life within a hundred yards of the Land, but the old Chineeſe and I c<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me ſafe to Shore, and the Boat was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven quickly after us, ſo that we took that up. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of paying the Chineeſe, I beat him ſoundly for being the main cauſe of all this. And from that time I never ſaw him more; without doubt he run away for fear the <hi>Fiſcael</hi> ſhould call him to an account for the death of my Companion.</p>
               <p>This was the fourth time, that God in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs delivered me out of that Element of Water, once in my own Country, once in <hi>Africa,</hi> once in the River of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and this time at <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was now time to go and wait upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon General, to know what was determined as to my affair. When I came there, I was ſurpriz'd to find a Deputation to go and Board the Phoenix for <hi>Banda</hi> and <hi>Amboina,</hi> for beſides that it croſſed my deſign, which was to go to <hi>Japan;</hi> I knew that thoſe two Countries were the moſt unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all India. However, after a little pauſe I reſolved to go thither or any where, rather than to ſtay there. So taking my Orders with me, I went aboard the <hi>Enckhuyſen,</hi> and told by Brother Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons how I was ſerv'd, who inſtead of condoling with me, laught at me very heartily.</p>
               <p>I was now to be gone in two days time; ſo I made haſte and provided my ſelf with <hi>Arac, Tobacco,</hi> and Long-Pepper <hi>preſerved;</hi> all which are found to be of greater uſe in thoſe unhealthy
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100310:67"/>
parts than in any other: And having made all other neceſſary Proviſion, I went on board the Phoenix.</p>
               <p>The next day we weighed Anchor, and ſailed from <hi>Batavia,</hi> the wind <hi>N. E.</hi> paſſed the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Sunday,</hi> and in three Weeks time we arrived before <hi>Banda,</hi> which is reckon'd to be three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles from <hi>Batavia.</hi> There fell nothing out worth any notice in our paſſage thither, but that a poor Seaman was blown down by a ſudden puff of Wind from the Fore-Maſt upon the Anchor, which tore his very Guts out of his Belly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS ſoon as we were come into the Road of <hi>Banda,</hi> our Maſter went aſhore; my Legs which had been ſwell'd for three or four days, were now ſo ſore, that I could not ſtir, elſe I
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100310:68"/>
would have gone with him with all my heart; but my Indiſpoſition augmenting, I was forced to be carried aſhore. There my Swelling increaſed, all upward, and my Belly was now ſwell'd to the higheſt degree that could be, ready to break: And in this condition I continued the ſpace of three weeks, (ſo that I was left here very comfortleſs, for the Phoenix was obliged to be gone) and after that the Diſtemper ſeized me ſo in all my Limbs, that I wholly loſt the uſe of them; and during a quarter of a Year I could not bring my Finger to my Mouth; ſo that truly I deſpair'd of ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the uſe of my Limbs, (altho' I was not ſick inwardly) and therefore I often prayed to God to take me to himſelf. I was carried every day to the Bagnio, where ſeveral other Patients with me were ſet upon Seats, all in a ring, with Blankets wrapt round about us ſo cloſe, that nothing but our Heads ſtuck out; there was a great Fire of each ſide of us, which made the heat intolerable, and then we were held over the ſteem of ſome medicinal Herbs, which were boyl'd for the purpoſe; into which infuſion they threw thirty or forty red hot Cannon Bullets, which raiſed ſuch a ſteem, and made ſuch a ſmother, that not one in a hundred was able to bear it, but they were forced to be taken out, and carried away upon Quilts made for that purpoſe. I was taken out thus in the beginning, but when I came to be uſed to it a little more, I bore it out bravely, and found it very helpful. So keeping to this for ſome weeks, I recover'd apace, and then they begun to anoint my Feet with <hi>Oleum Terrae,</hi> and preſcribed me to drink frequently a ſmall Glaſs of Bitter Brandy, or Arac infuſed in Bitter Herbs; by which method, with the help of God, I perfectly recover'd.</p>
               <p>After this I went to ſatisfie my curioſity, (which was the occaſion of my coming) and to ſee the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:100310:69"/>
Country. But I ſhall decline giving any deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, becauſe it hath been done already ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently by others, eſpecially by <hi>Johan Hugen Van Linſchooten.</hi> Only I wil give you a ſhort account of the Noble Fruit which this Iſland is famous for, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nutmeg and Mace, which the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, whether Dutch, or Freemen, or Slaves, are obliged to deliver yearly to the Governour, and is ſent afterwards to <hi>Holland,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> and to <hi>Perſia,</hi> and other places of <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tree on which the Nutmeg grows, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt like the Pear-tree, but doth not ſpread ſo much, and its Leaf is ſomewhat rounder. The Fruit is much like a Peach in bigneſs and looks, of an extraordinary fine taſte, and delicate ſmell, when it is ripe: On the out-ſide is a thick hard Shell, like the Bark of a Tree, over which the Flower grows. When the Nut begins to be ripe, it ſwells ſo much, that the firſt Shell burſts open. The Flower is of fine Red, and very agreeable to look on, eſpecially when the Tree is pretty full of Fruit. Sometimes the Mace comes off of it ſelf, and when it ſticks to the Fruit, they gather all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and in the drying of the Nutmeg, the Mace drys and falls off, and changes its lively Red into that brown Yellow, which we find it hath here in <hi>Europe.</hi> The whole Fruit is very proper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and is an excellent Confite.</p>
               <p>While I was at <hi>Banda,</hi> a couple of Fellows were executed for having killed their Mother; the death they were put to was very terrible; they were faſten'd upon a Wooden Croſs, and their Limbs were broke with an Iron Bar, and there they were left to expire.</p>
               <p>After I had ſpent three Months here, in pretty good health, the Ship called the <hi>America</hi> came to <hi>Banda;</hi> ſo that having now the opportunity of compleating my Voyage, which my ſickneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:100310:69"/>
me to do with the Phoenix, I embraced it readily, and went in her for <hi>Amboina.</hi> I was glad to leave that unhealthy Country; and tho' I had, and ſhall ever carry with me ſevere tokens of the Plague of that Country, I was glad to come off ſo well as I did. In four days time we came before <hi>Amboina,</hi> where our Ship was ſtraight loaden with <hi>Cloves.</hi> I went there on ſhore to look about me; and while the Ship was lading, I had time to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine how they grew, and what I could not be an Eye-witneſs of, I had from my old Friend the Serjeant, whom I made mention of before, from whom I got thoſe Bottles of Oyl of Cloves, which coſt me ſo much care and trouble, and at the laſt I was forced to drop them into the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Clove-Tree is much like the Laurel-Tree, the Bloſſom is White at firſt, then it turns Green, and after that Red. While it is green it ſmells ſo fine and ſweet, that nothing can be compared to it. Theſe grow mighty cloſe to one another, and many of 'em together, all within the Bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom; when they are ripe they gather 'em, and dry them; then they are of a brown Yellow. Thoſe Cloves which they do not gather, as not being ripe, hang on till the year following; and thoſe they call then <hi>Moeder Nagelen,</hi> i. e. <hi>Mother Cloves.</hi> Where theſe Trees grow, there grows no kind of Graſs, or any green thing nigh; their nature being ſuch, that they draw all the moiſture about them to themſelves, and ſo do the Cloves likewiſe, as I have often ſeen my ſelf, that a Tub of Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet in a Ware-houſe that had ſtore of Cloves laid up in it, after they were pickt and cleans'd, in three or four days time the Water would be all gone out of the Tub. The ſmell of 'em is ſo ſtrong, that ſome People have been ſuffocated with it when they have been buſie with too great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of 'em, and in too cloſe a place.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:100310:70"/>
Our Ship having taken in all her Lading, we left this place, and made directly for <hi>Batavia,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there happily in a Fortnights time; where our Ship was immediately unladen, and all the Cloves put aboard the <hi>Weſt-Friezland,</hi> in order to go for <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here an Order was ſent me to change my Ship, and go in the <hi>Old Europe,</hi> the ſame Ship that brought me from the <hi>Cape</hi> to the <hi>Indies.</hi> I went with her to the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> which is a place fit for careening of Ships; where ſhe was to be fitted up, being very old. The Iſland hath its name very juſtly, <hi>Onruſt,</hi> ſignifying <hi>no reſt,</hi> by reaſon of the continual diſturbance, which the Sea cauſes to the Inhabitants, who are only Carpenters, Smiths, and other ſuch Artificers for Shipping. For the Iſland being very low, and the Sea Ebbing and Flowing every two hours, at very uncertain heights, gives the Inhabitants no reſt or ſecurity: And every new and full Moon, the Sea drives 'em up a vaſt way; but ſo unſixt are its Bounds, that they are forced to be continually upon their Guard: Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the great labour, and great quantity of work that lies upon their hands, makes it truly very reſtleſs for them.</p>
               <p>There were two Maſter Surgeons beſides me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the ſame Ship, and we had all our Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents aſhore: The only paſtime we could have, was catching of Tortoiſes, of which there are vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers there. When it is fair, and the Sun ſhines bright, they come out of the Water, and lie in the hot Sand. So when they were all very quiet and ſettled, we came upon them of a ſudden with Sticks and Iron Bars, and turned them upon their Backs, as faſt as we could, for then they cannot ſtir. When we had done catching 'em ſo, we took them out of their ſhells, and put them in Pickle, and kept them in Barrels or Pots, with Salt and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:100310:70"/>
Vineger. This was our daily Food, and very good, but ſome of 'em are far better than other ſome. The biggeſt we caught was more than three Men could compaſs, and a loaded Wagon might ſafely have gone over it without breaking it.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe, there are alſo a great many Sharks, which do much miſchief; of which I gave you an inſtance before in the poor Chineeſe, that was diving for Iron, and was devoured by 'em. There is much fiſhing for 'em. And the manner of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them is, by baiting ſeveral very large ſtrong Hooks, with the whole Liver of ſome other Fiſh, which the Sharks will not fail to ſwallow Hook and all, being extream greedy, and ſo they are taken. The Tail is all that is eaten of this Fiſh, and that is not very palatable neither; but the whole is eaten ſometimes by Seamen, in caſe of neceſſity, for want of other meat: But its Liver is very uſeful for many things in Surgery.</p>
               <p>Our Ship being now thoroughly refitted, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to our old Anchoring Place at <hi>Batavia;</hi> where we found a Ship newly come from <hi>Holland,</hi> that had not yet caſt all her Anchors. I took in all haſt a Chineeſe <hi>Praw,</hi> and went on board of her to ſee if I could not meet with any old Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance there, and to hear ſome News from our Country: And there I heard the firſt account of <hi>Stransbourgh</hi> being taken by the French, which was a very great ſurprize to us.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as our Ship had taken in all Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries here, ſhe was ordered to ſail for <hi>Ceylon,</hi> at which I was mighty joyful, and accordingly I recrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf with Proviſions, and went on board: Then we left <hi>Batavia</hi> with the firſt fair Wind, and in five Weeks time we happily arrived before <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi> which is the Chief City of the Dutch in <hi>Ceylon.</hi> It is one of the moſt commodious Ports of any in the Indies, where Ships may lie ſafe many
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:100310:71"/>
years, and come in at will, with the Sea-wind, and run out when they pleaſe, with a <hi>Land-wind.</hi> Yet there are a great many Rocks there, but they are only dangerous to Strangers; for which reaſon, when a Ship comes thither, that hath never been there before, ſhe is obliged to fire three Guns; whereas if he is acquainted with the place, he need fire but one. This is ſtraight anſwer'd by a Gun from a Watch-Tower, that is on one of the higheſt Rocks, about two miles diſtance from the City, where there is always a Pilot, and his Men ready, who as ſoon as they ſpy a Ship coming, diſplay a Flag in token that they muſt come no further, and then they go and bring the Ship in.</p>
               <p>At the Mouth of the Haven lies a Fort or Caſtle, called <hi>'t Swart,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Black Fort.</hi> It was firſt built by the Portugueze, but under a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence of building a thing of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature. For when the King of <hi>Candy,</hi> who could at that time have prevented their work, ſent to know what they were about; they told him they were only building a Play-houſe, and under that colour carried on their work, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it with large pieces of Cannon, which they brought to Shore in great Hogſheads; and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came able to maintain themſelves there.</p>
               <p>I do not deſign to enter upon a deſcription of this Iſland, becauſe it hath been done very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by others, and eſpecially by <hi>Chr. Schwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zor,</hi> whoſe Relation is now publiſhed with mine, to which I refer you.</p>
               <p>While our Ship was lading with Cinnamon, and ſeveral other Rich Commodities, I went on Shore moſt of the time; where I took my diet at a Freemans Houſe, where I had it extream good, and well ordered, and for a very ſmall price.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:100310:71"/>
The great Commodity of this Iſland is Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which is the Bark of a Tree, much of the bigneſs of an Olive Tree; the Leaves are much like the Laurel, but ſomewhat ſmaller; the Flower it bears is white, and the Fruit is like the Black Olives of <hi>Portugal.</hi> The Tree hath two Barks, the Cinnamon is the inner one of them, which is peeled off the Tree, and cut in ſquare pieces; then laid in the Sun to dry, which makes it rowl up together, as we ſee it in <hi>Europe,</hi> and changes its colour, which is at firſt near upon Aſh-colour, into what we find it of here.</p>
               <p>When the Trees are peeled in this manner, they are let alone for three years, in which time they have regained their Coats as before. The Trees grow wild, without planting and cultivating, and make a ſort of Coppice of themſelves; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no other hand than that of Nature to make them beneficial to Man.</p>
               <p>There is beſides this, a ſort of Cinnamon, that grows in <hi>Malabar,</hi> and is called <hi>Canella de Matte,</hi> but it is a baſtard kind, and nothing near ſo good.</p>
               <p>None of the Spices, neither the Cinnamon I have been ſpeaking of, nor the Cloves, Mace, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, Saffron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be carried away by any private Perſon upon pain of death: And it hath coſt ſome Men their Lives for attempting to bring them over; as I ſaw an inſtance of one who had got a ſmall parcel of <hi>Borrobone,</hi> in order to take with him home, and was executed for the fact. This <hi>Borrobone</hi> is a Root growing in great plenty in <hi>Iava,</hi> and is made uſe of inſtead of Saffron by all the Inhabitants; and it hath all the Vertues of the beſt Oriental Saffron; it is cut and dried, and looks like Ginger.</p>
               <p>The other Great and Rich Commodity of this Place is Pearls, which they fiſh for after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, The Company hath ſome thouſands of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100310:72"/>
for that purpoſe, which are divided into ſo many Companies, and to each of them there is an Overſeer. Theſe Men are all divided, ſo many to each Boat, and ſo they go to the Oyſter. Banks; where ſtripping themſelves, every one of them tie a ſmall Basket round their middle: Then they bind a piece of a certain Root they have, that is very hollow, and of an Oyly ſubſtance before their Mouths, ſo that it reſiſts the water a good while, and gives them ſome time to breath. In this manner you ſhall ſee 'em all go down with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful quickneſs to the very bottom; where they fill their little Baskets with Oyſters, then come up again as nimbly as may be; and when they have a good quantity of 'em, they carry them to Shore, where they lay 'em out in the Sun; there they open of themſelves, and in them are found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times many Pearls, ſometimes none at all.</p>
               <p>Some of theſe Divers, more skilful than the reſt, will, without the help of thoſe Roots, keep under water almoſt as long as they that uſe them.</p>
               <p>When their days work is over, they come to Shore all together in good order, delivering faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully all the Pearls they have got to the Officers that are appointed by the Company, which finds all theſe Men with Proviſions, and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and allows ſome of them pretty good Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries beſides.</p>
               <p>In the whole fiſhing Seaſon it cannot be but, there muſt happen ſeveral accidents, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men loſe their Lives in the Sea among the Rocks; you hear almoſt daily of ſome ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and every day gives ſubject of lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and complaint to ſome new made Widow or Orphan. Yet notwithſtanding all this, there is no want of Men, ready to take to ſerve in this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous employment, ſome being forced into it by the Dutch, and others by their neceſſities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:100310:72"/>
The Oyſters in which the Pearls are found, are fine, white and ſmooth; I have known 'em find three hundred and odd of Pearls in one of 'em. When they have a mind to give them a fine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, they take Rice, and beat it to duſt with Salt, and rub them with that, and it makes them as bright as Chriſtal, and ſo they will continue.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Oyſter in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which is called by the Inhabitants <hi>Changa,</hi> by us <hi>Mother of Pearl;</hi> this they poliſh very fine, and make fine drinking Cups of it. It is alſo of great uſe for many Ornaments, eſpecially that which comes out of <hi>China, Bengal, Ormus, Gammaron,</hi> &amp;c. as we ſee moſt frequently on thoſe pieces of work, that come from thence into theſe parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is likewiſe another manner of fiſhing, which is more tedious, and therefore leſs uſed. Yet I have ſeen it practiſed in a River that was thirty or forty Fathoms deep. Two Ships were laid aſide of one another, at about eight or ten yards diſtance; and a Beam being laid acroſs them, whereon there is a large Pully fix'd; they hang a large Bell thereon, in which the Man ſits, (upon a croſs Seat fix'd within the Bell) and ſo the Bell is let down; there is a little ringing Bell fixt upon the top of the Beam, and the Man hath a Cord with him faſten'd to that, and to his Body; as ſoon as he finds the Air begins to fail him, he pulls that little Bell, which is a token to the reſt to pull him up; and when he hath clear'd that place, they move a little further, and fix there again till they have got all they can.</p>
               <p>Having ſpent my time aſhore, I went on board again, and then the other Maſter-Surgeon took his turn, and I went no more on ſhore, but only once, when my Comrade ſent me word, that there was an Elephant of the Governor's was to ſhew a great many Tricks, of which I have given you a relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before.</p>

In a matter of five Weeks time, all our buſineſs being done in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> we all got aboard, and ſet ſail for <hi>Batavia</hi> again, where under the Almighty's Protection we arrived ſafe, after a kind Voyage of three Weeks. But we were no ſooner arrived, and caſt our Anchors, but we fell into an extream dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Our Butler, according to cuſtom, and by the <hi>Skipper</hi>'s Order, went down to fetch ſome Arack for the Seamen, and as he was drawing it out of the Bunghole, with a ſort of ſmall Pump, which they had for that purpoſe, either by a Snuff of the Candle, or by the Candle it ſelf, the Arack took fire; and that ſpreading like Lightning, ſet the whole on ſire; for the European Brandy doth not burn near ſo violently as Arack doth. All our Men were immediately at work to put it out, but all in vain: It got a head after ſo furious a manner, that it ſet fire on the Ship it ſelf, and it was not long e're that was all in a flame. We had then nothing more to do, but to look after our ſelves, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſave our own lives; and it was a great mercy we could do that, for we could not ſave the leaſt parcel of our Goods, nor one of our Cheſts, much leſs any of the Company's Goods. This was a mighty loſs to the Company, who had abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Cinnamon, and rich Cinnamon-Oyl on board, all which helpt its own deſtruction, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the Fire: For no ſooner had we left the Ship our ſelves, but the fire took in the Powder-room, where there was ſome Tuns of Powder, which blew up the Ship and tore it all to pieces, and threw ſome of its Cannon above a quarter of a mile up into the Air. Thus, when we thought our ſelves ſecure, and paſt all danger, and pleaſed our ſelves with the thoughts of our ſucceſs, we were all on a ſudden mortified with this great ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and all our Joys deſtroyed, with the utmoſt peril of all our Lives. But God be praiſed, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:100310:73"/>
no Man got any harm, but every one of 'em were ſaved by means of a good number of Small Boats that were ſent to our Relief. The Butler, who had been the occaſion of this, was ſeized by the Judge Advocate, and for ought I know, was forced to ſerve the Company all his life long for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
               <p>After this I had Orders ſent me to go upon the Fort, called the <hi>Hollandia,</hi> which is by the New Gate. There I had the care of the Sick and Wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and was ſet over a Young Man, whom I had formerly known at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> and was here mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Daughter of one of the <hi>Kaſtizen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Kaſtizens</hi> are thoſe that had a Dutch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and an Indian Mother. When an European marries one of theſe <hi>Kaſtizees,</hi> and hath any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by her, they are called <hi>Maſtizees;</hi> and theſe may wear the ſame Garb that the Dutch uſe. Of this latter ſort, there are many thouſands in and about <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An Old Freeman, whom I uſed to converſe with frequently, and was very intimate with, undertook once in friendſhip to adviſe me to marry one of thoſe <hi>Maſtizins;</hi> who, as he told me, was worth above forty thouſand Gilders. This proffer did not much diſpleaſe me, but it was an Old Woman, he told me, and the Widow of an European Officer, who had ſerved the Company. Hearing of her Age, made me not ſo eager to ſee her as I was at firſt, when he proffered to carry me to her. But the very ſeeing of her diſguſted me ſo much from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and my Friend, that I never had a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable thought of him ever after. I thought at the firſt of her, that it was an Ape of the larger ſize, that had been the wonder and paſtime of Mankind for ſome hundred years: And asking him, whether he thought me fit for nothing but the procreation of Baboons, I left him in a
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:100310:74"/>
mighty paſſion, and would not ſo much as ſpeak a word more about the matter.</p>
               <p>When an European deſigns to marry any of thoſe People, He and the Woman muſt appear before the Preſident of the Council, and bring their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, (which are to be drawn up and ſigned by a Publick Notary) to him, to have his conſent to the conſummation of the Marriage; likewiſe a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of the Goods of each of them muſt be ſhewed him, and regiſtred: And when they have obtained leave, the Wedding is generally kept about a fortnight after.</p>
               <p>Beſides, that this baulk had turned my Stomach for ſome time againſt Matrimony, I was not very much inclined to it, becauſe a Man is obliged to ſettle, and ſpend his life in <hi>India.</hi> For I had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be going further ſtill; and by the means of ſome Preſents, now and then, to obtain leave to go to <hi>Japan.</hi> For which purpoſe having made ſome cloſe applications, and uſed the means I mentioned juſt now, I after ſome time had orders to get me ready to go thither, on board the Ship called the <hi>Aſia,</hi> which was to go in a fortnight to <hi>Formoſa,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Japan.</hi> So I went and provided my ſelf with all neceſſaries for that Voyage, it being no ſmall one.</p>
               <p>According to the Orders given, we ſet ſail in the Name of God, on St. <hi>Steven</hi>'s day, with ſo fair a <hi>South-wind,</hi> that by the next morning we were got three miles beyond the great Iſland <hi>Java,</hi> and paſſed by the ſmall Iſland <hi>Carouſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next day we ſaw the famous Coaſt of the Iſland <hi>Borneo,</hi> and leaving that on the right and <hi>Temabo, Tumbolan</hi> and <hi>Ananibo</hi> on the left, we ſteerd our Courſe between them, till we came into the open Sea of <hi>Paragoa;</hi> where leaving <hi>China</hi> on the left of us, we ſailed directly upon <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa.</hi> But e're we could reach it, we had very
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:100310:74"/>
bad weather for ſome days, and were in extream danger; for beſides that, the Sea it ſelf is one of the moſt dangerous by reaſon of the many Rocks there; we went thro' one of the dreadfulleſts Storms that was almoſt ever known; inſomuch that we loſt both Bolt-Sprit, and Sprit-ſail, and one other Sail. As we were drove to this extremity, our Maſter and Steerſman adviſed together, whether they ſhould not make what way they could to an Iſland that lay on the right Hand, and within ſight of us, to ſee if by that means we might not ſave the Men and Cargo. So it was agreed upon, that we ſhould make thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with only our Mainſail, But the night com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us, before we could come near it, we loſt all hopes of ſafety; for the Tempeſt increaſed with the darkneſs of the night, and we were moſt of us in deſpair of our Lives, and for my part I never was leſs fond of Travelling, than at that time.</p>
               <p>Yet my hope was, that as God had often preſerved me from Eminent dangers before, ſo he would not forſake me then in this Condition; Thus we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till near Morning, when our Seamen concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome hopes of attaining to Land, and accordingly by break of day, we diſcovered the Iſland <hi>Manilba</hi> within two Miles of us, and by the help of the Light we made ſhift to weather the Gulf of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nilba,</hi> which as ſoon as we were got into, we gave God Almighty thanks for his great Preſervation.</p>
               <p>Here we reſitted our Ship as well as we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and got a new <hi>Maſt,</hi> and in Eight days time we ſet Sail again with a fair wind Early in the morning, ſo that by next day we left <hi>China</hi> on the left, and the next Morning were in ſight of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſa,</hi> whither we came on ſafe, and caſt our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors before the Fort, called the <hi>Zealand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Maſter went aſhore, and did all his buſineſs in a fortnights time; during which time I was moſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:100310:75"/>
upon Land, but it being needleſs for me to give any Account of that place, which hath been ſo Amply deſcribed by others; I will wave it, and purſue our Journey.</p>
               <p>We ſet Sail again with a fair wind, and ſail'd for Three days along the vaſt Coaſt of <hi>China,</hi> which we had ſtill on the left of us, and when we came before <hi>Cucheu</hi> we caſt our Anchors, and lay ſtill Two days there.</p>
               <p>And then continued our Courſe, ſo that the next day we paſſed by the Iſland of <hi>Chanquoiſh,</hi> and Steering between the Iſland of <hi>Fuego,</hi> &amp;c. We in few days came before the City of <hi>Nangato,</hi> where we again returned God thanks, for having brought us thro' that dangerous Voyage. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our ſhip was ſo tattered, and that we had loſt 14 of our Men; and had 20 ſick, among thoſe of us that were left.</p>
               <p>We were forced to leave our Chaplain behind us at <hi>Batavia,</hi> for the Javians will not ſuffer any Nation to bring any of their Teachers along with them into their Territorys. So that we were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to make uſe of one of the graveſt of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who was Aſſigned to read Prayers daily in the Ship, and aſſoon as we came to caſt our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, we had ſtrict Orders given by the Maſter to hide the Book very carefully, that had been uſed in the Voyage; and to keep all other Religious Books cloſe out of ſight, leſt we ſhould go in danger of our Lives, if they ſhould diſcover any of 'em about us.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>VVE had ſcarcely dropt our Anchors before <hi>Nangato,</hi> but we had ſome Japonneeſes Boarding us with their <hi>Canows.</hi> They viſited our Ship from Top to Bottom, by Order of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and according to their Cuſtom, ſecured all our Sails, and all our Powder and Bullets; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted our Cannon, and took off ſome of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Tackle of our Ship, and carried them on Shore with them. Thus they ſerve all the Ships that come thither, and thus they had done to 3 or 4 Engliſh and French Ships, that lay there: But every bit they take away is faithfully returned, when they are ready to go off again.</p>
               <p>When we had begun to unlade, a parcel of Japon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeſes came to us to offer us ſome Women, and askt us, if we would not have ſome of 'em while
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:100310:76"/>
we ſtay'd there: But no body hearkned to their Propoſal but the Maſter, and the Book-keeper.</p>
               <p>The goods were unladen by the Japonneeſes, of which a certain number is allotted to each Ship: So that our Men had little or nothing to do. The Maſter went on Shore, as ſoon as the Ship was come nearer to the Town, and lay'd up there: But he came back every day an Hour at leaſt, or Two, before night: For all the while that we lay here, the Japonneeſes held a continual Watch aboard all the Ships that were in the Port. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undertake to give you a large Account of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan,</hi> becauſe it would require a larger Volume then I intend; nor do I think it neceſſary, becauſe ſo many have done it before me; but what I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved moſt particularly amongſt 'em, will, I hope, be ſufficient to ſatisfy the Readers Curioſity.</p>
               <p>When I came on Shore, the firſt place I entred into, was a publick houſe, where they drunk Tea, and that very plentifully; having reſted there a while with my Companions, we went to take a view of the Town; where we ſaw abundance of Joyners, and Japanners Shops, ſet out with Wonderful vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of rich and Exquiſite work, as <hi>Scrutores Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets</hi> &amp;c. inlay'd with ſilver and gold, and moſt admirably lackerd, all which made as fine a Show, as ever I ſaw. Some of theſe pieces of Work were valued at ſome Thouſands of Gilders. In that kind of Work they out-do all Indians whatever, and indeed in all manner of Ingenuity and Cunning, inſomuch that it was a Proverb among the Dutch, that <hi>tho' a Dutch Man was Cunning, be might go to School to a Japoneeſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They do not trouble themſelves with Linnen or Silk Manufactures; by reaſon that they are brought over to them in ſuch abundance from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:100310:76"/>
that they have 'em as Cheap, as in the places where they are made.</p>
               <p>Our Ship the <hi>Aſia,</hi> was laden with ſuch kind of things, and took in Exchange, what <hi>Japan</hi> affords, as Copper Stafetiens, Silver, Gold <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Manner of Saluting us ſeemed very ſtrange to me at firſt; for whereas the Chineeſes, and other Eaſt-Indians uſed to ſhew their reſpect by clapping their hands together againſt their Breaſt or Fore-head, theſe People pull'd off their Shoes, and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves down on the Ground, for they look upon it as the greateſt piece of Incivility to receive any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Standing.</p>
               <p>Whereas other Nations think fair Hair, and white Teeth great Ornaments; theſe are of a quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Opinion, and think none agreable, but thoſe who have the Blackeſt Hair and Teeth: and they uſe all the Art they can to make them ſo; their Notion in this being directly oppoſite to ours, take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Black to be the Livery of Mirth and Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and white of Grief and Mourning. They have but very little Hair on their Heads, being always carefull to pluck it out by the Roots from their Youth. In ſhort, all their Cuſtoms, Language, Dreſs <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is as different as can be from all other People.</p>
               <p>There is a certain Antipathy between them and the Chineeſes, they cannot bear with one another; when they go to War againſt the <hi>Tartars</hi> or the <hi>Chineeſes,</hi> they never give Ground, and will ſooner be Cut into a Thouſand pieces than Fly: and if Thouſands, 10 or 100000 are Cut down, they are immediately Recruited: For their Law forbids them to yield to, or Flee from, any Enemy. Their Countrey is ſo Populous, that one who hath not ſeen it cannot hardly believe it</p>
               <p>The Sea Port of <hi>Nangato,</hi> was at our firſt coming ſo full of Birds, that it was almoſt covered with 'em,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:100310:77"/>
and all the Ships that lay there as it were Blockt up with them; they were very Tame, inſomuch that as our Boats went to and fro to Land, they would but juſt give us way: the Reaſon of that vaſt Quantity is, becauſe they never kill any of 'em to Eat, for their Law forbids them ſtrictly to Eat any thing that is Tame, as Oxen, Cows, Hens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But any thing that is Wild, they may and do Eat. So that theſe Fowls being harmleſs, as well as Tame, they do not ſo much as diſturb them; which makes 'em Increaſe to that prodigious number. They are in Shape and Colour much like our wild Pigeons, and have the ſame feet with Ducks.</p>
               <p>The night before I was reſolved to go on Board again, there fell out an unlucky Accident in our Ship. Some of the Seamen had ſaved their Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Arack</hi> for ſome days, deſigning to have a good Quantity together for Punch, and the place where they went to drink it being very dark, they got themſelves a Lamp, which they lighted, and Imprudently hung up upon one of their Hammocks; One of them being a little Intoxicated, and lazy, lay'd himſelf down in that Hammock, and the reſt of the Company preſſing him to drink in his Turn, he did now and then take his Cup, but at laſt his hand growing more and more unſteady, he ſpilt part of his Cup over the Lamp; which by Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune hung over their Bowl. So that the whole taking Fire, and they not in a Capacity to look carefully about them, the Fire took hold of the Hammocks, and burnt ſeveral of them. But by the Aſſiſtance of the other Seamen it was happily ſtopt from doing any further Damage.</p>
               <p>The men who had occaſioned this were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately clapt up in Irons: And ſome days after they were brought to publick Puniſhment, according to the Cuſtom of the Sea: Which was to receive from every
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:100310:77"/>
Perſon of the Ship 90 Blows on the Breech, with an Anchor Rope.</p>
               <p>And had the Maſter not been very favourable, it would have fared much harder with them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as mild as the puniſhment was, it made them in ſuch a Condition, that they were forced to keep their Beds for ſeveral Weeks; and moſt like to Die: Neither could any of 'em eaſe Nature, or make Water, for ſeveral days.</p>
               <p>While we lay here, I was Invited on Board an Engliſh Merchant-Man, and there had great proffers made me if I would have gone along with them; the proffer was the more Advantagious, becauſe they had loſt their Surgeon in the Voyage, and had but a Young raw Boy with them that could hardly ſpread a Plaiſter. But I would by no means heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to their Propoſal, becauſe it was as much as my Life was worth, and what was yet more, I ſhould have been Perjured if I had accepted of it, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the Company.</p>
               <p>In this Port dyed three of our Men, and a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters Boy. Some Japonneeſes carried them out of the Harbour in a ſmall Boat, into open Sea, where they threw 'em over: For they are ſo far from ſuffering any Forreigners to be Buried among them, that they will not permit them to be thrown ſo much as in the Water that is near them. We had here ſuch a Terrible Storm all on a ſudden, that if our Ship had not been well provided with Anchors, and the Tempeſts laſted but a very little while; it had certainly been loſt. For in that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while, of four Anchors that we had, we loſt Two.</p>
               <p>The Engliſh Ship I was juſt now ſpeaking of, foundered, at that time 7 of her Men were drowned, and the reſt very hardly eſcaped. The next day they refitted our Ship again; during which time, I had an opportunity of going on Shore again for three or Four days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:100310:78"/>
In that time there happened to come ſome Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers to <hi>Nangato,</hi> who ſhewed the fineſt and the moſt dexterous Tricks that I ever ſaw, both of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerdemain, and of Activity of Body; but of what they Showed of the latter an Inſtance or two, will not be unacceptable. One of theſe Fellows had a Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boo Cane, of about 6 foot length tied to his Middle, and as he was Standing ſtill, another Fellow leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a ſudden with his feet upon his Shoulders, climbed up to the Top of the Cane; and there lay'd himſelf out at length upon the Knob, which was on the top of the Cane, of about the bigneſs of a Gooſe's Egg, ſtretching out his Arms and Leggs, and whiring round 3 or 4 times. The Man upon whom the Cane was tied faſt, walking all the while to and fro, and never offering to touch the Cane with his hand.</p>
               <p>After this there came a ſecond who ſtood upon his head, with his feet directly up in the Air, and then a third came and got up and ſtood upon the Soles of his feet.</p>
               <p>Then another ſet himſelf firm upon his Leggs, and there came one of them and ſtood upon his head, with his feet up in the Air.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they took a Board all ſtuck with ſharp Nails about two ſpans length; over which a Fellow raiſed himſelf upon his hands ſo neatly, that his head did not touch one of the Spikes. Theſe Tricks being ſomewhat extraordinary, and far more ſurpriſing than what I have yet ſeen in Europe, I thought it might not be amiſs to give you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them, tho' I am ſenſible that ſome who think all Impoſſible which they have not ſeen, will be apt to cenſure it, rather than believe it.</p>
               <p>This laſt time of my being aſhore, I chanced to come by one of their Religious Aſſemblys, into which my Curioſity led me to go, in hopes of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:100310:78"/>
ſome ſtrange Cuſtom: But there was nothing ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry peculiar. There only came in one of their Prieſts, who ſet himſelf down in the midſt of the place, and a great many People being gathered about him, he made a kind of Sermon or Oration to them, which I hearkned to very diligently; but could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a word of what he ſaid. Nor would any one of that Aſſembly give me any anſwer when I asked them what it was that he had been ſaying to them, but all went off like Mutes; they do not at all care to enter into any diſcourſe with Chriſtians concerning Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which I often attempted to bring them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And indeed it is not ſafe for Chriſtians to talk to them on that Subject, as we had all ſufficiently been Informed 'ere we came to Land here. Yet I could not forbear to touch a little a upon't ſometimes, with one particular Acquaintance I had got there, who was a grave, ſober, underſtanding Man: And he would often expreſs very favourable Sentiments of the Chriſtian Religion, and did not ſtick to tell me once (fetching a deep ſigh) that he wiſhed he could be at liberty to Embrace it, but withal conjuring me not to diſcover him; becauſe it would coſt him his Life, if it was known that he had ſuch a deſire.</p>
               <p>My time now grew ſhort; and I made haſte to buy what I wanted; but when I came to look about in their Shops and Ware-houſes, I was ſo Tempted with the ſight of their Fine-works that I bought a great deal more than I at firſt deſigned to do. What I bought, tho' of the Fineſt-work, I had exceeding Cheap: Which was another Encouragement to me to lay out my Money. Theſe Work-men are but very poor, as indeed all the Trades-men in the Country are. Some of 'em do not live better than Beggers, and a little Charity Tranſports them into ſuch humble Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments, that if at any time I gave any of 'em the value of Two-pence of our money, I could
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100310:79"/>
hardly keep them from falling upon their knees before me to thank me. There is no middle Rank of Men among them, of any value, even the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants being not lookt upon: But on the other ſide, their Gentry or Nobility are valued and Reſpected at a more than ordinary Rate: And in their gate and behaviour one may obſerve ſuch a Grandeur, or rather Haughtineſs, as is ſcarce to be ſeen any where elſe.</p>
               <p>Our Ship being now full laden with Copper, Lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er'd work, Jappan-money, and other Commoditys, the Japponeeſes came again to us, firſt to viſit the Ship, and then reſtored us all our Cannon, Powder and Bullets, and our Sails; all which they brought us on Board again, and the next day, we ſet ſail out of the Port, tho' it ſnowed hard, and the Wind was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Rough.</p>
               <p>The next Morning we ſaw three Suns in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens; but the Brightneſs of the two unuſual Phoeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menas the two ſeeming Suns was not comparable to that of the real Sun; all three of them were ſeen within a large Rainbow.</p>
               <p>The 2d. 3d. and 4th day we failed by the Iſland <hi>Ximo,</hi> and coming to a ſmall Iſland of about 6 miles compaſs, we caſt Anchor, to wait there for a Wind. Some our Men went on Shore, and brought back ſome Eggs with 'em, which Water-fowls lay uſually about the Shore. They were as large as Geeſe eggs, and we found 'em extraordinary good.</p>
               <p>The next day we went off with a good Wind; 2 or 3 days after, we were all of us Surprized to ſee ſomething Floating, and hundreds of Fowl upon it; but coming nearer to it, we found it was a vaſt big Fiſh, cover'd with thoſe Birds.</p>
               <p>We found here but 18 or 20 fathoms Water; ſo that we were dayly and continually forced to uſe the Plummet: Till a freſh Storm came upon us which obliged us with all ſpeed to hand all our ſails.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:100310:79"/>
The Tempeſt was ſo furious for a time, that we thought no otherwiſe but we ſhould have been ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up: But God Almighty, whoſe Compaſſions never fail towards them that call upon him faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was pleaſed to deliver us out of our diſtreſs, by ſtilling the Winds, and after ſome time we came to a ſmall low ſandy Iſland, called <hi>Kruys Iſland,</hi> where we dropt 2 of our Anchors.</p>
               <p>In this ſtreſs of Weather we loſt one Man, who was Toſſed off the Maintop Maſt into the Sea. The Billows carried him quite out of our ſight, elſe we had been obliged by our Sea Articles to have put out the long Boat and to have gone after him, tho' we run the risk of looſing all the Men of the Ship. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we could not ſee him, we were not obliged to ſeek after him; and it was more prudent to give him over for loſt, than to venture 7 or 8 Men more when there was no Proſpect of doing any good.</p>
               <p>It Snowed very hard: ſo that we lay ſtill here 2 days, and on the 3d. day, we ſet ſail directing our Courſe towards <hi>Formoſa.</hi> In our way thither we came by a large Rock almoſt cover'd o're with Fowl, we went up to it with our long Boat, and caught above a hundred of 'em: if we would have ſtayed a while, we might have caught thouſands, for they hardly fled away from us: But moſt of 'em crept into their neſts, which were nothing, but the natural Cavitys of the Rock, without any ſtraw or any kind of Lining in them; they being ſo eaſy to come at, made us conclude, that they had hardly ever been diſturbed by any Man.</p>
               <p>At Noon our Steers-man took the Suns altitude, by which we found that we were within 40 Leagues of the Iſland <hi>Formoſa,</hi> whither we were Steering. It was as fine Weather, as we could wiſh; but the Wind being againſt us, we were forced to clap upon the Wind to make the beſt of it, and get a little forward,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100310:80"/>
till we came to have the Wind upon the beam, which in 3 days time brought us before the Road of <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> There we put ſome Rice aſhore, and ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but a day and a half, and at night we put out of the Bay, Firing 3 Guns to take our leave. While our Gunner was doing this, he had left a meaſure of Powder in the Boys hands who ſtood behind him, and a Seaman coming by with a Pipe of Tabacco in his Mouth, going to peep into the Powder caſe, let fall ſome of his Tobacco amongſt it, which burnt him dreadfully, and threw the Boy backwards to the ground. It was well this did not happen in a greater parcel, and that there was no more harm done. But for this the Seaman was taken, and was ſeverely puſs'd: That is done by laying 'em flat on their Belly, and ſtricking them with a Rope acroſs the Breech.</p>
               <p>The next day we Steer'd between two high Rocks, that were about half a League aſunder: The Wind from that time continued fair for us during the ſpace of 8 days, in which we paſſed by the Iſland <hi>Manilha,</hi> then we came into a Wind, which was very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us; for it filled the Air with naſty ſtuff as thick as Snow, this Wind came over ſome ſmall Iſlands that lay 2 Miles on the South of us, which are called the <hi>Stof Elyanden.</hi> When the Wind is pretty high, and ſits in that corner, if a Ship goes too near them, it is almoſt enough to Smother Men. But God be thanked we came ſafe thro' it, and with a favourable Wind came into the Sea of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua;</hi> we kept on our Courſe to <hi>Borneo,</hi> and from thence to Great <hi>Java,</hi> whence we quickly reach'd <hi>Batavia;</hi> which happily compleated our Voyage in 5 Months.</p>
               <p>Being Arrived, our Ship was unladen: Our ſick Men carried to the Hoſpital, and I at the ſame time went on Shore, and took all my Medicaments with
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:100310:80"/>
me, but we had not been here above a fortnight, but an opportunity offerd it ſelf to me, either to go along with a ſmall Fleet to the Straight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> or elſe with another which was to cruiſe between <hi>Malacca</hi> and <hi>Sumatra.</hi> I had my choice, and having declared my deſire rather to go with the latter, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived my Commiſſion. The reaſon why theſe two ſmall Squadrons were ſent thither was, becauſe we were informed, that the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> being diſguiſed at the diſturbance we had given them in <hi>Bantam,</hi> were coming out againſt us.</p>
               <p>After we had been ſome Weeks a Cruiſing there, now toward <hi>Sumatra,</hi> then towards <hi>Mallaca,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to the Iſland <hi>St. Maurice</hi> and <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Meeting with any either French or Engliſh, Captain <hi>Vander Bors,</hi> who was our <hi>Commadore</hi> or <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,</hi> reſolved to go with the Fleet to <hi>Achem,</hi> and to lye ſtill there, only he orderd that one Ship ſhould be Cruiſing about, and bring Intelligence, and the whole Squadron which conſiſted of 11 Ships ſhould take it by turns.</p>
               <p>While we lay here we had a moſt dreadful Storm for the ſpace of 6 whole days. The <hi>Sciam</hi> was caſt away, Men and all, except a few of 'em. The <hi>Zealand</hi> having loſt all her Anchors, was drove upon a Shelf, where ſhe ſtuck. We went in haſte to help her Men, and we did ſave ſome of 'em: But at laſt the two long Boats which we had ſent to their Relief being Toſſed violently againſt each other, Split in pieces, and all the Men in them were drowned, which were about 130.</p>
               <p>As for our Ship, we were forced to Swaddle it with a four double Cable Rope, leſt it ſhould have Split, by the violence of the Waves, and to keep conſtantly Pumping, ſix and ſix at a time, changing Men every quarter of an hour. And whereas one Man uſed to ſuffice at the helm, we were forced to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100310:81"/>
have 10 to keep our Anchors from twiſting altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and breaking. The worſt of this was, that we were not far from Land, and we were juſt of the Windward of'm: For we had been much ſafer if we had been in open Sea. But that is ſafe enough every where which God takes into his keeping, and it pleaſed him at the end of 6 days to ſend us a fine Calm again, wherefore we went immediately to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and gave God thanks that he had thus deliverd us.</p>
               <p>The next thing we did was to give the Men ſome Refreſhment, one chief part of which is always a good portion of <hi>Arack,</hi> and that being done we ſent word to <hi>Batavia,</hi> what a poor condition we were in, to which we had for anſwer, that we might come away for <hi>Java</hi> again: For that two Ships were lately come thither from <hi>Holland,</hi> which had brought information, that there was no report there of any likely-hood of War, and that we needed not to fear it in thoſe Parts: But only that <hi>England</hi> required ſome Millions of Money from <hi>Holland,</hi> for the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the Engliſh had ſuſtained by their means in <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam;</hi> and that in caſe the Dutch did not come to a Compoſition, a War would moſt certainly follow.</p>
               <p>While we lay ſtill before <hi>Achem,</hi> I went often to Shore to refreſh my ſelf with the excellent Fruits of that Country. The Religion, Manners Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of that People are much the ſame with the <hi>Javians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a Village not far from thence, where none but Fiſher-men live, I ſaw Men that had one of their Leggs as big as moſt Mens middles; when they uſed to hold them up, it would Shade their whole Body from the Sun, and yet would theſe Men run as faſt as Horſes. I ſometimes layd my hand on thoſe Leggs of theirs, and they felt juſt like a Spunge.</p>
               <p>By that Village runs a very fair and pleaſant Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which empties it ſelf into the Sea, near the place where we lay at Anchor, along the ſides of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100310:81"/>
which are a great many ſtrange Tree, which bear a Fruit they call Wild <hi>Ananas</hi> 3 times a year, when the Fruit is ripe it is extream pleaſant.</p>
               <p>Our Fleet, which conſiſted now of no more than 9 Ships, ſet ſail for <hi>Batavia,</hi> where we Arrived in a fortnight: And found the other Fleet come three days before us. I had changed my Ship, and was in Buſineſs in the <hi>Hollandia,</hi> where I had a great deal of work, and moſt of my patients Afflicted with ſore Leggs. The Surgeon that did belong to it dyed in this Voyage, and I the rather choſe that Ship, becauſe it had already received Orders to go to the Iſle of <hi>Bali.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before it went off I went to Shore to take my leave of my old Acquaintance; and there met with one that was lately come out of Europe, a Native of <hi>Ulm,</hi> a place I was well acquainted with; and it being a day which was kept there as a Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, we kept it here alſo amongſt our ſelves, and diverted our ſelves very well: Among other news he brought over with him, the moſt conſiderable was, that the <hi>Turks</hi> were beaten from before <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna;</hi> which did not a little contribute to our Joy and Satisfaction.</p>

               <p>IN two days time we ſet Sail with a fair Wind: And the ſame day before Sun-ſet we paſſed by the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> then came between the Iſland <hi>Toppers-hoedie,</hi> and <hi>Bantam</hi> along Great <hi>Java</hi> into open Sea: And in 18 days time we reached the Iſland <hi>Bali,</hi> and caſt our Anchors before the Capital Town of the ſame name.</p>
               <p>In our former Voyage to <hi>Banda</hi> and <hi>Amboina,</hi> we paſſed by this place and came within 8 Miles of it; But the Wind being then ſo fair for us, we would not touch here, but made the beſt of our way for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: Otherwiſe we ſhould have called here of Courſe, as moſt Ships do, to take in freſh Water, and other Refreſhments.</p>
               <p>Here we unladed our Ship, and exchanged the Commodities for thoſe of the Countrey: Which were chiefly, Silk and Cotton wrought, moſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>People
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:100310:82"/>
here being employed in Spinning and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
               <p>They are a very Strong ſort of People, ſomewhat Blacker than the generality of other Indians are. They uſe no other Weapon when they fight but Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which they carry always about them in a kind of quiver. Theſe Arrows are ſo contrived, that when the Man who is Wounded with 'em goes to draw them out, they break; beſides that, they are ſo Artificially Poyſon'd, that it is preſent death without any Remedy.</p>
               <p>They permit themſelves to be ſold, to any Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over all the Indies, for Slaves; while I was there I bought a young Girl of a Merchant, for 18 Rix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollers, and took her with me to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where I could make her earn me two Shillings or 18 Pence a day.</p>
               <p>They are exceeding Brutiſh People, and the Simpleſt of Heathens. Their God is what ever they firſt caſt their Eye on in the Morning, ſo that it is ſtill variable, ſometimes a Cow, ſometimes a Tree, ſometimes a Dog, or a Bird, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This they keep in veneration for all that day, and pray to it with great earneſtneſs upon all emergencies.</p>
               <p>They know nothing of Marrying amongſt 'em. But as it is among Brutes, Men and Women are in common to each other, which makes the Country very Populous. Yet each man hath always ſome one whom he looks upon as a Principal Conſort, and by the Cuſtom of the Country ſhe is obliged to ſuch a ſevere and Rigorous Ceremony upon the death of her Mate, as would very ill go down with thoſe who make a profeſſion of more faithfulneſs and a more Honourable obſervance of their more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Engagements: And I have ſeen them acquit themſelves of it with the greateſt Reſolution ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; I mean the Burning themſelves, when their reputed Husbands Corps is committed to the Flames.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100310:83"/>
The manner of it is thus. When the Man is dead, they ſow him up in a Cotton cloath, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him up to the Top of the Houſe, where they keep him four or five days; during which time the Woman hath time to prepare her ſelf, that is, to take her leave of her friends; and all the while ſome old Women who are hired for that purpoſe, are ſitting at the door, crying and howling. Then they dig a great hole near the River ſide, which they fill with Wood, and having laid the Corps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, they ſet fire to the Wood. The Woman all this while having taken her farewel of all her Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and having got a whole bundle of preſents and recommendations to their friends in the other World, ſhe binds up all her tokens together in a Cotton Cloath, and when the Fire is throughly lighted, ſhe throws her ſelf therein.</p>
               <p>Theſe tokens are different according to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Inclination, or degree of Relation of the Perſon they ſend to; as one Man ſhall ſend his Wife Money, the other Flowers, the other ſome other ſmall preſent, all which ſhe promiſes to deliver faithfully. There ſtands round the Fire ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with their Inſtruments of Copper and other Metals, on which they make ſuch a horrid noiſe, that there is no hearing of the Womans Shreeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides there are Men ready with Veſſels of Oyl to pour into the Fire to make it Burn more vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that ſhe may the ſooner be out of her pain.</p>
               <p>When they are thus conſumed to aſhes, they are taken up very clean and thrown into the River with another conſort of howling and crying. I know there hath been ſeveral Accounts of this given by others after a different Manner, but what I have here given is as I have been an eye witneſs of it my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Here grows ſome of the ſineſt Fruits in the World, and in great plenty, ſo that I eat my fill of 'em. Theſe Fruits are a Refreſhment of no ſmall value to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:100310:83"/>
an European, and it makes him have a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eſteem for thoſe remote and Barbarous Iſles, and it is very often the only thing for which one would value them; it is as obſervable, that the more Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous the Country is, the more it excels in choice and delicate Fruits, as this place may well ſerve for an example, and all the Iſles thereabouts, which are Inhabited by the moſt Brutiſh ſort of Men. And ſome of 'em by Men who devour one another, and make a feaſt of their Victory; as at <hi>Suſu,</hi> which lyes here hard by, and likewiſe in the Country of the <hi>Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentots</hi> near the Cape of <hi>Good Hope.</hi> I have often wiſht for ſome of them ſince I parted with them, and that they had agreed more with our Climate, ſo that we could have them in Europe.</p>
               <p>Our buſineſs being done, we left <hi>Bali;</hi> And quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gained the Coſt of Great <hi>Java,</hi> from which <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi> lyes but eight Leagues diſtance; and in eight days Sail we arrived at <hi>Balavia</hi> again. We had all the way the ſight of the Iſland we left, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times could ſee over it in a very clear day, it not being above ſixteen Miles in compaſs.</p>
               <p>When we came to Shore I was very kindly rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and placed into the Hoſpital at <hi>Batavia;</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſt then a vacancy by the death of the chief Surgeon of that place, the Council was pleaſed to chooſe me in his ſtead, and to give me the care of it. Here I had five Maſters Surgeons under me, and my Station was every way much more agreable than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto it had been; but that which pleaſed me the beſt, was that I had both time, and opportunity to ſerve God; and tho' it was only the Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that was exerciſed there, yet I took a great deal of Satisfaction in going to ſerve God with them, when their Aſſemblys met; which was three times a Week. But I could rather have wiſhed there had been a Church of my own perſwaſion (which is the ſame that <hi>Luther</hi> maintaind and profeſs'd) for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100310:84"/>
then I believe I ſhould never have troubled my ſelf to have come back into <hi>Holland</hi> again, and I dare ſay that thouſands more would willingly continue there, rather than undertake ſuch dangerous Voyages to come back, if they could but have the free exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Religion, as they have in <hi>Holland,</hi> where all Religions are tolerated; and it was ever a wonder to me, that the ſame liberty was not granted in <hi>Batavia,</hi> which is as wiſely and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally govern'd as any City in the World, and keeps as good an order in all things, notwithſtanding the great variety of its Inhabitants; having within it, beſides the Natives of the ſeveral parts of the Indies, vaſt numbers of <hi>Turks, Perſians, Tartars, Chineeſes, Siamers, Moors, Japoneeſes, Armenians, Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, &amp;c.</hi> Yet is there no other Religion allowed, but that of the Reformed, and at their Aſſemblys are all the Soldiers obliged to be preſent, of what perſwaſion ſoever they be, and forced to be there every <hi>Sunday</hi> by Turns, under the Eye of an Officer, and then they put their Shoes on, whereas they wear 'em but-rarely otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>There are beſides the Church in the Caſtle two other Churches, where they Preach in the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueeze</hi> and the <hi>Maleyſh</hi> Languages the firſt for the conveniency of the Burghers, the other of the mixt Nations, who generally ſpeak that Language.</p>
               <p>Yet for all this liberty of Religion is not given, there are many hundreds, who when their time is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, bind themſelves a freſh rather than venture the danger of going home again, tho' they lay their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion aſide for ever for't. The frequent news of of Ships being caſt away, and looſing one half of the Fleets, and ſometimes the whole ones, increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their fears daily. While I was at <hi>Batavia</hi> my ſelf, I ſent a Letter to my Relations, by one who intended to paſs thro' <hi>Ulm,</hi> where they lived: And
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100310:84"/>
of this Fleet he went in, half was loſt by the way, tho' he got ſafe home, and to my great ſurprize brought me an anſwer to it himſelf, about two years after that: Juſt as I was preparing to come into <hi>Holland</hi> my ſelf, he told me he was come over again to end his days there, for he found that the Air of his Native Country would no more agree with him.</p>
               <p>While I was thus ſettled here, I got very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable practice among the Free-men, beſides my fixt employment; and eſpecially among the Chinee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, whom I found by much the moſt generous ſort of People and beſt to deal with. It was common for them to give me three or four Rixdollars for letting of 'em Blood, and forty or fifty Gilders for curing the leaſt Wound. But of all the Patients I ever had, I cannot but mention one, who for the od<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Puniſhment which was inflicted on his Adverſary, is well worth the Relating.</p>
               <p>I was once in a Chineeſe's houſe drinking of <hi>Tea,</hi> which is drunk in great quantitys there in <hi>Tea-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> very good and very Cheap. On a ſudden two Chineeſes fell to high words, till at laſt one of'em took a pot full of Boyling hot Water, and threw it all upon the other, and all Scalded his Face, and ſome other parts. I took the Man home, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in a few days, for which he gave me thirty Rixdollars ready Money and did me all the kind ſervices he could, often inviting me to his houſe, and treating me very civilly. The other who had uſed him thus baſely, was Condemned to have twelve of the longeſt Hairs of his Beard pull'd out, or elſe to pay thirty Golden <hi>Cubanz</hi> which is in value 300 Rixdollars (each <hi>Cubanz,</hi> being worth 10 Rixdollars, and the Golden Coyn of the Great <hi>Mogul's)</hi> but this Chineeſe being a Man of Subſtance, choſe rather to pay the Money than to part with ſo many precious hairs out of his Beard, and they are all of them ſo fond

of that Ornament, that it would have been as Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to have ask him for twelve of his Teeth. Beſides this, he was obliged to defray all the charges my Patient had been at, and to ſtand to all damages.</p>
               <p>There was all this while a fine Ship preparing for a Voyage to <hi>Surat,</hi> and I having a great deſire to go that Voyage, becauſe it is lookt upon as very ſafe, and hardly ever attended with bad Accidents, I ordered my affairs ſo as to get leave to go: Upon which I ſent my things on Board the <hi>Gelderland,</hi> for that was the name of the new Ship which I was to go in.</p>
               <p>On Eaſterday in the Morning, all things being ready, we ſet Sail by break of day, and took our farewell with three Guns, but we reacht no further by night than the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> and for want of a Wind, were forced to lye ſtill there four days. At laſt we weighed our Anchors, having a ſmall gale of Wind, which carried us paſt the Iſle <hi>Sumatra:</hi> And as we came by the Iſland <hi>Engano,</hi> it ceaſed and left us without a breath of Wind. Thus we left the Ship to run a drift, and our Men were all idle for three or four days, during which time we had <hi>Engano</hi> ſtill in ſight of us, for we moved but very ſlowly.</p>
               <p>In this while many of our Men took notice that one of our Souldiers (for we had fourteen of them a Board beſides Seamen) a Venetian Named <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lao,</hi> uſed to be frequently with two Boys that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to the Ship, and thoſe three would meet in private ever and anon. The Boat-Swain took a particular notice of 'em, and watcht 'em narrowly; at laſt he diſcoverd the end of their Meeting, and Surprized them in the Act of Sodomy; Upon which he went and informed the Maſter of what had paſſed. Immediately after the Venetian, and both the Boys, one of about eighteen, the other about twelve year of age, were ſeized, and layd up in Chains,

and upon Examination they all confeſs'd that they had been guilty of that abominable Sin ever ſince their departure from <hi>Batavia.</hi> I and the other Maſter Surgeon were then of the Council, and by them, we were orderd to viſit them, and we found it but too true, upon which the Sentence was pronounced againſt all three of 'em, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſhould be caſt into the Sea, and accordingly early the next Morning after Prayers, the Venetian was brought forth: And one of the Boys tied to his right ſide, and the other to his left, and in that Manner thrown in altogether, and were never more ſeen by us.</p>
               <p>The Boys were very penitent, and much affected with their guilt, and Prayed with the Chaplain very heartily, and ſhed Tears in abundance: So that there were but few of us, that could refrain weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſight of 'em. But the Venetian was not at all concerned; and when he ſtood upon the Plank, ready to be thrown off, he begged for nothing but a draught of <hi>Arack.</hi> The Maſter told him, he ſhould have drink enough in an Inſtant, and deſired him to conſider of his latter end, and to provide for futuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but all Remonſtrances were in vain to the laſt, and ſo he was thrown over.</p>
               <p>There was another, who was ſuſpected of the ſame crime; and upon Examination he confeſs'd he had intended it, but never was guilty of the act, him the Council order'd to remain in Chains, and to be ſet on Shore on the next Wild Iſland we ſhould come at, which was <hi>Ouro,</hi> which was accordingly done; when we Landed him there, we left him ſome Water, Bisket and Tobacco to ſerve him ſome days, and a Gun; he begged heartily that we would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take away his life: But it was not granted.</p>
               <p>So we went forward with ſo fair a gale of Wind, that we loſt ſight of that Iſland before night. We paſſed on between <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which we left on the right, and the <hi>Maldivy</hi> Iſlands which lay on the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100310:87"/>
left, and Steering round the Coaſts of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and <hi>Biſnagar,</hi> we came with good ſpeed to <hi>Surat</hi> after five Weeks ſail, where we caſt Anchor.</p>
               <p>Our Ship was immediately unladen to make room for other goods: And our Merchants went on Shore to their apartment, which is always ready for 'em here, as it is in all thoſe places, where they have Factories: And there they have all neceſſary Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes; Apartments, Servants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> fit to receive them when ever they come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surat</hi> lyes about 800 Leagues from <hi>Batavia,</hi> and belongs to the Emperour of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> otherwiſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Great</hi> Mogul, who calls himſelf Lord of all the Indies.</p>
               <p>It is remarkable and ſtrange to obſerve how the Seaſons of the Year are here divided, their Winter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhows it ſelf by its conſtant Rains, for half a year in one part of the Country; during which time it Rains almoſt daily more or leſs; and while this ſort of Winter laſts in one part, it is Summer and fair in the other parts of the Countrey, ſo that they have it by turns. The days and nights are always near equal, of twelve hours each, what difference there is, is not perceptible.</p>
               <p>All this while our Ship was taking her lading in apace, but it was not great, moſt of it was <hi>Perſian</hi> Money; when ſhe had all in, we ſet Sail without delay with the firſt fair Wind, and in fourteen days time we paſſed again by the Coaſt of <hi>Malabar</hi> now on the left. Thence we ſail'd about the Cape of <hi>Gomori,</hi> which lyes extended to the South, and after that, we came to <hi>Punto de Galle,</hi> which is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for all the Ships that paſs that way to take in any Refreſhments. There we took in freſh Water and other neceſſarys. We found there an Engliſh Ship, called the <hi>Sina,</hi> come from <hi>Bengal,</hi> and bound for <hi>Cameron</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Sea.</p>
               <p>We laid four days here, before <hi>Punto de Galle:</hi>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:100310:87"/>
And then the Wind blowing fair for us, we run out of the Haven, and paſſed the next day by the <hi>Maldivy</hi> Iſlands, of which it is computed that they are above a thouſand in number, and in ſeven days ſail we came to the Iſland <hi>Ouro,</hi> where we had left the Souldier. We caſt Anchor there, and ſent out the long Boat with ſome Men to look after him, but they could not hear or ſee ought of him: So we continued our Courſe towards Great <hi>Java.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While we were in open Sea about 100 Leagues off <hi>Malacca,</hi> we had during three Weeks time ſuch a Calm, that we thought we ſhould never have had a breath of Wind more. So that in all that time we did not get a League forwards, only the Sea Wind moved us a little to and fro, but did us no good. For, tho' it may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe that are Ignorant of it, it oftentimes happens that the Main Sea, eſpecially that part of it, where no Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is to be found, is in a very great agitation, tho' there be no Wind at all to be perceived: And I my ſelf have often ſeen in the ſtilleſt VVeather, the VVaves heap'd up on Hills, and ſo furiouſly high, that no Storm can raiſe them higher, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times there is as great Danger, and as many Ships are there caſt away; eſpecially thoſe that are not well laden.</p>
               <p>During this Calm, we ſuffer'd more than ever we could have done in the moſt Terrible Tempeſt, for we were under the Line, and the exceſſive heat cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral to fall Sick, and what was worſe ſtill was, that we had made no great proviſion of Water by reaſon it was lookt upon to be but a ſhort Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; So that with heat and thirſt, we were all in danger of being ſuffocated. Our Water was now ſo far ſpent, that a draught of it cold not be had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a couple of Rixdollars. At leaſt it came to that paſs, that there was a neceſſity of ſetting two Centinells to guard the Water-Cask; out of which
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100310:88"/>
they uſed to diſtribute every man his portion, and to ſet four Locks upon it. And when the Portions were given out in the Morning, it was not above one quarter of the meaſure that it uſed to be.</p>
               <p>In this miſerable Condition I have been forced to to give two dozen of my Silver Buttons off my Waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, for one draught of Water, and to gnaw bits of Wood, hoping I might ſuck ſome moiſture out of it. In ſhort, it put us all upon trying all the ways we could imagine to allay our exceſſive drought; we had now but ſix Barrels of Water left, and we ſaw no proſpect of Relief, ſo that many of us often wiſh'd that our Ship would ſink down right with us, we neglected not to call upon God, and to ſend up our Prayers to him conſtantly thrice a day, that he would have Compaſſion on us; and as this was more becoming Chriſtians than the raſh wiſhes which our deſolate Condition forced from ſome, if not the greater part of us: So it was that undoubtedly which was moſt Effectual, for our merciful God ſent us a ſeaſonable relief, and ſurely becauſe we cried unto him in our trouble, he delivered us out of our Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>The Moon, which ſhined very bright, was all of a ſudden a little over caſt, and at length a Black Cloud came, which deprived us wholly of the ſight of it, and gave us mighty hopes that we were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have ſome Rain. This gave us all new life, and ſet us all at wotk to ſpread out our Sails ready, ſaſtening them by the four corners, with a Bullet in the Middle, to receive the VVater; thus we ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between hope and fear for about three hours; at laſt the weather grew very cool, and the Clouds gathering together, the Sky was all darkned, and ſuddenly the rain came pouring down upon us: But never were Men more heartily glad tobe wet to the skin. The firſt VVater that came thro' the Sails was very bitter; ſo we threw that away: and then
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100310:88"/>
we fell to filling of our Veſſels, which done, we hoyſted up our wet Sails, and run briskly before the Wind.</p>
               <p>One may Imagine what Joy it was to every one of us to have our miſerable Condition brought to ſuch an happy End; nor did we fail to give due thanks to the great Author of it, who had ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully, heard us. VVith this VVind we were not long 'ere we reach'd the Iſland of <hi>Engano,</hi> ſo that we after three Months Sailing paſſed the Streight of <hi>Sunda,</hi> and arrived happily on the Road before <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Maſter and the Steward, who had been ſo imprudent as not to provide the Ship with more Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was called to an Account for it, and puniſhed for their careleſneſs, and had a good round fine laid upon them, which was to be deducted out of their wages, by little and little till the whole was payd.</p>
               <p>This ſame Ship being deſign'd for <hi>Bengal, Pegu</hi> and <hi>Aracan</hi> in a very little while, and ſome of the goods being ready to load, I left all my things on Board, deſigning to go that Voyage too. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving provided my ſelf with what Medicaments I wanted, in about a Months time we left <hi>Batavia,</hi> and came in nine days before <hi>Pegu,</hi> where we caſt Anchor. We had but very little buſineſs there, ſo that we ſtayed there but three days, and ſet Sail again, and came to <hi>Aracan;</hi> and thence went to <hi>Bengal,</hi> which is but eight Leagues further. There we caſt Anchor juſt at the mouth of the River <hi>Chaor,</hi> which mixes with the <hi>Ganges,</hi> about a mile before it throws it ſelf into the Sea of <hi>Bengal.</hi> About eight Leagues up that River, lyes <hi>Verma,</hi> a Town of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Trade: Some of our Merchants ſailed up to it; But I went not with 'em.</p>
               <p>About forty Miles from <hi>Bengal,</hi> between the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Ganges</hi> and <hi>Perſelis</hi> lyes a place, called <hi>Loha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack;</hi> where there are whole Fields of thoſe Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100310:89"/>
called Roſes of <hi>Jericho,</hi> or the Roſe of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the Lady's Roſe. They are quite green; when you gather them, they cloſe together ſtraight and keep ſo, while they are dry, and when you put them into Water, they open as at firſt. They are good for many uſes; but excellent for Women in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and facilitate the Birth, by being only put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Woman. I could have had abundance of 'em for little value, of the Inhabitants. They ſay the ſeed of theſe was brought over by a King out of <hi>Syria,</hi> where they grow in abundance about <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo.</hi> I do not find they grow any where, but in theſe places I have mention'd; they have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Tranſport them into ſeveral places, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Great <hi>Java:</hi> But they die and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, the ground ought to be very full of nitre.</p>
               <p>As to what Relates to <hi>Pegu Aracan</hi> or <hi>Bengal,</hi> I will not undertake to give a deſcription of either of the places, becauſe I did not ſtay there long, and beſides they may be ſeen at large in <hi>Linſchooten's</hi> Travels, who hath been very particular in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of'em.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFter our Ship had got in her Complement of Sugar, Salt-peter, and Opium, we ſet Sail and went from <hi>Bengal</hi> to <hi>Maſulipatam,</hi> belonging to the King of <hi>Galconda,</hi> whoſe Son keeps his reſidence at <hi>Pentipoli,</hi> lying not far from thence.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are moſt of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The Air is very healthy one half of the year, when the Northern winds blow conſtant: But the Southern winds, which blow the other half of the year, fill the Country with diſtempers. We were theré during this latter Seaſon, and felt the diſmal Effects of it. We had already loſt nine of our Men, and the reſt were moſt of'em ill of Agues or Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies. But bleſſed be God, I was not at all indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed. The ill State we were in, made us make all the haſte we could to be gone, and hoyſting Sail, we departed, and came in four days time before the Iſland <hi>Nicoparas,</hi> here we ſailed in very great danger; for all the Sea there abouts is full of Rocks
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:100310:90"/>
that lyc three or four fathoms under Water, and little ſmall Iſlands, ſome of which are almoſt cover'd with Water. A little before we came by there, the <hi>Lion,</hi> a Ship of 470 Tun, run upon one of them, and was Split in pieces: But we paſt them all ſafe, and Steerd between <hi>Sumatra</hi> and <hi>Malacca,</hi> and thus got to <hi>Batavia;</hi> where I return'd to my former poſt. I uſed to go and viſit the other Surgeons that had the care of ſome ſmall Forts about us, and when they had any Patients that were dangerouſly ill, and their caſe deſperate; they were ſent to the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal at <hi>Batavia</hi> by vertue of a warrant from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, which they uſed to get for that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Near the Fort <hi>Jacatra,</hi> where I uſed to go often, is a piece of ground which the Chineeſes bought of the Dutch, and coſt them abundance of Money, in which they bury their Corpſes: It was called the Chineeſe's Church-yard. I remember there to have ſeen a Grave made for one of the Richer ſort of 'em, that amounted to three or 4000 Gilders, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they raiſed high, or coſtly in the Ornaments they beſtow on 'em, but only they dig them of ſuch a vaſt depth, and line the Grave from the very Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with fine ſquare Stone cut for the purpoſe, and ſo ſtrong is the Work, as well as neat, that it is as if they did deſign never to move from thence. I omit the other particulars of their Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe others have done it before me.</p>
               <p>All the way from that Fort to <hi>Batavia,</hi> is ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and diverting by reaſon of the continual variety of ſweet Walks, Curious Gardens <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it is a perfect earthly Paradiſe, and there is none comes to <hi>Batavia</hi> but goes to ſee it, and is exceedingly Charm'd with the ſight of it.</p>
               <p>A pleaſant accident beſell me there once. An Officer, who was at that time a Patient of mine, a looſe debauched Fellow, who followed no preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100310:90"/>
and therefore made all my remedies ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to him, being at the head of a Company exerciſing the Men, and having got I ſuppoſe a cup in his head, ſeeing me come towards him to be a Spectator a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt, Saluted me at firſt ſight after a kind of an inſolent manner, and then gave me ſome Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Language, and told me, he thought I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my buſineſs but very indifferently, ſince I kept him ſo long under my hands. I told him he talkt like an Impertinent Fellow, and that all the means of the moſt skilfull Surgeons in the World would be in vain to him, while he was always drunk and lived ſuch an intemperate life, and obſerved no rule. In ſhort, I told him that my Art was to cure Men, and not Beaſts, and that he might ſeek a cure elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; this enraged him ſo, being ſpoken at the head of his Company, that he came and ſtruck at me with his Cane with all the eagerneſs that might be, but 'ere the blow fell upon me, I cloſed in with him; and having no VVeapon in my hand, I wreſted the Cane out of his, and flung him upon his back, as he was getting up again, the ſtanders by parted us, and there was no more heard of it for that time.</p>
               <p>This ſpread about among all the Officers, and the Account of it being little to his advantage, and giving ſometimes occaſion to ſome to jeer him with his adventure, it made him ſtark mad; and ſet him upon thinking of revenge. I expected it, and therefore avoided him, whenever I could han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely do it. But one day we chanced to meet in a Chineeſes houſe, where we dined; nor did I ſee any tokens of his Reſentment all the while we ſat together, ſo that I was apt to think he deſigned to paſs it by. But when he had drunk a little largely, and the ill humours were ſet a Floating, he begun to make little inſolent Reflections upon me, which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100310:91"/>
turned at laſt to down right abuſes. This did not ſuffice, but he muſt needs urge me to come out to him in the Street, and going out firſt into it himſelf, with his drawn Sword in his hand, he vapourd and call'd me all the Cowards he could think of, who durſt not come out to meet him. I wore no Sword, as indeed none of our profeſſion did: But I had a tuck Cane in my hand, which I uſed to wear; but eſpecially ſince my firſt quarrel with him: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to it, at length I came out to him, and with my unwildy weapon after ſome paſſes on both ſides, I ſtruck him into the left ſide, but glancing againſt his ribs, I juſt larded him, and that was all; but he keeping his ground, I made another paſs at him, and fortunately run him into the Shoulder, and diſarm'd him; upon which he was carried into the Chineeſes houſe.</p>
               <p>Aſſoon as this was made known at <hi>Batavia,</hi> we were both of us taken and brought bound into <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> and there had before the Judge Advocate, who, having examined us and our Evidences, paſſed Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon my Adverſary in an inſtant, which was, that he was to be kept in Chains for three years, and to work among the Slaves; and to forfeit his Salary for the time, which was to be diſtributed among his Company, which was accordingly put in Execution, as ſoon as he was perfectly recovered, and that was in a few VVeeks time.</p>
               <p>My cauſe being much more juſt than his, and my Sentence being ſuſpended for a while, I thought I might come off Tolerably well; but when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd with what ſeverity they had dealt with him, I could not but expect ſomething proportionable would fall to my ſhare. But it was not long 'ere I was put out of doubt, and my Sentence was pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. I was to ſtand before the <hi>Corps de Guarde</hi> at <hi>Jacatra</hi> three days after one another, with ſix
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:100310:91"/>
                  <hi>Muſquets</hi> hung about me, and to forfeit three months Salary to the Judge-Advocate, and to do for that time the Duty of a private Centinel, ſtanding ſuch hours as were allotted me, with a Muſquet in my Hand.</p>
               <p>This was tolerable, and better than I expected; but it ſeems it was rather contrived for me, that I might not go altogether unpuniſhed, than as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment deſerved by, and ſuitable to what I had done. One may ſee by this puniſhment that was inflicted on me, that a Martial Genius reigns there; and that they are much given to a Military Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; for there was no manner of relation between the Muſquet and me, nor indeed did it agree with me at all. But ſome of my Friends gave me hopes, that they would ſoon get me releaſed; and by their means, orders were ſent me to return to my Poſt, after I had exerciſed the Muſquet during two Months; by which a Month of my Sentence was remitted me.</p>
               <p>A little while after I was reſtored, Orders were ſent to the <hi>Sumatra,</hi> the Ship I was laſt in, to get ready in eight days to go to <hi>Bantam.</hi> I put my ſelf in a readineſs to go with her, being deſirous to ſee how the Place ſtood ſince its great diſorder. The laſt day we were to be in Town, being <hi>Sunday,</hi> I went to Church, and heard a moſt admirable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon preach'd by the worthy Mr. <hi>John Conradus;</hi> after which I took my leave of my Friends, and then took a <hi>Praw</hi> to carry me aboard the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra,</hi> which had her full Lading in, which was all Proviſions, and moſt of that Rice. The next Morning the Wind being very fair for us, we ſet ſail, and came that very Night into the Road be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bantam.</hi> I went to Shore with the firſt Boat, and was much pleaſed to ſee all the Parts of that City ſo neat, and in ſo good an order, that there was not the leaſt ſign of its late Misfortunes to be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:100310:92"/>
ſeen. I ſtaid there that night, being told that the next day eight <hi>Javians</hi> were to be executed for killing ſome <hi>Dutchmen</hi> in the Country; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly four of them were broke upon the Wheel; the other four were tied faſt together, and turned down headlong off the Caſtle-Bridge into the Water.</p>
               <p>While this was doing, there was a vaſt out-cry of a ſudden of Fire: The Houſes being all of Cane, the firſt Houſe had in an inſtant ſet ſire to ſeveral others; ſo that the Uproar increaſing, the Magiſtrate ſet double guard upon all the Conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poſts and Gates of the City, to prevent further harm; and leſt this might be intended to ſerve for an Inſurrection: But both the Fire and Noiſe ceaſed quickly after.</p>
               <p>I went on board again, and hearing that the Young King was in a few days to make a Viſit to the Governour, I deſired a Friend to give me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the night before the day on which it was to be; and notice being given me accordingly by my Friend, I went to Shore.</p>
               <p>The manner of his Pomp and Magnificence was, I thought, very well worth my ſight; and it may not be diſagreeable to the Reader to have a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count oſ it. As ſoon as ever the King had ſet his Foot out of the Caſtle, all the Cannon were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, great and ſmall, all round the place.</p>
               <p>The firſt that walked before him were four <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boineeſes,</hi> carrying Bucklers and Swords in their Hands; next to them went a Company of <hi>Javians,</hi> then a Company of <hi>Balingers,</hi> with <hi>Aſſagyen;</hi> after theſe came ſix <hi>Javians,</hi> who carried a Chair finely wrought and gilt: then followed ſix Perſian Horſes, with Trappings richly covered with Gold and Silver; after them four <hi>Amboineeſes,</hi> with Eſcutcheons and Swords in their Hands; then the Young Prince; or King's Son, of about eight Years of Age, on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; his Horſe was ſet out after the nobleſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:100310:92"/>
I ever ſaw: He was attended by ſome hundreds of Women, each of which had ſomething in their Hands; ſome, Golden Cups; ſome, Flowers; others, ſeveral Fruits of the Country; theſe were followed by the Company of <hi>Dutch.</hi> Then came the King himſelf, riding on a very fine Perſian Horſe, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly accoutred, and ſitting with that Majeſty, that one would have thought him Lord of the Univerſe. Next to him went a great Company of Women; then another Company of <hi>Dutch;</hi> and a Company of <hi>Javians,</hi> with their <hi>Krizzen</hi> and <hi>Aſſagyen,</hi> which ended the Proceſſion. All this mighty Shew and Formality, was a very great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to me, conſidering that King's Station, and that his Dignity was meerly titular. But that Pomp and Grandeur did not give him ſo much luſtre, as it did thoſe under whoſe ſubjection he was forced to live: And in that conſideration, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were willing enough to amuſe him, with this vain ſhew of Power and Greatneſs. When the Guns were fired, one of the Men, not being ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as he ſhould have been, had one of his Arms ſhot off, as he was raming in the Powder. As ſoon as the young King heard of it, he came into the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital himſelf to ſee the Man dreſt, and to charge the Surgeon to take great care of him, and ordered an hundred pieces of Eight to be given him; promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing withal, that if he cured him, he would give him a Penſion of two hundred pieces of Eight year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; which was an argument of a good tender Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Generoſity, notwithſtanding ſome of his Actions, before-related, might repreſent him as one of a cruel and barbarous Diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>It was not without Wonder, as well as Pleaſure, that I beheld the great Reſtauration and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Famous City, which once lay in ſo ruinous a condition; and to ſee ſuch plenty and abundance there, where ſome time before there was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100310:93"/>
ſuch a ſcarcity of neceſſaries, that many Men were ee'n famiſh'd. And certainly of all the hardſhips of that War, none was to be compared to that which we underwent for want of Water. I was once forced to give as much Mony for one ſingle draught of it, as would have bought a Butt of Wine in ſome places. And ſuch was our lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition, that a Man would have given his Life the next hour for a draught of Cold Water to prolong it till then. So that when Water could be got at any rate, thoſe who had the greateſt ſhare of Plunder, would give all they had for one ſingle Cup of it; and thought themſelves happy they could purchaſe it upon ſuch eaſie terms: And thus after all their labour, they were but little the better for all that Booty they had gotten.</p>
               <p>But what was the moſt diſmal of all was, that it was not to be gotten ſometimes, tho' one had had the World to give for it: And in thoſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, many of our Men drinking out of ſome Pools that were not wholeſom, ſome being <hi>Nitrous</hi> or <hi>Saltpeteriſh,</hi> and others being poiſonous Water, it threw them into ſuch Diſtempers, and put 'em into ſuch Tortures, that it would have grieved any one to have ſeen the miſerable condition they were in.</p>
               <p>In the Wars with <hi>Kartiri,</hi> which were a little before my coming to the Indies, the poor Soldiers were in as bad a condition to the full. So that a Man would wonder, that the ſame Perſons ſhould willingly expoſe themſelves to ſuch difficulties a ſecond time; as moſt of our Men did, who were in both Expeditions. But what will not neceſſity put a Man upon, eſpecially when it is a little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liven'd by the hopes of ſome fortunate Succeſs? And I believe, that the good Fortune of a certain Drummer in thoſe late Wars, ſerved in a great meaſure to animate the whole Body of our Army.
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100310:93"/>
For this Drummer lighted fortunately of the King of <hi>Kartiri</hi>'s Crown, for which the General at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia</hi> gave him thirty thouſand Gilders of Dutch Mony; and gave him his Freedom, and a Paſs to go into <hi>Holland,</hi> where he was to have his Mony paid, tho' the Poor Man ne're liv'd to enjoy it, for he died in the Voyages; but the Mony was duly paid to his Siſters, who lived at <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the agreement made with the Deceaſed. And I make no doubt but every one of our Men, that knew this, were in hopes of getting at leaſt a Crown for their ſhare too.</p>
               <p>I was one of four who had almoſt got as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a Booty, but we loſt all by our want of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; for three of the Admiral's chief Attendants, and I, being juſt come into <hi>Bantam,</hi> after a little fatigue, we went to take a Nap in a Warehouſe that ſtood open, we laid us down upon a great Cheſt that ſtood there, and never dreamt that there was any thing of value within it; but we had not been there above half an hour, when an Officer was ſent from the <hi>Admiral</hi> to demand our Bed from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us, which we readily yielded. We were ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſurpriſed when we ſaw a Party of Men ready to convoy it to the Admiral, before whom it was open'd; and out of it came ſeven hundred Leathern Bags full of <hi>Cubangs,</hi> which (as I told you before) are pieces of Gold, worth ten Rixdollers apiece. You may imagine then how ſilly we lookt upon one another, when we heard this; and how angry we were with our ſelves, that we could complain of the hardneſs of our Bed, and were not ſo wiſe as to ſhake up the Feathers. But to be ſhort, we loſt very ſimply a Treaſure which we might have had very fairly, and without oppoſition, if we had but been ſo prudent as to ſearch into it at firſt.</p>
               <p>But it is time to return to the <hi>Sumatra,</hi> which was now ready to go off; ſo that with the firſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:100310:94"/>
fair Wind we ſet ſail, and got ſafe to <hi>Batavia</hi> again, where we found a Fleet of ſeven Ships in a readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to go home, <hi>i. e.</hi> to <hi>Holland.</hi> (as the cuſtom is to ſend ſome ſuch number of Ships home every Year, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs at a time.) I was glad to have the opportunity to ſend ſome Letters by 'em, and I did ſo; but charging only one Friend with 'em, my Friends in <hi>Holland</hi> never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any of 'em. But what made me the more negligent was, that I was near the time of my free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and in full deſign of going over my ſelf in a very little while. As ſoon as that Fleet had hoiſted ſail, I went to Church to join with the Prayers of the Congregation for the Fleets Proſperity and good Voyage, as there is always on thoſe occaſions.</p>
               <p>Our Ship lay ſtill at Anchor here for three Weeks, which made me very weary of it; at laſt we had Orders to go with a ſmaller Veſſel, call'd the <hi>Bali,</hi> to a ſmall Iſland, about four Leagues from <hi>Batavia,</hi> to fetch Timber to repair the Ships that lay at the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> and to carry it thither. This Iſle hath nothing but Timber upon it: Here we ſpent our time in catching of Tortoiſes, with which we feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our ſelves rarely; and having carried what was requiſite to the Iſle of <hi>Onruſt,</hi> we return'd to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi> The <hi>Bali</hi> being but a ſmall Veſſel, we ran up the River, with eaſe, to the very Gate of the Caſtle. The Chief Surgeon of <hi>India</hi>'s Lodging be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very near to us, I took the opportunity to wait upon him, and deſired him to take care I might be appointed to go with the next that ſhould be ſent to any diſtant part of the Indies, where I had not been; which he promiſed to do, ſeeing it was my deſire.</p>
               <p>He repreſented to me ſufficiently, and I knew it well enough, that I had a better Poſt already, and that any Poſt at Land was more conſiderable than the beſt at Sea; and that thoſe who had a ſettled
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100310:94"/>
Charge there, were more regarded, and better eſteemed. But I was for ſeeing of ſtrange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and variety of Things; and beſides, a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance upon Land, required a continual expence, which the Sea doth not give ſuch opportunity for. But, in a word, I would not have been penn'd up in one Town only, as ſome are there, for all the Credit and Advantage they can propoſe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or attain to; and indeed except in <hi>Bengal, Surat, Camron</hi> in <hi>Perſia, Japan,</hi> or ſome few other places, it is hardly worth a Man's while to reſt in hopes of being advanced; for Preferment goes there by Favour, as well as in theſe parts of the World: And when it doth ſo, I think no wiſe Man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it.</p>
               <p>Thus I continued upon the <hi>Bali,</hi> and as ſoon as ſhe had taken in her lading of Linnen and Striped Stuffs, together with ſome Cheſts of Mony; we fell down the River and ſet ſail for <hi>Bantam;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe was bound. We were above two hours ſail; but we were forced back by a contrary Wind, which blew ſo exceſſive hard for the ſpace of two days, that we were very happy, that we ridded our ſelves out of it ſo luckily. As ſoon as it was over, we ſet ſail again, and in forty eight hours we reached the Road of <hi>Bantam,</hi> where we immediately unladed.</p>
               <p>When we went to Shore there, we ſaw ſome thouſands of Javians got together at the Mouth of the River: We were a little ſurprized at firſt, not knowing what the meaning of it ſhould be; but coming nearer, and ſeeing ſeveral Hollanders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt 'em, and then diſcovering their Nets, Hooks and other Inſtruments, we found they were only catching of Crocodiles. When we landed, we ſaw ſeveral they had caught and knock'd in the Head already; their King was amongſt 'em to ſee the Sport. No body can think what a ſtrange kind of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100310:95"/>
a Noiſe theſe ſilly Javians made, and how they rent their Throats at it. Whereas my Comrade and I had caught almoſt as many without any kind of Noiſe, and not half that Trouble.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Bali</hi> was only to unlade here, which being done, we ſet out fot <hi>Batavia</hi> again; and as we came by the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> we heard all the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non fire, both in the Caſtle, and in the City; we could not tell then what it was for, but we kept going on; and not long after, when we came to caſt Anchor, we heard that the Fleet from <hi>Cameron</hi> in <hi>Perſia</hi> was ſafe arrived, and had brought the good news with 'em, that all the Old Differences between the Viceroy there, and us, were perfectly adjuſted; and that there was a Good Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſettled between us. And another Ship was come in from <hi>Holland,</hi> which had alſo brought the good news of the quarrel being made up between the <hi>Engliſh, Danes</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and ourſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Injury done to them at <hi>Bantam:</hi> Which good news coming together, could not but make us all exceeding joyful. So that all the Streets of <hi>Batavia</hi> were all illuminated with Bon-fires, and Fire-works. The latter were chiefly the work of the Chineeſes, who delight much in them, and are ſo ingenious at 'em, that one would wonder, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being a People who never have any Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of War, where Powder is uſed. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe entertained us with their Comedies, which are very diverting, if ſeen but ſeldom. We Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans had over and above theſe good news, that which more nearly concerned us, which was, that of the good ſucceſs of the Emperors Arms againſt the Turks; ſo that ſome of my Countrymen and I joined ſo much the more chearfully in the common Rejoicings, which continued all that Night. The next Morning the General <hi>Camphuyſen</hi> went to the <hi>Maleyſh</hi> Church, where publick thanks were return'd
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100310:95"/>
to God for our Proſperity; then the Service being over, the Guns were again fired round the City and Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Three or four days after, as I was returning to ſee my Patients on board the <hi>Bali,</hi> I met with a Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Soldiers that were going on board the <hi>Fleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingen.</hi> Theſe were very prettily accoutred with Silk-Stockings on their Legs, and Shoos made of Sail-Cloath: Theſe Men were deſigned for <hi>Camron, Surat</hi> and <hi>Macaran,</hi> to fill up the vacancies there of ſuch as keep Guard before the Houſes of the Company. But I would not have a private Soldier to fancy by this, that they are all to meet with ſuch treatment there; for this good uſage is only to a few, that are to credit the Factories in thoſe places; and thoſe are ſome of thoſe that have a great many Friends, and great Recommendations: Whereas many a brave Soldier is forced to ſpend his time in <hi>Bantam, Amboina, Banda,</hi> and other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy Iſlands, where they muſt trudge it without either <hi>Shoos</hi> or <hi>Stockings,</hi> and it may be periſh mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably.</p>
               <p>Our Ship was once again order'd to go to <hi>Onruſt</hi> to carry Rice, and other Proviſions; which we did, and returned in four or five days.</p>
               <p>As we were come back, it was my fortune to fall once more into the Sea; for as I went to eaſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on the outſide of the Ship, according to the uſual way, I held faſt by the Rope, which broke, ſo in I dropt. The Ships Crew was more ready to laugh at me, than to lend me their Hand; and I was doubly put to't, to ſwim with my Breeches down; but at laſt my Comrade threw me out a Rope, by which I got up, and praiſed God for my ſafety. This made me more careful for ever after; and that the Boatſwane might be more diligent to ſee for the future that ſuch things were firm and ſtrong, the Maſter gave him a ſevere reprimand, and laid a Fine on him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:100310:96"/>
After this I went to pay another viſit to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Surgeon; and from thence went to Sup with an Acquaintance of mine in the Caſtle, and took a Friend with me. I was to go into the Town to lie; ſo my Friend and I took a Praw to carry us thither up the River. In the way we came thro' the Boom, which is a String of Trunks of Trees chained to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, which block up the River from one ſide to the other, ſo that there is no paſſing thro' without an Officer, who ſtands there to let you thro', who firſt viſits and ſearches you, and then too you muſt pay ſo much, according to the bigneſs of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; and this goes to the Company, who make ſome thouſands of Gilders yearly out of it.</p>
               <p>The next day we went to the Lottery, to ſee what Gaming there was; that was moſt full of <hi>Chineeſes,</hi> who, as I ſaid before, are the greateſt Gemeſters in the World. Whoever is a loſer there, the Company is ſure to be the winner; for there is a Mony-Changer appointed by them, who ſits to keep order amongſt 'em, a kind of Groom-Porter; and every throw that is thrown with the Dice, there is two pence paid to him for the Company. And notwithſtanding that ſome of thoſe who ruin themſelves at play there, might be ſuppoſed to fall into a paſſion, and cauſe ſome diſorder, yet there is never any diſturbance heard of; it being no leſs than Death to make any in that place: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that ſeverity it would never be free from it, eſpecially when poor Soldiers loſe ſometimes their whole Pay in one Night, which they have done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard ſervice for a Month or two, or may be more; or when a Chineeſe loſes all that he is worth, even his Wife and Children, nay his very Beard; nothing being more natural, than for Men in that condition to fall into exceſſive Paſſion. But they dare not give it any vent there, nor make the leaſt noiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100310:96"/>
I could not refrain neither, but ventured ſix or ſeven Ducatoons, which were gone in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye; but I preſently gave over, and took my leave of it for ever.</p>
               <p>Thence I went to reſide for a few days at a Friends houſe, and a Countrymans of mine, one Mr. <hi>Buſchbach,</hi> who had got his Freedom, having compleated his time in the Company's Service, and was in very good Circumſtances. He was a Man of an exceeding kind and generous Temper, and a conſtant Patron of all the Germans that came to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and never weary of doing them all the ſervice that lay in his power. I was a little indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at his Houſe, ſo that I ſent word to the Ship, that if they were ordered to go any Voyage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I got better, they ſhould give me notice of it, that they might be ſupplied with ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to go in my ſtead. But bleſſed be God I reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in a few days, which I think verily was in ſome meaſure owing to my Friend's care, and his facetious diverting Company; for I never met with more agreeable Company in my life.</p>
               <p>His Houſe ſtood upon the <hi>Vierkant,</hi> a place ſo called from its being a Square, where the Rice Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket was kept, and feveral other Proviſions, being juſt at the Mouth of the River, and therefore moſt commodious for all Country People to bring their Fruits by water, as well as for the Fiſher-boats to bring their Fiſh thither. There is alſo a ſmall Dock for building of little Veſſels. And all Veſſels what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that come by here, muſt come to Shore, and be viſited by a Centinel that ſtands there for that purpoſe, and is relieved every hour; and in caſe any of 'em ſhould attempt to ſlip by, his Orders is to fire upon them.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEing pretty well recover'd, tho' as yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weak, I return'd on board, where I ſpent my time but after a melancholly manner, and moſt of it lying in my Hamock; yet I gathered ſtrength apace, and in ſome days got perfectly well.</p>
               <p>There an Order came to me to remove on board the <hi>Tyger,</hi> which was to go to <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with a great deal of ſatisfaction, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly went out with her. We had not been three hours under ſail, but ſuch a violent Storm came
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100310:97"/>
upon us as brought our Main-Maſt by the Board with ſuch a force, that we thought our Ship was daſh'd in pieces; and this continuing for ſome time, we were obliged to cut our Gears, and hand in what we could of our Sails.</p>
               <p>Our Maſter was not for going further, ſo we went back to <hi>Batavia;</hi> and being there refitted, we ſet Sail out again; and in three days came before <hi>Japara,</hi> which lies likewiſe in great <hi>Java,</hi> ſeventy Leagues eaſtward of <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Place, which was once the Reſidence of the mighty Emperor of that Empire, is as much under the Dominion of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as <hi>Bantam</hi> is. And that Emperor likewiſe is no more ſuch, than meerly in Name and Title; and is as ſubject to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> is, of whom I have given you an account. So that this whole Iſland, which is above five hundred miles compaſs, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all in ſubjection to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Company. The Religion, Manners, Cuſtoms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Japara</hi> are much the ſame as of thoſe of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we provided our ſelves with Water, and Wood for Fuel; which being done, we wound up our Anchors, and ſet ſail: The next day we paſſed by the ſix Iſlands of <hi>Luboce,</hi> leaving them on our left, and <hi>Java</hi> on the right; and arrived to the Iſland of <hi>Madura,</hi> which is about ten Leagues from <hi>Java.</hi> There we ſtaid a while, and then we ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward again with the firſt Gale of Wind, and paſſed by ſome hundreds of little Iſlands and Rocks, which are called <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> ſome of which we went over, whilſt the Sea beat moſt terribly againſt thoſe Rocks which ſtood a little above the Water, and made us very much affraid, we having no other way, but thro' them: So that we were continually ſounding with the Plummet. We fell foul of the Rocks four times notwithſtanding all our care; but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100310:98"/>
God be thanked, without any damage. The beſt of that courſe is, that there is ſcarcely ever any ſtormy Winds there, by reaſon of the great heat the Sun gives. A few days after we got before <hi>Macaſſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macaſſar</hi> is a conſiderable Kingdom, and well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd. The <hi>Dutch, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> have all free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Traffick there, as well as the Indians of all parts. It lies on the Iſland <hi>Cebebes</hi> to the <hi>South,</hi> and reaches about an hundred Leagues; under the Line, it hath <hi>Borneo</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Molucca</hi> Iſlands on the other.</p>
               <p>Here lay an Engliſh Ship, which had loſt both her Surgeons in the Voyage, and were in great want of one to take care of their Men; they applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not only to me, but to the Reſident, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to leave my Ship, to go with them, but it did not lie in the Governours power to free me from my Engagement in the Dutch Company. However they being drove to ſuch neceſſity, I went and lookt after their Patients, and I left all that was proper for 'em with one of the Ship, together with written Inſtructions, how, and when to make uſe of 'em; for which they thanked me heartily, and gratified me very generouſly.</p>
               <p>There happen'd a Fire one Night in one of their <hi>Negerys,</hi> which was all conſumed in an inſtant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built with nothing but Bamboos, and gave ſo great a light, that we thought it was the Day break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon us again, and put us into a kind of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, till we knew what it was.</p>
               <p>The People, Natives of this Iſland, are ſcatter'd thro' all parts of the Indies; and all Nations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of 'em for their Slaves, becuaſe they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding faithful, diligent, and good natur'd, and make the braveſt Soldiers, as I have ſeen it my ſelf in the whole time of the War of <hi>Bantam,</hi> where they daily ſignaliz'd themſelves, both by their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct. They are likewiſe the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100310:98"/>
ſort of Servants. I have had two of them, who have got me half a Ducate on a day; ſo that theſe are lookt upon as the moſt valuable of all the Indians; and therefore are uſed with the greateſt care and humanity that may be. The hardeſt and moſt ſlaviſh part of their Work, is generally put upon the <hi>Malabarians,</hi> who are an ill-lookt ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, like the <hi>Caffers.</hi> They are ſo black too, that they are often taken for <hi>Moors:</hi> Whereas it is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Aſia,</hi> but diſperſed here and there over all the <hi>Indies,</hi> as the <hi>Jews</hi> are in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The right <hi>Moors</hi> are thoſe of the great <hi>Mogul</hi>'s Country, and the places adjacent, as <hi>Bengal, Surat, Golconda, &amp;c.</hi> but they very ſeldom or never go out of their own Country; nor doth any body dare to take them for Slaves. As there is ſome of 'em as black as a Coal, ſo there is ſome as white as any <hi>European</hi> whatever. They are moſt of 'em very civil, handſom and well ſhaped, courteous and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel in their Behaviour. They are great Merchants, and very ſincere in their Dealings; and thoſe I have had to do with, I have always found very generous and grateful. I had once the Son of a rich <hi>Moor</hi> under my hands, while I was at the Hoſpital of <hi>Bantam:</hi> He had broke his Leg, and had been left to the care of ſome Surgeons of that Nation, who had done him no good. The Father at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of the skill of his Countrymen, ſent for me, and ſhew'd a great deal of rational concern for his Son's condition. I went to the Boy, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving examined the Fraction, and found it to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I imagined; I told the Father he might take Courage, and that I did not doubt but I ſhould in a little while ſet his Son upon his Legs again, with the help of the Almighty Creator of Heaven and Earth; (making uſe of thoſe Terms, becauſe it is in that Idea eſpecially, that the <hi>Moors</hi> worſhip God:) Upon which he bowed and lift up his Eyes
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100310:99"/>
towards Heaven. I ſent for my Boy, and with the aſſiſtance of a <hi>Moor,</hi> I ſet the Bone of the Boy's Leg; and having done all that was neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, my Young Patient found eaſe immediately. This gave the Father much ſatisfaction, and he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preſented me with twenty <hi>Spaniſh Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> telling me that was nothing of my pay, but to encourage me to take what carel could of his Child. Thus, with God's aſſiſtance, I cured his Boy entirely in ſix Weeks time; and without asking me, what I expected, he gave me thirty <hi>Cubanz</hi> into my hands, which amounted to three hundred Rixdollers, and ask'd me whether that ſatisfi'd me. I told him it did extreamly well; and truly well it might, for in our Country we knew nothing of ſuch large Fees as thoſe are. If we had but a few ſuch Patients there, it would keep a great many at home, who are now forced to ramble abroad, meerly to get their liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>But I return now to my Ship, which was ready to ſet ſail again for <hi>Batavia,</hi> and waiting only for a Wind. Therefore with the firſt Eaſterly Wind, we ſet out of the Port of <hi>Macaſſar,</hi> and running happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thro' the <hi>Pater-noſter Iſlands,</hi> we came to Anchor before <hi>Japara,</hi> where we found three Ships come from <hi>Batavia,</hi> three days before us; and had brought ſome Soldiers from thence, to quel an uproar that had been made at <hi>Japara,</hi> in which above twenty Dutch had been killed by the Inhabitants, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to throw themſelves into the Fort <hi>Sambura.</hi> But by the means of the Governor, and this Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Force, all was quieted, and the Ringleaders ſent away to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where they receiv'd their due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Some of them were broken upon the Wheel, ſome had their Ears and Noſes cut off; and were ſent chained altogether to ſome Iſlands to ſpend all their Life in burning of Lime, and there to remain perpetual Slaves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:100310:99"/>
I Landed before theſe Wretches were ſent away, ſo that I ſaw 'em go along Chain'd together: But that which was the moſt diſmal to ſee, was the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and ſad Out-cries of theſe poor Fellow's Wives and Children, who conducted them to the Water-ſide.</p>
               <p>All being thus ſettled again, the Company aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Garriſon, and fortified thoſePlaces which needed it moſt, to prevent any ſuch Diſorders for the future. It is a wonderful Thing, that ſuch are not more frequent; and that whenever they happen, they are ſo ſoon Calm'd, conſidering the vaſtneſs of the Dutch Dominions, which are ſo ſcatter'd here and there, and ſo far aſunder; but it is to be aſcrib'd to their vigilant, and wiſely Model'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; without which, they could not ſupport the weight of their ſeveral Dominions, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeveral Empires, Kingdoms, and large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, (all which would be too tedious to ſetdown) and it would amaze one to think, what a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Deputies, Preſidents, Governours, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, they are forced to maintain for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Power; beſides ſome Hundreds of Ships: And, I dare ſay, by good Computation, they have above a Hundred thouſand Men by Sea and Land. But as their Expence is great, ſo their Wealth is unaccountable; for where-ever you go, you ſhall not ſee one Thing in a thouſand, little or great, but if you ask whoſe that is, all the anſwer is, the Company's.</p>
               <p>We departed from <hi>Japara,</hi> and came the next day into the Road before <hi>Batavia,</hi> and an hour or two after us, came in the Ship that had thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels on board: ſo that there we ſaw them Executed, and diſpoſed of as I have ſaid already.</p>
               <p>Before our Ship was quite Unladen, here aroſe a moſt terrible Hurricane, which tore moſt of the Ships off their Anchors, and drove two of them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100310:100"/>
upon ſome of the little Iſlands, that lie near there; one of which being old and decayed, was daſht in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pieces. It laſted but half an hour, and ſo the Damage was the leſs, elſe there would hardly a Ship have eſcaped: Ours had caſt out five Anchors, two of which we loſt; and two of our Men being in the Long-Boat, the Storm coming upon them ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, could not make to the Ship, but the Rope breaking, were torn off from us. When the Wind ceaſed, we went to ſee after'em, and found our poor Seamen ſtill alive, but that was all, tied faſt by Cords to the Boat which floated with the bottom upwards; So that all were recover'd: But it was a Miracle, that being ſo far ſpent as they were, and not able to help themſelves, their Brains were not knockt out againſt the Boat; or that they were not devoured by Sharks. Beſides all this, abundance of ſmall Veſſels, Prawen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were caſt away; and many Perſons drown'd.</p>
               <p>The next day I went to ſhore with the Maſter and the Factors, who deſign'd to ſtay there all Night, and ordered the Seamen to go back to their Ship. I deſired they might ſtay till the Evening, becauſe I had a mind to go with 'em. But it being pretty dark, and the Wind very high, our Seamen keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Sail without Fear or Wit, we were all over-turn'd, within a Stone's throw of the Ship; but by the Bleſſing of God, and the ſpeedy Aſſiſtance of the Ship's Crew, we were all took up Safe.</p>
               <p>The next Morning I return'd to Land, where I was no ſooner come, but a <hi>Muck Speeler,</hi> who had done a great deal of Miſchief, and put the People in an Uproar, came running by me, and by good Fortune did me no harm; but kill'd a Boy within 20 Steps of me, and was preſently Shot himſelf in the Head, and dropt down; but it was after he had kill'd five or ſix People: Nothing ſaved me but the corner of the Street, by means of which, as he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100310:100"/>
run ſo furiouſly, he over-ſhot me, and got paſt me before I could get aware of him; and ſo, God be prais'd, I was ſafe, but ever ſince I was always upon my guard at Turnings and Croſſings of Streets.</p>
               <p>Here I ſpent my time with a great deal of variety of Diverſions, as Fiſhing, Walking, Shooting, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Water, and chiefly ſeeing my Friends: Moſt days I took a Praw, and went to ſome ſmall Iſlands that lie hard by there, where the chief Fiſhing is to be ſeen. Upon one of theſe Iſlands lived a rich Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe near to the <hi>Chineſe</hi>'s Temple. He having a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Family of Children and Servants, I had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Buſineſs in his Houſe, and got a great deal of Money by him. One Night, as I had taken my leave of him, and was going home, I ſaw a bright Flame at a mighty diſtance, and heard ſome Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Being Landed, I took ſome of my Friends with me to a high part of the Shore to ſee it. We were all amazed to think what it ſhould be, and in giving our ſeveral Opinions, we ſpent all the Night look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it. In the Morning the Flame could no longer be ſeen; but we hearing ſtill a Gun go off now and then, we went and acquainted the General with it, who order'd a Boat to be ſet out with 20 Men and an Officer, ready to go at Night, in caſe the Flame appeared again, and the Shooting continued. As the Day ſhut in, the Flame begun to be ſeen more and more, and ſomewhat nearer than the Night before. I deſired the Officer that I might go with him, which he readily granting, we ſet forward, and made directly up to the Fire: Coming nearer, we ſaw it was a ſmall Bark and People in it, we Hail'd them, upon which they gave over Shooting, but made us no Anſwer. This made us the more Earneſt to get up to 'em, and to Board 'em, which we did: And there we ſaw a moſt lamentable Sight, eight poor Engliſhmen, three of 'em Dead, and the five others little better, not able to ſpeak
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:100310:101"/>
one Word, but endeavouring to mutter. We took them into our Boat with us, together with ſome Cheſts of <hi>Tanges</hi> and <hi>Larines,</hi> (which is a certain Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of that Country) which they had in their Boat with them; we uſed them as gently as we could, and made all ſpeed poſſible to the Place from whence we came, and there gave them all Kind of Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was five or ſix hours e'er they came to themſelves, ſo as to ſpeak: At length they gave us an Account of themſelves; and told us, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to an Engliſh Ship that came from <hi>Bengal</hi> richly laden, and was Bound for <hi>Batavia</hi> to joyn the Engliſh Merchant-men that lay there; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Iſland <hi>Engano,</hi> it being hard Weather, they were thrown upon a Shelf, where their Ship was ſunk, ſo that of 78 Men they had on Board, but 15 got into that little tatter'd Boat, and that of them there was but thoſe we ſaw left; the reſt having periſhed one after another for want of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they had not had a Drop of in 15 or 16 days time.</p>
               <p>When we had this Account from them, we took them to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and carried them to the Engliſh Houſe, where we were heartily Thank'd, and treated with great Civility: Beſides all which, the next Morning a Reward was ſent to every one of the Soldiers, and to the Officer: And as for me, Having been very Helpful to them, and managed them with ſome Cordials, and taking Care leſt their ſudden Refreſhment ſhould do them an Injury, I had 20 Ducatoons ſent me as a Preſent.</p>
               <p>While I remain'd here, there happen'd nothing more worth taking Notice of: And now Orders were ſent me to repair on Board the <hi>Bergen</hi> in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weegen,</hi> which was to go Commadore, with two other Ships bound for <hi>Odia,</hi> the capital City of <hi>Siam;</hi> ſo that I went and provided my ſelf with all that was neceſſary for the Voyage: Which being done,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100310:101"/>
I went on Board my Ship, the Fleet being ready to go off, and we ſhould have ſet Sail the very nextday, had not the <hi>Ekerſloo,</hi> one of our three Ships, ſprung a Leak, which obliged us to ſtay while they took all the Goods out of her again, and mended her, which was a whole fortnight.</p>
               <p>This done, ſhe had her Lading put in again; and then we went under Sail with a favourable Wind, and next day paſs'd by the Iſle of <hi>Lucapara;</hi> and thus we continued our Courſe with good Succeſs for about eight days: But as it is almoſt impoſſible for two or three Ships to make ſo conſiderable a Voyage without ſome Lett or Misfortune; the <hi>Ekerſloo</hi> ſtruck upon a Bank of Sand, which frighted us all very much. As ſoon as ſhe gave us notice of it by firing a Gun, for we were a good way before her, but had happily Steer'd aſide and miſs'd the Bank, we immediately ſet out our Shallops, and went to her, and found there was no Remedy but Unlading her; which we did with all ſpeed, and beſtowed the Goods, partly on Board of our Ship, and partly on the other: It was a great happineſs that the Wind was not very high, elſe we could never have done this. When all the Goods were out, we made ſhift, by means of caſting Anchors, to get her off the Bank; and having examined her within, and found ſhe had no Damage done to her Keel, we put the Goods on Board of her again, and continued our Courſe, thanking God we had eſcaped ſuch a great Danger, by the favour of the Wind, which ſtill continued good for us.</p>
               <p>This happen'd to us in our Courſe to <hi>Tumbolan</hi> and <hi>Ananibo</hi> as we ſailed between <hi>Borneo</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacca,</hi> from which in three days we reach'd the Iſland <hi>Matuna.</hi> As we paſs'd by it, we ſaw ſome Ships before us, which we concluded were <hi>Chineſe Jonckers;</hi> About night they paſs'd by us directing their Courſe towards <hi>Borneo,</hi> which made us think they came
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100310:102"/>
from <hi>Cambodia.</hi> At break of day we ſaw five more, who likewiſe paſt by us about Noon, and ſteer'd their Courſe towards <hi>Malacca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we were come up to the corner of that Iſland, we took the Elevation of the Pole, and found we were to Sail more to the Northward; and in a ſhort time we came to the River, which runs through the Kingdom of <hi>Siam,</hi> up which we ſailed as far as the Town <hi>Bontempia,</hi> and there we caſt Anchor. Our Maſter and the Factor went ſtraightway in the Long-Boat to the Chief City <hi>Odia;</hi> which is 30 Leagues up the River; as ſoon as they were come back they went to Unlading.</p>
               <p>I then went on Shore too, and viſited the Dutch Factory there. The Houſe which the Dutch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors have there, is amazing both for its Largeneſs Beauty, and Strength. Above, are all the Lodgings, which are wonderful Stately both without and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Under, are the Warehouſes, which are of a vaſt bigneſs, and richly ſtored with all manner of Commodities.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Odia</hi> is very large; but moſt of the Houſes are very low: So that all the Towers of their Temples (which are computed to be above Five thouſand) being rais'd much higher, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all eaſily ſeen by reaſon of the other Buildings being ſo low, ſeem altogether like a Foreſt in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is impoſſible for any one to conceive what vaſt numbers of People is continually moving about in that City, inſomuch, that a Man who is newly come, would be apt to ask what's the matter, and take that for a gathering of the Mob, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Croud, which is but the uſual Concourſe of the Town. It is ſeated upon the River <hi>Menan,</hi> which is likewiſe fill'd with Ships, Praws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This River is of the ſame Nature with the <hi>Nile,</hi> the <hi>Niger,</hi> and the <hi>Ganges,</hi> and like them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows all the Fields about <hi>Odia,</hi> and makes them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100310:102"/>
fruitful; ſpreading it ſelf over great part of the Country, by means of ſeveral Arms or Creeks which Providence hath ordered for that purpoſe. And beſides this Advantage which this Inundation affords to the Country, it is a mighty Fence to the City <hi>Odia;</hi> becauſe the River over-flowing at cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Seaſons, no Enemy can Beſiege it but for ſome Months, during which the City is always able to defend it ſelf, being extraordinary well Situated and Fortified.</p>
               <p>Through moſt of the Streets run fine Channels, as at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> ſo that one may go with a Boat from one part of the Town to the other, which renders it mighty Commodious for Trade; I may ſay, that conſidering all things, there is not a finer City in all <hi>India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Ships having now in little more than a Fortnights time unladen, and taken in their full Lading, which conſiſted of ſeveral Commodities, as Buck and Roe-Skins, Jappan-Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we fell down the River, and with a fair Northerly Wind ſet Sail homewards again.</p>
               <p>The next day it Snowed ſo hard, and the Wind was ſo high, that we were drove almoſt upon Land 'ere we could be aware of it; but by good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence we came off without any hurt, and in 11 days came up with the Iſland <hi>Puloaura;</hi> where we lay ſtill three days refreſhing our ſelves, and then continued our Courſe. We arrived at <hi>Batavia</hi> in three Weeks: We were hardly come into Harbour when we ſaw the moſt diſmal Spectacle that can be. The Ship the <hi>Elephant,</hi> which rode at Anchor hard by us, laden with Powder and other Ammunition deſign'd for <hi>Bantam,</hi> by ſome Accident took Fire; and in an inſtant blew up into a thouſand pieces; ſo that of above 80 Men that were on Board her, there was not one left alive to tell how it came. It was the moſt diſmal ſight methoughts I ever
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:100310:103"/>
had ſeen, to behold ſo many humane Bodies toſs'd at ſuch a vaſt diſtance into the Air, for ſome of them went over our Ship, and ſo did ſeveral large pieces of the Ship likewiſe; and what made it the more diſmal, was, that no manner of help could be afforded them.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of going aſhore with the reſt, I went on Board a Ship that was come hither ſome days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us from <hi>Cameron</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> becauſe the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon which belonged to that Ship was a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman and intimate Acquaintance of mine, and we had been together in ſeveral Expeditions in the Wars of <hi>Bantam.</hi> He was over-joyed to ſee me, and I was no leſs pleaſed to find him well. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Queſtions paſt on both ſides, we came to give one another an Account of our Adventures ſince we parted, which gave him occaſion to tell me, that he had had pretty good Fortune in all his Voyages, but that he had narrowly eſcaped Death in a place where he thought himſelf moſt ſecure: For, ſaith he, When I firſt went to Shore at <hi>Cameron,</hi> I went with ſome of my Companions to the Factor's Houſe, and having ſpoken with them I had Buſineſs with, we went into a <hi>Cabaret</hi> or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Houſe; whence, after we had ſtaid an hour or little more, we thought to go back to our Ships; but ere we could get to our Boats the Night catcht us, and we were ſet upon by a company of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throats. They out-did us in number, and were well Arm'd, whereas none of us had any Weapon about us, ſo that we could make but a fruitleſs Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. Flight being the beſt Remedy, I preſume we all attempted it; but three of us only eſcaped their Hands, yet not altogether neither; for I had ſeveral Blows from 'em, and was run through in two places; the two others had their ſhare too; but neither of us three got any further hurt, and we have great reaſon to thank the Almighty God
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100310:103"/>
who delivered us out of their Hands; for whatever they did with the reſt of our Company, which were five more, we never yet could learn what became of 'em.</p>
               <p>He likewiſe ſpeaking of <hi>Cameron,</hi> told me, That while he was there, there had been ſuch an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake as had thrown down ſeveral Houſes, and kill'd ſeveral hundreds of People.</p>
               <p>Our next talk was about our own Country, to which we having both of us an Inclination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, we agreed there in an inſtant to take our Meaſures about it; for both of us had ſerved the Company our due time, and ſome Months over. So we went together on Board my Ship, and from thence we took a Boat to Shore, and went together to wait upon the Head Chirurgion, to acquaint him with our Deſign, and to deſire him to Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy us now on Land till the Fleet went off for <hi>Holland.</hi> He received us with great Civility, and did what we requeſted of him; and gave us part of the Hoſpital in Charge, as I had had before. This being done, We went each of us to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Ships to take our leave of 'em, and to fetch our Things, and return'd in the ſame Praw to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where we repair'd to our Poſt, and propoſed to our ſelves to take ſuch Care, that there might be no Cauſe of Complaints, leaſt they ſhould prove an obſtacle to our Deſigns, as it frequently happens.</p>
               <p>We had not been long here, but a Ship arrived from <hi>Holland.</hi> All the People that came in her, which were above 200 Soldiers, beſides Seamen, were preſently landed, and drawn up before the Caſtle-Gate, till an Order came from the General for them to march up to his Apartment in the Caſtle. I went to ſee them, for as the Reader may well ſuppoſe, every Body is deſirous to hear how Matters ſtand at home, and is in Expectation
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100310:104"/>
to meet with ſome Acquaintance. I found one there whom I had ſome Knowledge of, a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant's Son of <hi>Suabia,</hi> but had lived a long time at <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where I had ſeen him.</p>
               <p>When I had given him the Welcome, and he me an Account of his Voyage, he rejoyced me with the good News of our Victories over the <hi>Ottomans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>While we were Talking, the Order came from the General to let them march into the Caſtle; where they had each of them their ſeveral Poſts and Stations aſſign'd. But as all New-Comers have three ſeveral Days liberty to refreſh themſelves, I took my Acquaintance with me, to ſhew him the Civility of the place, (which is commonly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not very great). I took him out deſigning to go to a <hi>Negery,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Batavia:</hi> But as we were going up the River in a Praw we had taken, we met ſome <hi>Javians</hi> coming down in a ſmall Boat, making a mighty noiſe with ſome little Bells. We ask'd them the meaning of it; they told us that it was a Wedding, and that that was their Muſick. So we reſolved to go back with them, and ſee the manner of 'em: They went to an Houſe about a quarter of a Mile out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We were invited to come in. The Houſe was all ſet out and ſtrewed with Flowers, and ſeveral Mats made of Rice-Straw were laid upon the Ground, on which they were to have their Dinner.</p>
               <p>After a great many Ceremonies were paſt, which I have given an Account of already, a Buffle was brought, which the Bridegroom knockt down, and the Bride took a Knife and cut his Throat. Then they by turns cut pieces of the Fleſh, which they gave to the Cook to Dreſs, giving him at the ſame time Inſtructions how they would have it done, and Herbs to do it with. Some of it was ordered upon our Account, but we neither of us
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100310:104"/>
cared to be Sharers of ſuch a tough Entertainment, and they being but a meaner ſort of People, we thank'd them for the Civility they had ſhewn us, and ſo left 'em.</p>
               <p>From thence we return'd to <hi>Batavia,</hi> for the day was ſhutting in; and no New-Comer may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf from his Poſt the firſt Night, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deferr'd our deſigned Walk till the next day.</p>
               <p>That night one of the Caſtle-Gates was open'd, (which is a thing ſeldom known) to let out the Preſident of the City; who, together with ſome others of the Council, had been at Supper with the General.</p>

We cauſed a Dinner to be got ready for us of what the Country afforded; which was Fiſh and Fowl, Eggs, Herbs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Our Liquor was <hi>Suri,</hi> which is a Juice drawn from the Coco-Trees; with that, we made very good <hi>Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack</hi> and <hi>Lemonade,</hi> by the help of ſome Sugar, Spices, Limons, and Oranges, which we had in good plenty.</p>
               <p>I having a mind to make my Friend merry, and to divert him with variety, I ſent for ſome <hi>Gom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomers,</hi> (the Muſicians of that Country) and ſome <hi>Javian Baliar</hi> Dancers, who made us a great deal of Paſtime. The <hi>Baliar</hi> Dancers, which come from <hi>Babylon,</hi> I have ſpoken of before; but theſe were <hi>Javians,</hi> which are a ſort far inferiour to them, and differ from them much in the ſame manner as there is between a Dance performed by a Dancing-Maſter and one danced by a Ruſtick: But what was moſt Diverting to us, eſpecially to my Friend, was, ſome Tumblers and Jugglers that were amongſt 'em, who ſhew'd us ſeveral Tricks, which do uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much ſurprize, even thoſe that ſee them, that I know a Man runs ſome risk in relating of them. However, ſome of their moſt conſiderable Tricks of Activity I cannot wholly paſs paſs by.</p>
               <p>They were five in number: One of 'em laid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf flat down upon his Belly, upon a Mat they had ſpread on the Ground, and in the twinkling of an Eye, raiſed himſelf upon his Legs; then laying himſelf down again as before, he rais'd himſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame manner, and ſtood upon his Head on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: After this he laid himſelf upon his Back, and gave ſeveral Leaps in the Air like a Fiſh. The other four did the ſame Tricks over, one after the other, and ſtill better and better. After this they took a Ladder of about 12 Rounds, and ſet it againſt one of 'em; one of the other four got up to the top of it, and laid himſelf a croſs it; the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:100310:106"/>
ſecond went up, and ſat a-croſs theother's Shoulders; the third climb'd up and pitch'd himſelf on his Head, upon the Head of the ſecond, and there ſtood with his Feet directly upwards; upon which, the fourth came, and ſtood upright on the Feet of the third; And after playing ſeveral Tricks there, he leapt down on the Ground, and ſtood ſtill; the next Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that was ſtill ſtanding on his Head, gave a ſpring upwards, and falling down, lighted on the Shoulders of him that ſtood below; the next, who was on the Ladder came down likewiſe with a Leap, and fell a-croſs the Shoulders of him; and ſo did the fourth and laſt, who had been the firſt on the Ladder: He that had ſtood all this while, and held the foot of the Ladder, took it and climb'd up with it to the top of the other four, and there made a ſort of Harangue to us in <hi>Japponneſe,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Sight. There was a great many other Tricks intermixt with theſe, which were well worth the taking notice of; but I thought theſe would ſuffice to ſhew you, how far theſe Men out-do any thing we commonly ſee in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This being over, we call'd for our Reckoning in, which came to no more than Two thouſand <hi>Butgis.</hi> An <hi>European</hi> at firſt is frightned at ſuch a reckoning as this, and thinks that ſuch a Sum of Money ſhould be enough to Treat a King and all the Nobility, or to defray the Charges of a Lord Mayor's Feaſt; but he muſt underſtand, that theſe <hi>Butgis</hi> are but little thin pieces of Lead, with holes in the middle of 'em, a certain number of them is put upon a String to ſave the trouble of telling them over upon every occaſion, and three Hundred of 'em are worth but Two Pence of Dutch Money; ſo that our Dinner amounted but to 13 or 14 <hi>d.</hi> Beſides this, our Muſick and Dancers coſt us a Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and we gave a Ducatoon to the Juglers and Tumblers; having paid all, we went back again down the River to <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:100310:106"/>
At this very time the Streight of <hi>Sunda</hi> was very much infeſted with Pickaroons; They had only Praws or ſmall Boats of their own, with which they run with eaſe in and out of ſeveral Rivers of the Kingdom of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and did a great deal of miſchief about the Iſlands of <hi>Toppers-hoedie, Dwarſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-de-zee,</hi> and others. They uſed to wait there for their Prey, and when they had gotten their Booty, they made immediately to their lurking holes, where finding ſafety for a great while, they were at laſt ſo bold, that not a Ship could ſcape them; and the more, becauſe the Company never concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about it, nor took any Meaſures to ſuppreſs them. But at length, the <hi>Bali,</hi> (the Ship in which I had been ſome time before) coming that way, bound for <hi>Jambi</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Sumatra;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to caſt Anchor near the aforeſaid Iſlands, theſe Pyrates joyning their Forces together, came and ſurrounded her, and notwithſtanding a ſtout Defence made on Board the <hi>Bali</hi> for ſome hours, they made themſelves Maſters of her, killed all the Men they could come at; and having taken what they could conveniently carry away, ſet it on Fire.</p>
               <p>While the Ship was all in Flames, a Ship from <hi>Malabar</hi> coming luckily by, made towards the Fire to ſee what it was. Two Men, who in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement had hid themſelves below Deck, and were now got out, but knew not how to diſpoſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſtood upon the Fore-Caſtle ready to throw themſelves into the Sea to avoid being burnt: But they ſent them a Boat, by which means theſe poor Creatures were preſerved; and being brought on Board the Ship, they continued their Courſe to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where they gave the General an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of what had happen'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:100310:107"/>
The Company now being Sufferers by this, thought fit to ſend after theſe Pyrates, which they never minded before, while they came by no loſs themſelves, and while the Fiſhermen only, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in danger. Immediately two Men of War were ordered to go after 'em, together with eight ſmall Boats well Mann'd, to give them Chace. It being requiſite there ſhould be Chirurgions more than ordinary in thoſe Ships, and this being like to be a ſhort Expedition, and near home, my Friend and I, who could not be employed in a long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, were appointed to go with them. We were very well pleas'd with our Commiſſion, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we got ready our Cheſts, and went on Board the <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which carried 300 Men, and 48 Guns: The other Ship was about the ſame Rate. The Boats had each of them from 60 to 70 Men, and about 16 Patterero's.</p>
               <p>When we were got paſt the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> we kept along the Sea-ſhore till we came beyond <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam,</hi> and there we lay before the Mouth of ſome Rivers, as cloſe to the Land as we could: And ſo as to lye to the Windward. At Night we divided our Fleet, and ſent two of our Boats out to Sea to entice the Pirates out after them, if they ſhould chance to ſee them, and we ſtood ready to clap in between them, and the River; ſo to cut off their Paſs, and hedge them in. We lay two days cloſe to the Shore, within a Stone's throw of Land, but very ſafe, with no leſs than 60 Fathom Water. Atlength, about Sun-ſet, we ſaw five Boats making Sail towards our two Boats, at about two Leagues diſtance from us; upon which we moved altogether forwards, along the Shore; and by that time it was quite dark, we made directly towards 'em, taking ſtill care to be between the Shore and them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:100310:107"/>
The next morning we ſaw them by break of day ſailing by a ſmall Iſland. They having found out our Deſign, were endeavouring to make their eſcape, for the two Boats we had ſent after 'em were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from 'em than we were with the whole Fleet: So we joyned together again, and our eight Boats ſailing much faſter than the Men of War could, purſued them ſo tightly, that notwithſtanding theſe Rovers had ſeveral Oars with them, (which they uſe to make uſe of in a Calm or in caſe of purſuit) yet by Noon our Boats were all got within a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a League of 'em; ſo that the laſt of 'em were forced to yield or fight. We with our great Ships were within a League of 'em all, and turn'd round a ſmall Iſland, during which we loſt ſight of them: But our Boats all this while having got ground, they begun to thunder amongſt 'em; ſo that in a little time, two of the Pyrates Boats were ſeized. Then we came in ſight again, and took theſe two Boats into our Charge, and brought the Men on Board of us. Our Boats having made ſome ſtay, while they engaged theſe two, the other three were got away again pretty far. However, ours were not long 'ere they came within ſhot of 'em, and ſo purſued them that they came to a cloſe En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and after a ſharp reſiſtance, at length became Maſters of them.</p>
               <p>We loſt in all 28 Men, and had 30 wounded; but we kill'd 200, and wounded above 50 of theirs. The reſt we carried to <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was at firſt near 900 of 'em; of which nine were Dutchmen, and two Danes; one of whom had been a Captain of a Man of War. We caught both the Danes, but we had but three Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the ſix others were killed in the ſight.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Batavia,</hi> they were all put into Priſon, and Examin'd. They confeſs'd, that they had their Habitations in ſome <hi>Negery</hi>'s, about the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:100310:108"/>
                  <hi>Blaw Peper-bergh,</hi> and diſcover'd ſeveral of their Companions thereabouts: Upon which they ſent Soldiers both by Sea and Land towards thoſe places; and in three Week's time they brought back with 'em ſome thouſands of 'em, moſt of 'em being <hi>Javians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the whole, one part was broke upon the Wheel, ſome were Quarter'd, ſome were Whipt, ſome had their Ears and Noſes cut off, and ſome were burnt in the Forehead. The three Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were Hang'd: The two Danes Beheaded: and a great number of others were ſent to ſeveralIſlands; to Burn Lime, Hew Stone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and there to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main Slaves all their Lives. Their Wives and Children were ſerved after the ſame manner, that it might more effectually prove a terrour to others.</p>
               <p>About this time came into the Road of <hi>Batavia</hi> a Ship from <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> which brought with her two and twenty Savages from the Iſland St. <hi>Galle.</hi> They were much uglier and much more brutiſh than the <hi>Hottentots</hi> at the <hi>Cape of Good Hope;</hi> their Speech was hardly articulate, but confuſed like that of Children, and as if they Sung. They had no Hair on their Heads, only a rough ſcabby Skin. They were ſtrong, tho' exceſſive Lean, and had ſcarce any thing but Skin and Bones. Before their Privy-Parts they had a Wild-Cat's Skin, which reach'd down to their Knees; for in St. <hi>Galle</hi> there are multitudes of Wild-Cats.</p>
               <p>They were ſhut up all together, like Beaſts in a Stable, and were fed with nothing but raw Rice and Water, which it ſeems was too good for 'em; for in a little while they all died. A naſtier ſort of Men I never ſaw; for as I ſaid, except their Head, they were Hairy all over to their very Hands and Feet. Their Face was very red; but their Teeth were very fine and white: Their Eyes were very large; and their large Ears ſlit in five or ſix places.
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100310:108"/>
About their Neck and Feet they had ſome Twiſts of Sea-Ruſhes; which their Women made uſe of likewiſe to bear up their long ſwagging Breaſts. I believe the World doth not afford a more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage Wild ſort of Men. St. <hi>Galle,</hi> from which they came, lies about 1300 miles from <hi>Batavia,</hi> and about 300 from the Cape, on the ſide of the Iſland <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagaſcar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some time after this, a <hi>Javian</hi> Hermit, who lived in a Cave on the <hi>Blaw Peper-bergh,</hi> came to <hi>Batavia</hi> to ſpeak with the General; and refuſing to deliver his Meſſage to any of his Attendants, he was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and brought before the General, with whom he ſpent ſome time alone. His Buſineſs with him, was to make a diſcovery of a Plot, which ſeveral <hi>Javians</hi> had laid to ſurprize the City of <hi>Bantam,</hi> and to put all the Dutch Garriſon to the Sword: Upon which the General diſpatch'd an Expreſs to the Governor of <hi>Bantam,</hi> to Command him to be upon his Guard, and to let him know that he ſhould have a Reinforcement ſent him ſpeedily by Sea and Land.</p>
               <p>The Company upon this conceived a great Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, that the young King might be in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy; But it was upon a cloſe Enquiry, found to be a meer ſurmize; and all his Actions ſhewing ſo much the contrary all along, they continued to treat him with the ſame Reſpect as before: For all the Ring-leaders of this Plot were detected, taken, and puniſhed according to their Deſerts; but not the leaſt thing could be found that might any way reflect on the young King.</p>
               <p>The Hermit did not Care to return to his Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage again: So the Company promiſed him, that he ſhould never want if he would continue with them; which he accepted of readily.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:100310:109"/>
He ſpake ſeven Languages; to wit, <hi>Turkiſh, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, Perſian, Mooriſh, Chineſe, Maleiſh,</hi> and <hi>Javian;</hi> and had Travell'd over moſt parts of <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica.</hi> He had lived 15 years in that Cell; and it was a wonder how a Man ſhould continue there ſo long with any thing of ſafety; conſidering the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tygers, Leopards, Serpents, and other devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures that are in great numbers all about that Mountain.</p>
               <p>His Dreſs was very much like that of the <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Women; ſo that one would not have taken him for a Man; and beſides that, one might have miſtaken him, even tho' one was near him, becauſe he had pull'd his Beard out by the Roots: He was very thoughtful, ſpake but ſeldom, and very grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. He had above twenty pair of Shooes made of Paſtboard, hung about his Girdle. Inſtead of a Hat, he had a ſort of a Turbant wrapt about his Head made of ſtrip'd Cotton, about twelve Ells long, as the Moors uſually wear.</p>
               <p>As to his Diet, he Eat moderately, but loved to have all very good. Whatever he Drank, he poured part of it upon his Head, which was as bare as the Palm of a Man's Head, which was as bare as the Palm of a Man's Hand. The Lodging that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for him was over againſt mine, ſo that I had ſome Converſation with him in the <hi>Maleiſh</hi> Language. But he was not free of his Diſcourſe, except ſometimes in the Relation of his Voyages, and the Deſcription of the Countries he had ſeen; as to the reſt he ſeemed reſerved. I ask'd him one day, how he came to be an Hermit; to which he replied, juſt as you come to be a Surgeon. But to have done with my capricious Gentleman.</p>
               <p>I was ſent for to one of the General's Servants, ſo that I had once more an opportunity of ſeeing the General's Garden, which was one of the fineſt that ever was ſeen; for all kind of Aſiatic or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Trees and Flowers, in which were two Parts
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100310:109"/>
ſet aſide, the one for all manner of Wild-Beaſts; the other for all ſorts of Birds, of all which, an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count would be too tedious: In ſhort, I can hardly think of any rare Creature that was not there to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>Two days after this, my Companion and I, and two more, went a ſhooting, about two or three Leagues into the Country, along by the Powder-Mills, upon the River <hi>Jacatra:</hi> And as we had pretty good ſport, and kill'd a good quantity of Pigeons, Rabbets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we were going to a <hi>Negery</hi> to refreſh our ſelves, and make Merry with our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, we ſpying a Rabbet making towards a little Wood; two of us went after him, while the others went forward to get that Dreſs'd which we had kill'd. As we were in purſuit of our Game, my Friend one way, and I the other, I came to a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row River's ſide, where I ſaw a Man ſitting in a Melancholly poſture, with his Eyes on the Ground. Hearing him groan and ſigh, put me to a ſtand, and ask him what he was; to which he anſwer'd me with a deep ſigh, that he was a poor Hollander. I askt him what he did there, and whither he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to go. Ah! Sir, ſays he, I know not where I am, nor which way I am to take, but ſurely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence hath ſent you to my Relief; and ſeeing I have the Happineſs once more to meet with a Chriſtian, I beſeech you to direct me, (if there's any way for't) how I may come to you: Saying this, he fell upon his Knees; ſo I told him, I would get him over, and bid him ſtay there. My Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion had made his ſhoot, and was gone to the reſt: So I went up to the Village, and got a Praw, which I ſent to bring him over to me; and as ſoon as he came over, he guſht out in Tears, and Embracing me, thank'd me moſt paſſionately for my ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance. I deſired him to go along with me to ſome Company I had, which he did;
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100310:110"/>
and gave me a ſhort account of himſelf by the way. My Company wondred who I had got with me, but when they were informed what he was, we all help'd to Comfort him, and treated him as we did our ſelves. In that while he inform'd us of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of his Misfortunes: The ſum of which was, That being come over from <hi>Delſt,</hi> in the Company's Service, as Carpenter, he had been employed in the <hi>Kartirian</hi> Wars; and as he, with three more, were ſent out to take a View of ſome part of the chief City of that Kingdom, they had the ill Fortune to fall into the Hands of the Enemy, who carried them away Priſoners to <hi>Tuban,</hi> and there Sold them to a rich <hi>Chineſe,</hi> who was juſt come thither in a Ship of his own: That <hi>Chineſe</hi> carried them all four to <hi>China,</hi> to the Sea-Port Town call'd <hi>Quancheu;</hi> where after ſeven years of hard Slavery, they found an opportunity, and made their eſcape from thence in a ſmall Boat to the Iſland of <hi>Manilha;</hi> where they luckily met with a Ship that was coming to <hi>Batavia,</hi> but as they were got almoſt within reach of it, and within four miles of Land, their Ship ſtruck upon a Shelf, and there ſunk; and he knew of none that had ſaved themſelves but he alone. The Relation of this diſmal Story did affect us ſo, that we were as Melancholly as himſelf.</p>
               <p>Our Dinner being over, we return'd to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and took this poor Man with us, and preſented him to the General, who appointed him a Poſt under the Gunner of the Caſtle, till further Orders.</p>
               <p>I need not give the Reader the particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which he gave us of his Slavery, it being much the ſame with what we uſe to hear concerning that Condition, and may be found in moſt Books of Travels, eſpecially in thoſe of <hi>Ferdinandus Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez Pinto,</hi> who gives an Experimental Account of all ſorts of Slavery, having been himſelf, taken 13 times, and 17 times ſold, in the ſpace of 21 years.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:100310:110"/>
About this time three Ships were getting ready, to go and make a diſcovery of a certain Iſland which lies Northward of <hi>Japan.</hi> There had been ſome Ships ſent thither ſome years before, but they had all miſcarried; ſome by the way; others (as it was reported) by the attractive power of the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netic Mountains were drawn violently to Shore; ſo that to avoid that danger, they contrived the Building of theſe Ships, without Nails or Iron Work. When they were ready, they Beat up for Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer Seamen, promiſing them for an Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a Twelve Month's Pay over and above their Wages; half of it to be paid preſently, the other half when they came back. This raiſed Men in abundance, and as faſt as they could wiſh; and in three weeks time, the Ships being ready, went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſail with 220 Men on Board of 'em.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that Iſland was firſt found out by the Portugueſes, but that they were forced to abandon it by reaſon of the exceſſive Cold and multitude of Wild-Beaſts; for it lies Northward of <hi>Tartary.</hi> But the Gold, which as it is reported, comes in great ſtore down ſeveral Rivers of that Country, was (I preſume) the only Motive which ſet the Dutch upon making theſe dangerous Attempts, and upon ventring a ſecond time, after ſuch bad Succeſs. What became of this laſt Expedition I never heard; for there came no News of it to <hi>Batavia</hi> before I came away from thence.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, a great piece of Roguery was carried on at <hi>Bantam,</hi> which unhappily proved ſucceſsful. The Dutch had there under one of the Baſtions, a great Magazine of Powder, and they had unfortunately at that time above 100 Tun of it in the Magazine. A Javian undertook to get in by breaking of the Wall, which he was forced to do by digging a way under Ground quite to the ſide of it. Every day he cloſed up the entrance
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:100310:111"/>
into his Hole with Earth, ſo artificially and ſo ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no body perceived it, and that neither of the two Sentinels that ſtood on the Baſtion heard the leaſt Noiſe at any time. When he was got in, he took a Bamboo-Cane that was hollow, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that with Gun-powder, lighted it at one end, and the Fire coming to the Powder in the Cane, gave a great Blow, with ſome Flame, without doing any further harm for the preſent. This alarm'd all the People, who preſently went to ſearch every corner of the Baſtion, to ſee what the matter was, and there the Bamboo-Cane was found, and the Powder that was in it was conſumed: But no ſooner had they open'd the Vault-Door, but the Wind finding a free paſſage, took ſome ſparks of Fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, which lighted among the Powder, and in an inſtant ſet that on Fire, and blew up the whole Baſtion with 16 pieces of Cannon, and above 200 Perſons.</p>
               <p>An Account of this Accident was quickly ſent to the General at <hi>Batavia,</hi> who preſently ſent Men thither; together with Orders to the Governor, and to the young King, to make a diligent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry after the Author's of this Villany: And in a ſhort time, three Javians were diſcovered to be the Men; who were brought bound to <hi>Batavia,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, That they were the only Contrivers of that Action; upon which they were all three Condemned to Die. He that had ſet Fire to the Cane, was brought upon a Scaffold erected for that purpoſe, and there Pinch'd with red-hot Tongs from the morning till towards the evening, at which time he was cut into Quarters; ſo that that day was ſpent in Torturing of that Fellow only. The next day the ſecond was ſerved in like manner; The third was Broke upon the Wheel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:100310:111"/>
We thought the time long now 'ere the Ships went off to <hi>Holland,</hi> or at leaſt till the time was fixt for their going; which we expected daily ſhould be done: However, we had got our Names upon the Roll, and having time enough, we ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to take a ſmall Journey together to viſit the Hermits Cells; for which purpoſe we took ſome Javian Guides with us. The Road, we found as it was told us, very commodious, having a great many Inns, and good Accommodation, till we came to the Wilderneſs where theſe Hermits dwell. Within ſix or ſeven miles of which, we came to two Villages, one on one ſide, the other on the other ſide of the River; in the middle of which was a very high Rock, upon which was a <hi>Javian</hi> Temple. We went to ſee it, and found there only one Reverend Bard, who reſided there all the Year round. That Temple was uſed only two days in the Year, <hi>viz.</hi> Their <hi>New-Year's Day,</hi> and the Feaſt of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whoſe Sect they follow: And on thoſe Days, there is much Praying and Worſhiping, and great Proceſſions made.</p>
               <p>Having taken a View of this, we went on, and came to a Village that is near the <hi>Blawen Pepper-bergh,</hi> from which we had not above 2 or 3 miles to the place where the Cells are. In that Village we ſtaid the latter part of that Day, and all that Night, in order to ſpend all the next day in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying our Curioſity; and accordingly we got thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther early the next morning. There we ſaw a great many pretty Caves, cut out of the Natural Rocks, and very Artificially contrived. We had been told, that they were poor little miſerable Holes that were not worth the ſeeing; but we were not a little ſurprized to find them ſo neat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, nor leſs pleaſed to ſee how ſucceſsfully they had imitated Nature; inſomuch, that it was hard to judge, whether Nature or Art had had the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100310:112"/>
chiefeſt hand in the ordering of 'em. Theſe Cells were moſt inhabited by a ſort of Men, who in imitation of their Founder, Devote themſelves to a perpetual Auſterity, Mortification, and Self-Denial, as he himſelf had ſet them an Example; aſſuring them, That the Chaſtizing of the Body, would conduce very much to Felicity, and would infallibly draw down God's Bleſſing upon them; ſo that he was look'd upon as a great Saint; and his Followers are valued at no leſs rate all over that Country.</p>
               <p>They wore long Gowns after the manner of the <hi>Armenian</hi> Prieſts, or the <hi>Bonzen</hi> in <hi>Japan.</hi> They ſpend all Day and Night in lifting up their Eyes and Hands to Heaven, intimating, That they Deſire nothing here below. The Javians that were our Guides, told us, That they uſed to Eat nothing but Boil'd Herbs, Beans, Roots, and ſuch like Fruits: And that on ſome Days, which they call their Feaſt-Days, they eat Flies, Mice, Scorpions, and Spiders, dreſt with a Juice preſt out of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Herb that grows there in abundance, which looks very much like our Sorrel. In this poor Condition they live and die; but in the higheſt Eſteem and Veneration among all the Javians: So that they never fail to be Canonized after their Death, and their Bodies are burnt with great Solemnity, and with all the reſpect imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; every one thinking himſelf happy, that can but come and throw in a Bundle of Sweet-Herbs upon the Corps.</p>
               <p>Some of thoſe Hermits, thinking that the more they mortiſie the more they are acceptable to their God, Eat nothing but green Herbs and Roots, and that very ſparingly; which makes them look ſo naſtily, that it frightens one to look upon them, and kills them quickly too.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="203" facs="tcp:100310:112"/>
When we had ſeen all we could ſee, we came away time enough to reach the two Villages again before Night; where we ſtaid that night; and the next morning we ſet out early, to get into <hi>Batavia</hi> as ſoon as we could; becauſe we had a mind to ſhare in the Rejoycing that was to be that day, it being the General's Birth-Day; wherefore we took a Praw, ſeeing the Wind and Tide was for us, and with a very quick paſſage down the River, came to <hi>Batavia</hi> juſt as the People began to move. All the Burghers and Freemen were in Arms, and drew up before the General's Lodgings in the Caſtle, where after the Diſcharge of all the Cannon about the Caſtle and City, they ſaluted his Excellency with ſeveral Vollies of Shot. Each Nation then came in a diſtinct Body with Preſents to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; as firſt, the <hi>Chineſes, Siamers, Japonneſes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſars, Amboineſes, Bandaneſes,</hi> &amp;c. and even the <hi>Javians,</hi> who are not permitted to ſet a foot in the Caſtle on any other time, were then let in; but all theſe come but after the Company of Burghers and Freemen, which is compoſed of Dutch, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Engliſh, Danes, French, Portugueſe, and other Chriſtians, born in the <hi>Indies,</hi> who altogether make one Body. Theſe Preſents are Magniſicent, and one may judge they muſt needs be very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, when the very Soldiers who ſtood to their Arms under the Caſtle-Gate, had ſome Hundreds of Guildens given them.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, all the Streets were full of Lights, Boneſires, and Fireworks; wherein the <hi>Chineſes</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed their utmoſt Art and Skill: And for three or four days there was nothing but Feaſting and Treating one another.</p>
               <p>The time now being come that the Fleet was to go to <hi>Holland,</hi> and the day fixt, <hi>viz.</hi> the 12th of <hi>February,</hi> (in caſe the Weather ſhould permit it) my Friend and I made our Applications to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100310:113"/>
on Board of one Ship, if it might be thought convenient: And according to our Requeſt, we were aſſign'd on Board the Ship called the <hi>Ex-change;</hi> which did not as yet lie before <hi>Batavia,</hi> but was reſitting in the Iſland <hi>Onruſt,</hi> and was ordered to get-ready to go Commadore of this Fleet, as ſhe was to have gone with the laſt Fleet which went on the 22d of <hi>November</hi> 1684. but that ſhe was diſabled. Thus we had time enough to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for our Voyage.</p>
               <p>The Ships being come into the Road before <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi> ſome days were appointed to Addreſs our Prayers in the moſt ſolemn manner to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for his Protection, and to Beg of him that he would preſerve us from all Dangers; which was Religiouſly obſerved in the Dutch and Maleiſh Churches.</p>
               <p>After this, the General gave Order that the Liſt of thoſe who had ſerved out their time, ſhould be called over; and publick notice of it being given by the Clerk of the Muſters, thoſe who were to go, appeared all with their Arms in good Order, and by Beat of Drum were led into the Caſtle, where they deliver'd their Arms into the Hands of the Armourer: Upon which every Man of 'em was preſented with four Rixdollers, as a Gratuity over and above each Man his Half-year's Pay. Thoſe that wanted more Money, and deſired to have it might be furniſht with it, ſo it was leſs or not more than what the Company owed them, abating or allowing 20 <hi>per Cent.</hi> and giving an Acquittance of his Money ſo received aforehand, made and ſigned before a Notary Publick.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Author's Departure from <hi>Batavia</hi> for <hi>Holland.</hi> Orders obſerved among the Ships: They come and lie before <hi>Bantam;</hi> where the Author going on Shore, is left behind, but by good luck over-takes the Ship again. They come to the Cape <hi>de Bon Eſperance.</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the Place, and on the <hi>Hottentot</hi>'s there. They leave the Cape. Come into the Sea which they call the <hi>Graz-zee;</hi> They meet with a fearful Storm, which laſted four days. They come to the <hi>Briel;</hi> thence to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> where the Author is forced to lie, in great Pain, and at great Expence; and at last, with much ado, gets home to <hi>Ulm.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Had made Proviſions of all things neceſſary for my Voyage, but eſpecially of preſerved Pepper, Arack, and Tobacco, which are the chief Things for ſuch a long Voyage as that is. I took with me a good quantity of <hi>China-Ware,</hi> ſome pounds of Tea, and ſome <hi>Murus</hi> and <hi>Parcallen,</hi> (which are a ſort of very ſine Linnen) off the Company, upon my own Account, which amounted to a great deal of Money. After this, I went to take my leave of all my Friends, and amongſt others, of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, of whom I made mention before, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd my Friend and me with all the Expreſſions of Love and Friendſhip that could be imagined. He gave me a Seal-Ring and a Letter, deſiring me to deliver them to his Wife at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lm,</hi> in caſe I got ſafe thither; ſo we parted with Tears in our Eyes all three of us. He conducted us two to the <hi>Vier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kant</hi> or Square, from whence we took a Praw, and went on Board the <hi>Exchange;</hi> where a Review was made the next day, to ſee if there were no body
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100310:114"/>
wanting. All being found there, Orders came the next day, that we ſhould weigh Anchor, and go a Quarter of a League into Sea, and there caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor again.</p>
               <p>Then was there again a Day appointed to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Bleſſing of the Almighty; which was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, both at Land, and on Board our Ships. Then the Maſters of the Ships and the Factors were invited a Shore to take their Farewel Dinner with the General, and to receive his Orders for Sailing, and to take their Oaths of Fidelity: After which, they repaired every one to their ſeveral Ships, with Orders to ſet Sail with the firſt fair Wind; but the Wind was ſo changeable for three or four days, that it made us weigh our Anchors, and drop them again four or five times. Some of our more debauch'd Seamen, and others, did ſo fret and fume at theſe frequent Diſappointments, and grew ſo very impatient, that they could not forbear vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Rage in very undecent and prophane Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; for which, the Maſter, a good old Man of near 90 years of Age, reproved them very ſharply, and threatned them ſeverely if they did not refrain from ſuch Words; telling them, that this was not the way to obtain their Deſires, but that they ought rather to Pray to God to ſend us a favourable Wind, and patiently wait his Will and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>About 12 of the Clock, in the 5th Night, the Wind came good for us; whereupon, our Maſter as Commadore, ordered a Gun to be fired as a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the two other Ships to weigh Anchor with us. So we all went under Sail together, for in the Voyages homeward, the Ships are always obliged to go together; and tho' the one may be a quicker Sailer than the other, yet ſhe muſt not run away before the reſt; but ſhe is forced to Furl ſome of her Sails, ſo as the ſloweſt of 'em may keep pace
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100310:114"/>
with her; and nothing excuſes their parting from each other but a Storm, or hard Weather; after which they are to rejoyn as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
               <p>The next day we came and Anchor'd before <hi>Bantam,</hi> about a League from Shore near the place where we lay when we went in purſuit of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. Our Boat went on Shore, and I went with it, to ſee ſome of my Acquaintance there, and to take my leave of them. Notwithſtanding that the Steward had given me very ſtrict charge not to ſtay, and told me two or three times he was juſt going, I could not part from my Friends readily, and when I came to go, I found my Spark gone; and was told he was gone off half an Hour before, with eight Cows, and other Proviſions that he was come for. When I heard this, I was ready to die with Fear and Grief; and had no other Remedy, but immediately to Hire a light Praw with 16 Oars; When we came out of the River of <hi>Bantam</hi> into Sea, we ſaw our Ships juſt ready to Sail; for the Wind was very good, and then they looſe no time: However, I pluckt up a good Heart when I ſaw 'em, and encouraged the Javians to pull ſtoutly, and promiſed them ſix Rixdollers amongſt 'em over and above the Bargain, in caſe they overtook our Ship. This made them Row like Tygers, and by that time it was Night, as the Ship was got up to the Iſland <hi>Dwars in the Zee,</hi> we came in reach of her, at which the Javians ſet up a full <hi>Huzza,</hi> and I was ſo tranſported with Joy, that I could not but joyn with them very heartily. As ſoon as we could come to faſten by her ſide, I went to get up; but unfortunately made a falſe ſtep, and tumbled down again into the Boat, and ſo Sprain'd my Leg, that I was forced to be drawn up into the Ship, and lie ſtill for ſome days.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:100310:115"/>
The next day, three of the Cows were kill'd and diſtributed among the Ship's Crew. Some days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we paſſed the Streights of <hi>Sunda,</hi> and came to the <hi>Prince's Iſland,</hi> where we parted with our Convoy Ships, and ſent them back to <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As we came by the <hi>Prince's</hi> Iſland, which lies at the furtheſt corner of <hi>Great Java,</hi> we came into open Sea, and the Wind being right good for us, we continued our Courſe forward, not being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to looſe ſo fair a Wind as we had then; ſo that we did not put in there, nor would we ſtay to ſend in our Boats for a Recruit of freſh Water, as it is Cuſtomary; but made the beſt of our way, and fired three Guns to wiſh each other a good Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>We ſteer'd our Courſe now directly towards Cape <hi>de Bon Eſperance,</hi> Hall'd in our Long-Boat and Shallop, and took in our Anchors, and fitted our ſelves for the Voyage.</p>
               <p>When we were got out of ſight of <hi>Great Java,</hi> a ſecond Review was made of all our Ship's Crew, which amounted to Eighty eight Perſons in all, <hi>viz.</hi> the Maſter, the Upper Steerſman, two Under Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and two Mates, to relieve them from Duty; two Quarter-Maſters, to Order the Watches, which I have given an Account of in the beginning of this Book; a Factor; a Book-keeper; and a Clerk or Aſſiſtant; An Upper Chirurgion, (my ſelf) and an Under Maſter-Chirurgion; a Steward, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed the Allowances of Meat and Drink to every Perſon according to the Maſter's Orders; a Cook and a Scullion; a Gunner with four Men and Boys, who were likewiſe to help the Steward; a Serjeant; two Maſter Carpenters, and three Mates, a Boatſwain, and his Boy, a Schieman and his Boy; a Provoſt; four Boys; the eight Soldiers, and 32 Mariners; We had no Chaplain, but we had Prayers duly Read by the Book-keeper: There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:100310:115"/>
Maſter of a Ship, and a Maſter Chirurgion; but neither of them had any Poſt in our Ship, they were only Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>We came ſafe with all theſe People, till we got paſt the Iſland, called St. <hi>Paul</hi> of <hi>Amſterdam:</hi> After which our greateſt concern was, to paſs ſafe through the Latitude of <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> or St. <hi>Maurice;</hi> which, as I have already told you, is very ſubject to dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Storms and Hurricanes, moſt Seaſons of the year; inſomuch, that more Ships are loſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, than any where again.</p>
               <p>Having eſcaped this place likewiſe, tho' we met with hard weather, we came at laſt, after nine weeks Sail, in ſight of the great Promontory of <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> which rejoyced us much. One of the Carpenter's Men had the good fortune to ſpy Land the firſt of any; for which good Tydings, the Maſter preſented him with two Ducatoons and a Quart of Canary, as it was ever the Cuſtom on Board our Ships, to gratifie thoſe that firſt diſcover Land. We immediately looſned our Anchors, and faſten'd them to their Cables, and made directly towards <hi>Tafel-Bay,</hi> which lay about 20 miles from us. The next day we were within two Leagues of it, it being a very great Snow, and the Weather being very Calm, which was very extraordinary, it being for the moſt part very Bluſtring there all the year round. We hall'd out our Boat, and Long-Boat, into which having ſent ſome of our Men with Oars, they hall'd our Ship into the Haven. This took up half a day, and when we were come to a place where we could caſt Anchor, we did ſo; and hoiſted up our Flags, after which they at Land did the ſame likewiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tower of the Caſtle.</p>
               <p>Then our Maſter went to Shore, and gave the Governor of the place an account of our Succeſs thus far on our Voyage. Here we found three
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:100310:116"/>
Ships from <hi>Holland,</hi> and one Engliſh Fly-boat, riding at Anchor. We were immediately ſupplied with ſome Sheep, Fruits, and Herbs, which were very welcome Refreſhments, and many <hi>Hottentots</hi> came on Board of us; ſome of which, our Men made ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral little Preſents to. Our Men were likewiſe permitted to go on Shore by turns, to refreſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: Some of our Crew were ſent on purpoſe, that they might go into the Wood to fetch ſome Fuel, and others were ſent for a Recruit of freſh Water.</p>
               <p>When I went aſhore, I found the place extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary full of People, but moſtly of thoſe Soldiers, which belong'd to the Dutch Ships that lay there. They were brave luſty Men, and very brisk, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving met with nothing but good Succeſs in their Voyage thither. Some of their Men were Sick, and carried into the Hoſpital, which was pretty full. I went to ſee it, and told near 200 of them there; moſt of which were forced to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, not being recover'd before the Fleet was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to go on, on their Voyage. Theſe Ships be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone off, the Town was left as thin as might be, and every thing was as cheap again; ſo that we had more conveniency of making our ſelves Merry. I ſpent here ſome time very pleaſantly, my Landlord being a very honeſt Fellow, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary obliging. He was of <hi>Newrenberg,</hi> and by Employment a Brewer. He having ſome Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of me before this, ſeem'd daily to increaſe his good Opinion and Eſteem for me; and his Daughter, I obſerved likewiſe, to become every day more and more obliging, which I look'd upon as a deſign between them of ſtaying me there: But I was ſo heartily ſet upon my Return home, that I might once again Enjoy the free Liberty of my Religion, that I could not be gain'd upon to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Mind upon any kind of Conſideration what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100310:116"/>
A few days after, I found, that what I had ſurmiz'd was true enough; and the Father very kindly made me an Offer of his Daughter, and told me what he was ready to do for me if I would ſtay there; and withal, that he had a great Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to go into his own Country, which he was loath to do, unleſs he could by ſuch a means as this, make over his Lands to his Daughter, and put her into Poſſeſſion of them: For a Freeman cannot otherwiſe diſpoſe of what he hath; and if he is deſirous to leave the Country, he cannot Sell his Eſtate, but it muſt fall of Courſe to the Company; ſo that he can take nothing over with him but his Perſonal Eſtate. But neither the Daughter's Beauty, nor the Sweetneſs of his Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, could have ſuch an Influence upon me as to make me break my Reſolution. So that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hearkening to him any further than juſt to thank him, I made all neceſſary Preparation, and made me ready to go back to my Ship. But I wonder'd that my Landlord could ever have the Heart to part from ſo pleaſant a place as his was to return home, ſeeing he had that only thing which I wanted, the opportunity of Exerciſing my Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion publickly.</p>
               <p>One day I went out by my ſelf to fetch a walk, and as I went muſing along, I found my ſelf before I was aware of it, within a quarter of a Mile of the <hi>Lewen-bergh,</hi> between which and the Sea, I ſaw ſome of thoſe Hutts which the <hi>Hottentots</hi> dwell in. Upon ſight of which, my Curioſity led me to go and ſee what kind of life thoſe People led. I went into one of 'em, and there I ſaw a parcel of 'em lying upon the Ground like ſo many Hogs, and faſt aſleep: But as ſoon as they awaked and ſaw me, they ſprung up and came up to me, making a noiſe like Turkies. I was not a little concerned; yet ſeeing they d<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d not go about to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100310:117"/>
do me any harm, I pull'd out a piece of Tobacco and gave it them: They were mightily pleaſed with that Preſent, but the way they took to ſhew their Gratitude, and to thank me, was ſo odious to me, that I wiſh'd I had not given them any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of returning me Thanks. For no ſooner had I given them this, but they all lifted up thoſe Flaps of Sheep-Skin which hang before their Privy-Parts to give me a ſight of 'em. What with this beaſtly Behaviour, and what with the naſty ſtench of their Kennels, (as I think I may properly call 'em) I made all haſte to be gone. Some of 'em I found at their Dinner, or rather, Eating, (for that is a word of too much Order and Decency for them.) They had only a piece of Cow-Hide, laid out upon the Coals a Broyling, and to make the Carbonnade more pleaſant, they had ſqueezed the Dung out of the Guts, and ſpread it finely on the Hide to moiſten it, and to give it a reliſh; and this they take when it is broyl'd, and chop it, and ſo Eat it. The very ordering of it in this manner, turn'd my Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach ſo, that I could not ſtay to ſee the Eating of it: But I made all the haſte I could to be gone. I went from thence directly to the <hi>Lewen-bergh,</hi> which is a fine pleaſant Hill, not at all Rocky, but cover'd over with Graſs, and affording a moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Proſpect. Here I ſat me down, and took a view of the Country all round me. After I had been there a while, I eſpied at Sea a Ship making to the Port with full Sails; and preſently after I ſaw the Flag hoiſted up in the Caſtle. Upon this I came down to go towards the Fort, and as I was going along the Shore, there ſtood a Servant Maid, who was come to fill a little Tub with Sand: As ſoon as ſhe ſaw me, ſhe cry'd out to me as loud as ſhe could, <hi>Maridi ſini Senior:</hi> Oh Sir! Pray come and helpme. I ran full ſpeed towards her to help her, and when I came up to her, ſhe ſhewed me a
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:100310:117"/>
dreadful long Serpent, that had juſt then been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring a young <hi>Hottentot,</hi> and had ſwallowed him all up but the Legs, which ſtill ſtuck out of his Mouth. This had put the Maid into a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, and made her afraid that ſhe ſhould be his next Prey: And truly being much in the ſame Apprehenſions my ſelf, I betook my ſelf to my Heels, which the Maid ſeeing, ſhe gave a dreadful Shriek, and began to run too. That great Shriek ſhe gave brought out ſome <hi>Hottentots</hi> that were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, who came running towards us. As ſoon as they ſaw what was the matter, they got them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ready to catch the Serpent; and having brought out ſome long Ropes, they threw them with wonderful Dexterity about its middle, and drawing the Ropes, ſome at one end, ſome at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as hard as they were able; they held him ſo faſt, that I expected they would have cut him in two. All the while the Serpent Hiſs'd in a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, and Twiſted it ſelf ſtrangely, but could not ſlip away. At laſt came ſome of the Men with great Poles, with which they knock'd him on the Head. This dreadful Creature was very near 16 Foot long. They faſtned it to a Stick, and let it dry.</p>
               <p>This being done, I return'd to the place from whence I came.</p>
               <p>In my return I met with ſome Wild <hi>Hottentots,</hi> who come down thither from the <hi>Cafre</hi>'s Country, about 100 Leagues from thence. They, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, are almoſt Blind in the day time, at leaſt extream Dim-ſighted; ſo that they do moſt of their Buſineſs by Night. In the time that I ſtaid in the Cape, I ſaw once one of theſe Wild Prople exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for Theft: He had ſome time before ſtolen ſome Cows and Sheep from ſome of the Freemen, without the Approbation of their King, (which is a Dignity they confer upon ſome one amongſt 'em;
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100310:118"/>
and whereever they are, tho' but to the number of five or ſix together, they always make them a King or Captain to Rule over them, without whoſe Conſent no kind of thing is to be done; and in this the Company doth not at all interpoſe, but leaves them to their own Cuſtoms). The Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal was tied Hand and Foot, and ſtretched out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Poſts, about half a Man's height from the Ground; after which ſome Men came with great Sticks, and beat him to Death. If they hit him on the Head or Breaſt he is ſoon diſpatcht; but they never give over as long as they find any Breath in him. When he is expired, they carry him to the Wood, and there faſten him to a Bough, and leave him for a Prey to Wild Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The Ship that I eſpied coming from the top of the Hill, was an Engliſh Fly-boat, which came and caſt Anchor by the other Engliſh Ship that lay there before. The Maſter gave us an Account of his Voyage, which had been thus far very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous. He was bound for <hi>Jappan,</hi> but was to call at ſeveral Places by the way. He put in here to Treat with the Governour, but about what, I could not be informed.</p>
               <p>After we had ſtaid herefull three Weeks, which is more by a Week than Ships generally do, every body was ordered on Board in a readineſs to be going. Our Maſter being Commadore, call'd a Council to ſettle the Orders of their Voyage. The next day a Review was made, where all were found in very good Order, except two that were very ſick; but yet, as ill as they were, they would not ſtay there, but would venture on their Voyage.</p>
               <p>The next day, after the Review was made, our Maſter and Factor, together with the other Maſters of Ships, went once more a Shore to wait on the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100310:118"/>
Governor to take their Leave of him; They came back that ſame night in order to go out of the Bay with the firſt fair Wind; which happen'd that very night, being the 23th of <hi>May;</hi> and then we ſteer'd our Courſe North-Weſt.</p>
               <p>All the next day we had the African Coaſts in ſight. Our Water Veſſels were ſhut up again, and dealt out by Portions; which was, a Can to each Perſon once in 24 hours; and half a Quartern of Brandy, or Arack. When we had been a while under Sail, out came a Seaman from under the Hatches, who had hid himſelf there till we were got out in full Sea. He was but juſt come to the Cape with an Engliſh Ship; and being ſent aſhore to fetch in freſh Water, he ſo contrived his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as to get in with our Men, being reſolved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to go with the Engliſh again. He was an Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgher, a brisk active Fellow: In the hardeſt of Weather, he was firſt and laſt on the Maſt, and extreamly ſerviceable. So that he got the love of every body, and generally had a larger ſhare of the Diſtributions than any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>Having now ſailed about 10 days, we came up to St. <hi>Hellens,</hi> where the Ships that are homeward bound from <hi>India</hi> ſeldom fail to call; but our Maſter did not think fit to put in there, partly becauſe we had already made great ſtays, and partly becauſe we needed no Proviſions.</p>
               <p>In 14 days we found our ſelves under the Line, and the Sun ſtood Perpendicular over our Heads. This was the twelfth time that I paſſed under it in my Voyages to and fro. As ſoon as we came there, our Maſter commanded a White Flag to be hung out; which was the uſual Token for all the Maſters and Steerſmen in the Fleet to come on Board of him. When they were all come together, he open'd their Inſtructions to them, which were, That contrary to the Cuſtom of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> homeward
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:100310:119"/>
bound Ships, (which was to Steer their Courſe betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Hitland,</hi> in their return to <hi>Holland)</hi> they ſhould now go round <hi>Hitland,</hi> and paſs betwixt <hi>Fero</hi> and <hi>Filo,</hi> and ſo keep along the Coaſts of <hi>Norway,</hi> where they ſhould meet with a Squadron of Men of War for their Convoy. And this was accordingly done. But now being our Voyage was made ſo much the longer by theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders than otherwiſe it would have been, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſhorten each Man's Allowance to make it hold out the better.</p>
               <p>All this while we got, (Bleſſed be God) all ſafe from under the Line, and were not above ſeven days a paſſing of it. Whereas it is common for Ships to lie there two or three Months, and cannot ſtir for want of a Wind, ſo that what with the Calm, and the exceſſive Heat, they looſe abundance of their Men: But we had but five Men ſick all that time.</p>
               <p>From thence we paſs'd to the <hi>Gras-Zee,</hi> or <hi>Graſs-Sea,</hi> ſo called from the Graſs which grows there, ſo that the Sea appears juſt like a Meadow, and it lookt to us as if we were already with one Foot upon Land. This held for near 100 Leagues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. We paſs'd through it with a very good Wind, and were very glad to get out of it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was a pretty Sight enough. When we pull'd up any of that Graſs, we found it had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry long ſmall Roots.</p>
               <p>Soon after this we came in ſight of the Iſlands <hi>Corvo</hi> and <hi>Flores,</hi> and at the ſame time of the <hi>North-Star.</hi> Being got thus far, each Seaman's Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance began to increaſe again. But before this Order was given, the Maſter ſent to Examine all the Proviſions, and had an Account brought him of what quantity there was left of each particular. He finding there was good ſtore of Arack left, and that we had had a very quick Paſſage ſo far, and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:100310:119"/>
Wind continued ſo very fair for us, that it gave us hopes of being quickly at the end of our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, was willing to let the Men enjoy themſelves a little more, and ſo order'd that a pretty good ſhare of Arack ſhould be dealt out to every one of 'em. But there being ſeveral that were ſick, and could not uſe their Arack themſelves, diſpoſed of it to thoſe that were well, who having then too much of that ſtrong Liquor, made themſelves exceeding Drunk, and committed a great deal of Diſorder: For tho' there is very ſevere Laws on Shipboard, and thoſe are generally Executed with Rigour, yet ſuch is the Seamen's Temper, that they ever grow more diſorderly and ungovernable as they come nearer home. Wherefore our Maſter being a very good honeſt old Man, reſolved to let none have any more, but thoſe that were in a fit Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Drink it themſelves; And that this might be obſerved punctually, he order'd the Under Steerſman to ſtand by every day, and to ſee every body Drink their own Portion: By this means he put a ſtop to thoſe Diſorders, and prevented a great deal of Miſchief.</p>
               <p>When we came more and more in ſight of the <hi>North-Star,</hi> we began to be very chearful, and fell a Singing of the Hymn,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hoe Schoon light ons de Morgen-Star.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But by that time we got a little beyond the Iſland <hi>Fero,</hi> the Weather began to ſeem very Cold to us, tho' it was in the very middle of the Summer, that we could not bear to ſit above Deck, till we had got ſome more Cloaths on. What made us ſo very ſenſible of Cold was, that we came from ſo Hot a Country as the <hi>Indies</hi> is. Here we obſerved, That the day was 20 hours long, and that in the four hours that the Sun was below our Horizon, it ſtill gave ſo much light on the one ſide, or the other of us, that a Man might make ſhift to Read any Book of a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100310:120"/>
fair Character any time of the Night, by the help only of that refracted light.</p>
               <p>The next day our Maſter, and Steerſmen, judged that we were not far from <hi>Hitland.</hi> Then we ſaw continually great Flocks of Birds and flying Fiſh, which fell down in great numbers in our Ship. So Orders were given to watch on the Main-top-Maſt-Head, and about the Evening one cry'd out Land. The Mountains aſſured us ſufficiently that it was <hi>Hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> therefore we bore directly upon it with a brisk Gale, and no ſmall Joy it was to us, that we were thus happily drawing apace towards our Country.</p>
               <p>Thus we kept ſailing all the next day along that Coaſt, within about a League from it, and ſo paſt it. Quickly after that we ſpied four Men of War, which we concluded were our Convoy; and being come ſomthing nearer, we perceived them to be ſo by their Colours: Upon which, we hung out ours, and fired ſome Guns for a Signal. We likewiſe Hall'd out our Boats to go on Board them, but the Wind hindred us from doing it. All the while we came nearer and nearer, and the Convoy having a ſmall Tender with them, they loaded it with Proviſions, and ſent it towards us; as it is always the Cuſtom to meet the homeward bound Ships, and to bring them freſh Victuals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to refreſh them after ſuch a long Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. They brought ſome Veſſels of Beer, Sack, Butter, Cheeſe, Tobacco, Pipes, and Brandy.</p>
               <p>When theſe things were brought on Board of us; one Veſſel of Beer was put on the one ſide of the Main-Maſt, and another on the other ſide; and thoſe were free for any body to go to, and Drink at Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>But we did not long Enjoy our ſelves thus; For as we were juſt coming to a pitch of Mirth and Jol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſuch a dreadful Wind aroſe, as we had not met with any thing like it in our Voyage; and it terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us ſo much the more, becauſe we were near home,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:100310:120"/>
where we thought our ſelves ſecure, not dreaming of any farther danger. The night came upon us, and our Ship being very old and crazy, began to ſpring ſeveral Leaks, ſo that we were forced to keep continually a Pumping. The Weather was ſo cold, the night ſo dark, and the Wind ſo very boiſterous, that we were paſt all hopes, except what we had in God's Gracious Providence, and to that alone we committed our ſelves. The morning came, but gave us but a ſmall Relief, for the Wind was as terrible as before; and ſo it pleaſed God to hold on for four days together without Intermiſſion; at the end of which, God was pleaſed to Calm the Wind and Seas, and reſtore us to our former Peace and favourable Gales; for which we all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily offer'd up our Thanks to the Almighty.</p>
               <p>Here we loſt our Upper Steerſman, who had been ſick moſt of the Voyage, and we threw him over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board.</p>
               <p>We had after this hard Weather, a pretty good Gale of Wind which brought us quickly in ſight of the Northern Coaſts. We ſail'd then all along by them, and ſteer'd our Courſe directly upon <hi>Holland,</hi> reckoning to reach the <hi>Maes</hi> in three or four days more. In our Courſe we met with ſome Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who came a-board of us, and ſold us ſome freſh Herrings. This was to me the greateſt Feaſt I had had a great while, and I think I never liked any thing better in my life. Among thoſe Fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there was one, that was as he ſaid, 142 years old; and becauſe we ſcrupled to believe him, he ſhew'd us an Extract of his Birth out of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-Book: He was as Active at his Buſineſs as any of his Fellows.</p>
               <p>Shortly after this came a Pilot on Board of us, and by Orders from the Company, took the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Ship on himſelf, and diſmiſt the Maſter: So we came to caſt Anchor before the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:100310:121"/>
                  <hi>Briel.</hi> As ſoon as we had caſt Anchor here, the Deputies of the Company came on Board of us: They are generally two of the oldeſt that are Deputed for that purpoſe. Theſe Gentlemen call'd all the Ship's Crew together, and thank'd them in the name of all the Company for their Faithfulneſs and Diligence in their Service; from which they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately freed them, and promiſed them that they ſhould be paid with ſpeed: After which, every one was at liberty, and was carried to Shore in ſome ſmall Ketches that came for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon this, came other Seamen on Board the Ship, which they call <hi>Sjouwers.</hi> Theſe Furl'd in all the Sails, and took them down; fired all the Guns and charged them again. All the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions they found remaining was theirs. Every one of us was forced to leave his Cheſt on Board, they being all to be brought to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe, and there to be Search'd.</p>
               <p>The Wound I had received in the Wars of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam</hi> had of late been a little uneaſie to me; and the two Bullets which were ever ſince that time in my Leg, began to be a little troubleſome: But now my Pain increaſed ſo faſt upon me, that in a very little while after we came to the <hi>Briel,</hi> I was no more able to walk at all by my ſelf; but was forced to be carried into a Houſe by a Couple of our Men. I was ſorry I had not a little more time to Eaſe my ſelf here; but the reſt being ready to go for <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> I was obliged to be gone along with them.</p>
               <p>Being come to <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and having within 3 days time received my Cheſt back again, as all the reſt likewiſe had. I was forced to go from thence to <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> that being the Chamber where I had engaged my ſelf; and from which I was to receive my Money. Thither I went partly by Land, and partly by Water; but either way with ſo much pain
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100310:121"/>
and uneaſineſs, that all the Hardſhips I had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone in all my Voyages were not to be compared to that: Yet was I full of Acknowledgement to Almighty God, who had deliver'd me out of ſo many Extream Dangers to which I had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, from the mercileſs Sea, fierce and cruel Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and Beaſts; and from ſeveral Heathens of many Nations more Barbarous than them all, and had brought me again into a Chriſtian Country. And though I was not in Health of Body, yet it was an exceeding Comfort to me, to have ſo good Opportunities again of making better Proviſion for my Soul, and to participate of that Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from which I had been abſent during ſeven years. Wherefore being in this weak Condition, the chief thing I deſired was to have a Miniſter, and to receive the Communion. My Landlady help'd me to one who was the Miniſter of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Lutheran Church at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> from whoſe Pious Diſcourſe, and Abſolution, together with the Bleſſed Sacrament, I received an exceeding great Comfort, and then very chearfully reſign'd my ſelf up to the Almighty's Pleaſure. I thank'd my Ghoſtly Father for his Kindneſs, and made him a Preſent of ſix Ducatoons, ſome Roſes of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and ſome <hi>China</hi> Ware.</p>
               <p>My Pain encreaſing rather than diminiſhing, and I growing daily worſe and worſe, I ſent for a Doctor and two Chirurgions, not willing to truſt to my own Skill only. And being I was not able to go and receive my Money my ſelf, I was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſend a Perſon to the <hi>East-India</hi> Chamber to receive my Money and Goods, by Virtue of a Letter of Attorney which I gave him. The Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that was Due to me from the Company did not amount to more than 4 or 500 Ducatoons, which was all the Fruit of my Labours; except ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods I had brought over on
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:100310:122"/>
my own Account, which I had to Sell: But by that time I had ſatisfied my Attorney, my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and the two Chirurgions, and defray'd the reſt of my Charges, I found my Bag very light. My Doctor did not coſt me above Forty Dutch Gilders: The two Chirurgions, who were two of the moſt famous Artiſts in the whole City of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi> had Eighty Rixdollars; They had taken out my two Bullets, and cleared the Bone of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twenty Splinters, great and ſmall: For my Lodging, I paid TWO Rixdollars a Week, and had but a very poor Accommodation neither. The Apothecary too came in with a hideous Bill. In ſhort, I ſhould have been but in a miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition if I had not had Money: And that went after ſuch a Rate, that in leſs than Three Months time I had ſpent above 300 Ducatoons. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I began to recover a little, and my pain was not ſharp as before; tho' I could not go or ſtand as yet: But as ſoon as I was able to ſtir, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue my Journey, and ſet out of this place, and endeavour to get home, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befel me. And in order thereunto I took a Coach to carry me to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht-Poort,</hi> where I took Boat for <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and ſo paſſed through <hi>Cleveland</hi> to <hi>Cologne.</hi> By that time I was got hither, I was ſo fatigued, that I was not in a capacity of moving any further; and therefore I was forced to lie ſtill here for near three Weeks; during which time, I ſpent a great deal of Money again, and was ſo weak that I had hardly any hopes of ever reaching ſo far as home; nor did any Body think I ſhould ever have recover'd. But it pleaſed God to Bleſs human Endeavours, ſo that I recovered a little again; upon which I immediately got my ſelf carried to the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and there went on Board a Ship which carried me to <hi>Mentz,</hi> and thence to <hi>Franckfort.</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:100310:122"/>
Some Relations and Gentlemen of my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance were ſo kind as to come to meet me before I got Embark'd on the <hi>Rhine;</hi> but I was not in a Condition to take notice of them. However, they were ſo Civil, as to Convoy me along the Shore. When <hi>I</hi> was come to <hi>Franckfort, I</hi> was forced to ſtay without the City two days before they would permit me to enter, and the Weather being very Cold, <hi>I</hi> made but a poor ſhift in the Ship all that while: till at length, the Chirurgions came to me, and went themſelves to the Burgher-Maſter; upon which <hi>I</hi> was let in to the City that very night, tho' late. It being hard to get a Lodging in an Inn at that time of night, ſome good Friends of mine carried me to a private Houſe, where ſome of my Acquaintance came to Viſit me. One of them got me a Coach, which in ſeven days time brought me to the place where <hi>I</hi> ſo earneſtly deſired to be, the City where <hi>I</hi> was Born. There <hi>I</hi> found all my Dear Siſters alive and well, who received me with all the Demonſtrations of that ſincere Love and Affection they had for me, and were extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Serviceable to me.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>I</hi> finiſh'd my Travels, which had taken up Nine whole years: And by the Faithful Relation which <hi>I</hi> here give thee of them: Thou mayſt not only ſee, what Dangers and Difficulties <hi>I</hi> have been expoſed to in ſo many various Adventures, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thou oughteſt to Admire the wonderful Goodneſs of God, who ſo wonderfully delivers Men, and never forſakes thoſe that put their Truſt in him. And not being able to Praiſe him ſufficiently my ſelf for his great and ſignal Mercies to me, <hi>I</hi> heartily deſire that every thing that hath Breath may Praiſe the Lord.</p>

                  <p>The Riſe of the Dutch <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company. Many go to the <hi>Indies</hi> induced by a fooliſh hope of growing Rich there. Kidnappers ſend many thither.

               </argument>
               <p>IT is about ſixty years ſince ſome rich Merchants and others in <hi>Holland,</hi> as at <hi>Amſterdam, Enck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huiſen, Rotterdam, Leyden, Delft, Hoorn, Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleburgh,</hi> and <hi>Fleſſinguen,</hi> having joyned Stocks, made
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100310:124"/>
up a Company, Rigg'd out ſome Ships, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them with Officers and Seamen, ſent them to the <hi>East-Indies.</hi> They have from time to time mightily increaſed their Strength there, and at length made themſelves ſo powerful, as to wage War, not only againſt ſome Kings of <hi>Europe,</hi> as of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Portugal;</hi> but to be able alſo to Curb ſeveral Kings and Emperors of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> And hereby they are already become much more Wealthy than ſome Kings are, and grow every day greater and greater.</p>
               <p>The rich Things which ſeveral Perſons have brought with them out of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the great Booty which ſeveral opportunities offer to Men, the juſt and exact Pay of thoſe who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the Service of the Company, on the one ſide; the deſire of ſeeing ſtrange Countries, and the Cuſtoms and Manners of People, ſo far diſtant, on the other, induce many Men to undertake this Voyage: Beſides that, there are many Strangers that come into <hi>Holland,</hi> who are drawn in by a ſort of Kidnappers, to engage themſelves in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Company, allured by the hopes of great Profit and Advantage.</p>
               <p>Theſe Buyers and Sellers of Men, are People that entice Strangers to their Houſes, if they ſee they have but little Money, or are in perfect want, or if they come of themſelves through Neceſſity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and provide 'em with Meat, Drink, and Cloaths plentifully, till the Ships are ready to go, and the People Embark; Then each Kidnapper brings his Men, ſometimes Ten, Twenty, Thirty, to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Houſe, and there gets them liſted. Some days after this, he receives for each Man, for his Pains and Charge, a Note of a 150 Guldens, and Two Months ready Pay, which the Soldier or Mariner, whatever he be, muſt Earn out. And the Note is not paid till it comes to be Due in
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100310:124"/>
Monthly Wages. An Account of what Pay is due to every one is ſent every year out of the <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Holland,</hi> and may be ſeen upon the Books there. But if one of theſe Men happens to Die in the Voyage, the Kidnapper looſes all his Charge; for in ſuch a caſe, the Company doth not pay him his Note, becauſe it was not workt out.</p>
               <p>Theſe Men, to Entice Strangers to go, make them believe ſtrange Stories of the <hi>Indies,</hi> promiſe them vaſt Things, and are not aſhamed to go ſo far as to put a Hammer into their Hands to knock the Diamonds out of the Rocks they ſhall meet with. Many of theſe poor Fellows Ruin themſelves Body and Soul, by Marrying Indians, and running over from the Chriſtians to ſome Heatheniſh King, when they have Habituated themſelves to their Cuſtoms and Manners: Others meeting with untimely Deaths, amongſt Drinking, or other ill Company, which often happens: Others committing what Coſts them their Life by Sentence of ſome Court of Juſtice. And becauſe theſe Men trapan that ſort of People to go a Voyage that commonly proves their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, they are generally call'd, <hi>Ziel-Verkopers</hi> or <hi>Kopers,</hi> that is <hi>Soul-Buyers</hi> or <hi>Sellers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I for my own part was forced, for want of Money, to be ſome Weeks at one of theſe Jack-Call's Houſes for Entertainment, paying a 170 Guldens, the two Month's ready Pay being reckon'd in; and I was accepted by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company on the 15th of <hi>November</hi> 1675. as a Volunteer, and was made Steward of the Ship call'd <hi>Aſia:</hi> My Pay was 20 Guldens <hi>per</hi> Month of Dutch Money; and I was to ſerve them five years in the <hi>Indies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon theſe Conditions, I, with ſeveral others, went off from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in a little Smack to the <hi>Texel,</hi> on the firſt of <hi>December</hi> 1675. There the Fleet lay that was ordered to go to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> which conſiſted of Five Ships, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Aſia</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:100310:125"/>
the <hi>Macaſſar</hi> Vice-Admiral, the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> the <hi>Cortgeene,</hi> the <hi>Tidor:</hi> We ſaw beſides, a great many Engliſh and Dutch Men of War and Merchantmen, that ſtaid for a good Wind.</p>
               <p>The 2d of <hi>December,</hi> I Embarkt on Board the <hi>Aſia,</hi> together with ſeveral others, engaged in the ſame Service.</p>
               <p>The 3d <hi>Ditto,</hi> The Dutch Gentlemen that were Owners came on Board of us, with a very rich little Yatcht, wiſh'd us a good Voyage, and took their leaves of us.</p>
               <p>The 4th there came a Muſter-Maſter, to ſee if all thoſe that belong'd to the Ship were in it. There was in ours, the Chief Merchant, the Maſter, the Chaplain of the Reformed Religion, with his Wife and four Children, four Steerſmen, one Book-keeper, five Barbers and Chirurgions, two Mates, two Stewards, two Cooks, two Gunners, four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, three Coopers, two Sail-Makers, two Quarter-Maſters, one Serjeant, two Corporals, two Under-Corporals, 150 Soldiers, and 93 Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt-Men, nine Boys to Swab the Ship every day, and one Boatſwain; the whole number was 297 men. The Muſter-Maſter having taken a view of all, wiſh'd us a good Voyage and a good Wind.</p>
               <p>The 5th, The Wind blew very ſtrong at North-Weſt, ſo that we were obliged to drop four An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors at one time, of which each weigh'd 36 hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pound.</p>
               <p>The 12th of <hi>January</hi> 1676. The greateſt Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble we had was cauſed by the Ice that came againſt us in great Flakes from the North, and encompaſs'd us on every ſide, ſtriking continually againſt our Ship, and did our Cables a great deal of Damage. Therefore our Officers having conſulted what to do, reſolved, That if the Wind did not change in three days, we ſhould leave Ship and Goods, and go back to <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> with the light Veſſels; that the Men
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:100310:125"/>
as well as Ships might not periſh, as it happen'd 15 years ago, when 15 founder'd about the ſame place.</p>
               <p>The 13th <hi>Ditto,</hi> At Eleven a Clock at Night the Wind changed and blew very fair for us at S. E. upon which a Gun was fired from our Admiral, all the Ships in the Fleet being to be govern'd by it, and was a Signal that every one was to weigh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, and make ready to Sail.</p>
               <p>The 14th, early in the morning, ſailed firſt the Admiral, with Flags and Pendants on the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt; after him the Vice-Admiral, with a Flag on the Foremaſt; and then the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> with a Flag on his Mizen-maſt, and then the other common Ships.</p>
               <p>The 15th, An Engliſh Fiſherman came to us, and gave us Information that there were 16 French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of War cruiſing near <hi>Calais,</hi> with two Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers and two Fireſhips laying wait for our Fleet. We ſent out immediately a Yatch for true Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which came back to us on the 16th, and brought us word, that the Enemy was making up to us. Then we fell back to the Rode of <hi>Duyns,</hi> and lay under the Cannon of that place, while we prepared our ſelves for Fight, and to Conſult what we were to do: Upon this we had theſe following Orders agreed on.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> That all Captains, Seamen, and Officers, ſhould carefully obſerve what Signals and Commands were given by the Admiral, and Obey them punctually.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>II.</hi> That as ſoon as the Enemy came in ſight of us, we ſhould draw into the Form of a Half-Moon.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <hi>III.</hi> That if we ſhould happen to find a ſtrange Ship fall'n in amongſt our Fleet, we ſhould give the other Ships notice of it by firing off three of our Demy-Cannon.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:100310:126"/>
                  <hi>IV.</hi> In caſe a Ship ſhould be ready to ſink, it ſhould give notice of it by hanging a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn on the Foremaſt, if it were night; or by hanging out a yellow Flag, if it were day.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>V.</hi> Being the Admiral upon Pain of Death, muſt not yield himſelf, nor his Ship, into the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Hand; the Vice-Admiral was (in caſe of a Fight) to be nigh, and ſecond him.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <hi>VI.</hi> The Admiral was to put up two bright Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns, and the other Ships but one, that they might diſtinguiſh and follow the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral.</p>
               <p n="7">
                  <hi>VII.</hi> Upon all Occaſions, the Officers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers were to behave themſelves briskly and honeſtly, and to obſerve very ſtrictly, theſe and all other Articles relating to the Fleet, upon their Peril.</p>
               <p>The 17th, We lay ſtill, and a French Privateer came up the Engliſh Road, and paſſed by our Fleet, narrowly viewing it, and ſtruck in to Sea again.</p>
               <p>The 18th inſtant, in the morning, Our Admiral ſhot off one piece, and hung up a Blue-Flag for a Signal to hoiſt up Sail, which was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, with many diſcharges of our Cannon in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to his Royal Majeſty the King of <hi>England,</hi> which were anſwer'd from <hi>Dover-Caſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 19th, We ſaw the French Fleet about a League diſtance from us, but when they ſaw that we were ſo ſtrong, they did not dare to fall upon us, but made home to <hi>Calais.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 20th, We loſt ſight of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> The Sea that lies between them two is call'd the Channel, and is 96 miles long. After this we came into the Sea of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Water there looks extreamly blue by reaſon of its being ſo vaſtly deep. About Noon, the Admiral ſets up a white Flag, and fires a Gun, to give notice to all the Captains, Maſters, and Stewards, belonging to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:100310:126"/>
the Fleet, to come aboard his Ship, which they did; and whilſt he treated them, and all were mighty merry, the danger of the French coming upon them being over, the <hi>Macaſſar</hi> fell foul on our Ship, and gave us a terrible ſhake. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar</hi> got a great Hole in her ſide by it, but it was eaſily ſtopt again. Towards Evening, our Gueſts went to their reſpective Ships, and the Cannon kept firing all the Night.</p>
               <p>The 21th in the morning early, The Ships, that till then kept together, parted, each taking their ſeveral Courſe to the Places they were Bound for. Some went to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> others to <hi>Smirna, Spain, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Portugal.</hi> We that were bound to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> being five Ships, kept on to the South-Weſt, having a very good Wind at N. N. E.</p>
               <p>The 22th, Our Men aboard the <hi>Aſia</hi> were divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two parts; the one call'd the <hi>Prince</hi>'s, the other Count <hi>Maurice</hi>'s Quarter, one of theſe Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was to watch by turns four hours a piece at Night; when the Watch on the one ſide wanted to be relieved by ſome body of the other, two Men ſung a Song to awake them.</p>
               <p>In the Evening of this day, The <hi>Rantſoen</hi> (as we call it) began, that is, we came to a ſet Allowance, which was, to every Perſon three Pound of Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket a Week, half a Pint of Vinegar, a quarter of a Pint of <hi>Lisbon</hi> Sallad-Oil, and every day a Gill of Brandy: On ſome days we had Stock-Fiſh and Peaſe boil'd in Water, upon which we us'd to pour a little Oil and Vinegar: But the next morning we had a Wooden-Diſh full of boil'd Barley allowed to every ſeven Men. On Sundays, Tueſdays, and Thurſdays, our Dinners was Pork, or other Fleſh.</p>
               <p>From the 23th of <hi>January</hi> to the 24th of <hi>February,</hi> nothing remarkable happen'd, except that the cold Weather had quite left us; And we ſaw the Fiſh
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:100310:127"/>
ſometimes driving one another to and fro, and particularly the flying Fiſh, about the bigneſs of a Herring, always in fear of being devoured. The longeſt Flights they could take was about a Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, and then they were forced to light on the Water to wet their Wings again: By this Flight they eſcape indeed from their greateſt Enemies, the Dolphins and the Porpoiſes; but then they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten become the Prey of Sea-Birds, call'd Boobys: Here we ſaw Birds and Fiſhes flying together.</p>
               <p>The 25th of <hi>February</hi> we ſaw <hi>Pico de Canaria,</hi> or the <hi>Canarie</hi> Mountain: We ſteer'd our Courſe thither, and came pretty near it by the next day; and then we found that we were 20 Leagues off when we firſt diſcover'd it. Otherwiſe, upon a ſmooth Sea, we could not ſee farther than five Leagues in a ſtreight Line. This difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from the extraordinary height of the Hill above the ſurface of the Water.</p>
               <p>The 26th, 27th, and 28th <hi>Ditto,</hi> we had good Weather.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of <hi>March,</hi> early in the morning, We ſpied two Ships with Dutch Flags and Pendants, that were Roving about; but we would not truſt them, for we knew the Turkiſh Pyrates uſed to Lurk about this Mountain of the <hi>Canaries,</hi> or the Southern Iſlands. After a Council of War held, our Admiral, about Noon ſailed foremoſt to take better notice of them, and he quickly found them to be what we ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>We were not the only one who made our ſelves ready for a Fight, but our four Ships that came after, at about a League diſtance, did the like, and gave us notice by an appointed Signal, that they were prepared. We expected them, and towards the Evening, the Enemy came ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what nearer to us, yet not within ſhot; all that Night we kept a very ſtrict Watch.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:100310:127"/>
The 2d <hi>Ditto,</hi> very early in the morning, the Wind blew hard at North-Weſt, by which means we loſt ſight of the Turkiſh Ships about Twelve at Noon; and about the Evening it ceaſed.</p>
               <p>The 3d, we made vaſt way with a good Wind, and about four hours after we ſpied a Ship, and found by her running ſhe was one of the Turks we had ſeen the day before; our Maſter being a very brisk Sea-Soldier, (his Name <hi>Peter Vander Woetſtiin)</hi> found that he could not poſſibly out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail this Pyrate; ſo he lower'd his Sails and ſtaid for him, as much as to ſay, that he did not fear him. The Turk ſailed by us with his Dutch Flag up, as near and ſwift as he could: He pretended to be a Friend of ours, and ſet a Renegado to Hail us, and ask us in Dutch, What Ship? And whither Bound? Our Maſter ordered the Gunner to fire, and the Men fired ſo briskly with the lower Tire, and batter'd the Mahometan ſo ſorely, that they made all the haſte they could to get away, and found work enough to mend the Holes our Guns had made.</p>
               <p>The 4th in the morning, about 7 of the Clock, this Turk, batter'd as he was, came up to us again; his Deſign was to clap us on board, and to Storm us. We having a ſufficient Force on Board, defended our ſelves ſo bravely, that the Enemy was obliged to run again at night with no ſmall loſs. On our ſide, we had Twelve kill'd and Twenty wounded, Soldiers and Seamen: The wounded were all cured. In the mean while, the Carpenters were employed in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing what Damage the Enemies Shot had done us, and ſtopping the Holes.</p>
               <p>The 5th <hi>Ditto,</hi> Our Chaplain Preached a Thankſgiving Sermon for the Aſſiſtance God was pleaſed to give them, delivering them through his Mercy out of the Hands of thoſe Cruel Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants:
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100310:128"/>
And after that, our Maſter and Admiral thank'd his People for the help they had given him with ſo much Gallantry; and ordered a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Sack for every Man.</p>
               <p>From the 6th to the 24th of <hi>March,</hi> we had very bluſtering Winds, and a dreadful violent Storm, ſo that we often thought our ſelves at the very brink of Death.</p>
               <p>The 25th, While that Tempeſtuous Weather ſtill laſted, the Mate and his Boy were catch'd together acting the abominable Sin of Sodomy: A Council was held upon it, and Sentence was given that they ſhould be tied back to back, (which was done by the Boatſwain), and tied in a Sack, and thrown alive into the Sea. As the Miniſter was doing his Duty towards theſe Malefactors, repreſenting to them the hainouſneſs of their Crime, and directing them to prepare for Death, the Boy, about 14 years of Age, wept bitterly; But the Mate, being an Italian, about 40 years old, ſhew'd himſelf mighty ready to Die, ſaying; 'Twas bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he ſhould be puniſh'd alone for his horrid Sin, then that the whole Ship ſhould ſuffer for his ſake.</p>
               <p>The 26th, the Wind ceaſed; But we hardly knew where we were, nor had known it for 20 days time, having not been able to make an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation ſince the 6th day: And,</p>
               <p>On the 27th, it being very fine Weather, we found that the Storm had carried. us under the Equinoctial Line. Here it is extream unhealthy, and a certain Diſtemper ſeized moſt of our Men, which made them raving mad: In one day five Perſons died, one of which was our Chaplain, the other four Soldiers. Theſe Dead Men, were (according to the Cuſtom of our Dutch Ships) ſew'd, each Corps by it ſelf, in a ſheet, and after our uſual Morning or Evening Prayer, (with a Pſalm ſung at the end of it) thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:100310:128"/>
The 28th, we had no Wind: On this day, one of our Barbers, and two Seamen died; and two Soldiers, in their raving Fit, (cauſed by the intollerable Heat) leapt into the Sea; which two of our beſt Swimmers perceiving, leap'd in after them, and brought 'em into the Ship again: But one of 'em after all this, hang'd himſelf that very Night by his Bed-ſide.</p>
               <p>On the 29th, The other Soldier that had leapt in the Sea, died, having no regard to any good Advice that was given him, and could not be made to Pray. We had not a Breath of Wind this day, nor</p>
               <p>The 30th and 31th: Theſe two days we threw over-board our late Chaplain's 4 Children, 4 Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgions and Barbers, a Carpenter, and 10 Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt, 2d, 3d, and 4th of <hi>April,</hi> the Calm held us ſtill; And in thoſe four days we loſt a Steerſman, two Carpenters, the Serjeant, and 30 Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Seamen; ſo that we expected every Soul ſhould Die out of the Ship.</p>
               <p>The 5th <hi>Ditto,</hi> it pleaſed God to deliver us from that fatal place by a favourable Wind at Weſt and by-South. We had ſtill a great many ſick Men, and not enough in health to be able to Brace our Main-Sail, tho' the Mortality ceaſed; ſo we were forced to make ſhift with our ſmall Sails. That day we caught with a Hook one of the great Fiſhes called Sharks, that rowl'd and toſs'd about our Ship. We deſign'd to dreſs him, and refreſh our ſelves with it; but when we cut it open, we found in the Belly of it our Serjeant that we had thrown over-board, not yet dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted. The ſight of this ſo turn'd our Stomachs, that none could find in their Heart to Eat of the Fiſh; ſo that we threw Man and Fiſh into the Sea again. It is obſervable, That theſe great Fiſh have always ſome ſmall ones to go before
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100310:129"/>
'em, that are called by the name of Pilot-Fiſhes, and ſwim in and out of the Shark's Mouth. And when a Shark is catch'd, they cleave to his Back like a Burr.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not omit what happen'd to my ſelf. As I fell Ill and was in a Swoun, he that look'd after the ſick, took me for Dead, and fetch'd a new Shirt out of my Cheſt, and was putting it upon me; The Sail-maker too was a going to ſew me up; and he handling me a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle roughly, after all his puſhing and toſſing of me, I open'd my Eyes: Thoſe that were about me were not a little ſtartled; and ſaid, it was high time for me to open 'em; for if I had winck'd but a little longer, over I had gone. Our chief Merchant gave me a Glaſs of Sack, which refreſhed me very much.</p>
               <p>From the 6th to the 18th of <hi>April,</hi> we had a very fair Wind and good Weather. In that time we ſaw ſome of the Northern Capers, and a great many Whales, which kept us Company till we came on</p>
               <p>The 20th, within ſight of the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Mount</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> which is very remarkable for its height.</p>
               <p>The 22th, We came happily into the Road near the Land call'd, <hi>Capo de Bonne Eſperance,</hi> or the <hi>Cape of Good Hope.</hi> And here we met again with two of our Ships, <hi>Cortgeene</hi> and <hi>Tidor,</hi> which had been parted from us, and we had not ſeen, ſince the 2d of <hi>March.</hi> They gave us an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, That they had been buſie with the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Privateers that fell upon us, and that they had wetted their Feet; which was, that they had ſunk 'em. However, They took up 36 of their Men that could Swim beſt, and brought them along with them. This News gave us a great deal of Joy. The Priſoners we ſent hence imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the <hi>Robin-Iſland,</hi> to gather Muſſel-ſhells, and others, for the burning of Lime.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE 23th of <hi>April,</hi> early in the morning, I went on Shore of <hi>Africa</hi> with our Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: From this place to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> they reckon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100310:130"/>
uſually 2000 miles. At this Cape we lay ſtill nine days, and in that time provided our ſelves with Water, Wood, and other Neceſſaries. As to the Qualities of this Land, by what Obſervation I could make of it, I found it to be: Firſt Fruitful; And for that Reaſon, our <hi>East-India</hi> Company hath cauſed ſome years ago, many very ſtrong Places to be Built there by the Water-ſide, cloſe under the <hi>Duyvel's-bergh, Lewen-bergh,</hi> and <hi>Tafel-bergh,</hi> well ſtored with Soldiers, and all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and are ſufficiently provided againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the Wild-Men; ſo that their Ships go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to and from the <hi>Indies,</hi> may ſafely, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger, put in there at any time, and take in Proviſions, whether it be of Cattle, Water, Wood, or other Refreſhments. And here are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready a great many Boors that are come from <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and by reaſon of the great Priviledges that are granted them, have ſettled there, and have Tilled the Land and made it very fruitful, for a matter of 20 or 30 miles round about thoſe Places. Secondly, Very populous: The Inhabitants are called wild Africans, or <hi>Hottentots.</hi> Their Colour is like that of the Egyptian Heathens, or as we call them corruptly, Gypſies. The Hair of their Head grows entangled in one another, like the Wool of a young Lamb; upon which they hang for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all manner of Sea-ſhells. They are of a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtature, and well proportioned, only that they have their Noſes a little too flat and broad.</p>
               <p>They wear no manner of Cloaths, only a Sheeps-skin or Calf-skin on their Shoulders, (and that's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with Greaſe to make it ſoft and pliant) when it is a little Cold, or when it Rains. They wear the Tail of a Fox, or of a wild Dog hanging before their Privy-Parts. The Women among theſe <hi>Hottentots</hi> have a different Ornament from the Men, which is the Gutts of their Cattle freſh killed.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100310:130"/>
Theſe they wrap about their Legs, not minding the inconveniency it puts 'em to, which is ſuch, that they can hardly go, and they leave 'em there till they are quite dry.</p>
               <p>I had often-times been told, that theſe Women had naturally a little kind of a Flap growing over their Privities, like that of a Turkey-Cock's Bill, which I had a mind to ſee if it were true; but upon Examination, I found nothing of Truth in it. My Experience coſt me only ſome Tobacco.</p>
               <p>Theſe People have a very ſtrange Speech, and make ſuch a diſagreeable Noiſe with their Mouth, as other Nations cannot imitate; but a great many of them that live near to the <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> can ſpeak ſome Dutch. They have no manner of Religion, Prayers, or Laws, only they Worſhip the Moon. The firſt time that they ſee it; they ſpend that whole Night in Dancing, Singing, and Bawling Ha, ha, ha, ha. They do not at all trouble themſelves with Building or Planting: So that they have no conſtant abode, but move from place to place with their Children and Wives, where they can find Paſture for their Cattle. They Eat all ſorts of Fruits and Roots that grow either above or under-ground. They make no difference, whether their Meat is kill'd, or dead with any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or whether it be Man's Fleſh: Whatever it be, they throw it upon ſome Coals, leave it there a little while, and ſo Eat it.</p>
               <p>They lie in ſmall Hutts or Holes, every one with his Wife. If any of the Women have two Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at one Birth, they kill the weakeſt, that the other may have the Breaſts to himſelf, and grow ſtronger and luſtier. As ſoon as the Boys come to be about Twelve years of Age, they cut off his right Teſticle, that he may be the fitter for Running.</p>

They have ſome Kings amongſt them, and a great many Captains, and have cruel Wars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one another. They ſhoot Darts, and are excellent at hitting a Mark with a Stone. The Women too will come in often and carry their Husband's Arms: If they take any of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they kill 'em and eat 'em with great Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. And in the ſame manner they uſe the Europeans too, (who come often to Truck a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Tobacco or Bracelets, for a good parcel of Cows and Sheep) if they can get them into their Hutts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Rich. They have all manner of wild Beaſts. For here are the furious Lions, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard no Man, and when Hungry, fall upon Men and Beaſts and Devour them. The Grinning Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. The vaſt Elephant for Bulk and Strength. The Angry Rhinoceros. The skipping and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering Ape: Beſides, Wild Dogs, Bears, Wolves, and wonderful fine Wild Aſſes, all in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; As alſo Oſtriches, which have indeed Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Wings, but cannot Fly by reaſon of their bigneſs and weight. Their Eggs are hatch'd of themſelves, and not (as ſome miſ-informed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have given an account of it) by their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual looking after 'em. Sea-Cows, that lie in the freſh Rivers all day, and at night come on Shore to feed: Their Fleſh is better than that of Swine. Stag and Deer, Wild-Boars, Partridges, Peacocks, Geeſe, Wild-Ducks, and other ſort of Poultry, too long to give an Account of, all which are here very plentiful.</p>

The 2d we had a General Day of Humiliation in our three Ships. For tho' we were now out of Danger of Sea-Robbers, we were not ſo from Storms and Tempeſts, and other fatal Accidents.</p>
               <p>The 3d, The Wind blew very hard at N. W. tho' it was Serviceable for us to ſet us forward.</p>
               <p>The 14th, The Wind grew higher ſtill: And in the Afternoon, a Merchant's Son of <hi>Franckfort, Morel</hi> by Name, going, (as it was uſual) to the fore-part of the Ship to Eaſe Nature, fell into the Sea; and all our Endeavours to help him were in vain, by reaſon of the boiſterouſneſs of the Waves, and our ſwift Sailing: That ſame day the two Ships of our Company, the <hi>Tidor</hi> and <hi>Cortgeene,</hi> parted from us.</p>
               <p>From the 5th to the 10th the ſame Wind laſted.</p>
               <p>The 11th, We felt it very Cold.</p>
               <p>The 12th, We had a mixture of Hail and Snow, and two of our Seamen fell in and were drowned.</p>
               <p>The 13th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th <hi>Ditto,</hi> We hoiſted up but one Sail, and ran very ſwift, the Wind blowing almoſt a Storm, and made commonly 70 miles, or more, in 24 hours.</p>
               <p>The 21th, We reach'd the Altitude of the Iſland St. <hi>Maurice.</hi> This Iſland was not long ſince Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Dutch <hi>East-India</hi> Company, before which time it was not Inhabited. It is fruitful, and has great ſtore of Wild-Deer; It produces Amber-Greeſe, Ebony, and other fine Woods.</p>
               <p>The 22th, A Seaman of ours fell unluckily from the Main-Maſt upon one of our great Anchors, and from thence into the Sea, and ſunk immediately, his Breath being gone with his firſt fall.</p>
               <p>The 23th, We came again into a warm Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and we had a very favourable Wind to the end of this month.</p>

The firſt of <hi>June</hi> it was very ſtill, but very Rainy Weather.</p>
               <p>The 2d, Our uſual Allowance of Fleſh, Bread, and Beer, was leſſened, which did not pleaſe moſt of us very well.</p>
               <p>From the 3d to the 20th, We had nothing remarkable, ſave that we ſuffer'd in ſome meaſure both Hunger and Thirſt, tho' that contributed much to our Health, according to the Proverb, which ſays, <hi>That Hungry Men will not over-ſleep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;</hi> and much Sleep being unhealthy, the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our Stomachs would keep us from any ſuch Indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>The 21th, Our Maſter promis'd Twelve Crowns to any one that ſhould diſcover Land, upon which we all look'd about us very ſharp, and kept very ſtrict Watch, taking great notice what Colour the Water was of, by which we often have notice that we draw near the Land; in the mean while we were buſie with getting of our Anchors ready.</p>
               <p>The 22th, in the morning, One that ſtood on the top of the Main-Maſt, cry'd out, Land, and being ask'd which way he ſpy'd it, he anſwer'd, Directly in the Eaſt, and that it was a high Land. This was about Sun-riſing, and about Noon we found that he had not been miſtaken; for it was the very Land which we were to go to, <hi>viz. Java Major,</hi> or <hi>Great Java;</hi> This occaſion'd a very great Rejoycing, for now we had Bread and Water al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in abundance.</p>
               <p>The 23th, We came into the Road of <hi>Sunda,</hi> which is about 36 miles long: Here we were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd, by reaſon of the Calm, and the fierceneſs of the Tide againſt us, to caſt out our Anchor. While we lay there, ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Java</hi> came to viſit us, and brought us all manner of Indian Fruits; ſuch as <hi>King's Apples, Mellons, Figs, Citrons, Bananas, Sugar, Rice,</hi> and other-like things; all
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100310:132"/>
which Refreſhments we had of them in exchange for old Iron and Tobacco. They came in little Boats, but oddly made, and very ill put together, but they ſail very faſt with 'em.</p>
               <p>The 24th, Two of them were ſent over to us out of <hi>Bantam,</hi> laden with Fruit from <hi>Java,</hi> Ducks, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This day we made ſome of our way with a good Wind, but towards the Evening we caſt Anchor, the Wind being changed.</p>
               <p>The 25th, in the morning, betwixt 9 and 10 a Clock, we ſaw at the right Hand of us, the Royal City <hi>Bantam;</hi> In the afternoon, about 4 a Clock, we came into the Road before <hi>Batavia:</hi> Our Cabin-Boy ſwimming very well, and having a mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelf in that Water, was unexpectedly catch'd and devour'd by a Crocodile.</p>
               <p>The 26th, in the morning, We were fetch'd to Shore in a ſmall Skiff to <hi>Batavia,</hi> to our great Joy: Thus we did (by God's Aſſiſtance) compleat this great Voyage from <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to <hi>Batavia,</hi> in five months and 12 days, and in leſs than 24 weeks, made 3636 miles.</p>
               <p>The 27th, Came in the <hi>Tydor</hi> and <hi>Cortgeene,</hi> which came out with us from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope,</hi> and which had not been ſeen ſince the third day after that until now. This made them all very glad in <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This day at night, all the Soldiers that were ſent here from <hi>Holland,</hi> were brought, well Arm'd and in good Order, before the Dutch General there, called <hi>Maetzuycker:</hi> He welcom'd them; and after that, the Officers divided them, and ſent them, ſome into the City, and ſome into the Fort. I went to ſee the Fortification: It has four Baſtions, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, the <hi>Diamond,</hi> where a Major, with 40 or 50 Soldiers keep conſtantly; Secondly, The <hi>Ruby,</hi> kept by a Captain, and as many Men; Thirdly, The <hi>Saphire,</hi> which is commanded by a Serjeant; And
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:100310:133"/>
Fourthly, The <hi>Pearl,</hi> commanded alſo by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant.</p>
               <p>The 28th, 29th, and 30th, We had three days liberty to go up and down, in and out of the City; and here we much wondered to ſee the Chineſes, (of which ſeveral live here upon the account of their great Trade) carry Meat and Drink to thoſe that are Buried in the Church-yard, in Veſſels of fine <hi>China,</hi> lamenting, and asking them, Why they Died, and what they wanted; and telling them, it was unkind not to let their Friends know of it; But the Dead there, as well as here, are very ſilent. This good Chear of theirs is generally carried off by the Dutch Soldiers and Seamen, who Feaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with it, when they have Game'd away their Money, or otherways ſpent it. Beſides theſe Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſes, there are ſeveral other Eaſt-Indians, and other Heathens, that live at <hi>Batavia,</hi> and drive a great Trade there. They are all oblig'd to joyn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the common Defence of the City, in caſe of Neceſſity; chiefly the Javans, the proper Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Iſland: They are very Tawny, and wear only a Girdle about their middle, of fine Linnen, or Silk: They are Circumcis'd as the Turks: Some of them Worſhip an Image with a Lion's Head, the Sun, and the Moon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſide Amboineſes, Tarnatans, Malleyers, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſſers, and other-like Nations, each of theſe have their Kings; are very skillful with Weapons, which are Bows, Arrows, Javelins, Spears, and Poiſoned Darts. When they go into the Field, they adorn their Bucklers with a great deal of finery, wearing on their Head a very fine Bird, call'd the <hi>Bird of Paradiſe,</hi> which is found in <hi>Amboyna,</hi> about 500 miles from <hi>Batavia.</hi> Their warlike Muſick is an Inſtrument made of Mettle, called Gum-Gum, much in the Nature of our Drums; It makes a greater noiſe than a good large Bell. The Amboyneſes
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:100310:133"/>
are great Necromancers; and from hence it is ſaid, Doctor <hi>Fauſtus</hi> got his Maſter, and was carried thither through the Air riding upon a Cloak.</p>
               <p>From the 1ſt of <hi>July</hi> to the 9th, We were daily exercis'd in the handling of the Musket and Pike, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10th, Some of the ſtouteſt and briskeſt of all our Men were pick'd out and ſent,</p>
               <p>The 11th, Under the Command of Major <hi>Pool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> a Brandenburger, Captain <hi>Harzing,</hi> Captain <hi>Roodbol,</hi> Captain <hi>St. Martini</hi> a Frenchman, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Dack,</hi> each with his Company, and Embark'd in one Ship to go to <hi>Japara</hi> to quell the Inſurrection there, and to help the King of <hi>Bantam</hi> againſt the Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The 12th, Our Seamen too, belonging to our five Ships were divided into Companies, and provided with Hand-Granadoes, ſharp Cutlaces, Pikes, Bills, and other Weapons uſeful in War: Their Officers were the Maſter as Captain, the Mate was made Lieutenant, the Boatſwain a Serjeant, and the Quartermaſters Corporals.</p>
               <p>The 13th and 14th, We paſt by <hi>Bantam,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Toppers-hoedie,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Iſland.</p>
               <p>The 15th, We ſaw our Enemies in an innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of little Skiffs. They had notice of our approach, and deſigned to keep us from their Wall; ſo they came to meet us, and quite ſurrounded our Ship: Their intent was to get on Board, then Storm, and Rob us. All this while, our Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Soldiers were employed, and fought ſo briskly, that that day we deſtroy'd about 1100 of their Skiffs, little and great. We had but few of our Men killed, but many wounded. We could not tell the number of the Enemy that was ſlain; for ſuppoſing there were as many of their Boats ſunk, as I ſaid ev'n now, the number of the Men is uncertain, for they hold according to their big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:100310:134"/>
from 6 to 30 Perſons. And beſides, As their Boats ſunk, abundance of them were Swimming to Land, like ſo many Water-Spaniels for about a mile's ſpace, and ſo ſaved their lives. Our Booty was but ſmall; for the Indians had nothing about them but Proviſion and Arms, the beſt part of which fell into the Sea.</p>
               <p>The 16th, early in the morning, We were put aſhore all together to purſue the Enemy, whilſt they were ſtill terrified with their late loſs. We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to make an eaſie work of it, but they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and we found it, otherwiſe. They fell upon us like Mad-Dogs, in vaſt numbers, and of all ſides. The <hi>Opium</hi> that they uſe to take always before they engage, had made 'em ſtark Mad; ſo that they kill'd the flower of our Officers, and 150 private Soldiers: And at laſt, the reſt of us were forced to Flee and Swim for our Lives to get into our Ship.</p>
               <p>The 17th, All our ſick and wounded were put into a Ship, and ſent to the Hoſpital in <hi>Batavia;</hi> And a Letter ſent to the General, and the Council, to acquaint them, that we wanted a ſreſh Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and Recruits to go on in our Enterprize.</p>
               <p>The 18th, We ſent out a large Boat, with a Lieutenant, and Soldiers and ſome Seamen, to go aſhore and view the place, and give us Intelligence; but the Enemy fell upon them, and ſlew every one of them, except one Seaman; who,</p>
               <p>On the 19th, came ſwimming to our Ship very quick, having the ſtream with him. He gave us an account, how they were fell upon by four Boats full of thoſe Japarians, who killed all his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and as for his own ſafety, he had made his way through 'em with a great lighted ſtick of Wood, that he ſnatcht up from under a Kettle, and with that kept them at ſuch a diſtance who were half Naked, that he had room and time to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100310:134"/>
throw himſelf into the Water to Swim for his Life, tho' they continually ſhot at him with their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Our Maſter order'd him immediately a Glaſs of Sack to refreſh him, for he was ſadly weaken'd, having been almoſt a day and a night in the Water.</p>
               <p>The 20th, After a Council held, Letters were written to the General <hi>Maetzuycker,</hi> in <hi>Batavia;</hi> and I was one of thoſe that were order'd to go with them.</p>
               <p>We ſailed all the 21th, 22th, and 23th, and arrived happily at <hi>Batavia</hi> on the 24th, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered our Meſſage and Letters.</p>
               <p>The 25th, An Advice-Boat was ſent with a Letter to the Fleet at <hi>Jappara,</hi> to order them to come all back to <hi>Batavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 26th, A new Ship from <hi>Holland</hi> arrived here, and brought us an Account, That they had been 9 months a coming, and that 18 of their Men died in their Voyage.</p>
               <p>The 27th, Came another Ship in, which the Hollanders had given over for loſt, having been gone from <hi>Zealand</hi> above 18 months, and they had no News of it all that while. The Maſter of it told me, They had undergone a great deal of Hardſhip; (which one might eaſily ſee by the Ship and her Crew.) Amongſt other things, he told us, That they had been driven ſo far Southward by a continual Storm, that their Compaſs did 'em no more Service, the Needle turning from one ſide to the other irregularly. At laſt, they had diſcover'd in the night, a high Land, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to them like Fire; but they turn'd their Backs to it, and ſail'd ſo long, till they came at laſt by meer good Fortune, to get the uſe of their Compaſs again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:100310:135"/>
The 28th, A Ship came from <hi>Malacca</hi> to <hi>Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> which brought a great many Spiauters and Pellicans of a Purple Colour, as alſo a Caſſwari: This is a great Bird that has no Feathers on his Body, but Hair, like Hog's Briſtles. It will Eat red-hot Coals, Tobacco-Pipes, Iron, and leaden Bullets; but doth not Digeſt any of 'em: It hath no Tongue, but makes a Noiſe as Shrill as that of a little Goſling. Of this Bird we ſhall take an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to tell you a very pleaſant Story by and by.</p>
               <p>The 29th, Four Seamen were publickly Beheaded at <hi>Batavia,</hi> (which is here the common Death of Criminals) for having killed a Chineſe. At the ſame time, ſix Slaves that had Murthered their Maſter in the night, were broke upon the Wheel. A Mulatto (as they call thoſe that are begotten betwixt a Black-a-Moor and a White) was Hang'd for Theft. Eight other Seamen were Whipt for Stealing, and running away, and were beſides this, Burnt on the Shoulder with the Arms of the <hi>East-India</hi> Company. Two Dutch Soldiers that had abſented themſelves from the Guard two days, ran the Gauntlet. A Dutch Schoolmaſter's Wife that was caught a Bed with another Man, (it being her frequent Practice) was put in the Pillory, and Condemn'd to 12 years Impriſonment in the <hi>Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During the time of Execution, the Gates of the Fort, and of the City, were ſhut up, and all the Garriſon in Arms.</p>
               <p>The 30th, Came 32 Javans, with a Crocodile, 22 Foot long, which they had caught with a great Crook, and brought into the Fort to ſhew it to the General, who having taken a view of it, gave the Fellows that brought it 6 Rixdollars for their Pains: So they carried it away again.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="249" facs="tcp:100310:135"/>
The 31th, A Javan came into <hi>Batavia,</hi> and gave an Account of the General's Huntſman's being fall'n upon by a Tyger, and torn in pieces by him.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt, 2d, and 3d of <hi>August,</hi> The Dutch Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Soldiers, as alſo the Indian Inhabitants of <hi>Batavia,</hi> drew up in the <hi>Galge-Veldt,</hi> each by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and made a very fine ſhew. Many of the Indians here ſhew'd their Activity in Leaping, and in exerciſing their Arms, <hi>viz.</hi> Shields, Bows, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and Pikes. The moſt remarkable Leaper amongſt them all, was one Captain <hi>Joncker,</hi> who Leapt cleverly over a Dutch-Trooper, that was mounted on a Perſian Horſe. We Hollanders were Poſted, (about the Houſe where our General and the Lords of the Council of the <hi>Indies</hi> were, with their Wives and Children) with four Companies under Arms, ready in caſe the Indians (who were in great numbers) ſhould attempt to Riſe or make a Rebellion. This ſhew was made to entertain the <hi>Heer Rycloff Van Goens,</hi> a Dutch Admiral, that was newly come over, and was then one of the Lords of the Council, and a ſhort time after was made General.</p>
               <p>The 4th, Twelve Slaves of the Heer <hi>Speelman</hi>'s one of the Council of <hi>India,</hi> run away; they had taken a Boat and got to <hi>Bantam.</hi> The Muſter-maſter of <hi>Batavia,</hi> went with ſix Servants, all Guinea-Gaffers, well provided with Cutlaces and other Arms, in a Yatch in purſuit of 'em. They ſoon met with them, but the Slaves ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves, that they kill'd the Muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter and all his Company; and went on to <hi>Bantam:</hi> where they thought themſelves very ſafe, but to their Grief, they found themſelves miſtaken; for as ſoon as they Landed, they were known to be Fugitive Slaves, and ſeized and ſent back.</p>

                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:100310:136"/>
On the 7th, All the Twelve were broke upon the Wheel in the place call'd the <hi>Galge-Veldt.</hi> The manner of doing it is thus: There are four Poſts drove into the Ground, and ſtand out about two foot: To theſe they Tie the Malefactor's Hands and Feet; Then comes the Executioner with a Bar of Iron, and breaks his Limbs one after the other, and at laſt gives him one Blow on the Breaſt.</p>
               <p>The 8th, A Seaman was found in the Square, (the Dutch call it the <hi>Vierkant)</hi> cut moſt dreadfully with a Knife. This Square is a very large place, and is ſo called, becauſe it hath four Angles. It was built by the Engliſh about 60 years ago. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Dutch got it from 'em, by this means, (as I am informed.) Some Dutch Ships came cloſe to this Square; Their Admiral begg'd the favour of the Engliſh Governour, that he might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to bring in his Men, (who were very ſick with their long Voyage) for recovery of their Health and for Refreſhment; which the Engliſh Governour generouſly granted out of Pity and Compaſſion. The Dutch ſent two Boats full of their beſt and ſtouteſt Men, arm'd privately with ſuch Weapons as might not be diſcover'd, as Swords, Knives, and Piſtols, and with a feigned groaning and grunting, were let in at the Water-Gate; and being got in, fell upon the Engliſh, and ſlew one part of 'em, and took the other Priſoners, and plunder'd all their Goods. (vid. Van Heſſe<hi>'s Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the taking of</hi> Batavia <hi>in his Voyage.)</hi> Since that time, the City and Fort was built by the Dutch, who have now made it ſo ſtrong both within and without, with Walls and Ditches, (which never are frozen up by reaſon there's no Winter here) that the place is inacceſſible, and is able to reſiſt all their Eaſt-Indian Enemies. The Fort, with the 4 Baſtions, (which I have given an Account of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready)
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:100310:136"/>
commands all the Streets of the City, the Square, the Water-Gate, and the Road where the Ships lie.</p>
               <p>The 9th, Our Armourer ſent Orders to all the Guards, That thoſe who wanted Musket-Balls ſhould come to the uſual place at 4 a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, (after they had been Exerciſed,) and fetch 'em. He ſent out before-hand, a Box full of 'em by two of his Slaves from the Store-Houſe, and bid them ſet it down in the great Court. A while after, coming to give 'em out, he found his Box empty. He runs immediately to our Captain, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, That the Soldiers had ſtole away the Bullets: The Captain ſets him Sentinel for his Negligence; and then had all the Soldiers ſearch'd: But on</p>
               <p>The 10th, They found out that the <hi>Caſſwari</hi> Birds (of which we have made mention above) that run all about the Fort, had ſwallowed all the Bullets, and dropt them here and there, as they wander'd about, whole and undigeſted. Our Armourer was forced for his Careleſſneſſ, to go all over the Fort to pick up the Bullets that were fall'n, and to hunt the Birds about to make them reſtore the reſt.</p>
               <p>The 11th, As an old Chineſe was coming along the ſaid Fort, with two Veſſels of Milk to ſell; a Peacock that belong'd to the General, ſeeing him, flew up upon his Head, and had certainly pickt out his Eyes had it not been for ſome Slaves that beat him off. This old Chineſe had once been the richeſt Man in <hi>Batavia,</hi> and worth ſome Tuns of Gold, which he had play'd away at Dice, and loſt the very Hair of his Head which was his laſt Stake.</p>
               <p>The 12th, I went into the City to a Chineſe's Houſe to drink a Glaſs of their Graſs-Beer, which is made of Sugar, and is very pleaſant. There I ſaw their manner of Eating: Seven of 'em, all Men, ſat at a Table by themſelves, for they will not truſt themſelves among the Europeans, nor will
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:100310:137"/>
they let them ſee their Wives: Beſides their Wives, they keep ſeveral <hi>Malleyers,</hi> that are fine Women, tho' of a tawny Complexion, and broad Noſes, whom they Buy for their uſe. Theſe Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have the liberty of ſhewing themſelves abroad: Their Maſters lie with them at their Pleaſure; but beſides theſe Women, they frequently keep Swine for the ſame purpoſe, and make the ſame uſe of 'em.</p>
               <p>In the middle of the Table ſtood a very large <hi>China</hi> Diſh, with a great many little ones in it, which were filled, ſome with Fiſh, and boil'd Rice inſtead of Bread; ſome with a ſort of a Meſs made of Citrons, which they call <hi>Arſchhar;</hi> and others, with a pickl'd ſort of Fruit like our Barberies, which they preſerve in Juice of Citrons and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. Each Man had a Wooden thing in his Hand like a pair of Tonges, which they uſe inſtead of a Fork, to Eat their Meat with. After they had done Eating, they took every one a Whiff of Tobacco out of a Pipe (which they call <hi>Gur-Gur)</hi> the Bole whereof is ſo large, that it would contain half a Pint of Water.</p>
               <p>At the time of their Meals, they did not forget their God, which was an Idol made of Wood, and ſtood very finely adorned upon a Table, with a Lamp burning by it. Him they ſerved firſt with their beſt Fruits and Meats, and laid it all decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on a Board that ſtood by for that purpoſe. I was ſo intent upon obſerving them, that I never minded my Drink, tho' it was excellent, and continually expected to ſee that Devil Eat the Victuals that were ſet before him; but I found, I might have ſtaid long enough, for he was ſo modeſt, he would not offer to touch them, ſo I came away: For I ſaw they did not like my ſtanding ſo near their Door to obſerve 'em as I did, and they knew me to be a Dutchman.
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:100310:137"/>
What the Devil did with his Meat afterwards I cannot pretend to give you an account of.</p>
               <p>On the 13th, I went to viſit the Rich Chineſe. Any European that goes there, is treated very li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally with as much ſtrong Drink as he pleaſes; which ſort of Drink is Diſtill'd out of the <hi>Suri</hi> that comes off from the Coco-Trees, and they call it <hi>Arack.</hi> The Richeſt Chineſe hath all the others under him; and as ſoon as he hangs out a red Flag, they are all obliged to appear immediately. He furniſhes alſo all the Dutch Ships with a ſufficient quantity of <hi>Arack,</hi> and Vinegar; of which he makes a Bill, which is abated out of their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions.</p>

               <p>THe 14th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> Came two <hi>Javans</hi> to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia,</hi> and brought Twelve Bats as big as Geeſe for a Preſent to our General. They are reckon'd there a very delicate Food; and I was told, they were brought to the General's Table as a Rarity, and fit for a great Entertainment. They fly out at Night as ours do, and haunt the Coco-Trees, and there ſuck the <hi>Suri</hi> that lies in the Coco-Nuts, ſo long, till they tumble down, and ſo are eaſily taken up with one's Hand; in the Day they keep in the Woods and hollow Trees.</p>

                  </note> Javan that had eaten ſome Opium ſtruck a Soldier that ſtood Sentinel with a half Pike upon the Bridge, between the City and the Fort, with a Poiſoned Dart, and kill'd him. This mad Fellow went on with a Deſign to fall upon the next Centinel alſo, which ſtood next to the Gate; But he being aware of him, preſented the Point of his Half-Pike againſt the Javan, who ran furiouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, and ſo killed himſelf.

               </p>
               <p>The 16th, We had a great deal of terrible Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that ſet fire on many Chineſe Ships, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed them. It look'd all that day, as if the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non had been perpetually firing. The reaſon of which is, That their Maſts and Ships <hi>(Jonckers</hi> as they call 'em) are of Bamboo-Canes, the Knots of which, when the Fire comes to crack them, give a very great Bounce in the Air.</p>
               <p>The 17th, Two Soldiers and one Seaman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted out of the Garriſon, and went to joyn with the Robbers that dwell on the <hi>Blaew-bergh,</hi> that is, Blew-Hill, about 12 Leagues off here. Theſe Robbers are a parcel of Soldiers and Seamen that are run away from the Dutch Service, and live about the <hi>Blaew-bergh</hi> with their Wives that are Javans, and much annoy the Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>The 19th, Twelve Javan Wild-Horſes were brought over from <hi>Bantam</hi> for a Preſent, to the Heer <hi>Maetzuycker</hi> our General.</p>
               <p>The 20th, Some Javans brought a Dead Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent 26 foot long, before our General's Lodgings. When the General had ſeen this dreadful Creature,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:100310:139"/>
he order'd it to be carried to his Phyſician Dr. <hi>Kleyer,</hi> who had it cut open by one <hi>John Otto Helwigh,</hi> a Saxon Doctor of Phyſick, (that came over with us as a Soldier) and had his Skin ſtuff'd up, and kept for a Show.</p>
               <p>The 21th, Three Month's Pay was paid to all the Garriſon, in Money, Silks, Stuffs, Linnen from <hi>China,</hi> Shirts, Shooes and Stockings; inſtead of Victuals here, we are allowed Board-Wages. The Pay is as followeth.</p>
               <p>A Captain's, 80 or 100 Guldens <hi>per</hi> Month Salary; 10 Rixdollars, and 7 Cans of Wine, and two of Oil, Board-Wages.</p>

               <p>The 23th, Our Major <hi>Poolman</hi> order'd a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, with 60 Soldiers, to go with the <hi>Aſia</hi> to the Weſtern Coaſt.</p>
               <p>The 24th, Two Ships happily arrived before <hi>Batavia;</hi> the one from <hi>Siam,</hi> loaden with Spiauter; the other from <hi>Tarnate,</hi> loaden with Cloves, Nut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>megs, and Mace. They brought us the News of a great deal of miſchief that had happened in <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boina</hi>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:100310:139"/>
and <hi>Tarnate</hi> about 500 miles Eaſtward from <hi>Batavia,</hi> by the Earthquakes, that are very frequent there, and commonly every year. Amongſt others, a part of an Iſland that was ſunk by an Earthquake in the year 1674. which at that time was ſaved, and was very rich in Clove-Trees, was now wholly ſunk.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that know the way of living here, need not much wonder why that Iſland ſhould have ſuch ſevere Misfortunes fall on it. The Spaniards here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore found this Iſland, and ſeeing it abound ſo much in Spices, fortified it with Caſtles and Towers, and adorn'd it with Churches, Cloiſters, and Schools: But they exerciſed an exceſſive Tyranny over the Inhabitants. For after they had treated with them and eſtabliſht themſelves in Peace, the Don's car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves ſo haughtily and cruelly, that if an Inhabitant chanced to meet 'em, and did not go 10 or 12 ſteps out of their way, and then ſtand ſtill, till the proud Spaniard was gone by, <hi>Sinioro</hi> made no more on't, but thruſt him through the Guts with his Cinque-Palm, (a Sword five Span's long) and laid a certain piece of Money, call'd a <hi>Perdau,</hi> upon the Dead Body: After which, the Murtherer was free from any Puniſhment, nor was he liable to be accuſed or reckon'd a Murtherer. And in this manner they have dealt with abundance of poor Indians upon any ſlight occaſion, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times out of a meer inſolent Humour. This Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Spaniſh Yoke hath been made ſomewhat lighter to 'em by the aſſiſtance of the Dutch; but the latter too, often plagued them ſufficiently, tho' not ſo bad as the former; and being once become Maſters, turn'd the Churches, Schools, and Cloiſters into Warehouſes, Inns, or Taverns, to ſave the Charge of Building new ones. To this exceſſive height of Inhumanity and Irreligion they were come, till in the year 1674. they were overwhelm'd by
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:100310:140"/>
an Earthquake, and their Forts, Walls, and Houſes ſunk, together with a great number of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
               <p>The 25th, Two Elephants paſſed by our Fort, which the King of <hi>Siam,</hi> who keeps his Reſidence in <hi>Odea,</hi> ſent as a Preſent to General <hi>Maetzuycker;</hi> beſides 35 hundred weight of Spiauter: With this, His Requeſt was, That we ſhould lend him a Man to make him ſome Gun-Powder; promiſing that he would ſend him back again to <hi>Batavia</hi> in two years time.</p>
               <p>The General received the Preſent, thanking the Ambaſſador; and deſired him to return his Thanks to his Maſter for his Favours, and to tell him, That he would heartily have fulfill'd his Majeſty's Deſire, but that he could not poſſibly do it then, becauſe he had but one of them himſelf, which he could by no means ſpare; but that he had ſome Powder that was at his Majeſty's Service.</p>
               <p>From the 26th to the 31th, We were obliged to appear every day upon the place where we uſed to Exerciſe, with our Companies, and fire againſt two Elephants that were newly come from <hi>Ceylon,</hi> which were brought every day to that place, that they might ſtand firing, and be uſeful in fight.</p>
               <p>From the 1ſt to the 30th of <hi>September,</hi> I did not ſtir out of the Fort, by reaſon of a terrible Head-Ach that ſeiz'd me, and ſuch a terrible one, that it fetch'd all the Hair off my Head; nor was I able to bear the exceſſive heat of the Weather. I us'd no other Remedies but Bathing <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Refreſhing my ſelf every night and morning (after Sun-riſing and Sun-ſetting) in the Water that runs about the Fort, tho' that was very dangerous, by reaſon of the Crocodiles that are there.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of <hi>October,</hi> Three Companies of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Batavia</hi> were order'd to Embark in three Ships, call'd the <hi>Macaſſar, Polsbroeck,</hi> and <hi>Polran</hi>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:100310:140"/>
to go to the Iſland <hi>Ceylon.</hi> They were all to be ready the next day to go off: I being one of the Company that was to go, took my leave of my Friends, and made my Proviſion of Fiſh, Sugar, Dates, Citrons, and other Neceſſaries for my Voyage.</p>
               <p>The 2d, About 10 a Clock in the Forenoon, each Company went to its appointed Ship; We and our Lieutenant (called <hi>Henrick Rentzen Van Oldenburgh)</hi> went to our Admiral-Ship, call'd the <hi>Macaſſar;</hi> In the Afternoon a Muſter-Maſter came to viſit the Ships, to ſee whether all the Men were on Board or no. If at any time one abſents himſelf after Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders given, and is found on ſhore, he is condemn'd to remain in Chains till the Ship in which he was to have gone is come back again.</p>
               <p>The 3d, early before day, The Maſter order'd the Gunner to fire one piece, which was the ſignal for our two other Ships to weigh Anchor, and to hoiſt up Sails. At break of day, (the Sun riſing here all the year round at 6 in the morning, and ſetting at 6 at night) we ſail'd with a Land-Wind by <hi>Bantam:</hi> In the afternoon, when we came to have a Sea-Wind, it blew very hard, and quite againſt us; ſo we were forced to caſt Anchor, and lie there ſtill, till</p>
               <p>The 4th, about two at night, The Tide and Land-Wind turn'd for us again, which carried us as far as the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Iſland, where we were to take in Wood and freſh Water.</p>
               <p>The 5th, 6th, and 7th, I went aſhore with five Soldiers, well provided with Arms, to defend thoſe that cut the Wood, from the Tygers; and to ſhoot ſome Fowls, ſuch as Peacocks and Ducks; for this Iſland being not much inhabited, does very much abound with all ſorts of Fowl.</p>
               <p>The 8th, at break of day, We weigh'd our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors, and paſs'd that day through the Road of <hi>Sunda,</hi> and came about the evening into the Sea.
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:100310:141"/>
The Wind was S. E. and by S. our Courſe lay moſt toward the North.</p>
               <p>The 9th, We were divided into two Quarters, for the better regulating the Watch, that every one might know when to Watch, and when to enjoy his Humour. Till this time we had Water to Drink, and Rice enough, but boil'd only in Water.</p>
               <p>The 10th, We had a very favourable Wind, And this day we came to an Allowance, which was, To each Perſon half a pound of boil'd Rice every day, half a Pint of diſtill'd <hi>Arack,</hi> and a Pint and a half of Water: Two Pound of Bisket a week, and half a Pint of Vinegar, and half that quantity of <hi>Lisbon</hi> Oil. Sundays and Thurſdays three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a pound of Fleſh: On Tueſdays a Quartern and a half of Bacon; Mondays, Wedneſdays, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, and Saturdays, Gray-Peaſe, which we Eat with Oil and Vinegar.</p>
               <p>The 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, We had ſtill a good Wind, and we began to draw pretty near the Weſtern Coaſt. In the night, about the 2d Watch, which is between 10 and 2 of the Clock, we ſaw a continual Lightning ſhoot through the Clouds, which look'd like a mixture of black and red, and made the moſt diſmal ſight that Man ever ſaw. In the 3d Watch, called the Day-Watch, about 3 of the Clock, we chang'd our Courſe from Weſt and by North, to North and by Eaſt.</p>
               <p>The 16th, It was a very ſerene Calm; But on</p>
               <p>The 17th, 18th, and 19th, We had nothing but very unconſtant Winds and Weather, and very dark Clouds all about us.</p>
               <p>The 20th and 21th, We ſaw neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars; from whence we concluded that we might expect a great Storm, and for fear of it we took in our Sails, and prepared our ſelves for it.</p>
               <p>The 22th, We had a ſmooth Gale of Wind at Weſt: Our Courſe being Northward, we ſaw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:100310:141"/>
Lightning, and heard much Thunder: I was Amazed that it laſted ſo long, and I enquired of our Maſter, and of ſome of the oldeſt Seamen, what could be the reaſon of it. They told me, That it was dark in that Country of <hi>Weſt-Kust</hi> ſix months together; that the Country afforded great ſtore of Pepper, and ſome Gold was to be found in the Mountains of it. For that Reaſon, the Dutch, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long War, had built there ſome Fortiſications, and kept Soldiers there, which hold it to this day. That the Europeans cannot bear the Climate long, it being very unhealthy; and unleſs they are fetch'd away within three years time, they generally Die. To prevent which, they ſend freſh Men thither every year. That thoſe that Die there are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken away ſuddenly, as they are Eating or Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Table. Their Food is Rice inſtead of Bread, Bufflars Fleſh, Beef and Pork, and Fiſh in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: Their Drink is <hi>Suri</hi> that comes from the Coco's, and Sugar-Beer, 3 or 4 years old, which they keep under Ground.</p>
               <p>The 23th, The Wind blew hard at Weſt. We ſaw an infinite number of Fiſhes, called <hi>Springers;</hi> their length is generally about 6 or 7 foot, and about as much in thickneſs. Their Fleſh is very firm; they Swim always againſt the Wind. When they Leap very high out of the Water (as they did then) the Seamen expect a very great Storm and Tempeſt. We catch'd ſeveral of 'em with a certain Inſtrument, which they call an <hi>Elle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaer,</hi> ſtriking it into their Bodies. This night the <hi>Polran</hi> parted from us, but we could not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was done deſignedly by the Maſter, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was by the Careleſſneſs of the Helms-Man, whoſe turn it was to Watch.</p>
               <p>The 24th, We were forced to take in our Main-Sail, by reaſon of the hard Wind, and defend our
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:100310:142"/>
Deck all over with pitch'd Canvas from the Waves that were ſo boiſterous, that they almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed our Ship.</p>
               <p>The 25th, 26th, 27th, and 28th, We had ſtormy Winds, but yet ſo tollerable, that we made 25 or 30 miles of our way in 24 hours.</p>
               <p>The 29th, The Wind increaſed. The <hi>Polsbroeck,</hi> which ſtill kept us Company, gave us a Signal, that ſhe was ſo full of Water, that ſhe ſtood in need of our help. When we came to be ſomewhat near, the Maſter told us, That his Pumps were good for nothing, and begg'd of us to lend him ſome of ours, which we did; for our Ship was ſo ſtrong and cloſe, that it receiv'd no Water, and we did not want'em our ſelves; but that night this Companion of ours loſt us too.</p>
               <p>The 30th, We took in all our Sails, and lower'd our Yards, and made our ſelves ready for a Drift; that is, to bind the Helm faſt, and commit our ſelves to the Winds and Waves to drive us where they pleaſed. This Drift we held out in, till</p>
               <p>The 4th of <hi>November,</hi> five days together. Upon Conſultation held, we cut down our Main-Maſt, which, with the force of its fall, was like to have ſunk our Ship. Till that day we had not taken the height of the Sun, ſo that we could not tell whither, or how far, we were caſt.</p>
               <p>The 5th, The Wind fell, and changed to the S. E. Then we hoiſted up our Sails, and took the height of the Sun, whereby we found that we were cloſe by the Equinoctial, and not caſt yet away ſo far as we were afraid we had been. We ſailed N. E. and by E. all this Voyage we had that kind of Birds flying about us, that live upon the flying Fiſhes; but upon the great Heat we were now come into, they left us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:100310:142"/>
The 6th, We had a brisk Wind, and from ſix in the morning to ſix at night we made 20 miles of our way, and found the next day, being</p>
               <p>The 7th, That we had paſs'd the Line. Two Soldiers and three Seamen died out of our Ship that day, and were thrown, after Prayers, into the Sea: And we had about 20 ſick.</p>
               <p>The 8th, The Wind changed to the South; and we were directly to go Northward. The Boatſwain's Mate catch'd a large Shark, in which they found four Boys, and ſome Bones of Men.</p>
               <p>The 9th, We ſaw a little Veſſel that made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; in the afternoon it came near to us, and we were big with the hopes of ſome News they brought, but they were all vain: For our <hi>Orlamen</hi> (as we call them that have been before in the <hi>Indies)</hi> ſpoke to them in the <hi>Malleyers, Amboineſes, Cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laiſh, Malabariſh,</hi> and <hi>Maldaviſh</hi> Languages, but neither would do; and they anſwer'd us in a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that none of us could tell what to make of; but they made us to underſtand by Signs, that they were in great want of Drink: Our Maſter had their Veſſel boarded, and in it we found 24 Indians, with long Hair ty'd up on the left ſide of their Heads. They had with them 12 Muskets, ſome Gun-Powder, and Iron-Balls; pretty good ſtore of Rice, Pepper, and dry'd Fiſh, but no Water. We ſuppoſed them to be ſome Indian Robbers come from the <hi>Weſt-Kust,</hi> and drove thus far into the Sea by the late Storm. Our Maſter order'd them to be taken into our Ship, together with their Proviſions, and we drew their Veſſel along after us, ty'd with a ſtrong Rope to our Ship. We allowed them Bread and Water, and we made them Pump the Water out of our Ship, and Swab it.</p>
               <p>The 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th, The Wind continued directly for us at South, we going on ſtill Northward.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:100310:143"/>
On the 14th, We changed our Courſe to the N. W. and by W. the Wind kept where it was, but ſomething weaker. This day one that ſate on the Foremaſt, holding by a Cord, the Cord broke, and he fell down Dead into the Ship.</p>
               <p>The 15th, We obſerved, that the Water begun to change colour; at night we uſed the Plummet to ſound the Water, but we could find no bottom, tho' the Line was 200 Fathoms long.</p>
               <p>The 16th, The Water changed yet more, and ſeemed whitiſh; we made our Anchors and Cables ready, if occaſion ſhould be, to uſe them.</p>
               <p>The 17th, Our Maſter promiſed ſix Rixdollars to the firſt Man that ſhould ſpy Land, and a Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon of Wine.</p>
               <p>The 18th, We had a lovely Wind and good Sailing. A Seaman that ſtood on the out-ſide of the Ship to draw up Water, was waſh'd of by a Wave. We immediately tack'd our Ship, and back'd our Sails, and threw out our Long-Boat to go and take him up; which they did, and in about two hours time brought him ſafe to us.</p>
               <p>The 19th, We had a very fair Wind and fine Weather. Two of our Seamen quarrel'd, and fell at laſt to their Knives, and wounded each other. As ſoon as the Maſter knew of it, he had 'em both Duck'd from the Main-maſt, as wilful Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the Laws of the Ship.</p>
               <p>The 20th, about 6 in morning, our Boatſwain, a very expert Seaman, climb'd up the Main-top-gallant-Maſt, which is the higheſt part of the Ship; no ſooner had he look'd about him, but he cry'd out aloud, Land, Land: The Maſter ask'd him, which way, and he told him to the North-Eaſt; ſtreight we changed our Courſe from North Weſt thither. The Helmſman threw out the Plummet, and found a ſandy bottom at 80 Fathoms. In the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:100310:143"/>
afternoon we got ſight of the high ſteep Mountain, call'd <hi>Adam's Pick,</hi> and by that we knew that this was the place we wanted to be at, <hi>viz.</hi> the Iſland <hi>Ceylon.</hi> Towards night we changed our Courſe again to the Eaſt, and ſometimes to the E. and by N. for we had no mind to be near Land that night, and we could not have reach'd the Road that day. In the firſt Watch, between 6 and 10, we could feel ground ſtill, but in the 2d and 3d we could not.</p>
               <p>The 21th, in the morning, at break of day, We chang'd our Courſe again, and went directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Land lying South-Eaſt of us, with the Wind at S. W. About 10 a Clock before Noon we ſaw the Ships that lay at Anchor upon the Road by the City of <hi>Columbo.</hi> In the mean while, the Wind veer'd four Points more to the W. and ſo much the fitter for us. About Noon, we felt a ſandy ground at 40 Fathoms, but we kept Sounding ſtill, till we were quite out of the deep, and in full ſight of the Land. This day every one had plenty enough of boil'd Rice, and the Water Veſſels were free to any body. We had ſuffer'd a great while Hunger and Thirſt, notwithſtanding that we had Courſe Diet enough, and above 40 Barrels of Dutch and Bata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Water. The Soldiers now begun to Equip themſelves, to make a ſhew at their Landing, and dreſs'd themſelves very ſine with great Joy and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Their Arms, which till then had been kept up in the Gunner's Room, were delivered to 'em, to go out Arm'd, as is uſual, to Shore.</p>
               <p>All our Flags were out till about three in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, when we caſt our Anchors, and found ſtill 12 Fathom Water. The Gunner was ordered to fire one Gun, and one Seaman was to ſtrike our Admiral's Main-maſt Flag before the City of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi> but immediately again to ſet it up. After this, we fired all our Guns, to which the Fort of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:100310:144"/>
                  <hi>Columbo</hi> anſwer'd with ſeven of their Cannon. The Governor of this City ſent two great Sloops of <hi>Ceylon</hi> to fetch us aſhore; in which our Lieutenant and Men went up to the Governor's Houſe, who welcomed us all very heartily, and gave all our Men three days liberty to refreſh themſelves after their hard Voyage. The diſtance between <hi>Columbo</hi> and <hi>Batavia</hi> is about 500 Dutch miles, which we had reach'd in 49 days, from the 3d of <hi>October</hi> to the 21th of <hi>November.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 22th, I went to Board with an old <hi>Cingulaiſh</hi> Woman, becauſe ſhe could ſpeak a little Dutch; and ſhe got her living by keeping a Houſe to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Dutch, of which ſhe had generally 20 or 30 in her Houſe. I paid 15 <hi>s.</hi> a Month, and 40 pound of black Rice. We had every one his own Diſh, ſerved up with Fleſh, Fiſh, Figs, and ſuch like Diet, twice every day, at 8 a Clock in the morning, and 4 in the afternoon. Our Houſe was only a Hut, made up of Boughs of Trees. And here I met with three of my old Acquaintance; who,</p>
               <p>On the 23th, took me Abroad to a very large Orchard, call'd <hi>Tang Salgato,</hi> where we drank ſome <hi>Sury</hi> freſh from the Coco-Trees. This was in the morning, and about noon we beſpoke a hot ſort of Liquor, called <hi>Maſſack,</hi> which is made in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner. They put into a Veſſel 8 Quarts of <hi>Suri,</hi> and to that, one Quart of <hi>Arack</hi> or Brandy. All this boil'd together, and about 20 or 25 Eggs are broke into't, which gives it ſubſtance, and a good colour. Then they add to all this ſome <hi>Kings Sugar,</hi> (which they get from ſome certain Trees there) and ſome Nutmeg, and Mace: All this came to half a Rixdollar. We had ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to wait upon us, which they call <hi>Bulliatoſes,</hi> who diverted us with various Leaping and Dancing. Their Ears are about a Span long, with Golden Pendants in them; They ſaw by my Dreſs, that I
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:100310:144"/>
was newly come from <hi>Europe;</hi> and I found they had a great mind to Converſe with me, but I not underſtanding them, made them underſtand by ſhaking my Head, that I did not Care for their Company.</p>
               <p>The 24th, We took a walk about two or three miles out of <hi>Columbo,</hi> to ſee ſome tame Elephants that were kept in Orchards there. And having ſeen them, we went into the Houſe which belong'd to a Portugueſe, who treated us very nobly; and at night had us home upon an Elephant of his. This day an Ambaſſador, named Myn Heer <hi>Bucquoi,</hi> was ſent from <hi>Ceylon,</hi> with a Lion, for a Preſent to the King of <hi>Candy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the 25th to the 30th, Our Men were daily Exerciſed, and at night our turn began to be upon the Guard, where my Poſt obliged me to be, till</p>
               <p>The 25th of <hi>April</hi> 1677. which was five months, in which time I learned the Cingulaiſh and Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe Languages, finding them not only uſeful, but neceſſary to thoſe that are to ſtay there.</p>
               <p>The 22th, I was ſent with 30 Soldiers to the Fort of <hi>Galture,</hi> 8 Leagues from <hi>Columbo,</hi> to have ſome new Ramparts added to it. Of this Fort I intend to ſpeak by and by, deſigning now to give an Account of the Cities, Inhabitants, Cattle, and Fruits of the Iſland <hi>Ceylon,</hi> as far as I could obſerve of them while I ſtaid there.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Deſcription of the Iſle of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> its Cities, Forts, and Inhabitants, which are chiefly of two ſorts. An Account of the King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Court, Officers, Counſellors, and his other Subjects: Their Cuſtoms, Manners, Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Houſes over-run with Fleas and Piſmires; Their manner of Eating and Trading. The King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s a Cruel Tyrant. The Cingulayans Cuſtoms in War; Their Arms and Exploits. The other Inhabitants of <hi>Ceylon</hi> are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labarians, who are Subjects of the Dutch: They Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Devil, Crocodiles, Serpents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Burials. The Dutch took <hi>Columbo,</hi> and other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Ceylon</hi> from the Portugueſes, and the King of <hi>Candi,</hi> tho' he had help'd them againſt the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes. The King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Reſentment of it to this very day. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nhealthy Climate of this Country.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Iſland <hi>Ceylon</hi> is about 200 Dutch miles in compaſs. It lies in the Indian Sea, not far from the Maldivian Iſlands, and the Wild Coaſts of <hi>Cormandel</hi> and <hi>Malabar.</hi> It was found out about 200 years ago by the Spaniards, who invaded the Kingdom of <hi>Cotta,</hi> which the City of <hi>Columbo</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to, in this following manner.</p>
               <p>They came with two Ships, and landed at the place, where now <hi>Columbo</hi> is: The Cingulaiſh King, being informed of it at <hi>Cotta,</hi> came out with an Army to meet them, but in vain; for his Men could not abide the ſmell of Gun-Powder. The Spaniards fell to Building ſome ſmall Fortifications, and to ſettle themſelves in the Country: As ſoon as they were able to get ſome Aſſiſtance, being well pleaſed with the Land and their Succeſs, they
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:100310:145"/>
carried on the VVar not only againſt the ſaid King of <hi>Cotta,</hi> ſo as to beat him out of the City where he reſided, and lay it waſte, (as it is now to this day, a place where the wild Elephants are catch'd) but in time reach'd farther; and at laſt, of ſeven Kings that had poſſeſſion of this Iſland, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed ſix. But the ſeventh, who reſided at <hi>Candi,</hi> in the middle of the Iſland, being vex'd to ſee with what Tyranny they uſed his Subjects, begun to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on a War very vigorouſly againſt them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually Plagues the Cities and Forts, which they had built on the Sea-ſide, and for about 20 miles into the Land. . How this Country fell from the Spaniards to the Portugueſes, and from the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſes to the Dutch, I will give an Account hereafter.</p>
               <p>Their chief Fortifications, are, the City and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Columbo;</hi> eight Leagues Eaſtward of that lies the Fort <hi>Negombo;</hi> 20 miles further, the Fort <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pintin;</hi> again, 22 miles from thence, another call'd <hi>Aripen;</hi> and between thoſe two, the <hi>Paerl-Bank,</hi> heretofore ſo famous: Six miles further, a very ſtrong Fort on the Iſland of <hi>Manara,</hi> very fruitful, and ſeven miles in compaſs. This Iſland of <hi>Manara</hi> is divided from <hi>Ceylon</hi> by an Arm of Salt-Water, about a Cannon-ſhot wide. <hi>Jaſnapaparnum,</hi> a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified City, lies 22 miles diſtant from <hi>Manara,</hi> and is ſecured with Baſtions, call'd by theſe Names, <hi>Pas-Piil, Pas-Beſchatter, Pas-Elephant,</hi> and <hi>Punt de Pedre.</hi> Six and thirty miles farther, is the Fort called <hi>Trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conamale,</hi> built by the Dutch againſt the French. This Fort the French had taken Poſſeſſion of; as alſo of the Bay, where Ships ride very ſafe, under the Command of Monſieur <hi>de la Haye,</hi> as Viceroy, till the Dutch drove them away again. There is another Fort call'd <hi>Battacolo</hi> 40 miles from that. Thence to <hi>Punt de Gala</hi> 30 miles. Thence to <hi>Alecan</hi> 11 miles. Thence to <hi>Galture</hi> 5 miles. Thence round back again to <hi>Columbo</hi> 6 miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:100310:146"/>
The Deſcription I have given here of theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Fortifications, makes the Circuit of this Iſland to be in all 206 miles.</p>
               <p>The Inland Fortifications, are; <hi>Maluane,</hi> 6 Leagues from <hi>Columbo; Hanguelli</hi> or <hi>Gourwebell,</hi> 2 Leagues from <hi>Malvane; Sittawaca</hi> 4 miles farther; <hi>Ruenell</hi> alſo 4 Leagues farther; <hi>Saffrigan</hi> and <hi>Bibliogam,</hi> 8 Leagues from <hi>Ruenell:</hi> And 12 Leagues on this ſide of <hi>Columbo,</hi> you have <hi>Anguradotten</hi> and <hi>Caudingellen,</hi> lying upon two Rivers that run out of the King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Country, very rich in precious Stones.</p>
               <p>The Iſland of <hi>Ceylon</hi> hath chiefly two ſorts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Thoſe of <hi>Columbo,</hi> from <hi>Columbo</hi> to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> are called <hi>Cinguleeſes</hi> or <hi>Cingulaians.</hi> They are very well ſhaped, part of a black, and part of a yellowiſh Complexion. The Men have long ſtreight Hair, and wear their Beards very large, like the Suiſſers. They are generally very Hairy upon their Breaſts, and they are very proud of it. They wear a piece of Linnen about their middle, from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel down to their Knees: But they make a very great diſtinction of their Apparel, according to their Dignity, and Quality.</p>
               <p>Their King dreſſeth himſelf as he pleaſes. His Cap is of Silk, wrought with Gold about a yard high, with a great Carbuncle before, and Rubies and Saphiires all round about it, and at the top a Bird of Paradiſe. His Shirt and Waſtcoat is made of the fineſt Cotton, with Golden Buttons, and he wears a Garment of colour'd Silk, that goes 4 or 5 times round his middle, and hangs down to his Knees. His Stockings are faſtned above his Knees with a ſtring, whereon is faſtned a ſilver Plate as large almoſt as a Trencher. His Shoes are only Leathern Soles with ſtrings, one of which comes up between his Toes, and the other comes round his Foot, and ties the Sole faſt to it: And all theſe ſtrings are ſet out with Saphires and Rubies. He
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:100310:146"/>
wears a Sword cloſe under his right Arm, tied to a Silk Ribbon: It is very heavy, being in a maſſy Silver Scabbard; it is made like a Hanger, and about a yard long; the Handle is ordered with fine precious Stones. On his left ſide, between his Shirt and his Waſtcoat, he wears a long Knife, beſides his Sword, inlaid with Gold and Jewels, and by that a ſharp Pen, (wherewith they write upon Leaves of Trees) in a Silver Sheath.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of his Council, called <hi>Piſare,</hi> and his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, may alſo wear Silk, Gold and Silver, but they are not permitted precious Stones for Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it is as much as their Lives are worth, to offer or pretend to wear any of 'em, tho' they are of little or no value; Nor do they dare ſo much as take up one of them when they find them any where; and the greateſt, as well as the meaneſt Perſons throughout all the Kingdom, are equally obliged to the Obſervation of this Cuſtom.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Corals,</hi> which are Governors over ſome one <hi>Coral</hi> or County, may wear Silk, but neither Sword nor Stockings. They wear a Staff tipt with Silver, with the King's Arms on it; they wear a ſort of Slipper or Shoe made of Wood, mighty neat, and very curiouſly wrought.</p>
               <p>Next to theſe <hi>Corals,</hi> the <hi>Apohami</hi> or Nobles are rank'd: They go dreſt as the <hi>Corals,</hi> excepting that they may not tie, like them, the Caps they wear on their Heads. Theſe are to be known, when they come into the City, by their having a Slave always behind them to carry a <hi>Talpot</hi> Leaf after them, which ſerves as an Umbrello when it Rains.</p>
               <p>The next in Rank are the Scriveners and Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, who Manure the Fields of Rice. They muſt wear nothing but Linnen, no Swords, Shooes, Stockings, nor Caps, only a Knife they may, and an Iron Pen. Their Wives, and thoſe of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Perſons may have their Garments from a
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:100310:147"/>
handful above the Navel down to the Ground; but nothing upwards, but a ſhort <hi>Bajuvan,</hi> as they Name it, which doth not come ſo low as to cover their Breaſts.</p>
               <p>After theſe, are the Handicrafts-Men, as Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters, Goldſmiths, Blackſmiths, Potters, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Burners of Chalk, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe and their Wives may wear a Linnen Garment from the middle downwards, and ſet out their Ears with Gold. After them are the <hi>Trivitors,</hi> who gather the Drink from the Trees and boyl the Sugar: <hi>Tſchallias</hi> that peel off the Cinnamon: The Fiſhermen and the <hi>Laſerins</hi> their Soldiers: <hi>Mainets</hi> their Waſhers: Borrowayen, their Drummers: Cubin, who are a ſort of People that will carry People where they pleaſe for Money: the meaneſt of all are the <hi>Batins</hi> and <hi>Zubies;</hi> Theſe may not lay them down upon the Ground, but muſt always have a Fan with them to lie in; Nor are they permitted to lie under any Roof. All their Women are obliged to go Naked all upwards upon pain of being whipt.</p>
               <p>To give you a Specimen of the <hi>Cingulaiſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they expreſs their numbers thus:</p>

               <p>But it is to be obſerved, That here are Diverſity of Dialects, as in the ſeveral Provinces of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and ſo the Inland Cingularians differ from the Borderers; which makes <hi>Rob. Knox</hi> in his Deſcription of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> give a different Account; and generally writes with an <hi>o,</hi> what I put down with an <hi>a;</hi> as <hi>Echoi, Dechoi, Tunhoi, Hutterhoi, Pauhhoi, Hoyhoi.</hi>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:100310:147"/>
Their Salutation is in theſe Words, <hi>Deo wardende Sacradende Neinde;</hi> and is anſwer'd with the ſame, both clapping their Hands to their Foreheads. <hi>Whither go you, Gaudi Januade. I don't know, Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wanetti. Fire, Genere. Water, Diwere.</hi> They write upon the Leaves of Sugar-Trees; when they read, it is with a very unpleaſant Accent, and very long Tone, as if they ſung. They write to each other on theſe Leaves, which are about an Ell long, and two Inches broad, and can fold them up ſo artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, that none can open them, without diſcovering that they have been open'd. They teach their Children to write upon the Sand or Ground with their Fingers. As to their Religion, they believe, That God, whom they call <hi>Deine,</hi> governs in Heaven, and that the Devil governs on Earth. Wherefore they Religiouſly ſerve him, giving him the Name of <hi>Jacie;</hi> and that not only by Offerings, and Songs in their Temples, but with Meetings in the Fields, under a ſort of Tree, which I cannot compare to any Tree ſo well as a Lime-Tree. There is a Wall built round it of about half a Man's height; Here they Dance, Leap, and Sing, to his Honour: He comes to them in their Dance, and gives them Anſwers to their Queſtions about things to Come: As whether it ſhall be a plentiful Year, dry, or wet, and other things of this kind. The Soothſayer too, that receives the Anſwer, hath great Honours paid him. But becauſe the Devil torments him too much, they are forced to carry him away home. They believe, That thoſe that Die are turn'd into a Bufflar, wherefore they give the Bufflars the name of <hi>Apetie,</hi> which ſignifies Father; and to the Cows, that of <hi>Amme,</hi> which ſignifies Mother.</p>
               <p>When the mean illiterate People (who cannot Read) have a Child Born, the Father Plants a young <hi>Jacken</hi> or <hi>Jager-Tree</hi> by his Houſe, by which he can reckon up the Child's Age. I have been at ſome of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:100310:148"/>
theſe Men's Houſes to Buy Goods, and happen'd to ask the Age of ſome of their Children that came about me, and they ſhew'd me a Tree, and told me, he was of the ſame Age with that. But they have there a Proverb, the curſed Alluſion of which they verifie in earneſt, which is, That it is fit a Man ſhould Eat the firſt Fruits of the Trees they Plant; ſo the Father always deflowers his Daughter as ſoon as ſhe is come of Age.</p>
               <p>They have a New-Year's Feſtival, which laſts ſix weeks, and begins about our <hi>Eaſter.</hi> In the firſt three weeks they waſh themſelves every day; the other three weeks they paſs away in Singing, and all kind of Mirth.</p>
               <p>Their dwelling Houſes are made according to the conveniency of the Country; ſome are near one another, after the manner of our Villages, which they call <hi>Aldeen.</hi> Others ſtand by themſelves upon ſome riſing Ground, to be ſecure from the Water, which ſometimes riſes very high, by reaſon of their great Rains: They are cover'd with Leaves of Trees. There is commonly but Room where they Eat and Lie, and another to Dreſs their Victuals in, which they beſmear every week with Bufflar's Greaſe, to free themſelves from Fleas and Piſmires. Their Money they generally Bury in a Pot under the Hearth, or ſometimes under the Devil's Tree, in the Field, where it is Sacred.</p>
               <p>Their Victuals is Rice boyl'd inſtead of Bread, and what they Eat with it, is made of all kinds of Herbs, Roots, Fruit, dry'd or freſh Fiſh, which they Boil with a deal of green Pepper, or elſe with the Milk that comes from the Coco-Nuts. Every one takes his ſhare of Rice upon a Fig-Leaf, (inſtead of a Plate) and takes his other Meat, and mixes it together with his Hand, and ſo Eats it.</p>
               <p>They waſh their Hands and Mouths very clean before and after Meals. They chaw <hi>Betel</hi> all day
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:100310:148"/>
which they prepare after this manner. They take one or two of the Leaves, about as broad as one's Hand, they call them <hi>Bular:</hi> They grow all round about, againſt Fruit-Trees, as Ivy does. Then they take ſome very fine Chalk, made of ſmall Muſſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhells burnt, and of it they ſcatter about as much as will lie on the top of a Knife over thoſe Leaves, and then rowl them up, and put into the middle a fourth part of an <hi>Arck,</hi> which is a Fruit like a Nutmeg; and to this Compoſition they give the Name of <hi>Betel,</hi> which they keep continually in their Mouth: And this is to prevent the Scurvy. They Smoak Tobacco too, not out of Pipes, but wound up in a dry Leaf.</p>
               <p>In their Trade, like other Nations, they love to Buy as cheap, and Sell as dear, as they can. They have no particular Traffick amongſt them, dealing almoſt all in the ſame Goods. One thing which ſeemed mighty ſtrange to me, was, That when I, or other Europeans came to Buy any ſuch things, as Butter, Pepper, Sugar, Honey, Figs, Fowls, Rice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ask'd them if they had any; they uſed to ſay <hi>Netti,</hi> which is to ſay, <hi>No.</hi> So that we were forced to give them very good Words, and inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate our ſelves into their favour, by giving their Children ſome Tobacco, or ſome little Trifle; Then they would ask their Children, even the ſmalleſt of 'em, whether they had beſt Sell any thing to theſe Perſons; and according to their Anſwer, they either ſold to us, or refuſed us, and would not have ſold us any thing without their Conſent, tho' we would have paid ten times the value of their Goods. When they had ſold us any thing, and received their full Price, they would beg of us, that we would give them ſome of it again, tho' at the ſame time they were well ſtock'd with the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:100310:149"/>
Theft, tho' but inconſiderable, is puniſhed with Death. All their King's Commands muſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually be obſerved upon Pain of Death; and that not of the Perſon only that hath Tranſgreſſed, but of his Kindred, to a third Generation. This King of <hi>Candi</hi> is a very cruel Tyrant. Some Europeans, that had been Priſoners at his Court for above 20 years, have told me, That he had order'd no leſs than 300 in ſome years, to be drawn in pieces with Elephants, for a very ſmall Fault, or ſometimes a meer Humour.</p>
               <p>We will now give you ſome Account of their Military Exploits and Diſcipline. They have a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which they call <hi>Diſſave;</hi> next to him ſome <hi>Saudis.</hi> Then the <hi>Araski,</hi> which are as Captains over 20 or 30 men each, with an Enſign. Their Artillery is only a ſort of Muskets, which ſtand upon a frame with three Feet, of which the hind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt is broad, and ſhorter than the two foremoſt: Having no Lead, they ſhoot with Iron Bullets. Theſe Muskets, the Nobility, which ſerve the King, carry with 'em in fights.</p>
               <p>They come into the Field, 30, 40, or 50000 ſtrong, all barefoot. Their Arms are a heavy Iron Cimiter about a yard long, and a light Half Pike. Few have Muskets or Fire-Locks; or if they have, they do little Execution with them; tho' they have never ſo much room to draw up, yet they never advance but in ſingle Ranks, for fear the Hollanders ſhould take too many of them off at once with their Field-Pieces. Their Drummers are very much deſpiſed, being taken out of a ſort of People, (tho' <hi>Cingulaians</hi> too) that live upon Bufflars Fleſh, and the Fleſh of any kind of Beaſts. They call them <hi>Borrowayen.</hi> They tie to their Body, two little ſorts of Drums call'd <hi>Tamelins;</hi> others have but one of 'em, but then it is bigger. They beat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Marches, with a great deal of Art, and the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:100310:149"/>
Soldiers underſtand them very well. They beat morning and night, but differently. Their Pipers uſe both a ſtraight and a crooked ſort of Pipe, and make pretty Muſick with them both together.</p>
               <p>Any Dutchmen, that are taken by theſe People, are never to be Ranſom'd at any Rate; but muſt remain amongſt them in great Slavery all the days of their Life; and all the ways are ſo ſtrictly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there is no eſcaping by any means. The Dutch that ſometimes deſert us, and go over to the King of <hi>Candi,</hi> are maintained in Neceſſaries, but are not truſted in any Employment.</p>
               <p>The other ſort of Inhabitants of this Iſland, are thoſe of <hi>Gala Batacolo, Trinconomala, Jafnapatnam, Manara, Aripen, Calpintin,</hi> as far as <hi>Negombo;</hi> and are called <hi>Malabars.</hi> Theſe are all very well ſhaped, and very black. They are all under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Hollanders, except thoſe of <hi>Wani,</hi> who have a King of their own. But he is obliged to pay to the <hi>East-India</hi> Company a yearly Tribute of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Elephants, and Money beſides.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Malabars</hi> come originally from the Wild Coaſt of <hi>Malabar,</hi> lying by <hi>Manara,</hi> and from the Kingdoms of the great <hi>Samerin, Calicut, Cananor,</hi> and others. They are all Infidels, and of different Opinions. Some of 'em, who are call'd <hi>Vitzliput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zli</hi> or <hi>Jooſie,</hi> Worſhip the Devil; others, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, a Crocodile, or an Elephant, and commonly what they pleaſe themſelves. They neither Eat the Fleſh of Bufflars, nor Swine. They hire old Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to Mourn over their Dead a whole night, and cry over the Corps all the time: <hi>Ajo aniate, ariate, inguwarre,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, Why did you Die, Come, come live again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then they Bury him, and leave the Hutt out of which the Man died, and build another. They are a little more Civil than the <hi>Cingulaians,</hi> and their Dreſs is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more comely. The Women never let them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:100310:150"/>
be ſeen uncovered by the Chriſtians. When they go abroad, they are all covered with white Linnen, and ſo cloſe, that they can but juſt ſee their way with the corner of one Eye: Their Arms and their Legs are all adorned with Silver Rings, and their Ears, about a Span long, with Gold: Their Fingers and Toes too are all richly ſet out with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Rings, moſt of Silver and Gold.</p>
               <p>Their Numbers are; 1 <hi>Onera,</hi> 2 <hi>Renda,</hi> 3 <hi>Muna,</hi> 4 <hi>Nala,</hi> 5 <hi>Anſe,</hi> 6 <hi>Ara,</hi> 7 <hi>Ola,</hi> 8 <hi>Orta,</hi> 9 <hi>Otta,</hi> 10 <hi>Padda,</hi> 11 <hi>Paddona,</hi> 12 <hi>Padda-renda,</hi> 13 <hi>Padda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muna,</hi> 14 <hi>Padda-nala,</hi> 15 <hi>Padda-anſe,</hi> &amp;c. The manner of their Salutation, is, Laying their Hand on their Forehead, and ſaying <hi>Damrian Amadran,</hi> which is returned the ſame way. They write like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe upon Leaves of Trees with an Iron-Pin, and make whole Books of 'em. We will now give you ſome Account, How the Hollanders came to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer this Country, and make themſelves Maſters of it.</p>
               <p>I have already told you, how it came to be in the Power of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and fortified by the Spaniards: It remained a great while in their Hands, till the Portugueſes Rebelling in <hi>Spain,</hi> choſe a King to themſelves, with whom all the Spaniards that were in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> joyn'd. And thus the King of <hi>Spain</hi> loſt all his Pretenſions in thoſe Countries, which was no ſmall loſs to him. The Portugueſes would be improving their Conqueſts, and try their Strength againſt the King of <hi>Candi,</hi> and thought by Fire and Sword, and their barbarous Slaughters and Murthers, to frighten him out of his Kingdom, but all in vain. For the King of <hi>Candi,</hi> finding himſelf in a great Extremity, call'd the Dutch to his Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; who together fell upon the Portugueſes, and became at length Maſters of all their Cities and Fortifications above-named. The laſt that was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by 'em, was the Capital City of <hi>Columbo,</hi> which is about 28 years ago.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="tcp:100310:150"/>
The King of <hi>Candi</hi> was now free, and had an Army of 50000 Men. The Dutch General on the other ſide, (call'd Min Heer <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ander Hulft)</hi> had an Army of 12 Companies of 80 Men each, together with a Fleet of 8 Ships. Both theſe, tho' the one a Heathen, and the other a Chriſtian, agreed very well together, put things into very good Order, and made a Treaty; That when the City of <hi>Columbo,</hi> both the old and the new, ſhould be taken, the King ſhould have the Old one for his Reſidence, and the Fort <hi>Negombo,</hi> lying 8 Leagues from thence, towards the Kingdom of <hi>Candi,</hi> in his full Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: The Dutch for their part ſhould have the new City of <hi>Columbo</hi> without any Moleſtation, with all the other Fortiſications they were already poſſeſt of; and beſides this, ſhould have Priviledge to Trade in any part of the Kingdom whatſoever with its Inhabitants.</p>
               <p>The City of <hi>Columbo</hi> being taken at laſt by the Dutch Admiral <hi>Ryclof <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>an Goens,</hi> (the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiou'd Heer <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ander Hulſt</hi> being ſhot Dead in the Trenches) and by the Aſſiſtance of the King's Forces, who did not ſuſpect any Falſhood after the Treaty made. The Heer <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>an Goens,</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd together the King's Army under pretence of giving them a Treat, and the Streets being filled with them, he ſets all his own Men upon them, (for what Reaſon I cannot tell) who cut the beſt part of them in pieces, and put the reſt to flight. The King, whom they thought to have taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, made his eſcape upon his Elephant, and got over high Mountains, Rocks, and Wilderneſſes, and at laſt into his Kingdom of <hi>Candi,</hi> where being ſecure, he ſwore never to forget the Falſhood and Treachery of the Chriſtians, but to continue in a perpetual War and Enmity againſt them.</p>

And in that he hath ſo conſtantly kept his Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that in theſe 28 years, he hath taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and put to Death ſome thouſands of them. Therefore this Iſland of <hi>Ceylon</hi> is not unjuſtly call'd the Dutch Soldier's Slaughter-Houſe; and when they are commanded thither, they reckon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves going to Execution. For the <hi>Cingulaiſh</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or Inhabitants are not the only Enemies they have there, but the Blood-Suckers, or Hedge-Hogs, which the Ground is cover'd with after a ſhow'r of Rain, will ſuck the Blood out of 'em: Beſides this, there are other Dangers; which are, Firſt, Being very often Pinch'd with Hunger; and then the Unwholſomneſs of the Air, by which thoſe that are not uſed to the Climate, fall into many Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Some are ſeized with a Stiffneſs in their Limbs, others with a Dizzineſs and Swimming of the Head, and cannot endure to look on the Light. Others are killed by the Bloody Flux; and with theſe Diſtempers, I have ſeen more Soldiers at one time in the Hoſpital than in the Garriſon: Beſides many others, who in purſuit of their Luſtful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, deſtroy themſelves by Venereal Diſtempers.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>I Come now to give a ſhort Account of the Wild and Tame Beaſts that are in this Iſland of <hi>Ceylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Among the Wild ones, I will ſpeak firſt of the Elephants. They are finer and more Docile than in other Countries. Therefore they catch a great many of 'em, which they make Tame, and fit for War, and ſend them to the Kingdoms of <hi>Perſia, Surrat,</hi> the <hi>Great Mogul,</hi> and ſeveral other places; and the Dutch themſelves make uſe of them in the Field.</p>
               <p>I have been very curious in Searching into the Nature, Diſpoſition, and Qualities of theſe Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants; and for that purpoſe converſed much with thoſe that Catch them, when they are young, and have my ſelf help'd to catch 'em. I have found in them all a great deal of Cunning, and a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, in which they ſeem to be almoſt Rational
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:100310:152"/>
Creatures. They never forget a Maſter's kind Uſage; but that of a rough and cruel one, they on the other ſide, never leave unrevenged. They never Couple together in the ſight of Men, but firſt they ſearch round about the Wilderneſs to ſee if no Body is there hidden in any Tree to ſpy 'em; and if they find any, woe be to them. The Male hath his Teſticles inwards, and the Female gives Suck between her fore Legs.</p>
               <p>When they are Catch'd and Tame'd, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Couple together. They carry their young ones ſeven years, and this has often been manifeſt by the Wild She-Elephants that have been taken, and kept in the Stables which they have for 'em at <hi>Gala,</hi> and have brought forth their young at ſeven years end, after they were catcht. The young ones are, at firſt, about the bigneſs of a Calf half a year old. They feed on Graſs, Figs, Leaves, and Coco-Nuts, Rice, and other Fruits, and Bread if one gives it them. This they reach and hold faſte with the end of their Trunk, and then thruſt it into their Mouths. Before they Eat any Graſs, they throw it and toſs it about, to ſhake out the Piſmires, by which they are mightily tormented ſometimes. If theſe little Animals chance to get in their Trunk, they walk about there and tickle them intolerably.</p>
               <p>Tho' they have no Hair, except on the Tail and Ears, yet they Swim very well. They'll live above 200 years, as has been ſeen in ſome whoſe Age has been deſignedly mark'd. They go together in the Woods ſome 8, 10, or 20 in a Company. They have a ſort of King, or Maſter-Elephant, which they follow; the young ones go in the middle. In the day time, they keep on the Mountains in the ſhade, but towards the Dusk of the evening, they repair to the Meadows and Water-ſide. They break their way through the Boughs and Buſhes with their Trunk; ſo that by the Noiſe they make, one may
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:100310:152"/>
hear them coming a Mile off. Then the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the Keepers of the Fields, cry out to one another for help, to keep them out of their Grounds, where they deſtroy all when they come. They holloe firſt, <hi>Hu, Hu,</hi> and then they cry for help, <hi>Alia innuwate, The Elephants are a coming:</hi> Therefore, when they come near their Hutts, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, or Fields, they light Torches, which they have on purpoſe made of long dry Wood, and with this they drive them away, making a great deal of Shouting and Noiſe. Thoſe that watch the Fields of Rice, ſit and ſing all night in a little Hutt raiſed upon four Poſts; and when they hear the Elephants coming, they holloe and light their Torches.</p>
               <p>There is two different ways of Catching the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. Among the <hi>Malabars,</hi> from <hi>Trinconomala</hi> to <hi>Batacale:</hi> There are ſome that Worſhip the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, by whoſe help they Charm theſe Creatures, after having Sacrificed to him a Cock for an Offering. After they have Caught 'em with their Hands, they tie them with ſtrong Thongs of Bufflar's Leather, and Tame 'em: But neither the <hi>Perſians,</hi> nor the <hi>Moors,</hi> care to Buy thoſe that are catch'd this way.</p>
               <p>The other way of Catching them, is in a Pound prepared for that purpoſe, as I have ſeen one in the Kingdom of <hi>Cotta,</hi> two Leagues from <hi>Columbo,</hi> near the <hi>Aldee</hi> or Village <hi>Battalamuda:</hi> And I have been my ſelf at the Catching of 50 of them, young and old; which is done thus.</p>
               <p>When the Inhabitants have notice where they are, and what place they frequent moſt, the Governour of <hi>Columbo</hi> gives a general Order for a Hunting Day; on which every body high and low, even the Nobles themſelves, meet at the appointed place: Beſides this, the Governour takes all the Soldiers, Drums, and Burghers, along with him; being all met, they ſpread themſelves in a Wing a League or two long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:100310:153"/>
Thus they go holloing and ſhooting along the whole day, thro' Woods and over Mountains: At Night they reſt, and for fear the Elephants ſhould get out back again, they light Fires all along about a Stone's throw from each other, which the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants are very much afraid of. The next day they go on again, and draw the Elephant's into a narrower compaſs. If any of 'em offer to go back, and break through, they fright them with Drums, and ſhooting and holloing. If one of them ſhould chance to break through, all the reſt would inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably follow. When all the Hunters have in 3 or 4 weeks time ranged over 20 or 30 miles Ground, theſe Wild Elephants are at length, by the means of Tame ones that ſerve to decoy them drove into the Pound, which we mention'd above. Then they tie a Wild one to a Tame one, or if it is a very luſty one, between two. Then they make 'em ſo Tame by giving them neither Meat nor Drink, that with a certain Inſtrument they uſe, a Child may manage them. Notwithſtanding there are ſome which they can never Maſter, and thoſe they turn out again to Breed and Increaſe.</p>
               <p>The Eaſt-Indian Kings and Merchants buy the Elephants by their height, which they meaſure to an Inch (as we do Horſes here) from the Ground to the ridge of the Back. According to their height, they are worth 7, 8, 900 or 1000 Rixdol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. Sometimes they Buy them (when they are of an extraordinary vaſt Bulk) for ſhew. Otherwiſe they uſe 'em in War, and to draw the Baggage, and great Artillery. The <hi>Great Mogul</hi> hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently with him 4 or 500 in the Field; And we uſed them in all Expeditions: Each Company had an Elephant, as we ſhall tell more largely hereafter.</p>
               <p>The two Teeth that ſtick bending ſo long out of their Mouth, are ſufficiently known by the Name of Elephant's Teeth. The Fleſh of Elephants is
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:100310:153"/>
not fit to Eat, and their Hides are made no uſe of, by reaſon of their wanting Men to dreſs and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them. They are extream thick. The Fleſh is Spungy, and Rotts in two or three days. The Hair that grows upon the Tail they hold very good againſt the Cramp, and as an approved Remedy they wear it made up in Rings on their Fingers.</p>
               <p>When they are to draw a Load, they go ſide long and look ſteadily upon the Waggon, to ſee that no Body lays any thing more upon't than what is uſual; and if one doth, they will not wag a foot further till it be taken off again: But what is more ſtrange then that, is, what I have often ſeen at <hi>Columbo</hi> and <hi>Jafnapatnam,</hi> That theſe Elephants when they were drawing a Load of Stones for the Fortifications, would ſtand ſtock ſtill at 11 a Clock, which is the Dinner time allowed to all the Slaves and Workmen, and would not draw an Inch further, tho' they were juſt at the place, and the Drivers encouraged 'em never ſo much.</p>
               <p>There is great ſtore of Bufflars in <hi>Ceylon,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in and about <hi>Calpintin.</hi> They are about the bigneſs of a Podolian or Hungarian Ox, but ſtronger. Their Horns are about two yards long: They are of an aſh-colour. In the day time they lie in the Water up to their Noſe, and at night they come to Graze in the Meadows. Their Fleſh is Eatable, when it hath lain 2 or 3 days in Salt; but very hot, and gives the Bloody-Flux to moſt People that Eat of it. They are very dangerous to go near, eſpecially to the Europeans, and chiefly if they have any young ones by them.</p>
               <p>Tygers are here alſo in abundance, and very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to Man and Beaſt, and particularly to Stags and Deer. They are about the bigneſs of a large Aſs, but ſomething longer; they are ſpotted with yellowiſh and whitiſh ſpots, and in their Make ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly like a Cat. Their Fleſh is white, and many
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:100310:154"/>
People Eat of it. Their Skins ſerve to make Belts, Holſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and are much uſed for covering of Trunks and Boxes. They have ſo much of the Scent of Musk, that the Huntſmen, if they take the Wind right, will ſind them out by it, and ſo in their purſuit of other Beaſts, avoid them.</p>
               <p>Bears are likewiſe found here in ſeveral Parts, and are dangerous Creatures: Yet they are not ſo much fear'd here, as the Wolves are in <hi>Germany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Jackalls are of ſhape and bigneſs like a Fox, only a ſharper Snout: They keep all day in their Dens, and at night they gather together a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them or more, and come to the outſide of the City of <hi>Columbo,</hi> in queſt of Dead Bodies, and fall ſometimes upon a Man, if they chance to find him aſleep.</p>
               <p>There is a ſort of Creature here, that is not very well known, becauſe it is rare; it is called <hi>Bitſche Vergunie,</hi> and by the Dutch, <hi>The Devil of Negombo,</hi> which Name they have given it, becauſe of its Qualities, as I am going to tell you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are moſt frequently about <hi>Negombo.</hi> It is about a yard high, and three yards long. It hath a ſharp Snout, and very ſharp Teeth. The Body is as it were Harnaſs'd over with thick round yellow Shells. When it is purſued, it can winde it ſelf up into a Ball. At night it makes ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal frightful Noiſe, that it hath often ſcar'd the Centinels from their Poſts.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lewer</hi> is another, called by the Dutch, <hi>Luiſte Dier;</hi> i. e. Slow-Beaſt. Theſe Beaſts are made like an Ape, with Hands and Feet, look very ghaſtly, and as lean as a Skeleton, wonderful ſlow in their Eating, Drinking, and Going; tho' Dogs, or any Wild Beaſts come towards 'em, they will not haſten their pace in the leaſt; and when they come near 'em, they turn themſelves to 'em, and with their glaring Eyes, fright away the fierceſt Dog that
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:100310:154"/>
can be. Their Eyes ſtand quite out of their Heads, and appear very terrible: When Men come after 'em, they do the ſame: But it hath not the ſame Effect, for Men have a Snare, which they clap on their hinder parts, and ſo catch them as they do Monkies. After they are catch'd, they are ſtill ſlow as before, and would not go above a League in a day, if one left 'em to themſelves. They are kept in Cities for a Rarity, but they are too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to tranſport into other Countries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wandura</hi> or Apes are here in abundance; they are black, excepting a whitiſh Ring about the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part of the Body, and a great gray Beard, which makes them look very much like ſome of the Old Cingulayans. They are about the bigneſs of a Maſtiff, and have a very long Tail. They skip about the Woods from Tree to Tree, making a great noiſe, their young ones hanging all the while about 'em. If you ſhoot 'em, the young ones fall with 'em, and then you take 'em off to keep and breed up: But this is not a true kind of Ape for keeping, ſo that few People take the trouble to Catch them; for they do not take any thing that's taught 'em, as others will. If a ſhot wounds them ſo as to fetch out a part of their Guts, they work out the reſt with both their Hands, (if I may ſo call 'em) and ſo fall down. Thoſe that are Catch'd will never Couple together, tho' one keeps them ever ſo long.</p>
               <p>Wild-Cats; there are of two ſorts: One of which is as large as our common Houſe-Cats, and live upon all ſorts of Fowl. The other is as ſmall as our Squirrels, and are called Suri-Cats; becauſe they keep about the Coco-Trees, whence the <hi>Suri</hi> comes. Their Hair is of a grey colour; and they make a noiſe like a young Turkey.</p>
               <p>Stags are bigger than the Stags in <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Deer, are ſomewhat leſs, and full of white ſpots.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:100310:155"/>
Wild-Goats are a little bigger than our Hares.</p>
               <p>The Hares leſs than with us.</p>
               <p>Wild-Boars here as in <hi>Africa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe are in vaſt numbers, becauſe but few People Hunt 'em; there being ſo great a quantity of Wild-Beaſts there that are better.</p>
               <p>Wild-Horſes are very plentyful in the Iſle of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nara,</hi> and not far from thence in another Iſle towards <hi>Jafnapatnam;</hi> but they are leſs than our Horſes in <hi>Holland.</hi> Sometimes they catch ſome of the fineſt of 'em, which they Break for the Saddle, or elſe they uſe 'em for Carts and Waggons.</p>
               <p>Among the Tame Beaſts and Cattle, Oxen and Cows are in ſo great plenty, that one of 'em is not worth above two or three Gulders.</p>
               <p>Bufflars are in abundance; the Country Fellows uſe them in their Rice-Fields: One of them is worth three or four Gulders.</p>
               <p>Three ſorts of Sheep there are amongſt 'em; one which comes out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> which for Wool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are like thoſe in <hi>Holland,</hi> excepting that their Tails are ſo vaſtly big, that ſome of 'em will weigh 20 or 25 Pound: Another ſort comes out of <hi>Africa,</hi> with Horns about a Span long, but no Wool, only Hair like Calves: A third ſort hath Wool like the firſt, but very long Ears.</p>
               <p>Goats are in good ſtore here, and Swine, ſuch as in <hi>Holland.</hi> One of the biggeſt and fatteſt in the Iſland <hi>Manara</hi> is not worth above a Rixdollar.</p>
               <p>Now for the Wild-Fowl. There are Peacocks of the ſame colour as here; and beſides thoſe, there are many as white as Swans.</p>
               <p>Wild-Cocks and Hens are about the bigneſs of ours.</p>
               <p>Water-Fowl, Snipes, Stock-Doves, and others. Two ſort of Herons, one of 'em bluiſh, the other half black. Geeſe and Ducks in great numbers. I will not make any mention of their ſmall Birds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:100310:155"/>
I will only give you ſome Account of the Parrots, which are here of three ſorts. The largeſt are of a green colour, mixt with blue and red, with a black Ring round the Neck, and are accounted the beſt. A leſſer ſize there is, all green, with a red Ring round the Neck, which is but little valued; and a leſs than that which is leſs eſteemed too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the leaſt docile. They Eat Rice and Figs. They are beſt to be taught when they are young. They are tied to a Cord or Chain, and morning and night, while it is duskiſh, one talks to 'em half an hour or thereabouts, till they get 'em at laſt to ſpeak any thing after them.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a great many Birds of Prey; as Falcons, Hawks, and Ravens, with a white Ring about their Neck.</p>
               <p>Batts are of two ſorts; the one ſmall as ours here, that fly by night; and the other as big as thoſe I have ſpoken of in <hi>Java.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is another ſort of Bird, which is call'd, a <hi>Navi,</hi> (becauſe it makes a noiſe which ſounds like that word) which when the Portugueſes hear, they expect the arrival of ſome Ships in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>They have but few Geeſe, except ſuch as are brought hither from the <hi>Cape of Good Hope;</hi> they have a Bunch growing on their Bill: They coſt a Rixdollar a-piece.</p>
               <p>Other Tame Fowl is there in ſuch plenty, that one may Buy a Pullet for a Peny, and 40, 50, or 60 Eggs for the ſame price. Ducks that lay 200 or 300 Eggs after one another, without one days inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, will coſt but Two Pence or Two Pence half peny. Many keep Pigeons likewiſe, which come from <hi>Holland,</hi> which they Buy for 10 d. a pair.</p>
               <p>Among the four-footed Animals, in the Rivers; There is the Crocodile which devours many Men that live near them, as they are Fiſhing, Waſhing, or Bathing themſelves, if they do not take an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:100310:156"/>
Care: But I will in ſhort deſcribe ſomething of the Nature of them.</p>
               <p>The Crocodile is not ſo very furious as ſome Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple imagine. He ſeeks his Prey alone; but when he is hungry, he Devours any living thing he can Eat, whether Man, Fiſh, Beaſt, Dogs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhews him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf commonly, and ſwims any part of the day at the top of the Water, like a piece of Timber. He ſets open his Mouth for a certain Bird to pick his Teeth with his Bill, which is about the length of one's Finger. At night he comes upon Land to ſeek out for Meat. Theſe Animals lay their Eggs upon the bare Sand, and leave the Sun to produce the young ones out of 'em, who as ſoon as they come out, are about half a yard long; The Egg it ſelf is about twice as big as that of a Gooſe. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually keep growing as long as they live, and come to be ſome 20, ſome 25, ſome 30 foot long: The Body is armed all over with a thick Scale: Their Teeth are exceeding ſharp; and ſo much ſtrength is in their Tail, that they'll kill any Fiſh or other Animal with a blow of it. Upon Land they can run faſter than moſt Men; but in a ſhort turning, a Man may have the Advantage of 'em, becauſe they muſt take a great compaſs; and being ſo long and thick, without any bending in their Backs, they are forced to take a large turn, which affords a Man fair time to eſcape out of their reach.</p>
               <p>Here is another ſort of Beaſt, much like the Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codile, which is call'd a <hi>Caprigoy;</hi> but it hath nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Shells, nor Scales on it, and its Tongue is very long and pointed. The longeſt I ever ſaw of theſe was not above ten foot.</p>
               <p>Another not much unlike this, but leſs yet, call'd a <hi>Leguwan,</hi> the Fleſh of which many People Eat.</p>
               <p>Now of Serpents there are ſeveral ſorts; one of 'em is called <hi>Worgers,</hi> they are 10 or 15 foot long. They will ſeize a Man, and claſp themſelves round
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:100310:156"/>
about him, and ſqueeze him ſo that he can't Breath, and falls down Dead: And to be arm'd againſt theſe, no Man goes abroad without a good Knife about him, to cut them in two, which makes them let go their hold quickly.</p>
               <p>Another ſort, which is called, <hi>Chapel-Snakes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they keep in Chapels or Churches, and ſometimes in Houſes; Theſe are very miſchievous and venomous, and without a timely Antidote, they who are bit by them, die Infallibly. They are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly from 4 to 6 foot long; and they have a ſort of Bladder, or ſpot of white, which ſhews it ſelf on the top of their Head when they are vex'd.</p>
               <p>There is another ſort of 'em, which they call <hi>Rat-Catchers,</hi> which are not ſo dangerous. They live all in Houſes, and deſtroy the Rats and Mice as much as any Cats would. They are nine or ten foot long, and will never hurt any Body unleſs one Angers them.</p>
               <p>The Green Serpents keep upon the Trees, and when any Man or Beaſt comes near them, they dart themſelves upon them, and with their ſharp Tongues endeavour to put out their Eyes. They are about two yards long. The moſt poiſonous of all, are, the two headed ones, which have a Head at each end.</p>
               <p>Here are two ſorts of Remedies againſt the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of thoſe Animals: The one, which the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants uſe frequently, is Witchcraft: The other, which I have often uſed, is a Serpent-Stone. This Stone is laid upon the Wound, and it ſticks to it, till it hath drawn to it ſelf all the Venom out of it. When it is come off, it is thrown into new Milk, which fetcheth all the Poiſon out of the Stone, and grows black and blue with it: Then the Stone is applied afreſh to the Wound, and if there be any Poiſon remaining, it ſticks on, if not, it falls off, and the Perſon is ſecure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:100310:157"/>
I have ſeen many Scorpions here as big as a common Crab, but their Stings are not dangerous, and cauſe only a ſmarting for two days, and never prove mortal.</p>
               <p>The Hundred-Feet called by the Portugueſes <hi>Cente-Pe,</hi> becauſe it hath a Hundred-Feet, is about half a yard long, and hath two Horns wherewith it Pinches. It is ſo full of Venom, that it is all over of a blew and yellow colour with it; if one is pinched by 'em, it may prove very dangerous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the cruel Smart it cauſes, unleſs the place is anointed quickly with Oil of Coco's.</p>
               <p>There are three ſorts of Piſmires, red, black, and white. The firſt are the biggeſt, and rid the Houſes of other Vermine, as Rats, Mice, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. The black keep in the Fields; if they touch a Man's Skin, they make it Smart for about half an hour. The white ones live amongſt Houſhold Goods; they Eat through Cheſts and Trunks, and damage Cloaths and Linnen very much.</p>
               <p>Fleas are here in Shoals, ſo that Men could not have any reſt, if they did not beſmear all their Houſes with Cow-Dung, to keep them away.</p>
               <p>The Air is full of little Flies and Gnats; and in ſome places People cannot Eat for 'em, but are forced to ſtay till night when they are ſettled.</p>
               <p>Blood-Suckers, or Leeches, are the worſt Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on the Iſland: They are moſt towards the North between <hi>Candi</hi> and <hi>Columbo.</hi> There are of two ſorts of 'em, the great and the ſmall; The firſt are the common Plagues of Bufflers: The other of Men. They keep in the Water, and are made much like our Hedge-Hogs. When any Man or Beaſt goes into the Water, they hang upon him till they have ſuckt their fill, and ſwell three times as big as they were at firſt, then they fall off. If one goes to ſtrike them off, immediately they break off and leave the Head in the Fleſh, which makes the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:100310:157"/>
Wound the more dangerous: But the beſt way to deal with 'em is to have ſome green Lemons with one, or good Vinegar and Salt or Salt-Petre, and wet them with it, and they fall off immediately.</p>
               <p>The ſmall ſort are about the bigneſs of a Straw, and about three Inches in length, and of a brown colour. They have neither Eyes nor Feet. In dry Weather they are ſeldom to be ſeen; but after ſome Rain, they fill the Ways and Shrubs. They do not creep as Worms do, but raiſe themſelves up an end, and throw themſelves upwards. If they lay hold of a Man they are not eaſily got off again, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great danger. Some <hi>Cingulayans</hi> ſay, That theſe things were firſt brought over into this Country by the contrivance of one <hi>Lamammea,</hi> one of the Kings of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Siſter, (whoſe Brother the Portugueſes had taken away by violence) to be a Plague to them, but how much truth there is in the Story, I leave the Reader to judge.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the Sea-Fiſh commonly catch'd here, I place the Sword-Fiſh; it is from 8 to 12 foot in length: It is called by that Name from a ſort of Sword it hath upon his Noſe, which is like a Saw, with about 50 Teeth about the bigneſs of one's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The biggeſt of thoſe Swords that I ever ſaw was an Ell long. The Fleſh of this Fiſh is fit to Eat, but the younger the Fiſh is, the better. Theſe Sword-Fiſhes are not of that ſort which are ſo great Enemies to Whales, for they never come ſo far into the North, it being too Cold for them there: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, thoſe that ſight with the Whales have their Sword on their Back, and keep about <hi>Greenland</hi> and <hi>Yſland</hi> in vaſt numbers.</p>
               <p>Sharks are right Sea-Wolves, and devour the Men they can catch, but they are often catch'd and devour'd themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Sail-Fiſh, ſo called, becauſe it hath a large Finn, which ſtands upon the Back of it above Water,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:100310:158"/>
and lets the Wind drive it forwards; hath a ſharp long Head of about an Ell long, and his Body is twice as long again: tho' its Fleſh is but courſe, yet a great many People Eat it.</p>
               <p>There is a Fiſh which they call <hi>Oan-Egbertſen</hi> half an Ell long, and very full of Blood. They are in ſo great plenty, that they pull up 7, 8, or 900 at one Draught. The great time of Fiſhing for 'em is in <hi>February,</hi> at which time not the Fiſh only is very cheap, but all ſorts of Meat and other Victuals are at very low Rates.</p>
               <p>The St. <hi>Peter's Fiſh,</hi> or <hi>Five Finger-Fiſh,</hi> is called by ſome the <hi>Leather-Fiſh,</hi> by reaſon of the thickneſs of his Skin; Hath five white ſtreaks on the Back in the ſhape of a Man's Fingers; it is about two yards in length, and very good to Eat: It is moſt in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in <hi>March,</hi> and then they catch likely 2 or 300 of them at once. The old Portugueſes will tell you that this mark on the Back came by St. <hi>Peter,</hi> who drew up one of them in his Net, and left the figure of his Fingers upon it. But this I leave the Reader to believe at Diſcretion.</p>
               <p>Jacks are here of the ſame kind as in <hi>Holland,</hi> one, two, or three yards in length, and are to be catch'd with Angles in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King's Fiſh is the beſt ſort that is here, and is ſomething like our Carps.</p>
               <p>Cablins are like our Herrings, but a little broader, there is vaſt plenty of 'em, and one Buys 10 or 20, ſometimes 40, for a Peny.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sertin</hi> is a ſmall lean Fiſh. They catch ſome thouſands of them at one Draught, becauſe they go together in Shoals.</p>
               <p>Sea-Swine or Sea-Hogs, are catcht here in great numbers; their length is five or ſix yards, and half that about: They have a ſharp Snout like ordinary Hogs; The Fleſh of 'em is very fat, and the Blood very hot: In the Water they out-ſwim all other Fiſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:100310:158"/>
Sea-Devils or Sand-Creepers are 5 or 6 yards long, with a frightful Head, very broad, but not thick, black at top, and white underneath. There is much difficulty in catching of 'em with Angles, becauſe they lie 15 or 20 Fathoms deep.</p>
               <p>Scaits are round and flat: Have their Eyes in their Body, and a thin flat Tail about two Yards long; they are very good to Eat.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Piil-Staert,</hi> as they call it, (which ſigniſies <hi>Arrow-Tail)</hi> is much like it; it is as good to Eat too: But the Tail is of that Nature, that if he wounds a Man with it, 'tis mortal to him: Wherefore great Care is taken to cut that off as ſoon as they have catch'd 'em.</p>
               <p>Tortoiſes, are catch'd here of 200 pound weight. They lay their Eggs on the Sand, 200 at a time, and leave them to the Sun to hatch; they have no Shell, only are cover'd with a Tough Skin. When they come upon Land, the Indians turn them over on their Backs, from which they cannot riſe again, having not the command of their Legs. When they have them thus, three or four Men carry them to Market, and there cut them out. The Shells of theſe very large ones are not uſeful, but the ſmall ones are of great uſe for inlaid Work, Combs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sea-Crabs, and Sea-Lobſters: Theſe are here a Yard long, with large Claws; and the other round with a very hard Shell.</p>
               <p>Sea-Lice, are made like Lice, cover'd over with a white Shell, about the bigneſs of a Walnut. They keep in the wet Sand on the Shore, and are Eaten only by the <hi>Malabarian</hi> Fiſhermen.</p>
               <p>Muſcles ſtick to the Rocks, and when the Sea is at Ebb, they pick them up.</p>
               <p>The manner of Fiſhing, which the <hi>Malabarians</hi> uſe, is much like ours. Their Nets are exceeding long, ſo as to reach about half a mile in compaſs,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:100310:159"/>
and are buoy'd up with Wood inſtead of Cork; and in the middle of it, which comes laſt to ſhore, they have a great Bag, into which the Fiſh is all driven.</p>
               <p>Freſh River-Fiſh are theſe: The St. <hi>Pilang,</hi> a Fiſh with a broad Head, as ſmooth as an Eel, about a yard long, and two Spans about. The <hi>Bald-Head</hi> is a better ſort of Fiſh, all Scaly like a Carp, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Head; weighs generally 7 or 8 pound. A Fiſh called a <hi>Fool,</hi> becauſe whoever Eats any thing of the Head, becomes ſtupid: Wherefore the Head is always thrown away, the reſt is very good to Eat. The <hi>Pager</hi> is a black Fiſh, with a hard thick Head; its Body is round, with very ſharp Finns.

               <head>CHAP. VI.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The Year in <hi>Ceylon</hi> is divided into two Seaſons only. Great Floods there during one of the Seaſons. An Account of <hi>Caudingelle,</hi> a Fort built and forſaken by the <hi>Dutch;</hi> much annoyed by the King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Men. The Author is ordered to <hi>Anguratot;</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of that Place; how the <hi>Europeans</hi> live there with <hi>Cingulaiſh</hi> Women. He goes back to <hi>Columbo;</hi> one of the Boats is loſt by the way. He lives a while there with one of the Council. Is ſent to <hi>Malvane,</hi> an unhealthy Place, which the King of <hi>Candi</hi> Beſieges with <hi>30000</hi> Men, but his General comes over to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Candi</hi> runs away from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi> where he had been kept a long while, and for what Reaſon. The Author with two Companies of Voluntiers are ſent out, and in their March ſuffered much Thirſt, and went all Bare-foot. They come to <hi>Calpintin, Aripen, Manaca, Jafnapatnam;</hi> all which Places he gives a Deſcription of. Then he goes to <hi>Porto Novo,</hi> where he hath two Arrows ſhot in him. He goes back to <hi>Columbo,</hi> where he is Cured.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE whole Year is divided into two Seaſons only, call'd the <hi>good</hi> and the <hi>bad</hi> Seaſon. Each of them conſiſts of five Months; the other two are call'd the Dubious Months, being <hi>March</hi> and <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> in which are the two <hi>Solſtices,</hi> on the <hi>12th</hi> Old Stile, or <hi>22d</hi> New Stile, of each of thoſe Months.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>March,</hi> the Rains begin to fall on that ſide on which <hi>Columbo</hi> is Situated, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue moſt commonly to the Month of <hi>September;</hi> ſo that all the Rivers overflow the Countries in ſuch a manner, that the People, Cattle and Wild-Beaſts
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:100310:160"/>
are ſurrounded on a ſudden, and carried away by the Water-floods. Thoſe that delight in Hunting, may find great quantities of Beaſts forced up into the Mountains at that time.</p>
               <p>In <hi>September</hi> it begins to hold up, and the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is much like what we uſe to have in <hi>April,</hi> in <hi>Holland:</hi> Then the Sun-beams come to be ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hot, that it dries up ſometimes Navigable Rivers, and then the Wild-Beaſts are forced to run a vaſt way to get Water.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>good Seaſon</hi> (as they term it) Thunder and Lightning are very frequent, and to that degree, that many huge Trees are ſplit and rent to pieces with it. The <hi>Sun</hi> doth not move far from this Place, wherefore little notice can be taken of the lengthning or ſhortning of the Days: Nor is it ever very cold here; only when the North Wind begins to blow in <hi>February,</hi> and which holds on for about four Months, one may bear a cotton Garment on. In this Seaſon, the Fiſhermen have ſeldom the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Fiſhing, by reaſon of the roughneſs of the Sea. Whilſt the <hi>good</hi> Seaſon is on that ſide of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo,</hi> the other ſide towards <hi>Cormandel, Jafnapatnam, Manara, Batacolo, &amp;c.</hi> have the <hi>bad</hi> with them, which is not a little ſtrange, conſidering that they are not far from one another.</p>
               <p>I was upon Duty in the Fort <hi>Galture,</hi> where our Men work'd by Day on the Fortifications, and at Night ſtood Sentinels, (the Night laſting but two Hours) from the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>April</hi> 1677, till the laſt of <hi>September</hi> of the ſame Year. Our head Officer there was a Lieutenant, one <hi>Adam Slecht,</hi> a <hi>Bohemian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the <hi>1ſt</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> we were order'd by our Governor to march to a Forlorn Fort, call'd <hi>Candin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelle,</hi> ſix Leagues from <hi>Galture,</hi> with 40 <hi>Europeans,</hi> and 200 <hi>Laſcarins,</hi> or <hi>Cingulaiſh</hi> Soldiers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:100310:160"/>
A very hard Storm fell upon us in the way, which ſo ſwelled the Waters about us, that we were forced to wade with our Cloaths tuck'd up, and we were not a little plagued with the <hi>Blood-ſuckers.</hi> We found the ſaid Fort overgrown with Trees and Shrubs, and no Inhabitants within two Leagues of it; they were all retir'd up into the high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, becauſe thoſe of <hi>Candi</hi> continually made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions upon that ſide of the Country, Spoiling, Burning and Deſtroying all they came near. The Hollanders had built this Fort ſome Years ſince; but having not made it ſtrong enough, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it with neceſſaries ſufficient, they were forc'd to leave it. It takes up about two Acres of Land; it hath four Baſtions, a Parapet, and Palliſado's as high as a Pike, and as thick as a Man's middle. We Europeans were poſted within, and the Cingulai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans on the outward Works; and were forc'd to cut up all the Wood about it, within a Muſquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot.</p>
               <p>We were in no danger in the day-time, but we had enough to do at night with ſeveral Parties of Candians, and with Elephants too: But theſe we frightned away eaſily with the Fires we made, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving good ſtore of Wood. Our Magazine was ſtor'd with Salt, Rice, Bacon, Fleſh, Brandy, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Shot, all which we had from <hi>Anguratot,</hi> two Leagues diſtant from us; and the care of it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me. Our Water was fetch'd about a Piſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot from the Fort.</p>
               <p>After we had lain here eight days in this wild and deſert place, the Candians came againſt us, Headed by <hi>Diſſave Tennecool,</hi> the great Robber: An <hi>Aratſi</hi> of ours brought us intelligence that they were coming with great forces upon us. We found then it was high time to remove our Quarters, which we did, ſetting all on Fire, and retired to another place near to <hi>Anguratot.</hi> By an order ſent
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:100310:161"/>
us from <hi>Columbo,</hi> we were oblig'd to go back to our old Quarters at <hi>Galture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 12th of October I was ſent to <hi>Anguratot</hi> to reſide as Maſter of the Stores, and Pay-maſter of the Forces. I was made mighty welcome by our chief Dutch-Officer, who lay there; and by Mr. <hi>Buſterweld,</hi> who was the Enſign there. He was a Man that had been employ'd in great Affairs here, and had been ſent as an Envoy to the King of <hi>Candi.</hi> He invited me to ſtay with him and make my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode at his Houſe to keep him company, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together we might ſpend our time more agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>I was well enough pleas'd to be at <hi>Anguratot,</hi> becauſe it was very ſtrong, and well provided with Cannon. A very fine River runs before it, which comes from <hi>Saffrigam,</hi> and hath great ſtore of good Fiſh, and Tortoiſes; and we had ſome thouſands of Inhabitants about us, of whom we bought choice Fruits very cheap, and all other ſorts of Victuals, as Fowls, Butter, Honey, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for a very ſmall price. It is very pleaſant living here for one that can ſpeak the Cingulaiſh Language.</p>
               <p>The Europeans that live here, who are not above Forty or Fifty in number, live live in this following manner. They have Prayers every day, morning and night, and a Sermon on Sundays, with Singing of Pſalms. They watch, and are free by turns in the day-time, but at night they muſt all be in the Fort upon pain of Death. Out of the Fort ev'ry one hath his little Houſe, where each of them keeps his Cingulayiſh Woman to provide and dreſs his Victuals, and ſerves likewiſe for his Bedfellow. If a Woman at any time is brought to Bed of a White Child, it is matter of great Joy to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Relations, and they grow very proud upon it. If a Man deſign to go out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he muſt keep it exceeding private; for if his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:100310:161"/>
Bedfellow knows any thing of it before-hand, ſhe certainly poiſons him, or bewitches him, as ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have been ſerv'd that have gone away; and tho' they were got 2 or 3000 miles, yet they were forc'd to come back again.</p>
               <p>On the laſt day of December, a Letter came to Mr. <hi>Buſterweld</hi> from <hi>Columbo,</hi> adviſing him to come thither, ſeeing he had a mind to go back into his Country. He ask'd me if I would not go with him to <hi>Columbo:</hi> So I accompany'd him thither, and we gave orders for three Boats to be made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for our ſelves and our Baggage.</p>
               <p>The 2d of January, 1678; Early in the morning we went out of <hi>Anguratot,</hi> and order'd the Cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layans (of which there were four in each of our Boats) to take a great deal of care, for we were to paſs thro' two ſeveral places that were very full of Rocks. The Dutch call the one of them, The Great Hell; the other, The Little Hell, becauſe they ſwallow up ſo many Men. We ſent out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in a Boat that went free, and old Fellow (a Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulayan, who was moſt experienc'd) to ſhew us the way. The Boat was loaded with Rice and Fowls, but the Men not Rowing ſo ſtrong as they ſhould have done, all ſunk with their Boat. We that came juſt after them were not a little ſtartled. I encouraged the Men in my Boat, as the Gentleman did thoſe in his, and we fortunately got through, and we compaſs'd 3 Dutch miles in 4 hours: So we got to <hi>Galture:</hi> But we never heard more of our four Cingulayans that we loſt in the firſt Boat.</p>
               <p>Our Lieutenant <hi>Sleght</hi> receiv'd us very nobly, and invited us to Dinner, and gave us other Cingulayans, which we ſent out before with our Boats. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Columbo</hi> was a great way from <hi>Galture,</hi> he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd two Palanquins to be got ready for us (which are a ſort of Chairs, but ſo contriv'd, that one may either ſit or lye down in them) and two Culins
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:100310:162"/>
or Slaves a-piece to carry us; they carry'd us very faſt, and we got ſafe to <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 5th, Mr. <hi>Buſterweld,</hi> having ſent all his things aboard, and being to leave me behind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd me to a certain Captain of <hi>Columbo,</hi> one Min Heer <hi>Witzenburg,</hi> to whom after he had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me, he went on the 6th Inſtant aboard his Ship to <hi>Punto de Gala,</hi> where he was to take in her Loading of Cinnamon and Pepper, and then put to Sea.</p>
               <p>This Captain <hi>Witzenburg</hi> was a brave Soldier, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50 years of Age, was then in <hi>Columbo</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and was likewiſe one of the Council, which conſiſts of eight Men only, who are treated with no leſs Title than that of Honourable. They Judge and give Sentence in all Cauſes, as well Capital as others. Our chief Merchant, one <hi>Van Vorſten,</hi> was the Preſident of them: He had been rais'd to this from a Cabbin-boy. The beſt part of them could neither Write nor Read: nor could the Captain I am ſpeaking of, tho' he was the third of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. If any Man will appeal from them, he muſt transfer his Cauſe to <hi>Batavia,</hi> which is 500 miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from thence.</p>
               <p>I ſtaid 5 months with this Captain, during which time I was a very ſerviceable Companion, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him all Orders and Cauſes at home, before he went to the Council (for they were always ſent to them there firſt) in which he us'd to take my opinion, and in anſwering for him all the Letters that came to him.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of July, I was obliged to go to a little Fort call'd <hi>Malvane,</hi> 4 leagues from <hi>Columbo,</hi> where I remain'd four months. The place is very ſtrong, by a River, it hath Palliſado's, Parapets, and a Ditch, eight Field-pieces, and other neceſſaries, and ſixty Men to keep it. Our Head Officer there, was one <hi>Oldenburgh,</hi> a Lieutenant. It was very unheal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:100310:162"/>
by reaſon of the thick Fogs; and therefore the Garriſon is often reliev'd from <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 6th, We were inform'd that the King of <hi>Candi</hi> would Beſiege this Fort; wherefore we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided our ſelves againſt it.</p>
               <p>The 16th, The <hi>Diſſave,</hi> or General, appear'd with Thirty Thouſand Men, (this was that <hi>Tenne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cool</hi> the Renegado we have ſpoken of before,) and he let us know privately</p>
               <p>On the 17th, That he reſented an affront which the King of <hi>Candi</hi> had put upon him, and beſides, that he had deceiv'd him in his expectations, for which he would now be reveng'd; and with this opportunity return to the Dutch, and not moleſt our Fort in any manner. We were oblig'd to keep this very ſecret, leaſt it ſhould come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his own Soldiers; and we ſent an account of his offers to <hi>Columbo,</hi> whence we receiv'd orders to direct him to <hi>Columbo,</hi> but not receive him into our Fort.</p>
               <p>The 20th, He went with three hundred of his beſt Men to <hi>Columbo,</hi> where he was receiv'd ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably by the Governor, and preſented with a Gold Chain worth 300 Ricxdollars. When the King of <hi>Candi</hi> had an account of this, he order'd the ſiege to be rais'd, and all <hi>Tennecool</hi>'s Generation to be deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p>The 31th of October we were reliev'd, and went altogether to <hi>Columbo.</hi> We were to croſs over a River 7 or 8 at a time, with two Boats tyed to one another. I was one of the laſt that were to go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. I was here very near being drown'd by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky accident. The old Dottia or Waterman was juſt ſhoving the Boats off of Land, when the Boats which are exceeding little turn'd over, for the Rope broke that tyed them together. My danger was ſo much the greater, for that a luſty fellow, who fell in with us, and could not ſwim, took faſt hold of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:100310:163"/>
my Leg, and would have drown'd us both, had I not fortunately laid hands on the poſt to which the Boats uſed to be tyed, by which means we were ſafe. Thoſe that could ſwim were in no great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: The others hung luckily upon the Boats that were floating with the bottom upwards; ſo that all ſaved their Lives. Some Muſquets were loſt, but it was a wonder that none of the Men were drown'd or at leaſt devour'd, conſidering that there is always ſo vaſt a number of Crocodiles in that Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
               <p>From the 1ſt to the 8th, We lay in the Old Town of <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 7th, and 8th, Several People were ſent out to hunt after the Prince of <hi>Candi,</hi> who had been kept ſome years by the Dutch, with a deſign to put him on the Throne of <hi>Candi,</hi> when the old King ſhould die. He was kept out of the City, near the old Hoſpital, and had a Guard of ſix Files of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſqueteers and one Serjeant; notwithſtanding which he found means to make his eſcape, and was never heard of ſince.</p>
               <p>He had been about ſix years at <hi>Columbo,</hi> where, at his coming, he declar'd himſelf to be of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood of <hi>Candi,</hi> and the true Heir to that Crown, alledging that the preſent King of <hi>Candi</hi> had U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd it from him, and that he was the Perſon that ſhould have ſucceeded the Old King. And indeed all the Inhabitants were much more affected to him, which they uſed to expreſs continually by the rich Preſents they uſed frequently to bring him.</p>
               <p>The Dutch allow'd him Forty Rixdollars <hi>per</hi> month, and 41 Simmeri's of Rice, to maintain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Retinue, which was a Steward, a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, a Captain, 20 Soldiers, 6 Drummers, 4 Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and 8 Slaves, or Chair-men, to carry thoſe Sedans we have already ſpoke of; in all 21 Men. They would not have loſt much by this, if he had
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:100310:163"/>
continu'd at <hi>Columbo,</hi> and had ever come to the Crown of <hi>Candi;</hi> for they would have made ſuch Articles with him before they had ſetled him on the Throne, that he would have been little more than Titular King.</p>
               <p>The 9th, Two Companies of Volunteers were form'd out of the Garriſons of the City and Caſtle, of 80 Men each, and were order'd to go to the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 10th, We were muſter'd up, and receiv'd the next day two months Pay. Our chief Officer was a Dantzicker, one <hi>Tobias Guntz,</hi> Captain-Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and our two Lieutenants were one <hi>Koningh,</hi> and one <hi>Vernie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 12th, We went aboard in two ſmall Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and arriv'd the next day at <hi>Calpintin,</hi> where our Men were lodg'd in a Church which ſtands out of the Fortification, where Divine Service is done in Dutch, Portugueſe, and Malabariſh. This Fort was built here, and is carefully look'd after, becauſe it is a conſiderable Paſs for other Nations; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Inhabitants drive no ſmall Trade with the Moors, and others. A great Commodity there, is Areck, which is a Fruit that grows like the Nutmeg. Moſt of the Eaſtern Indians cannot live without it, being ſo us'd to it, that they are never well, but when they are chawing of it. The Soldiers here, which are 100 in number, keep Dogs, with which they go and Hunt Bufflers, Sheep, Stags. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which they live: For the Land affords nothing but what's Wild, ſome Fiſh and ſome Rice.</p>
               <p>We lay ſtill from the 14th, to the 18th, Then orders were given for every Man to make his own Proviſion for three days, and to be ready on the 19th of <hi>March.</hi> Accordingly they were; and I having a deſire to be in the adventure, provided for my ſelf too, and order'd one of the Men to get me 6 pound of Beet boyl'd in Salt-water, and half a pound of
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:100310:164"/>
Bisket. The next morning early we ſet out. Our two Malabarian Guides went before us. At noon we came near to a Well, but found no Water there, which we began to want; but our want ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed: Then we turn'd our ſelves to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; where we thought to have ſatisfy'd our ſelves, and found the Water to be Salt. Our comfort was, that we were to come in the evening to a Well; but when we came to it, we found a Buffler fall'n in and drown'd, which made us all abſtain from drinking, notwithſtanding we were exceeding thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. Our Guide then took us half a mile farther, to a deep ſandy Soil, where they told us we might have Water. There we were forc'd to make ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral holes in the Ground, 2 or 3 yards deep, to get at it; but we were happy ſtill to have it upon any terms. In this place we lay all night, having ſet ſome Men to watch, and kindl'd ſome Fires to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the wild Beaſts coming upon us.</p>
               <p>The 20th, Early in the morning we march'd on thro' great Woods and Deſert-places, where we ſaw and heard nothing but Elephants, Tygers, Bears, &amp;c. there being no Man in all that part of the Country. We came in the forenoon to an Arm of a Salt-River that reach'd into the Land a great way; ſo that we were forc'd to wade over, after we had ſtaid about three hours, till the ebb was at the loweſt; and then too we were all forc'd to ſtrip, and pack up all our Cloaths, Proviſions, and Arms, and carry them on our Heads. We were almoſt half a quarter of an hour going over; and it was ſo deep, that ſome of the leaſt of our Men, had much to do to keep the Water from running in at their mouths. Some that thought to be wiſer than our Guides, went up to a place where they ſaw the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter run very rough, becauſe it was not ſo deep there. It was but ſhallow indeed, but the ſtream was ſo ſtrong there, that it threw 'em off out of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:100310:164"/>
their depth, and drown'd moſt of 'em. We being got over made haſte on, for we were by this time in want of Water again, and the beſt allay of our thirſt we could get, was our Bullets which we rowl'd about in our mouth to moiſten them. At night we lay ſtill at a place, whence thoſe that would of neceſſity drink were forc'd to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile for Water, and then dig for it too. After they had made each of them their hole, they drank their ſill, and then laid down in it for cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and took a nap there.</p>
               <p>The 21th, Three Soldiers came to meet us with three Horſes ſent from <hi>Manara</hi> for the Officers. We got upon them with a very good will, while the poor fellows were forc'd to drudge on without Shoes or Stockings (in the ſame manner as they ſet out). We arriv'd all at <hi>Aripen</hi> about 3 of the clock in the afternoon, having gone about 22 Leagues in our three days march; which was very hard for our Men, who went all the way barefoot. <hi>Aripen</hi> is a pretty ſtrong place, kept by 20 Dutch Soldiers, provided with 4 Field-pieces, and other Warlike Neceſſaries convenient for a place of that big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Many Malabarians live about it, of whom one may buy Fleſh, Milk, Butter, Eggs, Fowls, &amp;c. cheap enough: And we bought here two pretty good Bullocks for one Rixdollar, that ſerv'd both our Companies.</p>
               <p>This place is chiefly deſign'd to keep the <hi>Pearl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi> from being ſiſh'd by any one that hath no ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to it, which is an oſſence puniſhable with death. It is very unhealthy there, and no European but muſt expect a Fever that will kill him, it he ſtays there long. For which reaſon they are exchang'd from <hi>Manara</hi> ev'ry four months; and yet they loſe generally half their Men. We ſtaid there all night, and</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="308" facs="tcp:100310:165"/>
On the 22th, We march'd away again, and at night came by the Iſland <hi>Manara,</hi> to go to which we were to croſs the Waters, which is about a mile broad: It is ſix miles from <hi>Aripen.</hi> We were very kindly receiv'd by the Dutch Captain that lay there; and treated very nobly with Fleſh and Fiſh, which is here in great plenty.</p>
               <p>This Iſland, as we mention'd before, hath ſeven miles compaſs: It is inhabited by ſeveral Malabars, and abounds in Fleſh, Fowls, and fruitful Trees; and all the Water about it affords plenty of Fiſh. In ſhort, it may be call'd an Earthly Paradiſe. The Fort is well provided, and is kept by near 100 Dutch Soldiers. Each Soldier keeps a Boy to clean his Arms and carry them for him, and a Woman to look after his Meat and ſerve him. Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to this, the Officers live in very great State. We lay here three days, and</p>
               <p>The 16th, We went in three Dutch Boats to <hi>Jaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napatan,</hi> where we arriv'd on</p>
               <p>The 27th, And were very well receiv'd, and Quarter'd in the Fort that lies to the Sea.</p>
               <p>The 28th, 29th, and 30th, Our Men were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd, and 20 Elephants were brought upon the place whilſt we Fir'd, to uſe them to ſtand it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtarting in War. At firſt they were very fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and untractable, not being able to bear the noiſe and ſmoak of our Guns, toſſing up their Trunks, and were very furious. At laſt they were brought to it ſo, that an Indian could get upon them, and ride about a Furlong away from us, and then drive them upon us, (we firing againſt them all the while,) at length they'd break our Ranks, take what care we could; and tho' we ſhot in their very Noſes; and if the Cingulayans that rid them had not prevented them with their Inſtruments, they would have trampl'd us under foot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:100310:165"/>
The 1ſt of December, Two Companies of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to us from the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandel,</hi> out of the Fort <hi>Palliacate,</hi> and <hi>Nagapatan.</hi> They were Quarter'd in a Stable, uſed generally to keep Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants in.</p>
               <p>The 2d, Another Company came from <hi>Gala, Battacula,</hi> and <hi>Triconomala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 3d, We had a general Muſter, and march'd with our 7 Companies, and 8 Field-pieces drawn by Elephants, and 20 others Elephants beſides, out of the Fort of <hi>Jafnapatan.</hi> And being drawn out in the Fields there, we were commanded to incloſe our Leaders; that is, to form our ſelves into a Ring, where we heard the Articles of War read to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jafnapatan</hi> bears the Name of a ſmall Kingdom, which the Dutch took by ſurprize from the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſes. Its Fort is well built, and ſtrong; having four Baſtions, two Towers, a Counterſcarp, and a deep Ditch. It lies upon a Salt-water on the ſide of <hi>Manara,</hi> where the Dutch have built a very ſtrong fine Key.</p>
               <p>All the chief Officers lodge within the Fort with their Wives. The under Officers and Soldiers Wives live amongſt the other Inhabitants in the Town, which is about a League in compaſs: But there are a great many Gardens in it, and many poor ſmall Hutts; as alſo fair large Streets. There are two different Market-places in it; the one for Fiſh, the other is for all ſorts of Commodities, as Silks, Linnen, Pearls, Gold, Silver, Spices, Salt, Butter, Allum, Tobacco, Rats and Mice, Herbs, all ſorts of Colours; in ſhort, all a Man can deſire. Their current Money is made of Copper, and is either Shillings, Two-pences, Peny-pieces, <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſties,</hi> Half-penies, and Farthings. One may buy 10 or 15 Figs for a Farthing, that are almoſt a ſpan
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:100310:166"/>
long; and ſometimes 2 or 3 Pounds of Fiſh for the ſame price: So that a Man that goes to Market with 4 or 5 Farthings, may buy Proviſions to ſerve a common Family two days for his Money.</p>
               <p>I met here with an acquaintance of mine, a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, who was chief Chirurgeon to the Dutch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital, and Phyſician to Min Heer <hi>Laurent Piil,</hi> the Governor, and was much eſteem'd among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the Country for his Abilities, and the great Cures he perform'd.</p>
               <p>The 4th, We march'd out. Our Major <hi>Clebout</hi> went firſt, carry'd by Slaves in a Palankin, a ſort of Sedan, I have already mention'd. After him march'd the 6 Companies, with each an Elephant to draw the Baggage. It was ſuppos'd that we were deſign'd to march to <hi>Wani,</hi> where the Inhabitants had choſen a new Prince without conſent of the Dutch, their Prince <hi>Don Philip</hi> being Dead; and deſign'd to free themſelves for the future from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tribute to <hi>Jafnapatan.</hi> But as ſoon as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that we were drawing towards 'em, they ſent to meet us with ten Elephants, with offers to continue willingly a yearly Tribute of Elephants and Money, on conditions we would ſecure them from the King of <hi>Candi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major ſent them to <hi>Jafnapatan</hi> with a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and we came at night to a place call'd <hi>Pas-Piil,</hi> where a Dutch Garriſon lay. Here the Hutts were ready for our Men, and provided with neceſſaries againſt our coming.</p>
               <p>The 5th, 6th, and 7th, We lay ſtill here, being much tir'd with going ten Leagues in a day in all that heat, and ſo ſandy a Country. We found there three great Dutch Ships that were come from <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 8th, Four of our Companies, <hi>viz.</hi> The two that came from <hi>Columbo,</hi> the other two from <hi>Corman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> were to Embark ſecretly, and the two other
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100310:166"/>
Companies were to remain in the Fort, by reaſon of the Troubles that were in <hi>Wani,</hi> That very eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we ſet forwards for the Coaſt of <hi>Corman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 9th, Early in the morning, we came before <hi>Negapatan.</hi> Here a Dutch Yatch joyn'd us, and two other Veſſels, together with three great Boats well Mann'd with Seamen. With this Fleet we ſail'd along the Coaſt by <hi>Krancko Baar,</hi> a City belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and lying 8 Leagues from <hi>Negapatan.</hi> We ſail'd by the Daniſh Admiral that lay in the Road, with two other Ships, to whom we ſtruck our Pendants. We paſs'd on by <hi>Porto Novo,</hi> a Fort that belongs to the Moors, under the command of the King of <hi>Volkendal.</hi> They had a great many Boats before it, and one at a diſtance to watch the reſt. This one put up a Flag, and ſir'd a Piece for a Signal; and of a ſudden they were all under Sail, taking us for Enemies. But it was but a falſe alarm of theirs; for our deſign was only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Fort <hi>Policere</hi> (which is not far from St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas)</hi> into which many Soldiers that had deſerted from the Viceroy <hi>Lakay,</hi> were got: And this Fort we had orders to Inveſt and Demoliſh, becauſe it was a great hindrance to the Dutch Commerce.</p>
               <p>But on the 21th, A Yatch met us, that was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to bring us word, that the French, upon no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our coming, were fled out of the Fort, and gone to the King of <hi>Volkendal.</hi> So we went back to <hi>Nagapatan,</hi> where we arriv'd</p>
               <p>The 11th, at night, and caſt Anchor there. We heard that the Moors had drove away a Dutch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant that was Regiſterer, and Secretary of <hi>Mata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patan,</hi> and had ſeiz'd all his Goods: Upon which we ſent 2 of our Boats with 150 men to redreſs this Injury.</p>
               <p>And on the 13th, They came back with an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their good ſucceſs; and that they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:100310:167"/>
the Merchant his Habitation, and forc'd the Moors to give back all they had taken from him. Our Ship being to take up 400 quarters of Rice at this place, we lay ſtill there till</p>
               <p>The 12th of January, 1679, When we ſet ſail, and came on</p>
               <p>The 13th, To a Dutch Fort call'd <hi>Punto de Pedre,</hi> a very pleaſant place, having great plenty of Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Tamarins, Figgs, Cocos, Jager, and Areck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, which make delicate ſhady Walks, ſome of 'em a mile or two long; and a fine Campaign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; There we lay all night, and very well lodg'd we were.</p>
               <p>The 14th, Early in the morning, we march'd on foot to <hi>Jafnapatan.</hi> I was very dry in the march; and coming to a Malabarian Village, I ſlipp'd into a little Hutt to get me ſome milk to drink. I found an old Woman there with her Daughter: I deſir'd a Pint of milk, and they gave it me, asking me a <hi>Damagas</hi> for it (which is two-pence;) I drunk it off, and having paid my money, went away to overtake the reſt of my Company; and not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any thing, I was immediately ſhot in the Leg with one Arrow, and with another in my Thigh. I pull'd them out, and look'd all about me, but could not perceive any body, nor whence they ſhould come. However I thought to fright them, and cry'd out, <hi>O Nay, Dayoli, mettene Landes ingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>e;</hi> which ſigniſies, <hi>Ye dogs, there are more Dutch a coming.</hi> But that was all the revenge I could have, for I durſt not complain of it, becauſe it was done by ſtealth, and contrary to our orders, that I ſtopt there. So I went out of the Village as faſt as I could, and ſtopp'd my Wounds with an old rag, that I uſed to wrap the lock of my Fuſil in, and overtook my Company, and went on to <hi>Jafnapatan</hi> in great pain. There our Poſt was; and I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately went to my Countryman <hi>Lutz</hi> the Phyſician,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100310:167"/>
who Cur'd me; but was forc'd to cut open my Wounds, becauſe the Arrows were poiſon'd. We ſtaid there till</p>
               <p>The 14th of February, And then we were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back in Boats to <hi>Manara.</hi> There was a Veſſel here that would have held us all very well, but the Captain-Lieutenant would take but one Company in with him, wanting room for good quantity of Hogs and Onions, that he had a mind to carry to <hi>Columbo</hi> to trade with. We had very good Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters here, and ſtaid till</p>
               <p>The 1 ſt of March, Then we were divided, and went in two Boats: The one was a large Dutch one, call'd the Elephant; the other a poor little Malla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſh one, into which it was my lot to go: It was quite open, and had neither Rudder, nor Compaſs. But thoſe in the Dutch Veſſel told us that we ſhould not want one, if we would but follow 'em; we told 'em we would if we could; but we gave our ſelves over for loſt, and never expected that it would carry us over the Sea. However we went well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough while the day laſted; but towards the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, coming to the <hi>Pearl Bank</hi> at <hi>Aripen,</hi> it began to Rain, and blow exceedingly. The Wind was good, but ſo ſtrong, that we were afraid of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ev'ry minute. Our four Seamen, who were Malabarians, thought good to keep as nigh to the ſhore as we could; all of us thought very well of that too: But the Rogues, more afraid than we, as ſoon as they came in ſight of the Land, leap'd into the Sea, and left us, and ſwam to ſhore. By mere good fortune we had ſome Soldiers amongſt us, that had been Saylors, who manag'd the Sails and Stern. I had choſen to lay me down by the Hearth, where they uſed to dreſs their Victuals, to keep my ſelf and my Writings dry; but the Rain beat upon me, and mixing the Aſhes and Soot with it, I look'd next morning like a Chimney-Sweeper;
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100310:168"/>
but the beſt on't was, that I kept my Papers very ſafe. This was a bitter night; and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing we ſtruck upon a little marſhy Iſland, and there ſtaid till day, to ſee which way we were to take. There was an old fellow with us, that knew where-about <hi>Calpintin</hi> was, being well acquainted with the Country; by the help of his Directions, we thruſt off our Boat, and ſail'd by many other little Iſlands like this, and got in ſight of <hi>Calpintin,</hi> and by the next morning to it. Here we found the fellows tha<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               <argument>
                  <p>The manner of Fiſhing for Pearls: Why this ſort of Fiſhing was laid by for ſeven years. The Author's departure from <hi>Calpintin</hi> to <hi>Columbo.</hi> The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers he went through in his Journey. Comes to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo.</hi> Preſents ſent by the Governor to the King of <hi>Candi:</hi> What they were. The Author is order'd to go along with them. In what baſe manner the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians receiv'd the Preſents; and then treacherouſly fell upon thoſe that brought them. How they came off, and in their retreat deſtroy'd two Heathen Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. What ſtrange things happen'd while they were about it. They return to <hi>Columbo.</hi> The Gates there are ſhut up twice a day, and why. An account of <hi>Sittawack,</hi> and of the Amboineſes who ſerve the Dutch Company there. Precious Stones in the Earth and in the Rivers; where most found. A Deſcription of them; and where, and how they grow. What po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy the Author was forc'd to uſe to get a Saphir of an Old Cingulayan. A ſtrange Cock. An Elephant falls into a Well, out of which there was no getting of him. An Earthquake.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I proceed, I will inform the Reader how the Pearls are got here, how Fiſh'd for, and how Sold.</p>
               <p>The Bank, where they are, lies in the Sea, not far from the Land. It is about twenty miles long, and two broad; from ſeven to ten Fathoms deep. It belongs at this time to the Hollanders. The Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in which the Pearls are found, are about the breadth of one's hand. They ſtick to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of Rocks, ſome twenty or thirty together. There are People to look every year, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:100310:169"/>
the Pearls are ripe; when they are ſo, they write to all the neighbouring Kings to let them know what time the Fiſhing is to begin. Then the <hi>Divers</hi> are ſent, who are Malabarian Fiſhermen, who come with their Boats, and ſome Stones along with them. Each Diver hangs a Stone upon his Foot to ſink him the ſooner; when he is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, he fills his Net with Oyſters, and then looſens himſelf from the Stone. Then the Stone, together with the Net, is drawn up by another Malabarian in the Boat, whilſt the Man ſhoots himſelf up to fetch breath. When they have thus fill'd their Boat with Oyſters, they row to Land, and throw them out. There is a Dutch Soldier waits on each Boat, to ſee that the Malabarians do not take any of the Pearls away. The three firſt days theſe Boats are all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd for the Eaſt-India Company; after this they may Fiſh for themſelves paying a Rixdoller a day for every Diver.</p>
               <p>The Oyſters are laid in heaps on the Shore, and the Merchants come there to buy them. They are ſold at the rate of eight hundred for a Rixdollar. The gain or loſs of the Buyer depends on meer chance: For ſome may be find no Pearls in all they buy; others make vaſt advantage of their Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>There hath been no Fiſhing here for theſe eight years. Some ſuperſtitiouſly think that the place is bewitched: Others give this for a reaſon (which I rather approve of) that the boiſterouſneſs of the Sea hath cover'd the Oyſters with Sand, ſo that they cannot come at them.</p>
               <p>The 6th, In the morning all our Company went in the Boat call'd the Elephant; and having the Wind for us, we expected to reach to <hi>Columbo</hi> by night. The number of the Soldiers and Officers was in all 110. We had but a ſmall Veſſel with Water, a buſhell of Rice, a ſmall Buffler, and a
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:100310:169"/>
young Buck; which two laſt things were for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Governor. Thus the Boat was quite full, and no Man had room to lye down, but was forc'd to keep his Seat. The Wind blew North: But at noon it ceas'd, and then we went but flowly: but we kept in ſight of Land all along on our left hand. Toward night, the Wind aroſe again; and and then we made ſome ſpeed. Therefore the Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men bad us all look out ſharp for <hi>Columbo,</hi> where we earneſtly deſir'd to be, eſpecially becauſe our Water Veſſel was every drop drunk out.</p>
               <p>The 7th, By break of day, we found that we were carry'd wide off of it by the ſtrength of the current, and partly by the overſight of our Steerſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: For we could ſee no <hi>Columbo,</hi> nor Land nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. All the Officers were very angry with him for't, and would certainly have thrown him into Sea, if he had not got up to the top of the Maſt, where they made him ſtay all that day for his Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. Our Captain conſulted the Map of the Iſland <hi>Ceylon,</hi> and he directed us ſomewhat in our courſe; and about night we got in ſight of <hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d' Adam,</hi> or <hi>Adam's-Hill;</hi> and at ſix of the Clock next morning we got happily to <hi>Columbo.</hi> It was high time for us to get thither, conſidering that we had been two days and three nights without Meat or Drink. The Steerſman begg'd we would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and not complain of him to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor.</p>
               <p>The 8th, As ſoon as the Gates were open'd, we enter'd the City and went to our reſpective Poſts. The Captain, with whom I ſpent ſome time when I was here before, ſent to me to deſire me to make his Houſe my own again, if I pleaſed. I did not make any refuſal of ſo advantagious a proffer, but accepted of it, and I ſtaid with him till</p>
               <p>The 16th, When I was order'd to go with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others to carry a Preſent, which the Governor
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:100310:170"/>
ſent to the King of <hi>Candi;</hi> during which time I had the Title and Office of Captain. The Preſents were, two Perſian Horſes, with ſine Velvet Cloaths and Trappings, each Horſe led by two Malabarian Slaves: Ten Falcons, each carry'd by a Malabarian dreſs'd all in white: Six Musk-Cats, each in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Cage, carry'd by two Slaves: Six very large Cocks from <hi>Tutucurini,</hi> each of them likewiſe in a Cage, cover'd with green Velvet: Two Perſian Sheep, each with a Tail that weigh'd 20 or 25 pound: A Box that had two Bottles in it, that held each of them ſix Gallons of Perſian Wine: Beſides this, a great piece of <hi>Sandel</hi> Wood, that weigh'd 200 pound, wrapp'd up in ſine white Linnen. The Letter that was to be deliver'd to the King, was carry'd in a Silver Cap by a Serjeant bare-headed, and a Canopy was carry'd over it by four Cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layan Nobles: By each of which another went with a large Wax-Candle lighted as long as a half Pike.</p>
               <p>Our march began in order at the Governor's Houſe. Some Companies of Cingulaiſh Soldiers went firſt; then ſome Companies of Dutch; then the Preſents; after them two Companies more of Dutch. Theſe were order'd to go as far as the King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s reſidential Town, <hi>Ruenel.</hi> All the City was in Arms, and all the Cannon was Fir'd round, and a Dutch Company that conducted us out of Town gave three Vollies and went back again.</p>
               <p>We, together with the others before-mention'd, went on with the Preſents. At night we came to a place, where Dutch Potters live, two Leagues from <hi>Columbo;</hi> there we lay that night, and the next morning march'd on, and came</p>
               <p>The 17th, At night to <hi>Hanquelle</hi> or <hi>Gourwebel,</hi> a Dutch Fort, where we lay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:100310:170"/>
The 18th, We had a very unpleaſant and dirty way, and were not a little tormented with Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckers, till we came to the Fort <hi>Sittawack,</hi> which is in poſſeſſion of the Dutch, and 12 Leagues diſtant from <hi>Columbo.</hi> Immediately Letters were written, on leaves of Sugar-trees, and diſpatch'd to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> of <hi>Candi</hi> at <hi>Ruenel,</hi> to acquaint him with our being come thither, with a Preſent for the King his Maſter; and that he ſhould permit them to come forwards, if he pleas'd to receive them. But not a word of anſwer did we get, and we ſtaid here in expectation of it ſix whole Weeks, till the end of September. At laſt we had Directions ſent us from <hi>Columbo,</hi> which were, That we ſhould go four Leagues farther beyond <hi>Ruenel,</hi> and deliver them to the <hi>Coral,</hi> and then come back. And accordingly</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of October, We went; and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving croſſed ſeven little Rivers, we came to <hi>Ruenel.</hi> This Fort heretofore belong'd to the Dutch, but was abandon'd by them, tho' themſelves had built it. There we croſs'd over, and having march'd a League further, we came to a large Plain, where we halted a while to reſt and refreſh our ſelves. By that time we had been there about half an hour, we ſaw and heard ſeveral ſmall Parties of Cinguleſes coming upon us from ev'ry ſide. Our chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander ſent ſome Cingulayans to ask what they meant to do? They anſwer'd them, that the King of <hi>Candi</hi> had ſent them to take the Preſents we had brought.</p>
               <p>We would not truſt 'em. So we put our ſelves in order, and ſtood our Ground. Their number ſtill encreaſed, and they came very thick out of a Wood. At laſt their Artillery (which was very ſmall) appear'd too, and then they drew towards us. We ſent again to 'em to know what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to do with their Artillery, and whether this
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:100310:171"/>
was their cuſtom to repay Civilities? They told us their Field-pieces were not loaded.</p>
               <p>We would have been glad to have been at home again, for we were but two Companies of Dutch of 160 Men each, and two or three hundred Cingulay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and theſe Heathens were almoſt innumerable. They appeared as thick as Graſs on the Field. The Preſents were ſent for by the <hi>Monthou,</hi> who was one of the King's Chief Officers, and an under Officer took them and delivered them to him. He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them, and he giving no orders for their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be diſchrged, we gave no Volley of our ſide.</p>
               <p>Our Officer deſired to ſpeak to the King's <hi>Saudi</hi> in Perſon, and a place was appointed for them to meet at, equally diſtant from them both. The <hi>Saudi</hi> came upon an Elephant, and our Officer was on <hi>Horſe-back.</hi> Theſe two ſorts of Creatures are not to be brought near one another, wherefore they were forced to light, and meet a-foot.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saudi</hi> did not take off his Cap, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Crown'd a Head: Ours only repreſented a body of Merchants, and Deputy Governors.</p>
               <p>Our Officer complained of the manner of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, and ask'd why ſo many thouſand Men were drawn out againſt us, knowing that we had but two Companies of Dutch: The reaſon the <hi>Saudi</hi> gave was, That his Maſter had commanded it to be ſo; ſo they parted, but neither would draw his Men off firſt. At laſt, Night coming upon us, we were forced to retire.</p>
               <p>They let us paſs by quietly enough till we were got to the River by <hi>Ruenel</hi> (which is moſt like the <hi>Rhine</hi> of any I ever ſaw;) But as ſoon as one of our Companies was got over, they fell upon the Rear of the other. Our Cingulayans took the River, and ſwam over, leaving us in the lurch. We continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Firing upon them, and they upon us; till we were all got quite over. We loſt our Lieutenant and
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:100310:171"/>
two private Soldiers. We killed ſeveral of theirs, and wounded many more. We had a very bad way to go, and it fell a Raining, which made it more Dirty and Slippery, ſo that we could not go ſo faſt as we would have done. We retired towards <hi>Sittawack,</hi> and paſſed by a ſteep Rock; whence it is reported, That the late King of <hi>Sittawack</hi>'s Wife and Daughter flung themſelves down headlong, having received the News that he had loſt the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle againſt the King of <hi>Candi.</hi> The Candians all the while came after us, but were not able to do us any great harm, becauſe the ways were ſo narrow that they could not come up to us. Yet we were forced every now and then to Fire in the Rear of us.</p>
               <p>The 2d, 3d and 4th we reſted at <hi>Sittawack,</hi> the next day we deſtroyed two Heatheniſh Temples not far from that place; they were built upon a riſing Ground, and cut out of a vaſt Rock: Within they were adorned with many Images and Statues of Wood and Stone, repreſenting Devils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Under one of the Pagods we found a dark black hole, as it were grown ſo with Smoak, no body durſt venture to creep in. We threw ſome Straw into it, and Fired it, but we could not ſound the Depth or Length of it. Some Fellows were mightily afraid of ſtanding near the hole, and were afraid that we ſhould poke ſome Cingulayan Devil out of it; but if he was there, he did not come out, nor did we find out what it was made for.</p>
               <p>We had ſeveral Lutherans and Papiſts amongſt us; the firſt of theſe fell a Singing ſome Spiritual Hymns in the Temple, that had that hole under it. The Papiſts went together into the other, and they having among them an Old Fellow that had been a a Prieſt heretofore, he fell to ſaying Maſs. There was on the ſudden ſuch a noiſe, and thundring, and cracking, that we thought we ſhould have been a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:100310:172"/>
blown up, or that the Temple would have fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, Some run out thinking to be ſafer, but the noiſe and hurly-burly was greater there than with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſo that ſome came in again; and this continued a quarter of an Hour.</p>
               <p>The 6th we came away, and toward the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing entred into <hi>Columbo;</hi> where we found two great Ships lying in the Road come from <hi>Japan,</hi> with Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Gold, China and <hi>Saccapali</hi> which is a liquor of a faint ſmell, but very wholſome.</p>
               <p>The 7th I was ordered to my Poſt, which was at the Gate call'd <hi>Victoria,</hi> where I ſtay'd till the 2d of February 1680. I had 110 Men under me. The Caſtle Gates were open'd and ſhut, every Morning and Night at Six of the Clock, and all the Keys ty'd together with a Silver Chain, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the Governor: The Gates are ſhut likewiſe from Eleven to One a Clock in the Day time, that being the hotteſt part of the Day, and therefore generally taken to ſleep in. We Exerciſed our Men every Mondy, and every Sunday we went con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly twice a Day to Church, where Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was performed in Dutch and Portugueſe, after the Reformed way.</p>
               <p>The 9th Inſtant we went to relieve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany that was at <hi>Sittawack,</hi> Twelve Leagues from <hi>Columbo;</hi> we got there that Night, and the next Day being</p>
               <p>The 10th, the Company march'd out and left us. And here I ſhall give the Reader ſome ſhort Account of the Fort of <hi>Sittawack:</hi> It is ſcituated upon a Rocky Ground; near to this, juſt over the River, ſtood heretofore the King of <hi>Sittawack</hi>'s Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, ruin'd ſince by the Portugueſe: It is about four hundred Paces in Circuit: It is built four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare, with four Baſtions, call'd, <hi>Rycloff, Louiſa, Columbo,</hi> and <hi>Gala;</hi> Each of theſe Baſtions hath two Pieces of large Cannon. In the middle of this
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:100310:172"/>
place is a large ſquare Bulwark: Under this are kept the Proviſions, as Rice, Fleſh, Salt, and Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and the Ammunitious of War, Powder, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, and Balls: Over that was the Guard Room, where all the Men lay; at each corner of which were two ſmall Pieces of Cannon. Half the Men might have leave to be out of the Fort in the Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, but at Night they were to be in, every Man, upon pain of Death. Every Night the Names were call'd over, and Prayers Read; and on Sunday Night we had a Sermon preach'd in the Guard-Chamber. Here is alſo a Company of Amboineſes continually kept in the Dutch Service. Their Licu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant was call'd <hi>Alons,</hi> and was of Royal Blood. They live in the Town altogether, and with their Huts they make a very pretty Street, and they have their Wives with them. But at Night they are as much obliged to be in the Fort as any of us. They are very nimble and active at Running or Leaping. They never have but little Beards, and behind in their Necks they have a ſort of bunch grows like a Wen. Their Pay is, for a Lieutenant 24 Rix Dollars a Month, an Enſign 16, a Corporal 8, a Private Centinel 5, all paid in Mony.</p>
               <p>The Cingulayans are mightily afraid of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boineſes, and rather more than the Europeans are; for they are great devourers of Men. They wear Muskets and ſhort Swords. Beſides their own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, they generally ſpeak Maleyſh, Cingulaiſh, Portugueſe, and Dutch. They love Gaming exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and the day time they generally ſpend in Cock-fighting, Cards, and Dice; and when they have loſt all their Mony, they go to ſome work or other, as Carving ſeveral things in Stone or Wood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till their Month's Pay comes into their hands again, and as ſoon as they have paid their Debts, what is left they put to the venture; and when they have loſt that, it is much if the Wife is not ſtrip'd of all
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:100310:173"/>
her Ornaments to ſupply him in the purſuit of his Gaming, and the Family is left often in an extream neceſſity, and ready to ſtarve.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Sittawack,</hi> it is a Fort deſign'd to reſiſt the King of <hi>Candi:</hi> It hath three little Counties or <hi>Corls</hi> depending upon it, the one is call'd <hi>Cuculi</hi> and in Dutch the <hi>Hoender Grafschap, (Hoender</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying <hi>Fowls,</hi> which are there in abundance;) the ſecond is call'd <hi>Bulatkam-Corl,</hi> from the quantity of Plants it produces, which ſerve for Food to the Inhabitants: The third <hi>Biſang-Corl,</hi> from the great quantity of Figs that grow there. In each of theſe <hi>Corls</hi> are ſome hundreds of Peaſants that are under Contribution, and are forced to pay a fourth part of all their Rice to the Fort, and likewiſe of their Fruit-bearing Trees, as <hi>Cocos, A ack, Sugar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Fort beſides ſerves for a Guard upon all the pretious Stones, as Rubies, Saphyrs, Emeralds, the Topaz and Azure Stones, that lie in and upon the Ground: They are ſometimes waſht into the Rivers by the great Rain and Water Floods. In the River that runs from <hi>Saffrigam</hi> (which was once a Dutch Fortification, but now left) one may find abundance of little Rubies, and ſometimes a pretty large one; the very Sand of that River is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the ſame ſubſtance with the Stones, being of a Red and Blue Colour. We often uſed to go to bath in that River, and ſeek for precious Stones, but not when the Water was high, for fear of the Crocodiles; though it was not worth any Man's while, unleſs he could ſwim, and venture to dive in the deepeſt places for 'em; becauſe it is there only that thoſe of any conſiderable bigneſs are to be found.</p>
               <p>There is a little rivulet that runs below this Fort, coming from between two high Hills, and diſcharges or empties it ſelf into the River, in which are found Saphyrs, Emeralds, Topaz and Lazule-Stones:
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:100310:173"/>
We have walk'd many a day in this Water for two or three Miles an end, to look for 'em. We had little Basket-nets which the <hi>Amboineſes</hi> lent us; and we us'd to thruſt the Nets into holes, and fetch'd out good and bad together, and ſhake out of the Net all the Sand and Gravel, and the Stones that were of any bigneſs remain'd. Thoſe that had no Net made but but little on't. The Elephants us'd to be very troubleſome to us, and we were forc'd often to go ſome Miles about to avoid them, and I for my part was always provided with a Gun againſt them; and for fear too of Tygers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>
               <p>A ſmall account of the Nature of theſe Stones will not be unpleaſant to the Reader; wherefore I will, as far as I know, give as brief an account of them as I can:</p>
               <p>And firſt for the Rubies, they grow in a reddiſh, ſtony, ſandy Ground, one Fathom or two deep, ſpreading themſelves like Veins, and though the great Floods carry them away in the Rivers; they keep their Beauty and Colour as well under water as under ground, but if the water runs off of them, and leaves them ever ſo little expoſed to the Sun, they turn as black as a Coal.</p>
               <p>The Saphirs grow in a hard bluiſh ground, about a Fathom deep, and in veins too, and are waſht likewiſe into the Rivers by the violent Rains and Flood. Some are as big as the top of one's Finger;</p>
               <p>So are Emeralds, Topazes, and Lazule-ſtones, theſe are as Red as Fire, and as Blue as the Skie.</p>
               <p>Another ſort of ſtone is found here, call'd Cat's Eyes: Theſe are ſo call'd from their colour, which is a changable Blue and White.</p>
               <p>Red, Blue, Yellow, Black, and White Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal is to be found every where, and is very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to Men upon their March, when they go bare-foot,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:100310:174"/>
as all our Men did, but they find an Herb ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry common there, which they call Horſe-foot, that cures them in two or three days time.</p>
               <p>Some of our Company us'd to frequent thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers every day, and at laſt all of 'em contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Diſtemper, and that was all that ſome got by it; wherefore our Officers gave orders that no man ſhould go any more into the water upon that deſign.</p>
               <p>On a certain time that I was upon no Duty, I went about a League from the Fort, where I ſpy'd an old Cingulayan, with his two Sons, in the River ſeeking Stones: I took care to come up to them without being diſcovered, leaſt they ſhould have ſlipt away; I ask'd 'em if they had found any ſtones, one of 'em anſwer'd, <hi>Netti Ralu,</hi> which is, no Sir; I would not believe him, ſo I ſearch'd his Cloaths, and found in ſome of his Buttons, among other little Saphyrs, one that was about the bigneſs of a Hazel Nut. I askt him if he would ſell it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it at firſt, but at laſt he offer'd it me, and two ſmall ones with it, for half a Dollar, Dutch Mony. I had at that preſent time no Mony by me, and I durſt not take it by force from the old Fellow nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe he was a ſubject of the Dutch; and what to do I could not tell, having a great mind to the ſtone too: I had a piece of Chryſtal in my Pocket, which I took out, and convey'd the Saphir into my mouth; ſo I told him I would give him his price if he would go to <hi>Sittawack,</hi> and offering to give him it again, to keep till then, I let the Piece of Chryſtal fall into the Water, he thinking it was his ſtone, cry'd out, <hi>O Deine Balatie,</hi> which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, Plague it is gone: I ſeem'd concern'd, and told him he might find it again. He and his Sons went to ſeck for it, but to no purpoſe: They were mighty ſorry for their loſs; I told them I would make them ſome recompence, and took them with
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:100310:174"/>
me to <hi>Sittawack,</hi> where I gave them three ſhillings, and they went away very well ſatisfied. I made uſe of this ſtratagem, becauſe if I had left the ſtone in their keeping, they would have miſtruſted me, and never have come to the Fort after me.</p>
               <p>The Tenth of March I went with two other Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran Gentlemen, (each of us having a Gun with us,) to the Hill, where we had not long ſince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the two Pagods, to ſee what condition they were in. We found them ruin'd as we had left them, and poked again in the dark hole; But I believe we had routed the Devil the time before, for we could not make him roar any more, do what we could. At the bottom of the Hill I ſaw abundance of fine Cocks and Hens, and I bought ſome of the Hens and one Cock of an old Woman they belong'd to. She told me that the Cock I bought was conſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated for an Offering, while the Pagods ſtood, and therefore that I ſhould not kill him, and that he would beat any Cock whatſoever. I laugh'd at the ſtory, and yet was a little afraid becauſe it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for the Devil, and did not know but he might come and fetch him. However I ventur'd upon him, and paid as I did for my Hens, a Dutch peny for each of them. Being come to the Fort, I let him run there: In two or three days he fought and beat every Cock in the Fort that he could come nigh. Every Body wondred at the ſierceneſs of this little Cock, and I began to think that what the old Woman had told me might be true. At laſt I made a trade of Cock-ſighting, and I got all the Amboineſes about me. They laid wagers among themſelves, and I only won the Cocks that mine beat, which amounted to two or three and thirty. At laſt they ignorantly hit the Nail on the head, ſaying that the Devil was in him. Being to go to <hi>Columbo</hi> again, I took him with me, and thought he would have done as great feats there, but he was
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:100310:175"/>
overmatched with a Cock that came from <hi>Tutucurini,</hi> that beat him luſtily.</p>
               <p>The 2d of March, A <hi>Laſerin</hi> came to Town, and told us that an Elephant was fall'n into the King's Well, on the other ſide of the River. I went with ſeveral others, and ſaw him lye at the bottom ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed together, ſtanding almoſt up an end, but his Legs bent, and he was very uneaſie. We took ſome Fig leaves which we threw down to him; he took 'em very thankfully, and eat them. At laſt he lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up his Proboſes, and made a horrid noiſe, which we interpreted as a begging us to help him out; but he lying 12 Fathoms deep, we could not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly do it. One of our Drummers was there with us; who having been purſued one time by an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, as he was Hunting, knew this to be the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, that had put him ſo hard to his ſhifts; for if it had not been for a large Tree that he climb'd up into, he had certainly been kill'd. The Drummer to be reveng'd of him, went the next day by himſelf, threw a great many dry ſticks upon him, and ſome ſtraw, and ſet it all on Fire, and then came home and told us the exploit.</p>
               <p>The 3d of the ſame Month about 8 or 9 of the Clock at night, We felt a very violent Earthquake coming from the Northward, which ſhook our Block-houſe extreamly. All the Men that lay in the Guard Room were awaked out of their ſleep, and thought it was an Alarm. Ev'ry body would make haſte to come out, and ev'ry body would be firſt down ſtairs. The Throng was intolerable; and in the buſtle the Lamp went out, which made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Confuſion; ſo that at laſt very few went out as they ſhould do, but fell down ſtairs. We felt three ſeveral ſhakes, the laſt of which was ſo very violent, that we thought the whole Iſland would have been loſt; and we heard from the Seamen that lay in the Road before <hi>Columbo,</hi> that they had felt
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:100310:175"/>
it very ſenſibly too. What concluſions may be drawn from this, of the cauſes of Earthquakes, I leave Naturaliſts to agree about if they pleaſe or can.</p>

                  <p>The Author, with three others, go a Hunting. They meet with Elephants, and kill one of them. All ſorts of venomous Creatures come to <hi>Sittawack,</hi> to ſave themſelves from the Water, that overflow'd all the Land about it. Their manner of Hunting. Envoys that came to bring Preſents to the King of <hi>Candi,</hi> kept Priſoners by him. Two Engliſh-men kept for Slaves in <hi>Candi,</hi> make their eſcape, and come to <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawack;</hi> they tell a pleaſant Story of a Country fellow that had uſed a Ruby for a Whetſtone ſeveral Years.

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Spent all the Month of March in Hunting, and I liv'd altogether upon what Game I uſed to bring home with me. Upon a certain night the Moon being at Full (knowing it would be light all night) I, with three Gentlemen more, went out into a fair Plain, about a league from <hi>Sittawack,</hi> where we deſign'd to have ſome Stags. We ſet our ſelves down at the ſide of a Hill, to watch the wild Beaſts, that we expected would come out of a Wood to feed where we were, there being very fine Graſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:100310:176"/>
The firſt that appear'd were Bufflars, among which there was a Stag; they came directly to the place where one of our Company was (who was a Swede) and did not know what Creature it was. As ſoon as theſe came to ſmell him, they took to the top of the Hill again immediately, and made a great noiſe there. On the other ſide we heard ſeveral E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lephants making towards us. About Mid-night, being tir'd with ſitting, we got together to ask one another's Advice, what we ſhould do, when the Elephants came. We reſolv'd to fall upon them; becauſe we concluded they kept the Game from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Dale, and ſo ſpoil'd our ſport.</p>
               <p>When we got into the middle of the Plain, an Elephant broke out of the Wood, and run at us immediately; We took to our Heels, and run as faſt as we could to the place where we firſt ſat down; there we took Courage again, and reſolv'd to go on again, and that not one of us would run away, as we had done before: At the left hand of the Plain, we ſaw two great Elephants by a Tree eating the Leaves of it.</p>
               <p>The Swede would ſhew the greateſt Courage, and went foremoſt; and being within 60 paces of 'em, fir'd upon them, but they did not ſtir for all that: After that I went a little nearer, and ſhot one of of them in the Head, which made him make a moſt hideous noiſe; and then they ran off into the Wood again.</p>
               <p>We heard on the other ſide of us ſome more of 'em, and went towards 'em: We heard where they were, but we could not ſee 'em; for they were feeding about a Tree that had boughs which reach'd down to the ground, amongſt which they ſtood like ſo many Horſes at a Manger. We came cloſe to the very Tree, where they were, and yet could only hear 'em. I went a little on one ſide of the Tree, and then diſcover'd a terrible huge Elephant,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:100310:176"/>
with four ſmall ones beſides, about ten paces from me. My Gun was cock'd, and I, having overcome that little Pannick fear that ſeiz'd me at firſt, gave fire upon the biggeſt, and hit him juſt on the head, which made him roar luſtily. Then I retir'd, and another ſtept in, who fir'd likewiſe, and then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo we kept firing three times a piece round. The Elephants gave ground, but not above 20 or 30 paces, and ſet up a hideous roaring.</p>
               <p>We did not think it ſafe to purſue any more Game; So we went back to <hi>Sittawack.</hi> The next morning the neighbouring Cingulayans came down to the Valley, to ſee what was done there, having heard much ſhooting in the night; They found an Elephant, with two very ſine teeth, lye dead. They gave an account of it to our chief Officer, who ſent immediately for me, and ask'd if we had ſhot the Elephant: I told him it was probable, becauſe we had been purſued in the night by ſome of 'em, which oblig'd us to fire upon 'em. This was the only reaſon that could ſerve to excuſe us; for it is ſtrictly forbidden to ſhoot any Elephants, unleſs a Man is in danger of his Life. Our Officer ſent word of it to the Governor of <hi>Columbo,</hi> and ſent withal the Elephant's two Teeth. The Fleſh of this kind of Animals is good for nothing; the Fat is uſed for Lamps, the reſt was left in the place.</p>
               <p>In April it rain'd ſo violently, that we were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overwhelm'd with Water. The Amboineſes, who, as I told you before, liv'd in the Town, were forc'd to be taken into the Fort, with their Wives and Children; Men, and Beaſts, both tame and wild, were drove up into the Mountains: And our Fort was very full of Serpents, Scorpions, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venomous Creatures. We did what we could to keep them out, by making Fires at all the Gates and Poſts where the Sentinels ſtood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:100310:177"/>
The Rains abated in May, and likewiſe the Floods; and that Month I ſaw nothing remarkable, but that the Elephants ſhew'd themſelves in vaſt Numbers about our Fort. Moſt nights of this Month I went a Hunting with Cingulayan Sports-men, and with them I had always good Sport; and brought ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as much home as would ſerve the whole Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. An Indian uſed to go foremoſt, with a lighted Torch upon his Head, and a Stick in his Hand, to which ſome Shells are tyed looſe; and he goes along ſhaking of 'em, making a continual rat'ling. As ſoon as any Bufflers, Harts, or Hares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hear this, and ſee the Fire, they come towards it, and within ſhot of the fellow; then he that goes behind him ſhoots as many as he pleaſes of 'em. But the fellows ſometimes are in danger of being run at by an Elephant, who now and then purſues them, and puts 'em to it very hard, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Fire, and the ratt'ling of their Shells.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of July, There came an Envoy from <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo</hi> to <hi>Sittawack,</hi> call'd <hi>Mierop:</hi> He had with him an Ambaſſador from the King of <hi>Perſia.</hi> He rode in a very fine curious Chariot, made after the Perſian manner, drawn by two Oxen, cover'd with fine white Linnen. His Preſents for the King of <hi>Candi</hi> were two white Lions, three Tygers, twelve Musk-Cats, all carry'd in very neat Cages, lin'd with green Velvet. Two black Perſian Horſes, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd likewiſe with green Velvet; and twenty Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, carry'd by ſo many black Malabarian Slaves. The Letter was carry'd by the Dutch Ambaſſador in a Silver Cup, and over him was a Canopy carry'd by 4 Cingulayan Noblemen bare-headed.</p>
               <p>The 2d, We guarded theſe Preſents as far as a place, call'd The <hi>Devil's Tree,</hi> by <hi>Ruenel;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given our Ambaſſadors three Vollies, we left them. They went forwards with their Preſents
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:100310:177"/>
to <hi>Buare-Birge,</hi> which is in the King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. As ſoon as the King heard of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, he gave orders to have them all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and provided Neceſſaries for the Men, and the Beaſts they brought along with them; and to keep them in cloſe cuſtody till further orders. And it is a queſtion whether or no they will ever be ſet at liberty: For it is above 22 years ſince one <hi>John Baptiſta</hi> was ſent thither as an Envoy from the Dutch, and another Ambaſſador ſent from the French Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of <hi>Trinconomala,</hi> who are there ſtill, kept in Priſon and in Fetters, without any hopes of being ever free, as long as this King lives.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Conſinement, they live very hard; for tho' the King allows them neceſſaries (and thoſe it may be not in great plenty neither) the King's Officers convert the half of them to their own Uſe and Profit.</p>
               <p>On this ſame day, Two gray Old Men came to us in the Fort of <hi>Sittawack,</hi> dreſs'd after the Cingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layan manner. They told us that they came about 20 years ſince to <hi>Calpintin</hi> with an Engliſh Ship, and that they, with ten other Seamen, being ſent on ſhore to this Iſland to fetch Proviſions, Water, and Wood, they were trapann'd by ſome Candians, who ſent them to <hi>Candi,</hi> where they had been kept Priſoners all that while every one of 'em. That the other ten were dead, and they two had ventur'd their Lives to make their eſcape, and had left their Black Wives behind them. They had been eight days a coming (or rather eight nights, that being the only time they could travel in, being forc'd to lye hid all day in the Woods). They had heard that day the ſhooting from our Fort, and judged it, by that, to be a place in the Hands of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; and were over-joy'd to find themſelves deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd out of the power of their cruel Maſter, the King of <hi>Candi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:100310:178"/>
One of them was a Gunner, the other a Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and both ſpoke beſides, Engliſh, very good Cingulaian and Portugueſe: The Gunner told us a great many paſſages of his Life, during their Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; and amongſt other Relations, deſcribed to us the Richneſs of the King of <hi>Candi</hi>'s Warlike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments: His Carriages are all over-laid with Gold and Silver, and inlaid with Rubies and Saphyrs. He told us that he had ſeen once a great Ruby that a Cingulaian Peaſant had found, and carried home to uſe for a Whet-ſtone, and had whetted his Knives and Hatchets with it for ſome Years. A certain Field Officer of the King of <hi>Candi</hi> happening to go to that Contryman's Houſe, ſaw it, and carried it to the King, who ſent immediatly for the Country Fellow, and askt him what he would have for his Whetſtone: The poor fellow told the King that he had found it in the River of <hi>Bibliogam,</hi> and that it was at his ſervice, and that he could get another ſtone to do his buſineſs as well. This innocent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſatisfied the King that he did not know the value of his Jewel; for had he known it, it would have coſt him his life. The King diſmiſt him, and commanded ſome Land and Cattle to be given him, ordering him for the time to come to let ſuch ſtones lie whenever he found 'em.</p>
               <p>The 3d Inſtant theſe two poor Engliſh Men were ſent in a Boat to <hi>Columbo;</hi> I went along with them to introduce them to the Governor, who received us with extraordinary courteſie, and after a great many queſtions to ſatisfie his curioſity, ſent for Cloaths, which he freely preſented them with, and then took them to his Table, and very civilly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to ſtay in his Houſe till ſome opportunity offer'd it ſelf to ſend them to <hi>Batavia,</hi> where they might eaſily get an Engliſh Ship to carry them to <hi>Bantam.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:100310:178"/>
The 4th I went back with two Soldiers to <hi>Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tawack,</hi> where I continued till</p>
               <p>The 12th; when we were all relieved by a freſh Company from <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 15th we march'd from <hi>Sittawack</hi> in the Morning, and came at Night to <hi>Columbo.</hi> I pack'd up amongſt my things, two or three hundred of <hi>Bulat</hi> Leaves, which two Cingulayans carried after me. Theſe Leaves I have already told you are chew'd commonly by the Inhabitants; ſo I brought them to make a preſent of to my Landlady. I can't tell whether Heaven deſign'd me an occaſion of making my Fortune or no, but however it was, I refus'd laying hold on it; and how it was I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late in ſhort. My Landlady treated me very civilly from the firſt time of my coming to her Houſe, where I paid her 3 Rixdollers by the Month, and had a very good Table, and what Suri I pleas'd at Meals: Her entertainment grew in time kinder and kinder; and then it broke out into ſome prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary interrogations, why I would not ſettle there? Why I would not Marry? and many things of that kind; at laſt it came to a cloſe application, and to a plain offer of her ſelf, if I would marry. When I conſidered her on one ſide, as to her Fortune, I muſt confeſs ſhe did not altogether diſpleaſe me. Her firſt Husband was a ſubſtantial free Merchant at <hi>Columbo,</hi> call'd <hi>John Chriſtantz;</hi> he was owner of of a Ship, with which he had often been at <hi>Bengal</hi> at the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> and drove there a conſiderable Trade, but going there again in the year 1678, was caſt away with a <hi>Hurrican,</hi> and he and his ſhip loſt. What ſhe loſt by this accident I do not know, but ſhe was left worth near thirty thouſand Ducats, and twenty Slaves from <hi>Bengal</hi> which ſhe uſed very inhumanly: But the Figure ſhe made never would permit me to entertain a thought of marrying her, but that other People may judge
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:100310:179"/>
whether I was too nice, or but reaſonably ſo, I will give ſome deſcription of her: I did not diſlike her merely for her being Black, but methoughts her Ears, though they were richly ſet out with Gold, look'd but hideouſly, being longer than my Hand: Her Hair, that would reach down to her Heels, ſhe would beſmear every Day with Oyl made of Coco-Nuts, and then wind it up on her Head, juſt as we ſerve Horſes in <hi>Holland,</hi> when they have long Tails: She wore a little ſhort ſort of a Waſtcoat that hardly covered her Breaſts, faſtned with Gold Buttons; from the Breaſt down to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Navel ſhe was Naked. The beſt part of her Dreſs was from beneath the Navel downwards, having a Linnen Garment down to the Feet, and another-like one at top of that, ſomething longer than the under one: She had a great Necklace round her Neck made of Gold and Ivory: She ſpoke no Dutch, but Portugueſe and Cingulaiſh, which were her Father and Mother's Languages, and the Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian which is much the ſame. All theſe things together were ſo far from raiſing any Paſſion for her, that they were a preſervative againſt it, ſo I e'en left her as I found her.</p>
               <p>There were at this time two Sloops and a Yacht ready to ſet ſail for the Coaſt of Malabar, there to hinder the Malabarians Boats in their Pepper Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: I was ſent to command them, and had my choice of Men out of all the Company: After that I pick'd them out that I liked beſt, I took twenty of them with my ſelf on board the Yatch, call'd the <hi>Trinconomala,</hi> and in each of the two Sloops went 12 Men, and 7 Seamen.</p>
               <p>The 18th. in the Evening we ſet ſail. I had with me beſides my twenty Men, a Steerſman, and 15 Seamen; and I put off with our Flags and Pendants as Commadore from <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:100310:179"/>
The 19th, 20th, 21ſt, and 22d, we ſaw no Land: We had the wind for us, but the ſtream was contrary to us.</p>
               <p>The 23d, we eſpied land in the Forenoon, and in the Afternoon we came before the Town <hi>Couchin,</hi> which belong'd heretofore to the Portugueſe. I went to the Commadore that lay there, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd my Letter to him from the Governor of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo.</hi> The next Day he joyn'd us with another Sloop well Mann'd, and gave us inſtructions how we might beſt annoy the Malabarians.</p>
               <p>The 25th we went to Sea again, and there Cruiſed along the Coaſt up to <hi>Goa,</hi> a Portugueſe Town. We were in a continual Chaſe, and all the Boats that we met loaden with Cardamunga, and Pepper, and could not produce a Dutch Paſs, we took. Their Proviſions and Goods we ſtow'd in our Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and ſunk theirs; but many of the Malabarian Veſſels being little ones, kept in the Shallows near the Land, where we could not come, ours drawing much more Water than theirs did, and thoſe were ſecure enough.</p>
               <p>The 6th of October, we went back to <hi>Couchin,</hi> and brought thither fifty Malabarian Priſoners with us, and a great deal of Onions, Pepper, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damunga, Rice, and Dry Fiſh. I acquainted the Commadore with what I had done, and brought with me, and he left all the Booty amongſt us, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Pepper, which he kept to himſelf.</p>
               <p>Here we ſtay'd till the 20th of November, and found it much better living than in <hi>Ceylon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 21ſt, we went back homewards, and arrived happily at <hi>Columbo</hi> on the 29th about three of the Clock in the Afternoon: I deliver'd to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor my Letters from <hi>Couchin,</hi> and every one went to his reſpective Poſt. We had but two Men dy'd in the Expedition, they were ſhot with two Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:100310:180"/>
                  <hi>Aſſagayen</hi> or Darts; and one Seaman had his Arm ſhot off by a Gun that burſt in the firing.</p>
               <p>The 30th, a Maſter Gunner call'd <hi>Henry Scholten</hi> was ſhot to death, he was a Lutheran, and would not hearken to any inſtructions or advice that our Proteſtant Miniſter offer'd him: But being come to the place of Execution, he pray'd for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Three Muskets were fired upon him, which diſpatch'd him in an inſtant. Then his Friends took him and put him in a Coffin, and buried him. The ſame day two Moors of <hi>Volkendal</hi> that had been catch'd at <hi>Aripen</hi> by the Pearl-bank, were ſoundly whipt, all their cry was <hi>Apoi Paring, Apoi Paring</hi> in Malabarian, that is to ſay, Mercy Sirs, Mercy Sirs; at laſt they hung their Heads on one ſide, which made me think they were dead; but as ſoon as the whipping was over, they held up their Heads briskly again. The Executioner rubb'd their wounds afterwards with Pepper and Salt, and they were kept in Fetters, as belonging properly to the Company.</p>
               <p>I was now offer'd a Poſt, which I thought more advantagious, and not expos'd to ſo much Fatigue, which was to be Overſeer of the 12 Clerks belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Eaſt India Company: I accepted of it, and entred into the Office on the 1ſt of December. The Chief of that Office was one <hi>Walter Vander Beek.</hi> It was open from Seven till Ten in the Morning, and from Two till Six in the Afternoon, all which time there was buſineſs enough for the Twelve Clerks.</p>
               <p>I Dieted all this while with my long-ear'd Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, who continu'd asking me why I would not marry: I told her I would have her if ſhe would leave off Oyling her Hair, and let her Ears be clipt into ſhape; at which ſhe ſhook her Head, and ſaid in a doleful manner that ſhe would die firſt.</p>
               <p>

There was at this time a Jew that had liv'd a conſiderable time in the Houſe of a Cingulaiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, and had been very familiar with his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, tho' not Marry'd to her: He had a grievous fit of Sickneſs, during which ſhe was ſo faithful and ſerviceable to him, that he promis'd her Marriage as ſoon as he ſhould be recover'd. Being got up again, ſhe purſued him to make good his Promiſe; but the Jew refus'd it out of meer ſhame of being ſeen at Church with ſuch a long-ear'd Creature; and told her that was the only reaſon he could give her for going back from his Word. She, to remedy that, conſented to have her Ears cut into better faſhion, and had it done accordingly; after which the Jew Marry'd her in <hi>Columbo</hi> on a Sunday. A little while after he fell Lame, both in his Hands and Feet, and nothing but misfortunes befell him. The cauſe of all this he imputed wholly to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing turn'd Chriſtian; and look'd upon all as a juſt Judgment upon him for having forſaken the Jewiſh Religion: Bitterly Curſing the hour he had ever been Baptized. Another Jew, a Convert likewiſe, Marry'd at the ſame time a Black young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Malabar,</hi> very Rich; but this Marriage proved more happy than the other.</p>
               <p>Being occaſionally come to treat of Marriages, I will give you ſome Account how they are perform'd at <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Parties being agreed before-hand, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom comes, with two or three of his Friends, to the Bride's Houſe, where ſhe is dreſs'd in fine white Linnen and fine Flowers, to receive him. Her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother, if ſhe has any, are to be preſent there; and ſo are any two Perſons that were at her Baptiſm. The Certificate being produc'd, the Bride and Bridegroom give one another a Ring; after this they make merry. The next Sunday af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it, the Names are publiſh'd three times in the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:100310:181"/>
Church; and the Tueſday after that, they are Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd. When they go to Church, they have ſeveral Balliators, or Leapers, that go before them Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all the way. Then goes the Bride between two Women, with a fine Umbrella over her Head; then the Bridegroom between two of his Friends. The Ceremony being ended; when the Bride is come home again, every one in the Room Sprinkles her with Roſe-water, and throws an handful of Flowers upon her. Then they have a Wedding-Dinner, which is always given by the Maid's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Mother at their Houſe: When the new Couple are got to Bed, they fall a-beating Drums, Tamelins, and other Inſtruments, for about an hour; the Balliators all the while Dancing, and making a great noiſe. The next day they go about a mile or two out of Town, where they have a Dinner at ſome Publick-Houſe, which is generally given by the two Bride-men.</p>
               <p>Any European in <hi>Ceylon</hi> may marry any Woman he pleaſes: But if he is in the Dutch Service, the Marriage is not permitted; unleſs a Teſtimonial is given of the Woman's being Chriſten'd, under the Miniſter's Hand and Seal.</p>
               <p>Theſe Women pretend to have a much greater Inclination and Love for a white Man, than for their own Country-men: So that, if there is any Credit to be given to 'em, one might be pretty ſecure of keeping one's Wife to himſelf, at leaſt, from a black Rival. But I have known many Inſtances to the contrary, of Women that have been brought to Bed with black Children, which never happens if a Woman keeps conſtantly to an European; and ſeveral complaints I have known made of this kind to the Miniſters. Many indeed chooſe rather to to take no notice of it, than to expoſe themſelves by making their complaint; but if any brought it to an Examination, and it was either found out or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd;
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:100310:181"/>
both ſhe and the Adulterer were ſeverely Whipp'd, and made Slaves of, together with the Brats. There liv'd a Shoe-maker in the Old City of <hi>Columbo,</hi> that had marry'd a <hi>Maſtize,</hi> (ſo they call a Woman that hath had a white Father and a black Mother,) her Father and Mother were very honeſt People, and my great acquaintance; (he was a Brewer of <hi>Columbo,</hi> and one of the Burghers): The young Couple had not been marry'd above ſix or ſeven Months, when a Malabarian, one of the Waſhers, came as it is uſual at <hi>Columbo</hi> for them to go twice a-week to fetch People's foul Linnen) to this Man's Houſe, and ſinding the Woman alone at Home, courted her to comply in his ruſtical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, promiſing to Waſh her Linnen for nothing. The Woman pretended to like the bargain well enough, but told him ſhe could not for the preſent do it with ſafety, but the next opportunity ſhe would grant him his deſire. The fellow went home very well ſatisfy'd with the hopes of his future Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But when the Shoe-maker came home, his Wife very faithfully tells him all that had paſſed between them: The Man was not a little glad to find his Wife ſo virtuous, and deſir'd her to admit him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Room, where he deſign'd to lay wait for him. At the time appointed the Malabarian came, and the Woman, according to promiſe, gave the ſignal; upon which the Shoemaker and a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his came out, each of 'em having a good Club, and fell upon the poor Malabarian, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl'd him from any ſuch attempts for the future. A ſhort time after this the young Woman dy'd, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been poiſon'd by ſome Blacks, for being ſo faithful to a White.</p>
               <p>Their marrying with the Whites is (I am apt to think) generally more out of Policy, and to have the advantage of living more ſecure and free among
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:100310:182"/>
the Europeans, who have all the power in their hands, than out of any true love for 'em.</p>
               <p>The Women live very lazy Lives; they chaw Betel and ſmoak Tobacco, all day long; they are very neat, and waſh themſelves all over every day. The Man hath all the Care of the Houſe upon him; and they have generally two Slaves, the one to go to Market, the other to dreſs the Victuals.</p>
               <p>I will, now I am treating of <hi>Columbo,</hi> give you ſome Deſcription of that City.</p>
               <p>I have already told you how it was built by the Portugueſe; but when the Dutch Eaſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany took poſſeſſion of it, they Demoliſh'd many parts, and Re-built others after the Dutch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and to this day they are building at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and City. The Caſtle hath on the Weſt-ſide, the Sea; on the North-Eaſt, the City; on the South-Eaſt, a ſweet River: It is fortify'd with ſeveral Bulwarks, each of which hath 20 or 30 Guns; a very good Counterſcarp; and there are ſo many Rocks on the Sea-ſide, that no Ships can come near it.</p>
               <p>There is a broad Channel runs all round it, where one may ſee every day Crocodiles in abundance: It hath three Gates, one to the South-Weſt, call'd <hi>Port de Gala;</hi> about a Muſquet-ſhot off, on the ſide that goes to <hi>Galture,</hi> the Land about it is richly fill'd with Orchards and Gardens, full of fine Fruit-trees, which reach a mile or two: The other Gate is call'd the <hi>Delfsche Port,</hi> from the Baſtion which is juſt by it, that bears that Name. This Gate is toward the City, and the way to it hath the Sea all along on one ſide, and a deep Ditch on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a large Field call'd the <hi>Buffler's Plain,</hi> which they can lay all under Water when they pleaſe, by opening a Sluce. The third Gate, which is Northward, hath the Name of <hi>Water-Port;</hi> on the left ſide of that is the <hi>Water-Paſs,</hi> guarded by
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:100310:182"/>
many Cannon, that command all the Ships that lye in the Road. Within the Caſtle are many pretty Walks of Nut-trees, ſet in an uniform Order, but they bear no Fruit, only red and white Flowers: The Streets are pleaſant walks themſelves; having Trees on both ſides, and before the Houſes. The Caſtle contains about 40 Acres of Land. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, all the Merchants, Officers, and Soldiers, have their Dwelling within it; and without the Walls, between them and the Sea, are the Huts, where near four thouſand Slaves, belonging to the Company, lye at night. They are of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and are conſtantly kept at work: Their Huts are very little, made up with nothing but Straw and Leaves. There are Dutch-men to look over 'em, who are call'd <hi>Mucadons;</hi> each of theſe have 70, 80, 90, or 100 to overſee, and muſt give an account of 'em.</p>
               <p>There is likewiſe a very large place for Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, two ſtrong Cellars for Gun-powder, and Magazines for the Merchants, and a Church; and behind that, a very fine Stable, commonly full of Perſian Horſes. There is alſo a Powder Wind-mill by <hi>Port de Gala,</hi> and by the <hi>Water-Paſs,</hi> a Wind-mill to ſaw Boards, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The City of <hi>Columbo</hi> is much larger than the Caſtle, by reaſon of the large Trees and Gardens that are in it; and it is very well fortify'd with five Bulwarks, call'd, <hi>Victoria, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantia, Concordia, Haerlem,</hi> and <hi>Euckhuyſen.</hi> It hath on the North the Road where the Ships lye; on the other ſide the River that is full of Crocodiles. It hath three Gates, the one (as I ſaid juſt now) is call'd the <hi>Delfsche-Port,</hi> the ſecond is not far from that, and goes toward the Sea; the third is the <hi>Port-Victoria,</hi> or <hi>Negumbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inhabitants are a mixture of Officers, Soldiers, Burghers, and Tradeſmen, Blacks and Whites, and others: For which reaſon the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:100310:183"/>
are oblig'd to keep a careful watch every night. The Streets are always very clean, tho' it Rain never ſo much. There is an Hoſpital for the Dutch, very well provided with able Surgeons, and they with very good Medicines, and Slaves allow'd them. The chief Doctor, that had the Care of it in my time, was in very ill Repute for his ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of thoſe that came under his Hands, and for ſeveral ill Actions he was accus'd of; and, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, of having a pretty while been too familiar with a Slave of his, and then Killing of her, and Burying her in his Garden.</p>
               <p>Not far from that is an Hoſpital for Dutch Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans: The Boys are taught to Read and Write; after that they are made either Drummers or Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers: The Girls, beſides Reading and Writing, are taught to Sew, or any other Employment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their Sex; and there they are kept to work till ſome-body comes to marry 'em, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly happens by that time they are 12 or 13 years of Age.</p>
               <p>The Dutch Church-yard is in the middle of the City, enclos'd with a Wall, on which a Malabarian School ſtands: On the out-ſide of the Church-yard, there is Sold, all the Week long, Silks, Stuffs, and Linnen, by the Moors and Perſians; and all ſorts of Fruits, dry'd Fiſh, Onions, Sugar and Rice, by the Malabarians, Maldivians, and Cingulayans, and other Inhabitants of <hi>Columbo.</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the Year 1680, We had three unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents: The one was, That a Ship being come from <hi>Holland</hi> by <hi>Batavia,</hi> and lying at Anchor in the Road near <hi>Columbo;</hi> it had brought a great quantity of Gun-Powder for the uſe of this City; the Inhabitants thereof had already loaded their Boats with 80 Barrels of it, and were ſo near Land, that they prepar'd for haling of it to ſhore: A Boy, belonging to the Maſter of the Boat, ſtood ſmoaking with a Pipe in his Mouth; which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſeeing, gave him ſuch a box on the Ear, that he daſh'd his Pipe into the next Boat, where ſome Powder being ſcatter'd, took Fire, and blew up that Boat, and, in the twinkling of an Eye, the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:100310:184"/>
two next; and not only ſo, but alſo, all the People that ſtood upon the ſhore had a toſs in the Air.</p>
               <p>Another was, That two Ships lying at Anchor in the Road, and the Wind growing very violent, broke their Cables, and ſtranded them againſt the Fiſh-market; but all the Men ſaved their Lives.</p>
               <p>The 9th of December, Two great Ships call'd the <hi>Africa,</hi> and the <hi>Cortegeene,</hi> came from <hi>Perſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having now ſtaid ſeven months over and above the five years I was oblig'd to, in the Service of the Eaſt-India Company, I deſign'd to have gone off with thoſe Ships, but the Governor refus'd to diſcharge me for that time, under pretence of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to me.</p>
               <p>They ſail'd away on the 10th from <hi>Columbo</hi> to the City <hi>Punt de Gala,</hi> to take in Pepper and Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. I made my complaint that I was detain'd wholly againſt my will, to the chief Merchant of the Company; he told me I ſhould go, and that I ſhould ſtay but ſome days; that a Veſſel was daily expected to come from <hi>Bengal,</hi> and was to take up ſeveral other Perſons here, and then to go for our Country.</p>
               <p>The 11th, News came from <hi>Punt de Gala,</hi> by Land, that the ſaid Veſſel was come in there from <hi>Bengal,</hi> well loaded with Salt-peter, but had no Maſts left.</p>
               <p>On the 12th, Some Carpenters and three Maſts were ſent in a ſmall Veſſel to refit the Ship, and get it ready to go with the two others for <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 14th, I went to the <hi>Aldee</hi> or Village, call'd <hi>Batalamulo,</hi> two miles from <hi>Columbo,</hi> where I took my leave of our General <hi>Diſſave Tennekool</hi> (that was come over to us from the King of <hi>Candi.)</hi> He entertain'd me very civilly at Dinner, and order'd four Cingulayans to carry me back in a <hi>Palankin,</hi>
                  <pb n="347" facs="tcp:100310:184"/>
to <hi>Columbo,</hi> and preſented me with 200 preſerv'd Citrons for my Voyage.</p>
               <p>The 15th, My Captain invited me at night to a very handſom Supper.</p>
               <p>On the 16th, A very rich Portugueſe, call'd <hi>Don de Pairo,</hi> living at <hi>Matual,</hi> a league from <hi>Columbo,</hi> ſent an Elephant for me to come to his Houſe, where he receiv'd me with a noble Entertainment of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and a ſplendid Feaſt: I ſpent that night with him; during which he uſed a great deal of Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric to perſwade me to ſtay, and ask'd me, why I would venture ſo hazardous a Voyage, ſeeing I liv'd ſo pleaſantly there, and ſo much belov'd in that Country; but all this was in vain: My Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations for my own Country were to me the moſt prevailing Arguments.</p>
               <p>On the 17th, I took my leave of him, and thank'd him very heartily; and he lent me an Elephant to carry me back.</p>
               <p>On the 18th, I took my leave of my Friends at the Office at <hi>Columbo,</hi> and</p>
               <p>On the 19th, My Landlady invited me, with ſome others of her Friends and Acquaintance: She ſeem'd very much diſcontented with my leaving of her thus, yet would ſhew her ſelf kind to the laſt; and preſented me with abundance of Fruit and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But when I came to Sea, I threw all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, for fear ſome trick or philter ſhould have been play'd with them, which is uſual here.</p>
               <p>The 20th, The Governor ſent us word, that we ſhould get us all ready to go aboard that night; about four of the Clock in the afternoon, we went on board, and took all our Goods with us. Our Ship was but ſmall, yet it had four Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, twelve Seamen, beſides the Maſter, and the Steerſman. Our Maker was one <hi>Cornelius Eraſmus,</hi> a <hi>Jutlander,</hi> a true <hi>Pitcherman,</hi> who ſtaid at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbo</hi> to take his leave of his Wife, and Friends;
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:100310:185"/>
his Wife was a Papiſt when I knew her firſt, but he was a Lutheran. While I was at <hi>Columbo,</hi> I took a great deal of pains to convert her, and at laſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it; but I believe ſhe only embrac'd <hi>Luther</hi>'s faith becauſe it was her Husband's: I thought however ſhe had chang'd ſomewhat for the better; and I believe if I had ſtaid, I might ſtill have advis'd her better. She had a Siſter, one of the prettieſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men I almoſt ever ſaw; at leaſt, the fineſt that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was in that Country. She was a white Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and her Mother was a Babylonian. The dreſs ſhe went in was a great diſadvantage to her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being the ſame dreſs as I deſcrib'd before, when I ſpoke of the Habit my long-ear'd Widow uſed to wear.</p>
               <p>Being oblig'd to lye ſtill here till the 21th to ſtay for Letters, I went in a Fiſher-boat to <hi>Columbo</hi> to our Maſter's Houſe, where he was making very mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having ſtaid a while, he took his leave of his Wife and Siſter, who were very much griev'd at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; but they little thought it was their laſt farewel, as it prov'd the next day; for, being got into the Ship, and having weigh'd Anchor, we ſett ſail. The Wind toward night grew ſomething boyſterous; and as we came within a mile of <hi>Punt de Gala,</hi> our Ship, by the careleſſneſs of the Maſter, and Steerſman, who were carrouſing in the Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin, ſtruck upon a great Rock, call'd the <hi>Whale</hi> (which is but juſt cover'd over with Water) and ſprung a large Leak, which made the Ship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin immediately to ſink. The Maſter hearing the knock, and being ſenſible of the Danger, came out to give orders, and cry'd out we ſhould turn the Ship about; but it was too late to give Directions; ſo we prepar'd our ſelves for ſwimming; and I ſtripp'd my ſelf to my Drawers, and with ſeveral others I leap'd into the Sea; we gueſs'd by the ſcum where-abouts the ſhore was; we made that
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:100310:185"/>
way, and in leſs than half an hour we reach'd the Land: We were fifteen of us that ſav'd our ſelves by ſwimming; the reſt, being the Maſter, the Steerſman, and ten others, were all drown'd.</p>
               <p>We went to the firſt Houſe we ſaw, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to a Cingulaiſh Nobleman, who receiv'd us very kindly, had a great Fire made for us, and gave us all the refreſhment his Houſe did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
               <p>The 23th, In the morning we came before the Town of <hi>Punt de Gala.</hi> The Serjeants, Corporals, and Soldiers that kept the Guard, were mov'd with Compaſſion; and, before we went any further, gave every one of us ſome old Garments to cover our Nakedneſs; After this we were brought before the Governor, who examin'd us all, to know who was to blame for this miſcarriage. The Maſter was in all the fault we told him, but he had his Puniſhment already. The Governor order'd every one of us to have 12 Rixdollars paid us to equip our ſelves again, which was to be abated in our Accompts. Six of the Men that came from <hi>Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi> with me would not venture to Sea again; ſo they engag'd themſelves a-new for three years, in the ſervice of the Company; their Pay was augmented with two Guldens a month, and they were now to have twelve Guldens, whereas they uſed to have but ten. Orders were given to a Serjeant to take twelve men with him to go that very morning and ſee if they could recover any thing of our Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack. I went thither my ſelf in the afternoon, and ſaw a great many pieces of the Ship, and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Cheſts a-ſhore: But I ſhrewdly ſuſpected that they were broke by the Soldiers, and that they had bury'd the Goods under Ground.</p>
               <p>The 14th, Some of the Men that were drown'd were drove upon the Land; the reſt, I ſuppoſe, had feaſted the Sharks, that are there in abundance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="350" facs="tcp:100310:186"/>
The 25th, I went on board the <hi>Weſter-Amſtel,</hi> and gave my Paſs to the Maſter of it. The form of it was thus: <hi>To</hi> N. N. <hi>Maſter of the Ship, call'd the</hi> Weſter-Amſtel; <hi>You may receive on board the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hereof,</hi> Chriſtopher Schewitzer, <hi>with his Goods, to go with you into</hi> Holland.</p>
               <p>My Ship did not at all pleaſe me, for I ſaw it was very Old, and beſides that, very ſmall, and mighty ſlow in ſailing. The Carpenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were buſie in mending of it: In the mean while I went to ſhore again, and ſtaid at <hi>Punto de Gala,</hi> till the Ships were all ready, and there I took my provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. This Fort, by what I ſaw of it, is ſtronger than that of <hi>Columbo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 5th of January, 1682, All our loading was compleat; it conſiſted of Pepper, Cinnamon, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, and Silk-ſtuffs, from <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Bengal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the 13th, An Officer came to take a view of all the Paſſengers.</p>
               <p>The 14th, We hoiſted up Sail all together, with a direct Wind for us at S. E. The <hi>Cortgeene</hi> being the biggeſt Ship, was our <hi>Commadore,</hi> or Admiral. We fir'd all our Cannon: The like was done in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn all round <hi>Punto de Gala.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 15th, We kept a Faſt in our Ship, to beg God's aſſiſtance in our Voyage; all the Dutch Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Ceylon</hi> did the ſame.</p>
               <p>The 16th, The Maſters of our Ships met in the <hi>Cortgeene</hi> to adviſe and reſolve upon their ſignal, in caſe of their needing one another's aſſiſtance; and upon the Watch-word, and ordering of their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns in the night-time.</p>
               <p>The two large Ships ſail'd away briskly, but ours went very ſlowly; towards night they took in ſome of their Sails, that we might come up to them.</p>
               <p>We had in our Ship, the Maſter, three Surgeons (one of which always read Prayers) ſome Officers,
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:100310:186"/>
12 Soldiers, 24 Seamen, all together made 56 men. The two other Ships had each of 'em 150. We had beſides a great many Animals on Board, <hi>viz.</hi> Two Parrots, two Apes, two <hi>Cacadus</hi> of <hi>Amboina,</hi> (they are white Birds as big as Pigeons, with a tuſt on their Heads, and apter to learn to talk than the Parrots;) we had a Crocodile an Ell long, a Stag from <hi>Bengal:</hi> All theſe dyed in two months time, except the two Apes. We had likewiſe fifty Hogs from <hi>Bengal,</hi> and two or three dozen of Ducks for refreſhment now and then. Our otherProviſions were 60 Barrels of Water, 6 Barrels of Salt Pork, 6 of other Fleſh, 6 Barrels of Indian Brandy, and Rice enough. Our Ship was loaded at bottom with old broken pieces of Cannon inſtead of Ballaſt, then with Salt-Peter, then with 200 Laſts of Cinnamon and Pepper; and at top of all there were 250 great Bales of Silks and Linnen.</p>
               <p>We kept altogether without ſtorms, or bad wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther till the 28th of April.</p>
               <p>We were then near the Coaſts of <hi>Africa;</hi> but a thick Fog came upon us, and the Wind changing at South Weſt, blew us in one day and two nights 50 miles from Land; after which it changed to the Eaſt by which means we came,</p>
               <p>On the 30th, in ſight of <hi>Taſel-bergh, Lewen-bergh,</hi> and <hi>Duyvels-bergh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 1ſt of May, We came to the <hi>Cape of good Hope:</hi> There we found the Ships that were come from <hi>Batavia,</hi> that had lain there ſeven Weeks ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us: There were five of them, four large Veſſels, and one Fiſher-boat, call'd the <hi>Poſtborn.</hi> On board the Admiral, call'd the <hi>Landſchowen,</hi> that had a very fine gilt Stern, was the Old Heer <hi>Rycloff van Goens,</hi> heretofore the General over the Eaſt-India Forces. They told us that they had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd much in the Latitude of St. <hi>Morrice</hi> by a
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:100310:187"/>
ſtorm, which had wholly diſabled the <hi>Middleburgh,</hi> but that ſhe was ſince almoſt reſitted.</p>
               <p>We lay there ſtill ſeven days longer, and in that time took in freſh Water, Wood, Turnips, Herbs, Cabbage, Sheep, and Goats. Min Heer <hi>Rycloff van Goens,</hi> with all his Retinue, lodg'd all that while at the Governor's in the Fort. His Retinue was very magnificent; having ſeveral Gentlemen to wait on him, a Trumpeter, 12 Men for his Guard, all dreſs'd very fine in yellow, with ſilver Buttons, and red Breeches, and a great many Slaves from <hi>Bengal.</hi> I lay at a Dutch Countryman's Houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Devil's Hill; he was forc'd to keep ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hottentots, and great Dogs, to ſecure his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards and other Grounds from the Wild Beaſts.</p>
               <p>The 2d, A Ship came and lay amongſt ours in the Road; ſhe put out white Flags and Pendants. The Men on board of her gave out that they were French Merchants. But at night a Seaman comes ſwimming to our Admiral by the Moon-ſhine, and diſcovers what they were. He told 'em that they were French Pyrates, richly loaded with the booty they had got along the Arabian Coaſts: For his own part they carry'd him away by force out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and uſed him as a Slave every ſince; and he begg'd that we would receive him, and carry him into <hi>Holland.</hi> In the morning early the Pyrates miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this fellow haſted away, two of our beſt Ships were order'd to go after them, but they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come near them.</p>
               <p>The 8th, The Admiral went on board with all his Retinue, only he left his Wife behind him; for what Reaſon we could not learn.</p>
               <p>The 9th, Early in the morning, we hoiſted up ſail and weigh'd Anchors. The Wind was very good for us at South-Eaſt; and we went by the <hi>Zee Honden</hi> or <hi>Banditen</hi> Iſland.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:100310:187"/>
One the 10th, We kept a day of Faſting and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>
               <p>On the 11th, There was a meeting of all the Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to agree all of us upon certain ſignals to be given amongſt us either by ſhooting, lighting Fires, or hanging out of Flags, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From the 12th to the 16th, We had very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Winds, and little for us. At that time we had ſeveral <hi>North-Capers</hi> about our Ships. They are a large ſort of Fiſh almoſt like a Whale. We held our courſe Weſtward and by South.</p>
               <p>The 17th, We came into the Trade-winds, which blow conſtantly at North and Weſt. We made directly toward the Iſland of St. <hi>Helens,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd there in what poſture Affairs ſtood in <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 20th of June, We came in ſight of that Iſland; and being come on one ſide of it, where the Engliſh had a Fort, we order'd the <hi>Poſthorn</hi> to ſail cloſe by that Fort, to give them notice that we were Dutch, and came thither upon no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign than to ask ſome News about <hi>Europe.</hi> They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd us that it was a general Peace every where at Sea. Upon which we very joyfully fired all our Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which was all anſwer'd from the Engliſh Fort. We kept on in our courſe Weſt aud by North; the Winds ſtill continuing; and we left St. <hi>Helens</hi> on the left hand of us.</p>
               <p>The 22th of July, We came under the Line, and very happily paſs'd it, and loſt but two Men, both of 'em Soldiers.</p>
               <p>The 23th at night, We ſaw again the Northern Star to our great Joy; till then we had only the Southern Croſs in ſight, which is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellation <figure/> of four Stars, which ſtand in this Order.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:100310:188"/>
The 24th we met a Spaniſh Ship that had a great many Women on Board, who were ſent into the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> to People them: She was afraid of us, and would have eſcaped, but our Admiral ſoon fetch'd her back again.</p>
               <p>The 25th we met an Engliſh Ship that had but one Maſt, ſhe was Laden with Tobacco from <hi>Braſil;</hi> we Barter'd with them, and gave a good quantity of Spices, Silks, Stuffs, and Linnen, for their Tobacco; but we were glad we could have it on any account. I for my part gave a great deal of Pepper and Cinnamon for half a pound of it.</p>
               <p>The 26th, 27th, and 28th the Engliſhman kept by us, but on the 22th he left us with wonderful ſwiftneſs, and got out of ſight immediately.</p>
               <p>The 30th a great many flying Fiſhes fell down in our Ship, ſome of which we Eat, and the reſt we kept for a Rarity.</p>
               <p>The 31ſt abundance of Sea-hogs came through our Fleet, Swimming againſt the Wind. Our Gunner ſhot one of them with an Elligar which is an Inſtrument that ſticks in the Fiſh it hits: it hath a Leaden weight at the But-end, which makes that end ſink, and with the other it turns up the Fiſh: As ſoon as that one was made to bleed, all the others made away. That which we catch'd was Seven Foot long, and half that in compaſs; It was perfect Bacon, and had a deal of warm Blood.</p>
               <p>The 1ſt of Auguſt we went directly North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the Wind was at South-Weſt, and blew very cold. The Days were long, ſo that we reſted more by Day than by Night.</p>
               <p>The 2d, 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th we had much Rain, with which we filled our Water-Barrels; the Wind too being ſomething boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, parted us: Our Veſſel was juſt going to Founder, and began to gape in ſome places half
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100310:188"/>
a. Foot Wide. The Carpenters fell to Work, and were forced to bind up the Cracks and Chinks with Cords, Iron Bands, and Chains; and by our continual Pumping, we made ſhift to keep the Ship up.</p>
               <p>On the 8th we were forced to take in all our Sails, and let our Ship Drive; two Waves ſtruck into our Ship which would have certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sunk us, had not God's Mercy, together with our extream Diligence, happily freed us from the Danger.</p>
               <p>We were at that time by our ſelves, without either Friend or Foe near us. Our Cook had for ſome Days not been able to Dreſs us any Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals for the Toſſing and Tumbling in our Ship, ſo that we were forced to Eat Bacon that came from <hi>Bengal</hi> Raw, and afterwards help the Dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of it with Indian Brandy, of which we had good ſtore.</p>
               <p>The 9th we heard ſeveral great Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Fired, but could not tell for what: In the Afternoon about two a Clock, we ſaw at our Right Hand a large Ship; we found it was our Vice Admiral, and perceived by the Pendants that it was in danger of Sinking. We both en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to get up to one another, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral being come within reach of us, the Men on Board begg'd that we would ſend our Long-Boat to help them.</p>
               <p>They kept ſtill Calling, Bawling, and Firing, whilſt we were adviſing whether we had beſt joyn them, or keep off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For if they, being an Hundred and Fifty in Number, had all come over to us, we muſt have ſtarved; yet we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be ready to take up as many as we could if their Ship had ſunk: At laſt we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100310:189"/>
that our Maſter, a very skilful Seaman ſhould go to them, to ſee what condition they were in, and to give them his Advice. When he was come unto them, he adviſed rhem to throw Over-board ſome of their Goods, as they deſigned to do before: So they unloaded the Veſſel of near Four Hundred Laſts of Spices, as Cinnamon; Cloves, Nutmegs, Pepper, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> by which means they could come to ſtop the Leak, and ſo at laſt they ſaved themſelves. The Pepper being ſcattered about, got into their Pumps, ſo that they could not uſe them; the ſame thing hath often happened with us too.</p>
               <p>The 10th, and 11th, Theſe Stormy Winds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated. We began now to find it colder and colder, and the Fogs to riſe again. In thoſe two days all our Fleet, except the <hi>Poſthorn,</hi> met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
