            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Have diligently in my Travels observed how the Countreys herein mentioned doe grow potent with abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of all things to serve themselves and other Nations, where nothing groweth, and that their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dried fountains of wealth, by which they raise their estate to such an admirable height, as that they are at this day even a wonder to the world, proceedth from your <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>By which Priviledges they draw multitudes of Merchants to Trade with them, and many other Nations to inhabite amongst them, which

               <p>To bring this to pass, they have many advantages of us, the one is, by their fashioned Ships called Boye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55005:9"/>
are made to hold great bulke of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, and to saile with a few men for profit: For example, though a English Ship of two hundred Tuns, and a Holland Ship, or any other of the petty States of the same burthen be at Danske, or any other place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, or in England, they do serve the Merchant better cheap by one hundred pounds in his fraight, than we can, by reason hee hath but nine or ten Marriners, and we neare thirty; thus he saveth twenty mens meat and wages in a voyage, and so in all other their ships, according to their burden, by which means they are fraighted wheresoever they come, to great profit, whilst our Ships ly still &amp; decay, or go to Newcastle for Coales.</p>

            <p>It is a difficult piece of Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, to delineate, and lay out the bounds of Authority; but it is easie enough to conceive the best use of it, and by which it hath maintained: it selfe in lasting happinesse, it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acquired more honour by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, than by beating; for as the bonds of Reason and Love are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, so do all other chains or cords, both rusty and rot noble parts of their owne royall and politick bodies.</p>
            <p>But we will forbeare for a while to stretch this first string of Civill Justice; for in respect of the first sort of men, to wit, of those that live by their owne labour, they have never been displeased where they have beene suffered to injoy the fruit of their owne travells, <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; Tuum,</hi> Mine and Thine is

And much better will it be, if the place afford some notable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it selfe, from whence other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may more readily, and at better rate attain the same.
