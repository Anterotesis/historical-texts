            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hether it be not a Work of extraordinary Neceſſity and Benefit to the whole Kingdom, to aboliſh and reform all unneceſſary Delayes by Protections, Eſſoynes, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilous Pleas, Demurrers, general Writs of Error, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in arreſt of Judgment after Verdicts upon full E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Injunctions in <hi>Chancery,</hi> and the like, in ſuits and proceedings at the Common Law; and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all arreſts and reverſals of Judgments after verdict for any defect of form, or meer miſpriſions or neglects of Clerks, Attorneys, Councel, and the like, which the Client could not prevent? Whether it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to take away the allowance of Clergy in all caſes of Felony, ſince Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are aboliſhed? it being a meer Relique of Popery, allowed only to Men, not Women, though guilty of the ſame offence; and a badge of great injuſtice, to condemn and execute one Felon, only becauſe he cannot read, and ſave another guilty of the ſame offence at the ſelf-ſame time, only becauſe he can read his Neck-verſe, or the Ordinary (againſt truth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience) affirm to the Judge, <hi>Legit vt Clericus:</hi> whereas in reaſon, he that can read, deſerves rather of the two to dye, becauſe he is more learned, and ſo more capable of inſtruction, then he that cannot read at all. And whether it be not juſt, equitable, and beneficial to the Republick to make intailed Lands liable to juſt Debts, Statutes, and Judgments, as well as Fee-ſimple or Chattle Leaſes? And to bring Gentlemen and others that are no Merchants or Tradeſmen, who lie in priſon or obſcure themſelves refuſing to pay or compound their juſt debts, within all the Statutes of Bankrupts, as well as thoſe who live by buying and ſelling?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:164356:2"/>
2. Whether the ſpeedy regulation and ſettlement of the juriſdiction of all Courts of Juſtice Civill and Eccleſiaſticall, and of the exorbitant Fees of all Clerks and Officers in them, and in both houſes and all Committees of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Rectifying of all Extortions and Abuſes in Common Goales and Priſons, much complained of, be not a thing of ſuch preſent publike Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and Utility, as admits no longer delay, and deſerves the Parliaments ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy conſideration? And whether it wil not be an excellent ready means to reform abuſes of Common Goals and Priſons, to make them all Houſes of Correction and Common-Work-Houſes, where all Felons and Criminall perſons of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary quality ſhall be enforced to work for their living during their impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and receive due correction in caſe of refuſall, to keep them from idleneſs and other Vices; and to provide Preachers to inſtruct them there?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whether a new Coronation Oath, with ſome effectual clauſes to ſecure the ſubjects Liberties againſt the Invaſions of pretended Royall Prerogatives, be not ſimply neceſſary for our future ſecurity; the old Oath having been altered in ſome materiall things? And whether an Oath enjoyned by the Houſes to all their members, in all publike and private cauſes that come before them in the Houſe or at Committees, to proceed and Vote according to the merits and juſtice of the cauſe, and the beſt advantage of the Commonwealth, to the beſt of their skill and judgement, without any fear, favour, hatred, affection or partiality; would not give much ſatisfaction to the people, and prevent all ſcandals and jealoſies of partiality and affection under which ſome Members and Committees may elſe ſometimes chance to ſuffer?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Whether it would not be an Act of noble Juſtice and Equity, for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to take ſome ſpeedy courſe to ſatisfie the juſt Debts of ſuch wel-affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Perſons, (who are now fallen into great neceſſity, and ready to periſh for want) freely lent long ſince upon the publike faith, before they ſatisfie arrears or pay Debts to any Members or Officers, who are in no ſuch preſent Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, and have gained much by the Wars; ſince many of the richer ſort are to be ſatisfied their publike faith, out of the Exciſe and ſale of Biſhops Lands?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether the ſpeedy ſuppreſſion of al ſtanding Country Committees &amp; their Troops (againſt whom there are many grievous complaints) erected onely in caſe of neceſſity, be not abſolutely needfull, both for the peoples eaſe and contentment, the expediting of the Accounts of the Kingdome, the reducing all things to the Ancient courſe of Juſtice, the preſervation of the remaining Breeds of Cattle, ſheep, horſes, and Stocks of the Kingdome, almoſt deſtroyed by them and their Agents, the true cauſe of their preſent dearth? And whether it be not worth the inquiry, who and what are the reall cauſes they are ſtill ſupported, continued, after ſo many complaints, motions, Votes, and Ordinances drawn in both Houſes to aboliſh them?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether it be not worthy the Parliaments preſent Examination, how many Companies of Horſe &amp; Foot deſigned for Ireland, have for many moneths taken free Quarter on the Country, contrary to Ordinances, without any Order as yet for their tranſportation; and who have been the cauſes of this great abuſe, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:164356:2"/>
they may be exemplarily puniſhed? Whether many Iriſh Rebels and Cavaleers under a pretext of going for Ireland, have not liſted and kept themſelves in Companies, taken free Quarter, levyed Taxes, and committed many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Robberies, out-rages in divers Counties, to the great ſcandall of the Parliament, the intollerable oppreſſion and diſcontenting of the people, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Orders but their own? And whether ſuch (if not ſpeedily disbanded and exemplarily cenſured) may not raiſe up new commotions in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by joyning with the Malignant partie, and other disbanded male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; or elſe mutiny the people againſt the Parliament by their Exorbitances?</p>
            <p n="7">7. Whether it be good husbandry or policy to imploy ſuch Commiſſaries or Agents in the affaires of Ireland now, who have defrauded the Parliament in that imployment heretofore? Or to ſend proviſions into Ireland from <hi>London, Norfolk, Suffolk, Suſſex,</hi> the Eaſt &amp; Southern parts, through the narrow Seas<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (where Pyrats oft times meet with them) at three times the charge of fraight, ten times the hazzard, loſſe, length of time and inconvenience (ſuch proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being for the moſt part ſpoyled, or much impaired with long lying at Sea, and ſeldome ariving in due ſeaſon) as they might be tranſported from the Weſtern Ports; and in the mean time to eate out and waſte all the Proviſions of the Weſtern Counties neareſt to <hi>Ireland</hi> with free quarter of Horſe and Foot, pretended for <hi>Ireland,</hi> but yet not ſhipped thither in eight or nine moneths ſpace; from whence <hi>Ireland</hi> and the forces there ſhould and might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſeaſonable ſupplys with far more ſpeed, ſafety, convenience, and at much eaſier rates then now they do? And whether it be not worth the Inquiry, what is the true cauſe of ſuch miſcariages?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Whether it be not of abſolute neceſſity both for the Parliaments, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, Countries ſafety, to put the <hi>Orthodox</hi> conformable wellaffected party in each County (as the Militia of it) into aſpeedy poſture of Defence, under faithful Commanders of their own chuſing, firſt approved by the Houſes; both to ſuppreſſe the preſent and future inſolencies, mutinies of ſuch diſorderly Souldiers &amp; Cavaliers, who ſtraggle up and down refuſing to disband, the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing of the Malignant partie, and all ſeditious Sectaries and others, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elſe may ſoon embroyle us in new Wars? And whether the ſetling of ſuch a Militia will not be a better ſecurity, and leſſe charge to the Kingdome then an Army, or capitulating mercenary Souldiers?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Whether the deduction of Free quarter and undue Taxes levyed on the Country by Souldiers out of their pay, will not ſatisfie moſt of their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Arrears, if duly examined? And ſince ſew or no Souldiers are ſo juſt or conſcionable as to pay their quarters duly, when they have once their monies in their purſes; Whether it be not neceſſary to deduct all Souldiers quarters for the future out of their pay at every muſter, to ſatisfie the Counties where they billet; and to allow them to take free quarter (who elſe wil take it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out allowance or payment for it) and to disband or puniſh ſuch upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, who will not be contented with ſuch ordinary quarters as the Country (in this time of dearth) may reaſonably afford them, at the rates deducted for it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:164356:3"/>
out of their pay? Without which courſe and due payment of quarters by the Treaſureis, out of their pay, or each Counties Contributions to ward the Army, upon tickets, or proof of the Free quarter taken upon Oath before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees of Accounts in each County, the Country will be totally ruined, and at laſt inforced (as many fear) to riſe up in mutinies, both againſt the Souldiers and Parliament too, as unable to bear the intollerable burden of free quanter, and pay Exciſe and Taxes too, even for that the Souldiers eat and drink at free coſt, as they now do in many places?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Whether a ſpeedy examination and exemplary puniſhment of all undue practiſes in Elections already made: and an Ordinance to this effect; That all the Electors of Knights or Burgeſſes for the Parliament, ſhall immediately before their Elections take an Oath, without either fear, favour, or affection, to elect ſuch perſons to ſerve in Parliament, as in their judgements &amp; conſciences are moſt ſufficient, able and diſcreet to diſcharge that truſt for the common good; and that ſuch who either directly or indirectly canvis or make open or private ſuite for any ſuch place, ſhall be abſolutely diſabled to ſit in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though returned; would not be a ready means to prevent all future complaints of undue Elections, and eaſe the Houſe of very much trouble and the people of long attendance and much expence, now ſpent about Elections; and ſo neceſſary to be Ordained?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Whether it be not neceſſary or expedient to redeem all Impropriations in the poſſeſſion of Colledges, Hoſpitals, and Free-Schools, by ſetling demeſn Lands of Deans and Chapters of equall value on them by way of exchange? And whether the ſpeeding of the Ordinance for ſurveying and returning the true yearly value of all Church livings, Impropriations, Deans and Chapters Lands in every County, and for the uniting and dividing of Pariſhes and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the means of ſuch as are incompetent upon the return thereof, will not be an effectuall means for the ſettlement of our Church; and the onely me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall way to make all livings competent?</p>
            <p n="11">11. Whether the ſpeedy ſetling of the great Seal of <hi>England</hi> in able and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty hands, the confining the Chancery to its due bounds, the reducing of penall Bonds to a leſſe forfaiture (as 120. l. for not payment of 100. l. at the day to prevent ſuits in Chancery) and filling the Courts up with able Judges, will not prove a great advancement of Juſtice and benefit to the Subject?</p>
            <p n="12">12. Whether the delayes and difference about the <hi>Ordinance for Oxford</hi> will not proove miſchevous to the Univerſity, the whole Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if long continued? And whether all private differences, ends, intereſts, formalities, ſhould not alwayes give way to publike Accommodations and Advantages, eſpecially in Parliaments?</p>
