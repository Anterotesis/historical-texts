            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <note place="margin">What they gaue in olde tune in reward for good newes.</note> to offer ſo much Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, that it was to be doubted, whether there remayned ſo much more in all <hi>Greece.</hi> When <hi>Camilius</hi> ouercame the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trurians</hi> and <hi>Volſians,</hi> mortall enemies to the <hi>Romaines,</hi> all the women of <hi>Rome</hi> did not forget to ſende to the Oracle of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> which ſtoode in <hi>Aſia,</hi> as much Golde and Siluer as they had in poſſeſſion, without reſeruing any one iewell.

both the bloud and life of his onely daughter: the which vow as he promiſed, ſo he accompliſhed. Of theſe examples it may be gathered, what and how many thanks Princes ought too giue vnto God, for the triumphes, victories, and bounties hée giueth them: for though it be in the hands of kings to begin warre, it is in the hands of God only to giue victory. There is nothing that moueth god to be leſſe carefull for vs, than the ingratitude of a good turne receiued. For the good things wée receiue of men,<note place="margin">God will not but that we gratifie the good thing we receyue.</note> they will wée recompence or deſerue them: but God will that wée gratifie and not forget them. Princes moſte chiefly haue cauſe to beware they forgette not bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites receiued of GOD, bycauſe the ingratitude of a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite receiued maketh them incapable and vnworthy of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine fauour in time to come. The forgetfull, ingrate or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind Prince, neither God doth delight too helpe, or men ſo ſerue. All this haue I ſayde vnto your imperial Maieſtie, by occaſion of this great victory ye haue obtained at <hi>Pauia,</hi> where your armye hath taken <hi>Fraunces</hi> the Frenche King, who in his owne galleys was brought priſoner into <hi>Spayne.</hi> A caſe ſo graue,<note place="margin">In the wars more than in other things fortune vſeth doubleneſſe.</note> a newes ſo new, a victorie ſo ſeldom heard of, a fortune ſo accompliſhed is both terrible to the world, and brings your Maieſty in debt, which debt is, to giue God thankes for the victory, and to recompence the conquerours of the battayle. By this it may be apparant to your Maieſty, that there is nothing wherin fortune is leſſe conſtant, than in martiall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, ſince the French king being preſent (and alſo taken in his owne perſon) with all the potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> did loſe the battayle, where dyed all the nobles of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> Much ſhold your Maieſty erre, once to thinke the victory to be gotten by your pollicy, or obtayned by your power, or els to haue hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened by chaunce. For a déede ſo famous, an act ſo glorious, and a caſe ſo heroicall, as this is, doth not fall out vnder for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but is only giuen by diuine prouidence. <hi>Quid retribuam Domino pro omnibus quae retribuit mihi?</hi> If <hi>Dauid</hi> being a King, a Prophet, a Sainct, and with God ſo priuate, vnderſtoode not what to preſent vnto God, for the good things hée had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:

what ſhall we doe that are miſerable, that vnderſtand not what to ſay, nor haue not what to giue? of our ſelues wée are ſo weake, and our abilitie ſo ſmall, our valure ſo little, and haue ſo few things, that if God do not giue wherwith to giue, of our ſelues we haue not what to giue. And what we haue to craue, or els that he ſhould giue: is his grace to ſerue him, and not licence to offend him.<note place="margin">There is no ſacrifice more accepted, than to pardon an enimie.</note> In remuneration of ſo great vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, I would not counſell your Maieſty too offer iewels as the women of <hi>Rome,</hi> eyther Siluer or Gold as the <hi>Greekes,</hi> eyther your owne blud as <hi>Silla,</hi> neyther your childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha:</hi> but that ye offer the inobedience and rebellion againſt your Maieſty, by the commons of <hi>Caſtile.</hi> For before GOD there is no Sacrifice more accepted, than the pardoning of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.

Much more ſure is it for Princes, to be beloued for their clemency, than to be feared for their chaſtiſements. For as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth,<note place="margin">The man that is feared, hath neede to feare.</note> the man that is feared of many, hath cauſe alſo too feare many.

Moſt excellent Prince, it is great reaſon, that in reward of ſo great victory, they maye boaſt themſelues of your pietie, and not complaine of your rigor. The wiues of theſe vnfortunate men bée poore, their daughters vpon the poynt to be loſt, their Sonnes are Orphans, their kinſfolkes bluſhe and are aſhamed: In ſo muche as the pitie that yée ſhall vſe towardes a fewe, redoundeth to the remedie of manie. There is no eſtate in this worlde, whiche in caſe of iniury, is not more ſure in pardoning than in reuenging: for that many times it dothe happen, that a man ſéeking occaſion too bée reuenged, doth vtterly deſtroy him ſelfe.<note place="margin">It is more ſure to forget an iniurie, than to reuenge it.</note> The enemies of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> did more enuie the pardoning of the <hi>Pompeyans,</hi> than the killing of <hi>Pompeyus</hi> himſelfe.

For excellencie, it was written of him, that he neuer forgot ſeruice, or euer did remember iniurie. Two Emperours haue bene in <hi>Rome,</hi> vnlike in name, and much more in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the one was named <hi>Nero</hi> the Cruell, the other <hi>Antony</hi> the Méeke.

Although we know not who was the firſt King, neither who ſhal be the laſte king of the worlde, at the leaſt we know one thing, &amp; that is, that al the Kings paſt are dead, and al thoſe that now liue ſhal die: bicauſe death doth as wel cal the King in his throne, as the laborer at his plow. Alſo it is to bée vnderſtood, that in olde time,<note place="margin">In the olde time to bee a king was no dignitie, but an office.</note> to be a King was no dignitie, but onely an office, as Maior or Ruler of a common wealth: After this maner, that euery yeare they did prouide for the office of King to rule, as nowe they do prouide a <hi>Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy</hi> to gouerne. <hi>Plutarke</hi> in his booke of <hi>Common wealth</hi> dothe reporte, that in the beginning of the worlde all Gouernours were called tyrantes,<note place="margin">He that kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not to gouern, deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to reigne.</note> and after the people did perceiue what difference was betwéene the one and the other, they did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, to name the euill gouernors tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and the good, they intituled Kings.

When God did eſtabliſh an houſhold, &amp; for himſelf did conſtitute a Common Wealth in the land of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> he would not giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kings to gouerne, but Dukes to defend them, that is to ſay, <hi>Moſes, Gedeon, Iephtha,</hi> and <hi>Sampſon.</hi> This God did to deliuer

them from paying of tributes, and that they might be vſed as brethren, &amp; not as vaſſals.

Then God gaue them <hi>Saul</hi> to be their King, much againſt his will: ſo that the laſt Duke of <hi>Iſraell</hi> was <hi>Helie,</hi> and the firſte king was <hi>Saule.</hi> In the beginning when <hi>Rome</hi> was founded, and the <hi>Romanes</hi> began to be Lords of the worlde, forthwith they did create kings to rule them, and Captaines to defende them. They found themſelues ſo gréeued with that maner of gouernment, that they ſuffred but ſeuen kings, not withſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they thought them ſeuen hundred.

To come out of Egipt is to come out of ſinne, to turne into Egipt, is to turne into ſin, &amp; for this cauſe the office of a good Prince is, not only to remunerate the vertuous, and

ſuch as liue wel: but alſo to chaſtiſe the wicked and ſuche as liue euil.<note place="margin">The ſecrete is to be remit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted to God, but the publik offence to be chaſtiſed.</note> It is no other thing to return into <hi>Egypt,</hi> but bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, openly, and manifeſtly to ſinne, the which the good Prince ought not to conſent vnto, eyther with any in lyke cace to diſpence, bicauſe the ſecrete ſinnes to God, are to be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but thoſe whiche are manifeſt the good king ought to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe. Then doth the Prince ſuffer any to return into Egipt, when openly he ſuffreth him to liue in ſinne: that is to ſay, to paſſe his life in enuious reuenging, to holde by force y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is due to an other, to be giuen to folow the luſts of the fleſhe, and to dare to renue his olde age into wanton affections, in which the Prince doth ſo much offend God, that although he be no companion in the fault, yet in the worlde to come, hée ſhall not eſcape to be partaker of the payne. For a kyng to gouerne well in his kingdome, oughte to be aſmuche feared of the euyll,<note place="margin">The good king ought to impart his goodes, but not his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> as beloued of the good. And if by chaunce any bée in his houſe that is in fauour that is a quareller, or any ſeruaunt that is vicious, I denie not, but vnto ſuche a one, he may impart of his goods, but not with his conſcience. Alſo God commaundeth him which ſhall be king, that he hold not in his companie many women, that is to vnderſtand, he ſhal content himſelf with his Queene, with whom he is maried, without vngodly acquayntance with any other, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great Princes and mighty potentates doe more offend God, with yll example they giue, than with the faultes they committe.

And for this cauſe according to my iudgement, if they be not chaſt yet at the leaſt they ſhould be more ſecrete.

                  <p>Alſo God doth commaund him, which ſhal be king, that he hoord not vp much treaſure, that he be not ſcarce, or a nigard, for the office of the marchant is to kéep, but of a King to giue and to be liberal. In <hi>Alexander</hi> the great is muche more prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the largeneſſe be vſed in giuing, than his potencie in figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: the which doth clearly appeare, when we wil praiſe any man, we do not ſay, he is mightie as <hi>Alexander,</hi> but franke as <hi>Alexander.</hi> To the contrary of this, <hi>Suetonius</hi> writeth of the Emperor <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> the which of pure miſerie, nigardſhip, and couetouſneſſe, commanded in <hi>Rome</hi> to be made publike places to receyue vrine, not to kéepe the Citie more ſwéete, but to the end that they ſhould giue him more rente.</p>

               <p>It is to be vnderſtoode, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> more than all other nations were couetous of riches, and ambitious of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noures: whereby it came to paſſe, that to haue to ſpend, and to magnifie their names, they hild warres ſixe hundreth and fortie yeares, with all nations and kingdomes.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:150934:12"/>
that is to wit, in buildings they made, and in their Coines they did graue or ſtampe: neither did they allowe the grauing or ſtamping of any money, but vnto him that had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome ſome famous battaile, or done ſome notable thing in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth. The buildings they moſt vſed to make, were wals for Cities, cawſies in high waies, Bridges ouer Riuers, fountaines artificially made, ſtatues or greate pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ouer gates, Bathes for the people, arches for their triumphes, and Temples for their Goddes.

               <p>And for that it ſhall not ſéeme that I ſpeake at large or of fauour, it is reaſon I giue account of all I haue ſaid. The let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of one of theſe ſtamped mettals doth ſay, <hi>Pboro. dact.

This was he that firſt gaue lawes in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and alſo (as it is thought) in all the worlde, whereof it dothe procéede, that all Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſellours and Lawyers of <hi>Rome</hi> did call the lawes that were iuſte, and moſte iuſt, <hi>Forum,</hi> in memory

               <p>So the <hi>Romanes</hi> not meaning to obey the lawes they had receiued of their good King <hi>Numa Pompilius,</hi> ſent a moſte ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne imbaſſage to <hi>Grecia,</hi> to bring them the lawes that the Philoſopher <hi>Solon</hi> had giuen to the <hi>Athenians.</hi> Which being brought to <hi>Rome</hi> accepted, and obſerued, were afterwards in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled the lawes of the twelue tables.

neuer noted of diſhoneſtie, he neuer troubled the common welth, he did neuer reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge iniury, he did neuer thing againſt iuſtice, either againſt any man did vſe malicious wordes. He was in féeding te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perate, in drinking ſober, in giuing liberall, in receiuing of conſideration, in ſleeping ſhort, in his ſpeache repoſed, in buſineſſe affable, in hearing patient, prompt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, gentle in chaſtiſement, and benigne in pardoning.

He himſelf wente to the temples, he himſelf did offer the Sacrifices, he himſelf did reade in ſcholes, he himſelfe did heare complaints, he himſelf gaue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in cauſes of the law, he himſelf did cauſe to giue chaſtiſement to offenders. This <hi>Licurgus</hi> was of a valiant mind in warres, of great deuiſe in time of perill, certaine in things determined, ſeuere with rebels, in ſodaine aſſaults of great readineſſe, affable with offenders, &amp; a mortal enemie of vagabonds.

                  <p>What greater burden might ther be in this worlde, than that he which did break the law, went preſently to hell: And to him that did obſerue the ſame, they did not incontinently giue Paradyſe.

If hée commaunded to faſt, he faſted: if he commaunded to pray, he prayed: if he commaunded wée ſhould forgiue, he pardoned: if he commaunded to die, he died: if he commaunded vs to loue, he loued: In ſuch wiſe, that if he commaunded vs to take any medicine, firſt in him ſelfe hée made experence.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth not compare his bleſſed lawe, vnto Tymber, Stone, Plants, or Iron: but only to the yoke, bycauſe al theſe things may be caried by one alone: but to drawe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yoke of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, there muſt be twain. High &amp; alſo moſt profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is this miſterie, by the which is giuen vs to vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euen at the preſent houre that the good Chriſtian ſhall put downe his head vnder the yoke to cary the ſame: forthwith on the other part, Chriſt puts himſelfe to helpe him. None calleth Chriſt, that he doth not anſwere. None doth commend himſelfe vnto him,<note place="margin">The worlde doth more cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, but in the houſe of God more pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned than cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſed.</note> that he doth not ſuccour. None doth aſke him, that he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not ſome what. None doth ſerue him, that he payeth not. Likewiſe none doth trauell, that he doth not helpe. The yoke of the lawe of Chriſt, doth more cure, then wound: doth more pardon, than chaſtiſe, doth more couer than accuſe: doth more feare, than weary, and alſo doth more lighten, than burden. For Chriſt him ſelf, that commaunded to beare, he himſelf &amp;
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:150934:30"/>
no other doth helpe vs to cary. Oh good Ieſu, O loue of my ſoule, with ſuch a guide as thou, who can loſe the way? with ſuche a patron as thou, who feareth drowning? with ſuch a captaine as thou, who diſpaireth victory? with ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion as thou, what yoke may bée painefull? Oh ſwéete lawe, oh bleſſed yoke, oh trauell well imployed, by the whiche wée paſſe vntoo Chriſte: for, not only thou doſt make accompt too bée with vs in all our trauels, but alſo doſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, not to leaue vs to our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>He that in the garden of <hi>Gethſemany</hi> came forth, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue thoſe that were come too take him: It is firmely to bée beleued, that he fayleth not to come forth to imbrace them that come to ſerue him. If any worldly and mightie riche man doe contend at any time with a poore Chriſtian, truely we ſhall finde, that the helpe is much more that Chriſte gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto his poore ſeruant, than all the coſt that the world giueth to thoſe that do followe the ſame. Thoſe that the world doth leade vnder his yoke, to them hée giueth al things variable, diſmeſured, and by falſe waight: but in the houſe of god, all things are giuen whole, entier, without counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peyſe, and moſt perfect. We may well ſay with great reaſon, that the yoke of Chriſte is ſwéete, and his burden light: for that the world doth not ſo muche, as pay for the ſeruice wée do him, but Chriſt doth pay vs, euen for the good thoughts we hold of him.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt doth well ſée that of our owne nature we be humane, weake, miſerable, foule, and remiſſe: for which cauſe he doth not behold what we are, but what we deſire to be. <hi>Moyſes</hi> gaue the lawe to the <hi>Hebrewes: Solon</hi> to the <hi>Greekes: Phorone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> to the <hi>Egyptians: Numa Pompilius,</hi> to the <hi>Romanes:</hi> but as me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; euen as men died, ſo they ended: but the yoke of the law of God ſhall endure, as long as God doth endure.<note place="margin">In all the lawes of the world vices be permitted, Chriſtes lawes excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>What may <hi>Moyſes</hi> lawe be worth in whiche was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted diuorcements, and vſury? What may the lawe of <hi>Phoroneus</hi> be eſtemed, in which was graunted, to the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> to be théeues? Of what value may the law of <hi>Licurgus</hi> be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:150934:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
accompted, in whiche man ſlaughter was not chaſtiſed? of what accompt may the lawe of <hi>Solon Solonius</hi> be reputed, in which adultery was diſſimuled? Of what reputation may the lawe of <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> be weighed, in which it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that as much as you coulde take, was lawfull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer? Of what conſideration may wée iudge the law of the <hi>Lidians,</hi> in which the mayde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vſed no other mariage, but vnto him that did win them by adultery? Of what iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, may we thinke the law of the <hi>Baleares,</hi> wherein it was commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the bride ſhoulde not be giuen vnto the bridegrome, before the next kinſman had vſed hir? Theſe and ſuche like lawes, wée cannot ſay otherwiſe but that they were beaſily, brutiſh, and vnhoneſt: ſince they did containe vices, and by vicious men were permitted.</p>
                  <p>He that is entred into the religion of Chriſt, to be in déede a Chriſtian: hath no licence to bée proude, a théefe, a murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, an adulterer, a glutton, malicious, neither blaſphemous. And if we ſhall happen to ſée any to do the contrary, he ſhall haue onely the name of a Chriſtian, but for the reſt, he ſhalbe of the pariſh of Hell.</p>
                  <p>The holy, and ſacred Lawe of Chriſte, is ſo right in the things it doth admitte, and ſo pure and ſincere in the things it doth permit: that it doth neither ſuffer vice, nor conſent to the vicious man, <hi>Quia lex Domini immaculata.</hi> The <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> the <hi>Arabians,</hi> the <hi>Pagans,</hi> and Gentiles, that defame our law, and complayne of the hardneſſe thereof: Surely they haue no reaſon,<note place="margin">The Lawe of chriſt is ſharp vnto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but eaſie and light to the vertuouſe.</note> much leſſe occaſion ſo to do. For the defecte is not in that ſhée is euill, but in that of vs ſhée is euill obſerued. Thoſe that would bée vertuous, of the preceptes of Chriſte neuer conceyue hardneſſe, bycauſe the yoke of God, is not for their purpoſe that followe their opinion, but for thoſe, that liue conformable to reaſon. Finally: I doe ſay, that all that wée do in reſpect of Chriſtians, wée are bound to do, in conſideration that wee are men: and to this end Chriſte ſayeth, that his yoke is ſwéete, and his burden light. For he is ſo good, and ſo magnificent, that he payeth vs as well,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:150934:31"/>
for that we do for him, as though we were not bound to do it. This is it, that I vnderſtand of this text. And this is it, that I ſaid vnto his maieſtie, when I preached thereof. No more, but that our Lord haue you in his keping, and giue me grace, to ſerue him.</p>

                  <note place="margin">With what paper they were wont to write.</note>According to the varietie of time, ſo was the diſcouering of the manner of writing amongſt men. For (according to the ſaying of <hi>Strabo</hi>) in the beginning of the worlde, firſt they did write in aſhes, afterwardes in Kindes of trées, then in Stones, afterwardes in leaues of Laurell, afterwardes in ſhéetes of lead, after that in parchement, and at laſte they
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:150934:32"/>
came to write in Paper. It is alſo to be noted, that in ſtones they did write with yron, in leaues with penſils, in aſhes with fingers, in rinds with kniues, in parchment with canes, and in paper with pennes.</p>
               <p>The Incke that our old forefathers did write withall,<note place="margin">Note the inck of old time.</note> was firſt of a fiſhe called <hi>Zibia,</hi> after that they made it of ſoote of ſmoke, afterwards of vermilion, after that of Cardenillio: in the end they inuented it of gumme, galles, coperas and wine.</p>
               <p>Sir, I thought good to recite theſe antiquities, to gather thereof (of this your letter) whether it were written with kniues, with yron, with penſilles, or with the finger. For, (as I thinke) it is not poſſible (at the leaſt) but that you did write it with a cane or with a canon. You haue to vnderſtand, that the forme of your letter was, groſſe paper, whitiſh incke, cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked lines, letters turned vpſide downe, and the reaſons blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: ſo that either you did write it by Moone light, or elſe it was ſome childe that beganne to learne at ſchoole. Although the letter came old, open, ſlubbred, rent, and all be blotted, is it true, that it was ſhorte in reaſons, and fewe in lines: no ſurely, but to haue little or nothing to write, it helde twoo ſhéetes &amp; a halfe of paper. In ſuch wiſe, that when I did open it and did ſée it, I thought it rather to be ſome citation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they cited me, than a letter whiche any ſhould write to me. The letters written with your owne hand, I cannot tell why they ſhould be cloſed, and much leſſe ſealed: for ſpeaking the truth, for more ſafe I holde your letter being open, than your plate being lockt in your cheſt. For vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one a garde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niance is not ſufficient: &amp; to the other, a ſeale is ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>I gaue your letter to be read to <hi>Peter Coronell,</hi> to ſée if it were in Hebrew: I deliuered it to maiſter <hi>Prexamo</hi> to tel me if it were in <hi>Chaldee,</hi> I ſhewed it vnto <hi>Hameth Abducarin,</hi>

a letter in ieſt, or elſe a writing inchanted. And when many ſaid that it was not poſſible, but that it was a letter inchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or elſe infected with a ſpirit, I determined with my ſelfe to ſend it to the great Nigromancer <hi>Iohn de Barbota,</hi> inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſiring him to read it, or elſe to coniure it: who aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by writing, and alſo certefied me, that he had coniured it, and alſo put it in circle, and that he could gather of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is, that the letter (without doubt) had no ſpirit in him: but he aduiſed me, that he which wrote it ſhould be beſprited.</p>

               <p>Sir, I ſay this, bicauſe a man to be euill, deſcending from the good, ſurely it is a great infamie: but to deſcend of the good, and to bée good, is no ſmall glorie. But in fine, it is with men as it is with wines: ſometime he ſauors of the good ſoyle, ſometime of the caſke, &amp; others of the goodneſſe of the grapes.

vpon who art thou, and what art thou, it doth not ſéeme to me, a man may haue better blaſon in his houſe, than to be, and alſo deſcended of a bloud vnſpotted. For that ſuch a man ſhall haue whereof to commend himſelf: and not wherefore to be deſpiſed or taunted.</p>
               <p>Sir alſo you ſay in your letter, that I am in body large, high, drie, and very ſtraight: of which properties I haue not whereof to complaine, but wherefore to prayſe my ſelf. By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wood that is large, drie, and ſtraight, is more eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and bought at a greater price.

               <p>Sir I do conferre the moments of my contemplations, with the ſinnes of my life, and I do find by my rekoning, that it is not a iuſt thing to be large in ſinning, and ſhort in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

               <p>Alſo your Lordſhip doth ſay, that in preaching I am long and tedious, wherto I anſwere: that in the whole world there is no long ſermon, if the hearer do giue eare as a Chriſtian, and not as to curious. I remember the lent paſt being with your Lordſhip, they preſented vnto your honour, certaine Samons of <hi>Penia Melera,</hi> whiche you praiſed for very good, and yet complained that they were very little.

                  <hi>Helie</hi> the <hi>Spartan</hi> doth ſay, that onely the Emperour <hi>Traian</hi> was hee, that neuer was ouercome in battell. And the reaſon thereof was this, that he did neuer take any warre in hand, wherein he did not iuſtifie his cauſe.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Pontus</hi> whiche was called <hi>Mithridates,</hi> dyd wryte a certaine Letter vnto the Conſull <hi>Silla,</hi> being bente in warres moſte cruelly the one againſt the other, wherein was thus written: I doe muche wonder of thée Conſull <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> to take warre in hande in ſo ſtraunge a lande as this of mine: and that thou dareſt aduenture to deale with my great fortune, ſince thou knoweſt ſhée neuer deceiued mée, neither had acquaintance with thée.

               <p>Many times the Emperoure <hi>Auguſtus</hi> vſed to ſay: that warres to be good, muſt be incommended vnto the Goddes,<note place="margin">The nature of warres that is to be holden iuſt.</note> accepted of Princes, iuſtified of Philoſophers, and executed of Captaines.</p>
               <p>Thus much I haue ſaide vnto your Lordſhip, to this end,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:150934:39"/>
that if your warre had bin vpon Ieruſalem: it were to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for iuſt, but for that it is vpon <hi>Marſellius,</hi> alway we hold it for ſcrupulous. The kings hart is in the hand of God, ſaith the diuine ſcripture. If it be ſo, who may attaine vnto this ſo great a ſecret? whiche is to wéete, that the Kings hart, being in Gods hand, he dare offend God: which doth appeare moſt cleare, in that we ſee no other thing but warres amongſt the Chriſtians: and leaue the <hi>Moores</hi> to proſper and liue in reſt. This buſineſſe to me is ſo difficulte, that although I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeak thereof: I know not, how to vnderſtand it: ſince all day wée ſée no other thing, but that God doth permitte by his ſecrete iudgements,<note place="margin">Warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s dependeth of the ſecretes God.</note> that the Churches where they prayſe him be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and throwen downe: and the curſed remaine ſound and frée, where they do offend him.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip is a Chriſtian, a good man at armes, my neare kinſeman, and my ſpeciall friend, any of which things doth much binde me to féele your trauaile, and to be gréeued with your perill: I ſpeake of trauell to the bodie, bycauſe the Captaine that holdeth much of his honour, ought to eſtéeme little of his life: I ſay perill vnto the ſoule, bicauſe amongſt Chriſtians there is no warre ſo iuſtified, that in the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth not ſome ſcruple.</p>
               <p>Herein your Lordſhip ſhall ſée that I deſire to ſaue you, in that I will not delite you with lies:<note place="margin">Eight condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions meete to be performed, by a captaine generall of the warres.</note> But only to ſay vnto you that which I do conceiue, to the end that afterwards you may do what is méete. If you know not wherunto you are bound, I wiſh your Lordſhip to vnderſtand, it is, that the Captaine generall do auoyde vniuſt wrongs, correct blaſphemers, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour innocents, chaſtiſe quarellers, pay his armie, defend the people, auoyde all ſackings, and obſerue fayth with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Aſſure your ſelfe my Lord, that there ſhall come a time, in whiche, you ſhall giue an accompt to God, and alſo to the king: not onely of what you haue done, but likewiſe of that whereunto you haue conſented.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Gueuara</hi> was your Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dfather and my couſin,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:150934:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and he was one of the Gentlemen at armes,<note place="margin">The good knight ought to imitate his good predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</note> that paſſed out of <hi>Spayne,</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> with the King Sir <hi>Alonſo,</hi> and there did helpe to get this kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in recompence of his ſeruice, hée made him Lorde greate Seneſhall of the kingdome. Of whiche you may gather, howe muche your Lordſhip ought to trauell, to leaue ſuche another renoume vnto your ſucceſſours, as hath bene left vnto you by your predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>As <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth, writing vnto <hi>Articus,</hi> this name Knight or Gentleman, the <hi>Romaynes</hi> did neuer admit, either conſent to entitle thoſe that could gather muche riches, but ſuche as had bene at the victory of many battailes.</p>
               <p>That Knight or Gentleman that doth not imitate the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant actes of his predeceſſours, ought not boaſt himſelfe,<note place="margin">He is not to be intituled a knight that is rich, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</note> to deſcend of them. For, how much the more renoumed the life of the fathers is, ſo much the more are the children to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, for their negligence. To preſume much of no more but to deſcend of Noble parents, I ſay is a thing moſt vaine. To blaſon a mans owne proper déedes is fooliſhneſſe: but in the end of theſe two extremities, he is more tollerable that prayſeth his owne vertues, than he that boaſteth himſelfe of other déedes.</p>
               <p>When amongſt Knights or Gentlemen talke is of armes,<note place="margin">In the talke of warres, not that I haue heard, but that I haue ſcene is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for a gentleman.</note> a Gentleman ought to haue great ſhame to ſay, that he read it, but rather that he ſaw it. For it is very conuenient for the Philoſopher to recount what hee hath read, but the Knight or Gentleman it becommes to ſpeake of things that hée hath done. The Conſull <hi>Marius,</hi> when he was reſident in <hi>Rome,</hi> and alſo in the warres, many times would ſay: I confeſſe that I am extract of linage obſcure, and alſo I acknowledge that I haue no armes of my predeceſſors, for that they were not floriſhing Captaines. But iointly with this, they that are now aliue can not denie, that in the temples I haue erected pictures or counterfets, I haue receiued in my body many woundes, and in my houſe many enſeignes: none of which I do enherite of my predeceſſours, but haue wonne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:150934:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enimies. And <hi>Marius</hi> ſaide more: Your predeceſſors left you riches to enioy, houſes wherein to dwell, ſlaues to ſerue you, gardens to delight in, fame whereof to boaſte, and armour wherwith to venter: but they haue not left you vertue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you might preſume. Of which déede, Oh you <hi>Romaynes,</hi> ye may inferre, that it is very little that he doth enherite, which doth not enherite the vertues of his predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>I thought good to aduertiſe you of theſe things, to the end that in remembring the fame and nobleneſſe of ſuch men as were your predeceſſours, you ſhould muche more eſtéeme to imitate their vertuous actes, than too haue their armes ſette forth and drawen at large. I am deceiued, if I did not ſée in <hi>Caeſars</hi> court, a certaine gentleman of more than a Quent of rent, whiche I did neuer ſée haue a horſe in his ſtable, either launce in his houſe, neither yet commonly did weare his ſword, but onely a Dagger that was very little. But on the other part, when he began to recount the doubty déedes of his forefathers, it ſéemed that he daunted Lions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The armes of a knight are giuen him to fight, and not to behold.</note>Men do now eſtéeme to paint their armes in their houſes, to graue them in their ſeales, to place them in their portals, &amp; to weaue them in their ſumpter clothes, but none adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tureth to win them in the field: in ſuch wiſe, that they hold armes, for others to behold: and not for themſelues to fight.</p>
               <p>One thing I will counſell your lordſhip: which for ſuche as are of your eſtate in the warres, is very neceſſary: And that is, aboue al things to be vigilant, &amp; to haue great regard, that amongſt the captaines of your army, there be vſed great ſecrecie: for in greate affayres there is neuer good ſucceſſe, when they be diſcouered before they take effect. If <hi>Suetonius Tranquillus</hi> doe not deceyue vs: <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> neuer ſayde, to morow this ſhalbe done, and to day let this be done: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to day this ſhalbe done, and to morrowe wée ſhall ſée what wée haue too doe. <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſaithe in his politiques, that <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius Metellus,</hi> being demaunded of one of his Captains, when the battayle ſhoulde bée giuen, made aunſwere: if I thought my ſhirt did knowe the leaſte thought that is in my hart, I

woulde preſently burne it, and neuer weare another. It were very well the affaires of warres, ſhoulde bée commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of many, but the reſolution of them, to be vſed with few. For otherwiſe, they are like to be diſcouered before they bée concluded.</p>
               <p>Alſo I thinke very well,<note place="margin">Age and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be mothers of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell.</note> that you take counſayle with men that be graue and of experience but not without conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they be wiſe, without raſhneſſe. For ſometimes, more ſound counſaile doth procéede from men of fewe yéeres, and of much habilitie, than from men that be opinatiue and of old yéeres.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip hath great cauſe to conſider howe to take aduiſe of men, that in their counſayles be headſtrong,<note place="margin">The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind dothe more feare to flie, than to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide.</note> and in their déedes very raſhe: for in daungerous caſes that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the warres, it is leſſe euill to retire, than to be loſte. <hi>Alcibiades</hi> a Captaine amongſt the <hi>Greekes,</hi> did vſe to ſay, that men of bolde and valiant harts haue more néede of fortitude, to moue them to retire, than to abide their enemies. For not to flie, their honour doth moue them: but to retire, their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth conſtraine them.</p>
               <p>In greate hazardes it is muche better that men ſubmitte themſelues to reaſon, than to hurle themſelues into fortune: In all things your Lordſhippe hath to imbrace counſaile,<note place="margin">In ſoden pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils it needeth not to vſe lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g and delayed counſels.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be when you ſhall ſee your ſelfe in ſome ſodaine daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: for in the warre, wée haue ſéene many Captaines loſt, for no other cauſe, but for that when they ſhould haue done a thing at the ſodaine, they haue ſit downe with great leyſure to take counſell.</p>
               <p>Alſo your lordſhip ought to admoniſh your armies, that in their forcible and neceſſary perilles, they ſhew not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be menns diſmayed: for the warres be of ſuche qualities that the feare of ſome diſmayeth the reſt. Your Lordſhip may hold it for certaine: that the heart which is full of feare, muſt of neceſſitie be voide of hope. Thoſe that go alwayes to the warres, neither ought to holde victorie for certaine, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſpayre to obtaine it. For there is nothing wherein

The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> in his Bookes of common wealth did ſay: That leſſe greatneſſe is not to be imputed to the honorable, to deale and be conuerſant with the weake, than it is to ſtand and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with the mightie: and the reaſon that he gaue for the ſame, is, that the Generouſe and magnificent ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vſeth more force in taming his harte to ſtoupe vnto lowe things, than to take in hand graue, weightie, and high attempts. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of an high ſtature, receiueth more paine in ſtouping to the ground for a ſtraw, than to ſtretch out his arme to reach a braunche. By this that I haue ſaid, I would ſay, that this our hart is ſo puffed vp and ſo proude, that to riſe vnto more than he may, it is life, and to deſcend to leſſe than he is worth, it is death.</p>

               <p>The great <hi>Iudas Machabeus</hi> was leſſe in body and much leſſe in yeares, than his thrée other brethren, but in the end the good old <hi>Mathathias</hi> his father, to him onely did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend the defence of the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> and into his handes did alſo reſigne the armies againſt the <hi>Aſsyrians.</hi>

               <p>Sir, it ſeemes to mée that agréeing with that which I haue ſaide, your Lordſhip wold not take counſell with other men, that be learned and wiſe, but with me that am the ſimpleſt of your friends. As your Lordſhip hath ben ſo long time in the warres of <hi>Italie,</hi> it is very ſeldome that I haue ſéene you, but much leſſe, that I haue eyther ſpoken or bin conuerſant with you, for whiche cauſe my friendſhip is to be holden for more ſure and leſſe ſuſpitious, for that I loue you, not for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes you haue giuen me, but for the magnificence that I haue ſéene in you. When one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes to ſeeke to be our frend,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:150934:44"/>
maketh much to the matter, to conſider the cauſe that moueth him to ſéeke the ſame: for if he be poore we muſt giue him: if he be rich, we muſt ſerue him: if he be fauoured, we muſt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him: if he be wilfull, we muſt faune on him: if he be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, we muſt ſupport him: if he be vicious, we muſt diſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with him: and if he be malicious, we muſt beware of him.</p>
               <p>One of the great trauelles that vnprofitable friends bring with them is, that they come not to ſeeke vs,<note place="margin">To lacke friends is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous. And ſome friends be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</note> to the end to doe what we wil, but to perſwade vs to doe what they will. It is great perill to haue enemies, and alſo it is greate trauell to ſuffer ſome kind of friendes: for to giue the whole hart to one is not much, but how much leſſe, when amongſt many it is reparted? neyther my condition may beare it, either within the greatnes of your eſtate may it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained, that we ſhould loue after ſuch ſort, neither in ſuch maner to behaue ourſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues: for that there is no loue in this worlde ſo perfect, as that which holdeth no ſcruple of intereſte.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip ſaith in your letter, that you write not vnto me, for that I am rich or mighty, but becauſe I am learned and vertuous. And you inſtantly deſire me, that I write vnto you with mine owne hand ſome thing that maybe worthy to be vnderſtood, and pleſaunt to be read.</p>
               <p>To that which you ſay, that you hold me to be wiſe, to this I aunſwere, as <hi>Socrates</hi> did, whiche is too wit, that hée knew not any thing more certaine, but in perceyuing that he did know nothing.</p>
               <p>Very great was the Philoſophie that <hi>Socrates</hi> did incloſe in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aunſwere: for (as the deuine <hi>Plato</hi> doth ſay) the leſſer part that we vnderſtand not, is much more, than al that we know. In all this world there is not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like infamie, as a man to bée imputed ignorant, either the like kind of praiſe, as to bée called wiſe: bycauſe in the wiſe, death is very euil imployed, and in the foole life is much worſe beſtowed.</p>
               <p>The tirant <hi>Epimethes,</hi> ſéeing the Philoſoher <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> wéep immeaſurable teares for the death of a Philoſopher, demaunded for what cauſe hée wept ſo muche, ſince it
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:150934:45"/>
was a ſtraunge thing for Philoſophers to wéepe. To this <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> anſwered:<note place="margin">We ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to bewaile the life of the wicked, than the death of the iuſt.</note> O <hi>Epimethes,</hi> I do not wéepe bycauſe the Philoſopher died, but for that thou liueſt: and if thou kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt not, I will giue thée to vnderſtand, which is: that in the ſcholes of <hi>Athens</hi> we do more wéepe, bycauſe the euill doe liue, than for the death of the good.</p>
               <p>Alſo your honour doth ſaye, that you doe iudge me, to be a man ſolitarie and vertuous: might it pleaſe the diuine cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, that in al this, and much more, you ſpeake the truth: bycauſe, in caſe for one to be or not to bée vertuous, I dare venter to ſpeake, that how muche ſure it is, to be, and not too ſéeme to be, ſo daungerous it is to ſeeme to be, and not to be in déede.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">A man is to be knowne, but not to be vnderſtood.</note>Man is naturally variable in his appetites, profou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in hart, mutable in his thoughts, inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant in his purpoſes, &amp; indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in his concluſions: wherof we maye well gather, that man is eaſie to knowe, and very difficile to vnderſtand.

               <p>Your honour writeth vnto me, that I certifie you of my opinion, in that the king our maſter doth commaund now of new, that you paſſe once more into <hi>Italy,</hi> by occaſion of the battell,<note place="margin">The battell of Rauenna for euermore ſhall be renoumed.</note> that the Frenchmen of late haue ouercome at <hi>Rauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> whiche in the worldes to come ſhall be ſo famous, as it was now bloudie. Vnto this anſwering your honour, I ſaye that you haue great reaſon to doubt: and vpon the ſame too vſe counſell: for if you do not accompliſhe what you be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, the Kyng takes diſpleaſure, and if you doe what they entreat you, you contend with fortune.</p>
               <p>Two times your honour hath paſſed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and twice woon the kyngdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> in which two iorneyes, you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame the battell of <hi>Garrellano,</hi> and the battell of <hi>Chirinola,</hi>

and ſlewe the beſt people of the houſe of <hi>Fraunce.</hi> And that which is moſt of all, you brought to paſſe, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> nation of all the world were feared, and obtained vnto your ſelfe renoume of immortall memory.</p>
               <p>This being true as it is, it were no wiſedome,<note place="margin">Leſſe in the warres, than many other thing we haue to beleue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</note> either ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, once more to returne thither to tempt fortune, which with none doth ſhew hir ſelf ſo malicious and double, as with ſuch as ſpend long time in the warres.</p>

Since the ſoule goeth charged with ſinnes, the hearte with thoughts, the ſpirit with temptations, and the body with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels: it is much conuenient for vs, that if maye not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

diſcharge oure ſelues of this burden at the leaſt, that in ſome parte we lighten the ſame.</p>
               <p>Your honour is not ſo yong a man, but that the more part of your life is paſt: and ſince the lyfe goeth conſuming,<note place="margin">What he ou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght to do that hathe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued long in the warres.</note> and death approching: in my iudgement it ſhould be better coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell for you to occupie your ſelfe in bewayling your old ſins, than of newe to ſhed the bloud of enimies.</p>
               <p>It is nowe time, rather to wéepe than to fight: to withdraw youre ſelfe, than to vſe libertie: to make a reckoning with God, more than with the king: to accompliſh with the ſoule, and not with honour: to call vpon God, and not to prouoke with enemies: to diſtribute your owne, and not to take from others: to conſerue peace, and not to inuent warres. And if in this caſe, your lordſhip will not beléeue me: from hence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward I diuine, that then you ſhall begin to féele it, when you may not remedie the ſame.</p>
               <p>Your honour deceyueth your ſelf, or elſe I know not what to ſay, for that I ſée you flée that you ſhould procure, which is quietneſſe: and you procure that which you ſhould flée,<note place="margin">There is no greater trauel than to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſſe.</note> which is diſquietneſſe. For there is no man in this world more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, than he that did neuer experiment what thing it is to be repoſed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that haue trauailed throughout diuers landes, and haue had exprience of diuers fortunes, the thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they moſt deſire in this lyfe is, with honoure to ſée themſelues retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their countrey. Of which it may be inferred, that it is great temeritie, that you alone wil rather go to die amongſt ſtrangers, than to liue with honor amongſt your own. Vntil men haue gotten neceſſarie to eate, yea vntill they haue obtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo ſome ſurpluſage alſo to giue, in my iudgement, they ought not much to be blamed, although they wander through out diuers kingdomes, and put themſelues in great perilles.<note place="margin">Men oughte to trauell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they haue wherwith to defende neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie.</note> For he is as muche worthie reprehenſion, that doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that whiche is neceſſarie, as he that ceaſſeth not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that which is ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>After a man hath found that which he hath ſought for, and

In the Courtes of Princes I doe confeſſe there is a conuerſation of perſons, but no confederation of will: for here enimitie is holden for naturall, and amitie a ſtraunger.

               <p>Alſo you demaund if the Court be deare or good cheape, to this I anſwere, that my ſteward telleth me, that from Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber vnto Aprill, it hath coſt me in wood and cole, an hundreth and fortie Ducates. The cauſe of this is, that this ſame towne of <hi>Medina</hi> as it is rich in faires, ſo is it poore in mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines or woods, in ſuche ſorte that the count being wel caſt, the wood coſts as deare as the dreſſing of the pot.

               <p>Alſo you will mée that I write vnto you if the faire be good thys yeare at <hi>Medina.</hi> To this I anſwer, that as I am a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer and a ſuter, and haue neyther marchaundiſe to ſell, and muche leſſe money wherwith to buy: I knowe not whereof to prayſe it, nor do I fynde why to miſlyke it.

tooke great pleaſure, and being not able to buy them, I was muche tormented. The Empreſſe came foorth to ſée the faire, and as a Princeſſe moſt wiſe, wold not be accompanied with hir maids of honor, bicauſe the Gentlewomen that did ſerue hir, being ſo poore and ſo fewe, it coulde be no leſſe, but that they would vſe their libertie in aſking fairings, and the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen ſhould thinke it their partes to giue them.</p>

And of a trouth, his death was to many in this Court very terrible,<note place="margin">Death giueth feare, but not amendment.</note> although I ſée none to amende his lyfe by the ſame. Other infirmities be in this Courte, that bée not corporall, but ſpirituall, as angers, hatred, quarels, rancours, wrath, and ſlaughters: the whiche maladies doe conſiſt, not that they go with bodies infected, but in the ſwelling of the ſplene, &amp; corruption of the gall.</p>
               <p>I haue turned many tymes to reade your letter: and haue not founde any more to aunſwere. For of a ſuretie, it did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſéene an Interrogatorie to take witneſſes, than a letter to a frend: I wil ſay no more, but that I haue eſcaped in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto you, very wearie, &amp; alſo angrie not for the anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the matter, but in conſtruing youre ill fauored letter.

               <p>Sir you ſay, that in reading the moralles of ſaint <hi>Gregory,</hi> you did note, and alſo did meruaile to ſée, that the deuill did aſke licence of God to do hurt vnto holy <hi>Iob,</hi> &amp; it was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him: and the Apoſtle <hi>S. Paule</hi> did pray vnto God to take
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:150934:50"/>
away the temptation of the fleſh, and it was denied him. In ſuch wiſe, that God heard the Deuill, and did not condiſcend vnto the prayer of ſaint <hi>Paule.</hi> Maruell ye not ſir of this: for the thinges that the diuine prouidence do bring to paſſe be ſo iuſt, and done for ſo iuſt cauſes: that although wée maye not reach them: they want not therefore reaſon, why they ſhould not be done. If wée déepely conſider what God did with the Apoſtle, wée ſhall finde, that it was more that God gaue him, than the Apoſtle did craue.<note place="margin">God dothe more for vs in giui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g vs grace than to take away tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Bycauſe, hée deſired that the temptation of the fleſh might be taken away: and God gaue him grace to ouercome it. What iniurie doth the Prince to the Captaine, that ſendes him a warfare, if hée makes him ſure to haue the victory? If abſolutely God ſhould haue taken away the temptation of the fleſh, from the Apoſtle ſaint <hi>Paul:</hi> neither ſhould there haue remayned occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deſerue, either ſhould haue béen giuen grace to ouercome. For hée is more ſupported of God, to whom hée giueth helpe to conquere, than to him, that hée excuſeth to fight. Let vs not deſpaire, afflict our ſelues, or bée ouer thoughtfull, and much leſſe complayne and murmur of God: if forthwith hée giue not that whiche wée deſire. For hée doth it not, with diſfauour in that hée will not heare vs,<note place="margin">God doth know what he giueth vs, but we know not what to craue.</note> but bycauſe he wil change it into a better cauſe. Hée knoweth what hée doth, and wée vnderſtand it not: hée knoweth what hée doth denie, but wée not what wée aſke: hée meaſureth all thinges with reaſon, and wée but with ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: hée dooth denie that is hurtfull vnto vs, and graunteth that which is profitable. Finally I doo ſay, that he doth know: how hée are to bée handled: and therfore, wée ought of him only to depend. The Apoſtle had ſéene the inuiſible and diuine ſecrets, whiche of his forefathers had béen much deſired but neuer ſéene: and bycauſe, of that ſo high reuelation, hée ſhould not boaſt or grow proud,<note place="margin">To haue the occaſion of ſinne taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, is no ſmall benefite of God.</note> the Lord would not take away the concupiſcence of the fleſhe. In ſuche wiſe, that in recompence of not condeſcending to his deſire, hée did take awaye the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſinne, and gaue him grace to ouercome. God vſed more pitie with ſaint <hi>Paule,</hi> in that hée would not heare him:
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:150934:50"/>
than if hée had heard him. For if hée ſhould haue taken awaye the concupiſcence of the fleſh, it might haue come to paſſe that as much as hée had diminiſhed in temptation,<note place="margin">To be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is no good ſigne.</note> hée might haue increaſed in pride. When the Lord doth permit that one is tempted, it doth not followe therfore, that hée is of God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred: for my parte, I holde it rather a ſigne, that of God, hée is elect. For as ſaint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth, there is not a greater temptation, than not to be tempted. Chriſt hath left the way to heauen marked: and the markes of this voiage be tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, aduerſities, miſhappes, and infirmities. In ſuch wiſe, that it is no other thing to be remembred of God: but that in this world he be permitted to be tempted. Let it be holden for certaine, that they of him are loſt, whiche in this world, from aduerſities be priuiledged. For the enemy of mankind, (whiche is the deuill) vnto all thoſe that he hath regiſtred for his owne, hée doth trauell, that they may liue in great wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare and eaſe. Sir, alſo you ſaye,<note place="margin">The deuil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cureth great welfare vnto his dearlings.</note> that you doe much maruail to ſée the boldneſſe that the Deuill had in aſking licence of God, to hurt holy <hi>Iob:</hi> and to ſée the liberalitie that God vſed in giuing it. In ſuch ſort, that he denied <hi>S. Paule,</hi> that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and graunted the Deuill, that whiche hee craued. Sir, although you haue no reaſon, yet haue you ſome occaſion to demaund that whiche you aſke: for of a ſuretie, it as an hard thing to conſent that our enemy do hurt vnto our friend. That whiche I dare ſpeake in this caſe, is that it is leſſe, pernicious, and of more worthineſſe to ſuffer ill, than to haue authoritie to do euill. And after this maner wée haue more enuie of holy <hi>Iob,</hi> in that hée ſuffred, than vnto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, for that whiche he did. It ought to be farre diſtant from the diuine will, that he that hath to giue grace to ſerue him, ſhould giue licence to offend. It is a great euill for a man to be euill: but it is much worſe to make him euil, which is good. Bycauſe, our owne proper ſinnes God doth well ſée, they procéede of weakeneſſe: but the perſecuting of the good, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes groweth of malice. If men do aſke of God vppon their knées, that hée giue grace to ſerue him, they ought to aſke
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:150934:51"/>
with teares that he do not giue them place, to offend him. For in the ende,<note place="margin">Notable exam<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ples againſt ſuch as do per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſecute.</note> if I do not good workes I ſhall haue no reward: but if I doe euill, for the ſame I ſhall haue paynes. By <hi>Caine, Abell</hi> was ſlaine: by <hi>Eſau, Iacob</hi> was perſecuted: by <hi>Saule, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was baniſhed: by <hi>Nabugodonoſer, Ieruſalem</hi> was burned: by <hi>Achab, Micheas</hi> was impriſoned: by <hi>Zedechias, Eſaias</hi> was ſawen: and by the Diuell, holy <hi>Iob</hi> was afflicted. Man by the multitude of his ſinnes, doth deſerue to be an offence, and a ſcourge of the good. Much did the Diuell offend <hi>Iob,</hi> in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him: but much more did holy <hi>Iob</hi> deſerue in ſuffering that temptation. Bycauſe in the perſecutions of the iuſt, God doth more behold the pacience of him that ſuffreth, than he doth the malice of him that doth perſecute.</p>
               <p>Alſo you will, that I write vnto you, what it was I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this other day vnto the Emperour, which is to wit, that the Princes which tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nouſly gouerne their common weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, haue more cauſe to feare good men, than thoſe that be euill. Sir, that whiche I ſayde in this caſe was, that the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants whiche in the common wealthes haue offices of moſt preheminence, haue much more reſpect to the bountie of the good,<note place="margin">Very great bee the priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the vertuous.</note> than to the conſpiracies of the euill. For that amongſt many other thinges, this priuilege is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayned in vertue: that is to vnderſtand: amongſt the leaſt inferiors it giueth diſmay: with the equall, it moueth enuie: and to the great &amp; mightie, it yeldeth feare. The <hi>Siracuſan Dioniſius,</hi> had more feare of the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> which was in <hi>Grecia,</hi> than of al the enemies he had neare him in <hi>Cicilia.</hi> Kyng <hi>Saule</hi> had more reſpect to the deſeruings of <hi>Dauid,</hi> than to the armies of the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> The proud <hi>Aman,</hi>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:150934:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his knife, but the good, doth hurt with his credit. Sir, alwaies haue regard, not to ſtriue or contend with a man that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is good, and hath credite in the common wealth with all men.

                  </hi> cap. xvj. where it is ſaid, ſpeaking of King <hi>Saul</hi> and of his infirmitie: <hi>Spiritus Domini malus arripiebat Saulem.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A text of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> The fyrſt King of <hi>Iſraell</hi> was named <hi>Saul,</hi> he was choſen of the Tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> which was the laſt Tribe of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tribes: and in the ſecond yeare of his raigne, an euill ſpirit ſent of God did vex him, whiche would not come out of him, neyther leaue to torment him, vntill the good King <hi>Dauid</hi> came before him, to play and to ſing. But now the dout is, how it may be vnderſtoode, and agrée withall, that the ſcripture ſhould ſay, the euill ſpirit of the Lord did take <hi>Saul:</hi> if the ſpirit were of the Lord, how was he euell? and if he were euill, how was he of the Lord? it ſéemeth an hard thing, and not intelligible, to ſay of the one part, that that ſpirit which held <hi>Saul,</hi> was of the Lord: and of the other part, to ſay that the ſpirit was euil. But if the ſpirite were of the Lord how was he then euil? and if he were euill, how was he of the Lord? For the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hereof, it is to be noted, how it is written in the <hi>1. <hi>Regum</hi>
                  </hi> cap. xxvj. that <hi>Dauid</hi> being compaſſed with the armie of King <hi>Saul,</hi> who ſléeping on a night in his tent, <hi>Dauid</hi> did paſſe thorough the middes of his campe, and toke from the Kinges beds head, the launce that he fought withall, and a cruſe of water, wherein he vſed to drink: and in this paſſage, he was neither ſéen of the watch, nor perceiued of the ſcout. And why? <hi>Quia ſopor Domini irruit ſuper eos:</hi> to ſaye, as the Scripture ſaith, that the ſléepe of the Lord fell vppon them, is moſt true: but to ſay, that God doth ſléepe, and hath néede of ſléepe, is a great mockery. For, as the Pſalmiſt doth ſaye, <hi>Ecce non dormitabit neque dormiet qui cuſtodit Iſrael.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſay: <hi>Quòd ſopor Domini irruit ſuper eos:</hi> that God had ſent a dead ſléepe vpon them: it is to be vnderſtoode: <hi>non quòd ipſe dominus dormiret: Sed quia eius nutu infuſus eſſet: ne quiſquam preſentiam Dauid ſentiret.</hi> The diuine prouidence would caſt a
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:150934:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſléepe vpon King <hi>Saul,</hi> and vpon his watch, and vpon thoſe of his Campe: not for their recreation, but for the ſafe kéeping of <hi>Dauid:</hi> in ſuch wiſe, that in God, his ſléepe and his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is one ſelf thing: the Lord is ſo zelouſe of his elect, and ſo vigilant to preſerue them, that he doth not only giue them grace to performe good purpoſes, but alſo doth direct them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies by good meanes: in ſuche wiſe, that although hée doth permit them to trauaile, he doth not conſent that they periſh.</p>
               <p>But comming to the purpoſe, that after the maner, that the Scripture is to be vnderſtood, <hi>Sopor Domini irruit ſuper eos:</hi> after the ſame manner, is vnderſtand, <hi>Spiritus Domini malus arripiebat Saulem.</hi> And for farther declaration of this I ſay: <hi>Quod ſi Diabolus tentationem iuſtis ſemper inferre cupiat: tamen ſi à Domino potestatem, non accepit: nullatenus adipiſci potest, quod appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit.</hi> The ſpirite that did tempt and torment King <hi>Saul:</hi> for this cauſe he is called an euill ſpirite: for that the will of the Deuill in tempting vs, is euill. And for this purpoſe, he is named the ſpirite of the Lorde: for that the power which the Lord doth giue him to tempt vs, is good. When God dothe giue licence to any Diuell, that he go to vexe and diſquiet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny iuſt man: it is not Gods intention, that he tempt him, but to exerciſe him: bicauſe vertue is of ſuch qualitie, that it grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mortified, when it is not exerciſed with trauailes. The wheat whiche is not turned, is eaten with wiuels. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that is not worne,<note place="margin">Vertue &amp; the vertues by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</note> is eaten with mothes: the timber that is not ſeaſoned, is ſpoiled with cheſt lockes: the fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is not wrought, doth conſume with ruſte: bread long kept gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth finnowed.<note place="margin">God hath more regarde vnto vs than we our ſelues.</note> By this that I haue ſaide, I would ſay, that there is not any thing that turneth vs to more weakeneſſe &amp; negligence: than to be a certaine time without temptations. Much more care hath God of vs, than we of our ſelues: for in the end, as our worthineſſe is litle, and but to ſmal purpoſe, if we do quaile, he doth comfort vs: if we lie downe to ſleepe, he waketh vs: if we be wearied, he helpeth vs: if we grow fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he doth encorage vs: if we grow negligent, he doth intice vs. Finally I ſay, that leauing our ſelues vnto our owne
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150934:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power, wée permit our ſelues to fall, and he alone giues the hand to lift vs vp.</p>
               <p>Alſo holy <hi>Iob</hi> was tempted of the euill ſpirit of the Lord, not becauſe there was any notable fault in the man: but for that ther raigned in the Diuell enuie and malice. For curſed ſathan had not enuie of the great goods that <hi>Iob</hi> had, but of the excellent life that he led. At the inſtant that one is euill, he doth deſire that all be euill: if he bée ſclaundered, that all be defamed: in ſuch wiſe, that ther is not ſo perillous an enuie, as that whiche euill men haue of thoſe whiche be good and vertuous: If one be good and ritch, and liue by one that is euill and malicious. Firſt, he that is euill, dooth trauell to take away the credit the good man hath, before he vſeth force to ſpoile him of his goodes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abrabam</hi> was tempted when it was commaunded that his onely ſonne ſhoulde be ſacrifized. <hi>Tobie</hi> was tempted when he loſt his ſight. The holy <hi>Iob</hi> was tempted, when they killed his children, tooke his goods, and filled him with the mangie: in which temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thoſe holy men ſuffered much;<note place="margin">Not the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring but the pacie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth.</note> and alſo loſte much: but at the time of repayment he did not giue them reward according to the goods they loſt, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the patience they vſed. Since it is certain that all paſſions or troubles, eyther God doth ſend them, or elſe do come by the hand of God, it is reaſon that we take them as ſent by the hand of God, who is ſo iuſt in that he commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and ſo limited, in that hée permitteth,<note place="margin">The te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptation of the Deuill is limited.</note> that he doth neuer ſuffer vs to be tempted aboue our ſtrength. With men that be of a good life, and doe kepe rekening with their conſcience: the licence whiche God giueth to the Diuill to tempte them, is ſurely limited, and the patience that hee giueth them, is very bountifull, <hi>&amp; de hoc bactenus ſufficit.</hi>

My Lord, be it as be may: and let hir Maieſtie eate, as ſhall pleaſe hir to commaund: for in the end I do more repine at hir pacience, than enuie the meat ſhe eateth. The meates y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are ſerued at hir table are many: and thoſe that ſhee féedeth on, bee very few, (for if hir Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomie do not deceiue me,) the Empreſſe is of a very good condition, and of a weake complexion. The moſt that ſhée eateth of, is winter Mellons, poudred Beefe, fed Pigions, minſt Bacon, great Geeſe, and Capons roſted: in ſuche wiſe, that ſhée eateth that others do loth: and ſhée abhorreth that, for whiche men of the countrey do ſighe. They ſet before hir, Pecocke, Partridge, Capo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, franked Feſant, Manger bla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ck, Paſties, Tarts, and other variable kind of gluttonies: of all whiche, ſhée not only pretendeth a contempt to eate, but alſo, ſheweth a lothſomneſſe to behold. In ſuch wiſe, that the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tation doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſt in the much or little that we haue, but only in that, wherunto we be inclined. In all her dinner, ſhée drinketh but once, and that is not pure wine, but water mixed with wine: in ſuche wiſe, that with hir ſippets none may ſatiſfie his apetite, and much leſſe kill his thirſt. Shée is ſerued after the maner of <hi>Portingall,</hi> which is to wit: there is placed at the table thrée Dames vppon their knées, the one to carue, the other twaine to ſerue, in ſuch ſort, that the meate is braught by gentlemen, and ſerued with Ladies. All the other Dames be there preſent, ſtanding vpright, not in ſilence, but talking, not alone, but accompanies: ſo that the thrée Ladies giue the Empreſſe to eate, and the others yéeld their ſeruaunts ſufficient matter both to ſpeake and thinke. Authorized and pleaſant is the maner of <hi>Portingall,</hi> yet truly, notwithſtanding that ſometimes the Dames do laugh ſo loude, and the gallants do ſpeake ſo high, that they loſe their grauitie, and alſo are yrkſome to hir Maieſtie.</p>

               <p>To that whiche you demaund, who gaue the Hat to the Lorde Cardinall: it was Sir <hi>Frauncis</hi> of <hi>Mendoza,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Samora.</hi> And if my diuination deceiueth me not, the Lord Biſhop, had rather haue ben vppon his knées to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the ſame, than ſitting to giue it. They preſented the Hat in ſaint <hi>Antonies</hi> Church: and at the inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it was giuen him, there fell ſo great tempeſt of wind and raine,<note place="margin">The old Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes were ſuperſtitious.</note> that if as he was a Chriſtian, hée had bene a <hi>Romane,</hi> either he would not haue receiued it, or els haue defered it vntill another daye. My Lord it is not to be holden for a ieſt, that at the very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the wind and the raine was ſo cruell and vehement, and the water ſo great, that when the Cardinall went thence made Cardinall, he did more profite him ſelfe of the Hat he brought, than of the Hat whiche he receiued. The banquet made by the Cardinall, was magnificent in expences and of long continuance, for that we began to eat at one, and made an end at foure. As concerning drinking, there were found ſo good wines, and alſo ſo good drinkers, that <hi>Toro, S. Martin,</hi>

               <p>As concerning my lodging, your Lordſhippe ought not to aſke me, if I haue good lodging, but if I haue any lodging.

On a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in Aduent, preaching in the Chappell vnto hir Maieſtie, I ſayd, that ſaint <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> went to dwell in the deſert, not onely to auoyd ſin, but alſo for that he woulde not haue to

               <p>Further, your Lordſhip will that I write vnto you what I thinke of the duke of <hi>Veiar,</hi> which gathered ſo great treaſure in hys lyfe, that at his death he left foure hundreth thouſand Ducates. This is a matter perillous to write, and odious to heare: but in the ende (my iudgemente is) that he wente to ſéeke care for himſelfe, enuie for his neyghboures, ſpurres for his enimies,<note place="margin">Terrible no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes for the rich nigard.</note> a praie for théeues, trauaile for his perſon, anguiſhe for his ſpirite, ſcruple for his conſcience, perill for his ſoule, lawe for his children, and curſſes for his heyres.

bicauſe, for a man to be riche it is ſufficient that he be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, but to employ his greate riches, he muſte be a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and noble minded.

I can ſhewe youre lordſhip, that in this countrey you are more knowen by your fame, than by your perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Wherfore (as you know) you haue to trauaile that your life may be conformable vnto your fame, alſo you haue to conſider that if you come to iudge, you ſhall alſo: be iudged, not of few, but of many: not of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning but of cuſtome: not of goods, but of fame: not only in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, but alſo in ſecret: not of waightie cauſes, but alſo of very ſmall matters. One of the greateſt trauayls that Preſidents haue, and ſuche as gouerne common wealthes, is, that they doe not onely iudge what they doe, but alſo what they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:150934:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thinke: not only the things that they doe in earneſt, but alſo what they commit in ieſt: in ſuch ſort that all things whiche they doe not with ſeueritie, they iudge it for lightneſſe. <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarke</hi> ſayth in his politikes, that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did note in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monides,</hi> that he ſpake loude.

               <p>With reaſon they mighte haue prayſed <hi>Simonides:</hi> that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercame the battaile of <hi>Marathone: Parniculus</hi> that reſkued <hi>Thebes: Licurgus,</hi> that reformed his kingdom: <hi>Scipio</hi> that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <hi>Carthage: Cato,</hi> that ſuſteined <hi>Rome: Pompeius,</hi> that aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the Empire. <hi>Hanniball:</hi> that was of a mynd immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall: and <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> that thought it little to bée Lord of the world.

Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip may bold it for moſt certain, that the office of preſident is not a little honourable, but ioyntly therwith, verie tedious and burdenſome. For that no man hath compaſſion of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, &amp; all (if he take eaſe,) blaſpheme him. In this preſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip there is other trauell, which is, your friends haue licence to ſée you, and to ſpeake vnto you, but your Lordſhip hathe not libertie, to vſe conference with them: for if you talk with any in particular, and admitte him to youre ſecrete affaires: foorthwith they will reporte thorowe the audience, and alſo

In hard, graue, and waightie matters, it is not repugnant to wiſedome, neither yet to conſcience, for a Iudge to confer with his friendes, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this condicion, that they be neither affected or furious, for there doth wit moſt bend, where will hath moſt force. In ſuch wiſe, ye ought to be conuerſant, confer, talke, and alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult with your familiar friends, that all men may thinke of you, that they do cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, but not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maund you. Such as come to bée ſuters vnto you, are not to be anſwered ſharply or with rigor, a milde aunſwere neuer offendeth: for if they go not with hope to bée deſpatched, it were not iuſt they ſhoulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part complayning of their aunſwere. In the wordes, in the curteſies, and in the aunſweres, that you ſhall vſe, deale with euery one according as your Lordſhip ſhall perceiue the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicion of his eſtate to require: for otherwiſe, ſome will prayſe you for iuſt, and other ſome note you of euill nurture.

Conſent not to be furious, angry, cruell, &amp; abſolute, for that Iudges be bound to ſuffer infinite iniuries, and haue no licence to reuenge onely one. When at any time you ſhal fele occaſion to be angrie, troubled, and alſo iniuried, breake not forth into ire, nor ſpeake any euil word.

In ſuch wiſe, that the Philoſopher had more power with his wordes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the King with his armies. I ſay this reuerend Father, for that betwixt the bearing and reading of a ſermon there goeth no ſmall difference. For as the Apoſtle ſayeth, the letter killeth, but the ſpirit quickneth. The authoritie of the Prophets be aſſured, the ſermon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth written as it was preached, but I giue you to vnderſtand, it goeth deſpirited and vnſauery.</p>
               <p>But comming to the purpoſe of that the Prophet ſaithe:
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:150934:59"/>
which is to wete: <hi>deſcendant in infernum viuentes.</hi> The doubt is, how it may agrée, that they may go downe to hell,<note place="margin">A text of the Pſalmiſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> being aliue, and being aliue, how they may bée in hell. Saying, as the Prophet doth ſaye, in an other Pſalme: <hi>Non mortui lnudabunt te Domine, nes omnes qui deſcendant in infernum.</hi> If thoſe that goe downe into hell, ſhall not there praiſe God, but blaſpheme him: to what end doth the prophet commaund vs to deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? To ſay that <hi>Oreſtes</hi> entred into hell after the <hi>Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes,</hi> and that <hi>Aeneas</hi> deſcended thither to ſeke his father: and that the muſicion <hi>Orpheus</hi> did fetch from thence his wife, and the valiant <hi>Hercules</hi> did breake the gates and bind the Giant <hi>Aethna,</hi> and the dog <hi>Cerberus:</hi> Theſe may bée termed poetical fixions, and no truthes: for the vnfortunate that is once ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with night in hell, for euermore there remaineth bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: and he that can once tymely riſe vp into Paradiſe, ſhall neuer more ſée night: for the elect ſhall there find day without night, and the dampned ſhall find night without day. Being ſuch as wée ought to be, wée may excuſe our going to hell: but after that wée ſhall be entred thither, it is not in vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe. For ther is nothing more conſonant to reaſon, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he which willingly came to the fault, againſt his wil do ſuffer paine. For the prophet to ſaye, <hi>deſcendant in infernum viuentes,</hi> in my iudgement I durſt ſay, that his meaning was to perſwade vs, and to warne vs, that wée deſcend into hell being aliue: that wée deſcend not after wée be dead. Now let vs deſcend into hell by contemplation, ſo that afterwards we deſcend not to eternall dampnation. Let vs deſcend thither by feare, that they carry vs not thither by rigour. Let vs deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend thither with good will, that they carry vs not by force. Let vs deſcend by day, that they carry vs not at night. Let vs deſcend alone, bycauſe they ſhall not compell vs to goe with companye. Let vs deſcend in tyme, that wee maye returne, becauſe that afterwardes they ſhall not carry vs to leaue vs there. Finally, I do ſaye, that it is an holy thing to deſcend into hell, while we are aliue, to the ende wée deſcend not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wée bée dead. They dayly deſcend into hell that thinke vpon
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:150934:60"/>
the gréeuous paines and formentes that be giuen there for ſinne. For there is no better ſalue to part vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſinnes, than alway to carry the paine in memorie. For out of doubt, the paine of the dampned dothe withdraw vs from vices. Goe who will on pilgrimage to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerate,</hi> let them wander to get the <hi>Iubile</hi> of <hi>S. Iames:</hi> let him vow himſelfe to our Lady of <hi>Gadaliape:</hi> let him trauaile to <hi>S. Lazarus</hi> of <hi>Ciuill:</hi> let him ſend almes to the holy houſe: and let him offer his goods to <hi>S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony de Caſtro.</hi> But for my part I will no other ſtation, but that vnto hell. Hée vnderſtendeth not a little, nor occupieth himſelfe in little, nor goeth not a little, nor takes in hand that is little, neither goeth on pilgrimage a little, that euery daye giueth a hoylt or a turne into hell. Once a yeare did the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes</hi> viſit their temple. From fiue yeares to fiue, the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> did celebrate their <hi>Luſtros:</hi> from foure to foure yeares the <hi>Greekes</hi> did feaſt at their <hi>Olimpiades:</hi> from ſeuen yeares to ſeuen yeares, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did renew the Temple of <hi>Iris:</hi> from ten to ten yeares, the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ſend preſentes to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo:</hi> but he that is a faithful and a true Chriſtian, not from a time to ſo long a time, but euery houre and euery moment ſhall goe and come to hell. For of a perpetual paine, perpetual ought to be the memorie therof. In the pilgrimage to the holy Houſe, there is coſt, trauell, and alſo perill: but thoſe that euery day do viſite hell by contemplation: neyther haue coſt, or paſſe trauell, neyther runne in any kind of daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: For it is a pilgrimage that you goe on drie foote, and is viſited with ſtanding ſtill. Oh bleſſed is the Soule that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day by the ſtations of hell giues a turne, in which he doth behold, howe the proud be there brought downe: the enuious chaſtized: the gluttons pine with hunger: the furious grow milde: and the fleſhly conſumed. Therfore, let the liuing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into hell. To go this holy iorney, neyther weakneſſe maye excuſe vs, eyther pouertie let vs: for it dothe neyther commaunde vs to weary our perſons, or that wée employe our goods, but that wée kéepe our money and there to beſtow our thoughtes. Therefore let the liuing deſcend into hell.

ſayth, that ire is no other thing, but a ſhort fooliſhnes. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith, that which the Latins do cal ire, the <hi>Grekes</hi> do name de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of vengeance. <hi>Aeſchines</hi> ſayth, that ire was cauſed of the fume of the gall, and of the heate of the heart.<note place="margin">The trefull of al men and at all times ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred.</note> 
                  <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſaith there is muche difference betwixte ire and teſtineſſe: bicauſe ire groweth of an occaſion, and teſtineſſe of euyll condition. The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> ſayeth, that the faulte is not in anger, but in hym that giues occaſion. <hi>Laertius</hi> ſayth, when the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment excéedes the fault, then is it vengeance, and not zeale: But when the fault doth excéede the chaſtiſemente, it is zeale and no vengeance. <hi>Plutarche</hi> ſaith, that the priuiledges of ire, are not to beléeue our friends, to be raſh in attempts, to haue the chéekes inflamed, to vſe quickneſſe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handes, to haue an vnbridled toung, at euery word to vſe ouerthwartneſſe, to be fumiſh for ſmall cauſes, and to admitte no reaſon. <hi>Solon Solonio</hi> being dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded whom we cal properly irous, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he that little eſtéemeth to loſe his friendes, and maketh no account to recouer enimies. After ſo manie and ſo graue Philoſophers, that which I dare ſay is, that the vice of ire is lightly written, eaſy to perſuade, pleaſaunt to preach, ready to counſell, and very difficile to refrayne. Of any vice wée may ſpeake euill, but of the vice of anger we may ſay much, and very much euil. For ire doth not only tranſform vs into fooles, but alſo maketh vs of al men to be abhorred. To tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ire is ſufficientely vertuous: but vtterly to expell it, is a thing more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſure. For all things that are euill of themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, and of condition hurtfull, are more eaſily reſiſted than throwne away. In the beginnings, many thinges be in oure owne handes, to admit or to ſend them away: but after they haue taken power ouer vs (if by chaunce reaſon riſe againſt them) they ſay they will not depart, ſince they be in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Ire hath ſo euil a condition, that of one only tyme that we yéelde him our will, he afterwards maketh our will vnto all the hée liketh.</p>
               <p>In the Magiſtrates that gouerne the common wealthe,<note place="margin">In him that gouerneth, ire is perilious.</note> we condemne not the good or euill correction they vſe: but the

greate furie they ſhewe in the ſame. For if they be bounde to chaſtiſe the offences, they haue not licence to ſhew themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues paſſioned. Thoſe that offend, it is a thing very iuſt y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they remaine not vnpuniſhed: but this puniſhment muſt not be ſuche, that it appeare that they take ſome great vengeance: for be a man neuer ſo brute, without compariſon he dothe more féele the hate that they ſhewe, than the chaſtiſements which they giue. The whip, the ſtaffe, the ſworde, &amp; the puniſhment that is giuen to the fleſhe, although it be gréeuous, yet it ſoon paſſeth: but the iniurious worde the heart neuer forgetteth. For a man to be in power and authoritie, and to refraine his anger, it is not an humaine vertue, but heroicall and diuine. For in this world, there is not a more high or excellent kind of triumph, than a man to triumph ouer his owne heart. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> the Philoſopher,<note place="margin">A notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

There be few that follow this counſell, and verie manie that do the contrarie: for now a days there is none that is angred with the offence, but with the offender. For my part (and alſo for thoſe that ſhall) it is a great trauayle to trafike or deale with furious, impacient, and men of euill ſuffering: For that they are importable to ſerue, and of conuerſation very perillous. Since I haue ſaid what thing is ire, and the hurtes that are doone by ire: nowe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150934:64" rendition="simple:additions"/>
let vs ſay, what remedies may be giuen againſt ire. For my meaning is not to teache you to be angrye, but to bée paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente. I dare auouche, that it is a great remedie agaynſt ire, when a man is angred to refrayne the tongue, and to deferre vengeaunce vntill an other tyme. For that many tymes a man doth ſay and promiſe béeing in choler, thinges the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che afterwardes he woulde not ſhoulde haue once paſſed hys thoughtes. With the yrefull we muſt not be importunate to entreate a pardon, no not from the foote to the hand, but only to deſire that vengeance be deferred. For during furie, there is no accompte to bée made that the iniuried will pardon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte he bée quieted with the man that is furious and in cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler: for any one to ſéeke to bring him to agreement, or to iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, eyther it is lacke of witte, or diligence more than née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth. For the ire that is muche inflamed, and the heart that is kindled with furye, neyther doth admit conſolation, or is ouercome with reaſon. I doe aduiſe and readuiſe the man that preſumes to be wiſe, that he take not in hand to contend with him that is inflamed with yre. For if he faile to follow counſell herein, when he ſcapeth beſt, he ſhal eyther haue his honour reuiled, or his head broken. Although a man be a fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnto him that is offended, he doth him more profite to let him alone, than to ſpeake vnto him, or help him. For at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inſtant he hath more néede of a bit to bridle him, than a ſpur to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hym. With the man that is in a rage, it is more néede to vſe ſkill than to deale by force. For although he were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gred at the ſodain, the pacifying of him muſt be at leiſure. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the bookes of his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth doth counſell the Emperoure <hi>Traiane</hi> that hée bée paciente in his trauayles, mylde in his affayres, and of muche ſuffering amongeſt the furious: affirming and ſwearing, that many mo thyngs bée cured by tyme, than framed and agréed by reaſon. Betwixt noble perſonages wée haue ſéene greate quarelles, whiche paſſions and furies mighte not be ſtayed by entreataunce of friends, threatning of enemies, giftes of money, neyther yet with wearineſſe of trauayles: And after that tyme hath had

his courſe (and calling them to remembrance) haue agréed amongſt themſelues, without the requeſt of any friende to talke therin. Finally, I ſay, that when a friende doth ſée the choler of his friende inflamed, if hée will doe him good, lette hym caſte on water with temperaunce to coole hym, and not wood wyth furie to burne him. I (ſir Iohn) haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged this Letter muche more than I thoughte, and alſo more than I deſyred, but that youre excéedyng payne and ſorrowes haue made my penne diſcourteous, to ſuffer, vſe ſilence, and diſſemble, and let the tyme paſſe, and ſomewhat forget the matter. For if I bée not deceyued, you ſhall ſée, the fire that they made at your gates, burne in their entray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. <hi>Salomon</hi> the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſayde, that the wiſe man hathe his tongue in his hearte: and he that is a foole and furious, hath his heart in his tongue. <hi>Agis</hi> the <hi>Greeke</hi> ſayd, that the fooliſh man is grieued with that whiche he doth ſuffer, and boaſtes himſelfe of that whiche he hath ſpoken. And the wyſe is grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with that whiche he hath ſpoken, and boaſteth himſelfe of that he doth ſuffer. Nowe or neuer it is néedfull, that you profyte your ſelfe of your ſcience and wiſedome: For it is a ſpice of no ſmall fooliſhneſſe, to knowe to cure others, and not to remedie your ſelfe. I am not forgetful, that when my ſiſter the Lady <hi>Francis</hi> died in <hi>Mexia</hi> hir towre, you did write mée ſo many and ſo good thinges, that they were ſufficient to lyghten me of the payne, althoughe not altogether of the ſorrowe.

The properties of the belles, are to call men to come to ſeruice, &amp; neuer enter into the church them ſelues: and in my iudgement, ſuch is the condition of <hi>Italie,</hi> where there be great Sanctuaries that prouoke vnto prayer, and the people thereof hath no deuotion. Many doe ſay that all the weale of <hi>Italie</hi> conſiſteth in libertie.

Speaking the trueth, there be no common wealthes more loſt than thoſe where the people be moſt at libertie? For the condition of libertie is, to be of many deſired and of fewe well employed: where there is no ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is no King: wher there is no King, there is no law: where there is no lawe, there is no Iuſtice: where is no Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, there is no peace: where there is no peace, there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall warre: and where there is warre, it is impoſſible that the common wealthe maye long endure.

The diuine <hi>Plato</hi> did ſay many times to the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> when hee ſawe them goe ſo at large: take heed you <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> to your ſelues, &amp; looſe not by your viciouſnes, that which you haue wonne by your valiauntnes. For I giue you to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that libertie aſketh no leſſe wiſdom to conſerue it, than valiauntnes to obtain it. Experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce teacheth daylie, how in a frée co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, they do more hurtes, they ſpeak more blaſphemies, they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit more offences, they rayſe more ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales, more good be defamed, and more theft attempted, onely of two yongmen at libertie, than of two hundred that be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. If curiouſly we do behold, of a troth we find that they doe not drowne in welles, whip, baniſhe, cut the throtes, hang, cut of eares, nor put in priſon, but loſt men that ſpends their time in vanities, and employ their libertie in vices.</p>
               <p>In the life of man ther is not the like riches to libertie, but iointly therewith, there is nothing more perillous than ſhée is, if they know not to meaſure hir and vſe hir according to reaſon: libertie ought to bée wonne, procured, bought, ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and defended:<note place="margin">Libertie cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wiſdome.</note> but iointly with this, I do warne, giue counſell, and alſo aduiſe him that ſhall haue hir, that hée vſe

Many men there be that leaue to doe euill, bycauſe they will not: but much more are they that ceaſe, bycauſe they cannot.

               <p>In the times of <hi>Octauius Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour, there was in <hi>Rome</hi> a <hi>Romane</hi> Knight named <hi>Titus Annius</hi> (verely a man) of great experience in cauſes of warre, and right wiſe in the gouernment of the common wealthe. There was in <hi>Rome</hi> an office that was called <hi>Tribunus Scelerum,</hi> &amp; this had the charge of all criminall cauſes, whiche is to wit, to hang, to whip, to baniſh, to cut throates, and to drowne in wels: in ſuch maner, that the <hi>Cenſor</hi> did iudge the Ciuill, and the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bune</hi> the Criminall. This office amongſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> was of great preheminence, and of no leſſe confidence, they neuer incommended the ſame but to a man of noble bloud, auncient in yeares, learned in the lawes, in life honeſt, and in iuſtice very moderate: for that all theſe condicions did concurre in <hi>Titus Annius,</hi> hée was by the Emperour <hi>Auguſtus</hi> in the office of <hi>Tribune</hi> named, by the Senate confirmed, and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple allowed. <hi>Titus Annius</hi> liued and was reſident in this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice xxv. yeres, in all whiche time hée neuer ſpake to man any iniurious word, either did any iniuſtice. In remuneration of his trauell,<note place="margin">A rewarde after death.</note> and in reward of his bountie, they gaue him for priuilege that hée ſhoulde bée buried within the walles of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that hée ſhould bury by him ſelfe ſome money, and that in that ſepulcher there ſhoulde not any other bée buried. For a man to bée buried in <hi>Rome,</hi> was amongſt the <hi>Romanes</hi> a great preheminence, the one was bycauſe the prieſts did conſecrate the ſepulcher, and the other for that malefactors to flie vnto ſepulchers, were more worth than the temples. But now theſe letters woulde ſaye, that <hi>Titus Annius</hi> (Iudge of the faultie) by him in his ſacred ſepulcher did hide certaine money, whiche is to wit, ten foote off, and that in the ſame ſepulcher the Senate doth commaund, that none of his heyres be buried.

It is long ſince I commended vnto my memorye, that ſentence of the diuine <hi>Plato,</hi> wher it is ſaid: that vnto whom we diſcouer our ſecret, wée giue our libertie. I ſay this vnto your Lordſhip, for that if I had not conſented that your Secretarie ſhoulde enter my ſtudie, neither had hée bin a babler, or your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip importunate.

that I ſhoulde viſite them, and trauaile to bring them agréed: whiche I did of very good will, although not without great difficultie. In fourtie dayes that I was there, I neither wente to walke, either did occupie my ſelfe in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, eyther giue my ſelfe to ſtudie: but all my exerciſe was to ſée priuiledges, to viſit boundes, to heare quarelles, and to appeaſe iniuries.

I haue ſaid all this, to the ende you ſhoulde holde me the rather excuſed, for not aunſwering ſo ſoone vnto your letter: and for not accompliſhing that whiche I promiſed you in the grades of <hi>Valentia:</hi> but the caſe was this.

               <p>The hiſtory of <hi>Saians</hi> horſe is written by very graue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, whiche is to wit: <hi>Cayus Baſsianus, Iulius Modeſtus,</hi> and <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> in the third Booke that hée made <hi>de noctibus At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticis.</hi> And I doe aledge theſe authors, for that no man ſhall thinke it is a compound fable, but that of a troth it did paſſe, as here wée ſhall recount the hiſtorie, reſiting it from the foundation.</p>
               <p>The great <hi>Hercules</hi> the <hi>Thebane,</hi> after that hée had ſlaine <hi>Diomedes</hi> in <hi>Thracia,</hi> brought with him to <hi>Greece,</hi> a certaine race of horſes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Diomedes</hi> had bred, which of their own proper nature were in colour fayre, of ſtature large, in condicions gentle, and in battell couragious. Of the race of theſe there was bred an horſe in the prouince of <hi>Argoſe,</hi> whoſe proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was, a high creſt, hear to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſlit noſtrelles, ſure houed, well membred, broade buttocks, a long tayle, great eyes, a ſoft ſkinne, colour baye, and aboue all, of courage maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fierce. This horſe being yet but a colt, they came from <hi>Aſia,</hi> from <hi>Paleſtina,</hi> from <hi>Thebes,</hi> from <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> and from all <hi>Greece,</hi> by the meane of his fame: ſome to ſée him, others to buy him, and other ſome to praiſe him and ſet him a ſale to the people: for there was no perſon that deſired not to ſée him, and much more to haue him. And in this world, as there is not a thing ſo perfit, in whiche there is not ſome imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the deſtiny of this horſe was ſo accurſed: for all they that bred him, bought him, and did ride him, died miſerable and infamed. And for that it ſhall not ſéeme that wée ſpeake at large, and doe recounte an hiſtorie very ſuſpicious: brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we will touche who were they that bought this horſe and did poſſeſſe him, and alſo the great miſfortunes that came vnto them by the ſame.</p>
               <p>In the yeare CCCCxiij. from the foundation of <hi>Rome, Quintus Cincinatus</hi> the Dictator being dead, the <hi>Romanes</hi> did ſende a <hi>Romane</hi> Conſull into <hi>Grecia</hi> that was named <hi>Cneius
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:150934:71"/>
Saianus,</hi> a man in bloud holden famous, and for gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the common wealth very wiſe. When the Conſull <hi>Cneius Saianus</hi> went into <hi>Greece,</hi> that horſe was a Colt of thirtie monethes, the which he cheapened, bought, and brake, and was the firſt that did ryde him. And for that this <hi>Cneius Saianus</hi> being in <hi>Rome,</hi> did follow the partialitie of <hi>Octauius Auguſtus:</hi> a yeare after hée went into <hi>Greece,</hi> and not ſix moneths after hée had bought that horſe, <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> commaunded his head to be cut off, and alſo his body to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried. This maye it appeare, that <hi>Cneius Saianus</hi> was the firſt that bought and brake this horſe, and alſo did experiment by death his vn happy deſtenie. They named him then, (and from thence forwarde,) <hi>Saianus</hi> horſe. <hi>Cneius Saianus</hi> being beheadded, there ſuccéeded him in the office of Conſulſhip, a certayne <hi>Romaine</hi> named <hi>Dolabella:</hi> whiche immediatly being Conſull, did buy that horſe for an hundreth thouſand <hi>Seſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cios:</hi> and ſurely if hée had knowen the euill that hée bought vnto his houſe (I think) hée would haue giuen an other hundreth thouſand not to haue bought him. Within a yeare after the Conſull <hi>Dolabella</hi> had bought that horſe, there aroſe in the Citie of <hi>Epirus</hi> (were hée was reſident) a popular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in whiche the ſorowfull <hi>Dolabella</hi> was ſlaine, and alſo drawen throughe the ſtreates. The Conſull <hi>Dolabella</hi> being dead, another Conſull was deſirous to buy that horſe, whoſe name was <hi>Caius Caſsius,</hi> a manne whome <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth to haue borne great office in <hi>Rome,</hi> and to haue done great déedes in <hi>Africa.</hi> Not two yeares after, the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſul <hi>Caſsius</hi> had bought that vnhappy horſe, they gaue him ſuche herbes at his dinner, that within an howre, hée, his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren loſt their liues, not hauing time to ſpeake one word. The Conſull <hi>Caius Caſsius</hi> being dead, the famous <hi>Romane Marcus Antonius</hi> deſired to buy that horſe: and hée was ſo pleaſed with the forme and ſhape thereof (when they brought him) that hée gaue as great reward to the bringer, as hée paid vnto him that ſolde the ſame: not twoo monethes after that <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> had bought this horſe, a batell was fought
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:150934:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at Sea betwixt him and his enemy <hi>Octauius Auguſtus:</hi> In whiche bataill his onely beloued <hi>Cleopatra</hi> would be preſent, to hir greate infamie, and greater loſſe of him ſelfe. What vnfortunate ende <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> had, and what an haſtye death his <hi>Cleopatra</hi> did ſuffer, is notorious to all men that haue reade <hi>Plutarch. Marcus Antonius</hi> being dead, yet ſtill that vnfortunate horſe remained aliue, whiche came to the handes of a Knight of <hi>Aſia,</hi> who was named <hi>Nigidius,</hi> and for that the horſe (as now) was ſomewhat olde, at that preſent he bought him good cheape, although afterwards he coſt him very deare: for within one yeare after he bought him, at the paſſage of the Riuer <hi>Marathon,</hi> the horſe ſtumbled and fell in ſuche wiſe, that both maſter and horſe were drowned, and were neuer more ſeene.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the fiue Knightes that are throwen downe at the foote of <hi>Sayans</hi> horſe, to wit, <hi>Saian, Dolabella, Caſsius,</hi>

                  <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Antonius,</hi> and <hi>Nigidius.</hi> The whiche hiſtory, although it bée delectable to reade, on the other part it is lamentable to heare. Afterwardes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Aſia</hi> they fell in reckoning and to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber the euill fortune that the horſe had alway with him, there aroſe amongeſt them a common prouerbe, to ſaye vnto the man that was vnhappy or vnfortunate, <hi>That he had ridden vpon Sayans horſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like chaunce happened when <hi>Scipio</hi> did robbe the Temples of <hi>Toloſa</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> in that of all thoſe which caried away any golde and riches to their houſes, none did eſcape, but within one yeare died, and all his familie and houſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.

               <p>My Lord Duke, pleaſeth it the Lord that wée were ſuche being whole, as we promiſe to be when we be ſicke. All the care of the euill Chriſtian when he is ſicke, is, to deſire to bée whole, onely to liue and enioye more of this world: but the deſire of the good Chriſtian whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is diſeaſed, is to be whole, not ſo much to liue as to reform his life. In the time of ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, there is none that doth remember himſelfe of affection or paſſion, of friendes or enemies, of riches or pouertie, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or diſhonour, of ſolace or trauell, of laying vp treaſure or growing poore, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunding or obeying: but to be deliuered of one grief of the dead, would giue all that he had gotten all the daies of his life. In ſicknes ther is no true pleaſure, &amp; in health all trauel is tollerable: what wants he that lackes not health?

What is it worthe that he poſſeſſeth that enioyeth not his health? What doth it profite to haue a very good bed if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſléepe?

What commoditie ariſeth vnto him that hath much money, if the more part hée ſpend vpon Phiſitians and Poticaries? Health is ſo great a thing, that to kéepe it and to conſerue it, wée ought not only to watche but ouerwatche: The whiche ſurely ſéemes not ſo, ſince we neuer haue regard thereof, vntil we haue loſt it.</p>

For the whips that doe moſt ſcourge our miſerable life, are ordinary exceſſe, and profound ſadneſſe. Experience teacheth vs euery daye, that the men that bée doltiſhe and ignorant, for the more part are alwayes ſtrong, luſtie, and in good healthe, and this is the reaſon: for that ſuche as they are, neither doe wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them ſelues to obtaine honour, eyther doe féele what is ſhame, reproch, or diſpite: the contrary of all this doth hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to men that be wiſe, diſcrete, quicke witted, and of ſharpe deuiſe: euerye one of which be not only grieued of that which

And for that my maſter did not eate but what I dreſt him, or drinke but what I broughte him, wyth great ſuertie I might haue killed him and reuenged my ſelfe: but that hauing more reſpect to the nobleneſſe of bloud from whence I was deſcended,<note place="margin">Where no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, no trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon haunteth.</note> than to the ſeruitude that I ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I thought it better to put my life in perill, than to do trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to my nobleneſſe.

eyther I muſt die, or be eaten with beaſtes, or returne to my maiſter, or elſe put my ſelfe in ſafetie. Hauing paſt thrée days and thrée nights, forſaking all high wayes, thicked my ſelf in the great deſert. And being vtterly tired with great &amp; extreme beate, and no leſſe in feare of them that ſhoulde ſéeke mée, I conueyed my ſelfe into a great Caue, ſomwhat darke, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance narrow, but more large within.</p>
                  <p>Not ſixe houres after I had conueyed my ſelfe into that denne, I ſaw at the entring therof a Lyon moſte terrible to beholde, whoſe feete and mouth was all bloudie, and my iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemente was that he had eaten ſome beaſte, or torne ſome man in pieces: (whiche was lyke inough) for that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the countrey is inhabitable, and the heate intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet there reſorte into thoſe deſertes ſome that go to hunt the Lyon, and other vnfortunate (as I) that flée from their Mayſters, whiche chooſe for leſſe euyll to be eaten wyth Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">An extreme diſtreſſe.</note> than all their liues to be ſlaues.

and the ioy I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued to ſée that moſt cruel beaſt ſtand ſo myld, come ſicke, goe ſo lame, and to aſke to be cured. And you may wel beleue it, for at that houre I was in ſuch eſtate, that if it were in the power of that Lion to take awaye my lyfe, I had not at that inſtant any ſenſe to féele my death.<note place="margin">Beaſtes doe feele benefits.</note> The griefe of this poore lion was, that from the head to the point he had thruſt a thorne into his foote, and his foote was full of of matter, maruellouſly ſwollen, and the worſt of all was, that the wounde was ſo blacke and ſo feſtred, that hardly the thorne might be then ſéene. When I had with the poynte of a knyfe opened the wounde, preſently iſſued the matter, and foorthwith I pulled out the thorne, incontinente I waſhed it with vrine, and then annoynted it with ſalue, and ſpéedyly I bound it vp with a piece of my ſhirt: in ſuch maner, that if I did not as I ought to do, at the leaſt, I did that I thought beſt to be doone.

After I ſawe my hoſt the Lions foote ſomewhat amended, and alſo that I likewiſe grew weary, lothſome, and full of that beaſtiall life: at the inſtant that he went out of the caue to hunt, preſently I came foorth to hyde me, conſtrayned thereto by neceſſitie, and not of will.<note place="margin">Abſence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.</note> The nighte béeing come, when the Lion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his caue, and founde me abſent (of a trouth I ſwear vnto thée O magnifice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Caeſar,</hi> that) I heard him from thence where I was hidden, giue ſo many and ſo ſorowfull brayes, that they filled my eyes full of teares.

Oh how great mercie doth God vſe with that man, that giues him wherewith to giue, and putteth him not in eſtate to craue of any man. For to ſhamefaſt faces, and to generous hearts, there is no trauell that ſo doth perce their intralles, as to enter to craue at other mens dores. <hi>Plutarch</hi> reported of the great <hi>Pompeius,</hi> that being ſicke in <hi>Puſoll,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Phiſitions ſaide, that to be hole and recouer ſtrength, it were conuenient hée ſhoulde eate of certain <hi>Zorzales</hi> that the Conſull <hi>Luculus</hi> did bréede:<note place="margin">Zorzales blackbirds.</note> he aunſwered I will rather die, than ſende to craue them, for the Goddes haue not created <hi>Pompeius</hi> to aſke, but to giue.</p>

For (as I haue ſaid) the gentleman that knoweth to rule his houſe, and to order his goodes: hée ſhall haue to ſpende, to kepe, and to giue. For Princes and Lordes of power ought not to bée called great or mighty for the proude eſtates that they hold, but for the great rewardes they giue.

                  <p>When I heard a certain knight valiant and of noble bloud (yet diſdainfull and very proud) that vſed always to ſay to all men (although of worſhip he talked withal) thou, thou, and he he, &amp; neuer added wordes of fauor, worſhip, or curteſy: I ſaid vnto him: By my life ſir I aſſure you, and do iudge many ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes with my ſelfe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for this cauſe God or the king ſhew you any fauor, bicauſe you neuer talk with any man with words of fauor, worſhip or curteſie.

it hapneth many times, that to be reuenged of a worde, the whole people do riſe againſt their Lord.

To buffet the boyes of the chamber, to pull them by the heare, to ioll them againſt the portall, and to ſpurne with the féete: Your Lordſhip ought not to do it, neither conſent that it bée done in your preſence.

And if we well conſider the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd: neither the hart of <hi>Silla</hi> was deceyued in that he propbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> neyther the Art of <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> did erre in that he diuined of <hi>Alcibiades:</hi> bycauſe the one depriued <hi>Rome</hi> of hir libertie, and the other darkned the glory of <hi>Greece.</hi> Thus much I thought to ſaye vnto youre Lordſhip, to the ende you might ſée, how my hart was not deceiued in diuining what you had written, and alſo what you craued.</p>

ſpent in diſpoſing, and tried in writing it. Many other Lords of this kingdome, and alſo out of the ſame do write vnto mée, and craue that I declare them ſome doutes, and ſend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome hiſtories: which doutes and demaundes be all plaine and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and at thrée turnes, I finde them amongſt my writings: but your Lordſhip is ſuch a frend of nouelties as always you aſke me hiſtories ſo ſtraunge and peregrine, that my wittes may not in any wiſe but néedes go on pilgrimage. My Lord comming, to the purpoſe, you ſay that the Earle of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa</hi> did write vnto you, that eleuen dayes before the good Conſtable Sir <hi>Ynnigo</hi> of <hi>Velaſco</hi> died, he hard me ſay and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that he ſhoulde die, the whiche as I then ſpake, ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it came to paſſe, but I would not declare vnto him, by what meane I vnderſtood it.</p>
               <p>Youre Lordſhips pleaſure is, that I ſhoulde write vntoo you, whether I did ſpeake it in earneſt or in ieſt: or if I ſawe in the ſickeman any prognoſtication, or if I knewe in thys matter any great ſecret: the which I will diſcouer vnto you, if you promiſe me to kéepe it ſecret, and that vnto me thereof you be not ingrate. The truth is, I ſayd it to the Earle of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa,</hi> and alſo to the Doctour <hi>Carthagna:</hi> neyther did I know it by reuelation as a Prophet, either did I obtayne it in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as a Nigromanticke, either did I finde it in <hi>Ptolomeus</hi> as an Aſtronomer, nor vnderſtand by the pulſe as a Phiſition, but I found it as a Philoſopher: for that the good Conſtable did then goe in the yeare Climatike.<note place="margin">A notable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret in the yere climatik.</note> At the preſent I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Conſtable to be ſick, I demaunded how old he was, and when they anſwered that he was thrée ſcore and thrée, I ſayde his life was in great perill, for that he was then in the moſt daungerous yeare to die.</p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding hereof it is to wit, that all the lyfe of man is like a long &amp; a perillous ſicknes, wherin the ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th and the ninth day is muche to be noted, for that in thoſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick dayes, the ſick do mend or grow worſe. That whiche the Phiſition dothe call Terme in the ſick man, is called in the whole by the Philoſopher Climate: and from thence it is, that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:150934:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from ſeuen to ſeuen yeares, and from nine to nine yeares, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do chaunge their complexions, and alſo many times theyr conditions. That this is true, it clearely appeareth, in that the man which is now flegmaticke, we ſée him turne cholerike, the furious to be milde, the proſperous to be vnfortunate, and alſo he that is wiſe remoue to be fooliſh. All whych com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that after ſeuen or nine yeares, they haue chaunged as we haue ſayde their conditions, and alſo theyr complexions. Alſo it is to be vnderſtoode, that in all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of oure lyfe, we onely lyue vnder one onely climat, the which is ſeuen, or nine yeares: except in the yeare of thrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and thrée, in the which two termes of two climats doe ioyne, which is to witte, nine ſeuens, or ſeuen nines: becauſe nine times ſeuen, and ſeuen times nine, be thréeſcore and thrée yeares, and therefore in that yeare many olde men dye. Thoſe that come to the yeare of thrée ſcore and thrée,<note place="margin">A perillous time for old men.</note> oughte to lyue in very good order, and to walke very warely: becauſe that yere is ſo perillous, that none paſſeth the ſame without ſuffering ſome daunger. Many and very notable men (in time paſt, and alſo preſent) died in that yeare of thréeſcore and thrée. More and ioyntly with this I ſaye, that the ſonne that ſhall ſée his Father paſſe this terme, let him not hope ſo ſoone to ſée him die: neyther as yet to inherite.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romaine</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> Princes, after they ſawe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues eſcaped the yeare, théeſcore and thrée, they gaue greate gifts vnto their people, and alſo offered no ſmall offerings in their Temples: as it is read of the Emperour <hi>Octauius,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Antonie</hi> the méeke, &amp; the good <hi>Alexander Seuerus.</hi>

               <p>I thought good to giue a reckoning vnto your honor of this hiſtorie: or to ſay better, of this philoſophie: becauſe you maye vnderſtand how I did diuine the death of the good Conſtable of <hi>Caſtile:</hi> which all we his friends and louers did ſée, within the yeare ſixtie thrée to begin to be ſicke: and alſo to make and to dye. Of all the great-ſtates of this kingdome, I holde ſome for kinſmen, others my good Lordes, ſome for neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and others for aquainted: but amongſt them all, I
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:150934:91"/>
held him for my ſinguler good Lord and friend, for that I fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him of a very good conuerſation, and of a ſounde condition. The good Conſtable was milde in commaunding, iuſt in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning,<note place="margin">Notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of a noble man.</note> wiſe in ſpéeche, large in expence, valiant in battell, méeke in pardoning, and a very good Chriſtian in liuing. For that your Lordſhip and he were captaynes in the warre, and Viceroys in time of peace: you will not denie that whiche I ſay to be very true, although I leaue of him much more to be ſaid. When you gaue and alſo ouercame the battell of <hi>Reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ega</hi> neare vnto <hi>Pampalona,</hi> I do remember, that I comming vnto your honour to confirme two billes, the one as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iuſtice, the other for goodes: your Lordſhip ſayde vntoo me theſe words: with me (father maſter) you haue framed and brought to paſſe, that I will do what you will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme what you demaund: but it is neceſſary, that firſte you informe the Conſtable of the caſe, and make relation vntoo him of the qualitie of the matter, for that he is very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed in the diſtribution of goodes, and very ſcrupulous in matters of Iuſtice. The good Conſtable had with me very great familiaritie, and I with him inuiolable friendſhip, and vpon this foundation he did alwayes communicate with me matters of conſcience, and diſcharges of his goodes, wherein alwayes I did know of hym, that he did procure to do well, and did ſhunne and auoyde to offende, I knowe not what to write more in this matter vnto your Lordſhip, but that the good Conſtable (if he finiſhed his life here in <hi>Madrid</hi>) at the leaſt in my chronicle his memorie ſhall remayne immortall.</p>

The truth knowen and the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vnderſtood, neyther ſhall I be blamed, or you remaine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. The very truth that hath paſſed in this matter is, that as they haue ſtolen from <hi>Manſilla</hi> your ſeruant his horſe, and he played away al his money that he brought by the way (in ſéeking to borow, to pay at his lodging) he forgat with me to take order for his anſwere.

But as your body is little, and your hart excéeding the ſame, by a third or fift: if you giue him place to ſpeake what he wil, and that he complayne what he féeleth, beléeue me my Lorde and be out of doubt, you ſhall liue in your ſelfe payned and diſcontented, and of others not welbeloued.</p>
               <p>The great and mightie Lords,<note place="margin">A leſſon for Lords.</note> ought of nothing more too preſume or boaſt themſelues, than to haue great harts, which they ought to inioy, (if they will imploy them well,) in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating themſelues in great proſperities, and not to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied in their great aduerſities. My iudgement is, ſince your Lordſhip is naturally cholerike, and of ſmall patience, that you giue not your ſelfe to write when you be diſtempered: for men do write many times in their choler, whiche after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they would not ſhould haue paſſed (ſo much as) their thoughts. To the argument whiche you alledge that I eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med you but little bycauſe I wold not anſwer preſently: this I anſwere, I deny the premiſes, and defye the conſequence: bicauſe your Lordſhip hath much, may do muche, deſerueth much, and therefore we all eſtéeme you very muche. For me to be ignorant of the great eſtate of your perſone, of bloud ſo vnſpotted, of iudgement ſo delicate, in letters of ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe,

and of ſo greate dexteritie in armes: the cauſe were to great fooliſhneſſe, or to much lacke of wit. But let the cace reſt, let vs deuide all this vnkindneſſe amongſt vs, whiche is to wit, that your Lordſhip from hence forward deferre or put off your choler, pardon <hi>Manſilla</hi> for forgetting his letter: and alſo kind me to expound your doubts: and after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we will giue amends to that which is paſt, and vſe ſile<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for the time to come.</p>
               <p>Your honour demaundeth, that I declare, wherefore the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> in the vale of <hi>Mambre,</hi>

For notwithſtanding I haue ſéene much, and read much, I can not remember me to haue conſidered or doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, neither at anytime to haue preached thereof: I dare bée bold to ſay, that by theſe two maners of fallings, the one back wards, and the other forwards, do ſignifie two kindes of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. For euen as to fall after the one manner or the other, in the end all is falling: ſo in like manner, to ſinne after the one ſort or the other, all is ſinning. Thoſe that do fall vppon the backe, and backwards, we ſée them haue their faces diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered,<note place="margin">To be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of ſinne, is hope of ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and looking vp to heauen: by theſe are to be vnderſtood: thoſe which do ſinne without the feare of God, &amp; afterwardes haue no ſhame to haue ſinned. We ſée by experience that he that falleth forwardes, may helpe hym ſelfe to riſe with hys hands, with hys elbowes, with his knées, and with hys féete: by this I woulde ſay, that then we haue hope to come out of ſinne, when we ſhall be aſhamed to haue ſinned. The contrary happeneth in him that falleth backwards, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whych can neuer help him ſelfe with his handes, or lift him ſelfe, or ſtay with his féete. By this I would ſay, that the man that is not aſhamed to be a ſinner, late or neuer ſhall we ſée hym

come out of ſinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> doe ſaye, that no yong man of <hi>Rome</hi> might enter amongſt the common women, but wyth their faces very wel couered. If ther hapned any ſo vnſhame-faſt that durſt enter or come foorth diſcouered: ſo openly was he chaſtiſed, as if he had committed ſome forcible adultery. It is to be noted, that all thoſe that fell forward were ſaints: as <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> and on the contrary, thoſe that fell backwardes, as <hi>Hely</hi> the prieſt of the temple, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> that ſold Chriſt were ſinners. Out of all this there may bée gathered, how much, and how greatly we haue to regard, not only that we fall, either ſo much as to ſtumble: for we knowe not whether we ſhall fall forward as <hi>Abraham,</hi> or backward as the vnfortunate <hi>Hely.</hi> Conſidering we diſcend of ſinners, liue amongſt ſinners, be conuerſant amongſt ſinners, and this world being in ſo great want of iuſt men, we cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer our ſelues from all ſinnes: ioyntly therefore with thys let vs pray vnto the Lord, that if he take away his grace, that we do fall, that he take not away ſhamefaſtneſſe wherewith to ariſe. Much is God offended with vs to ſée how little we eſtéeme to ſinne, but he is muche more offended to ſée howe ſlowly we remember to repent: for they be very few that do leaue to ſinne, but at the time when they cannot more ſinne. Oh how many moe be they that fal backward with <hi>Hely,</hi> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> forward with <hi>Abraham:</hi> for if there be one that is aſhamed of ſinne, there is an hundreth that account ſinne but paſtime. Let euery man eſtéeme himſelfe as he liſt, and let euery man ſay what he ſuppoſeth:<note place="margin">No greter ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than he that preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be good.</note> but for my part I hold none for a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinner, than he that accompts himſelfe for very iuſt: ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I conceyue for very iuſt, but he that acknowledgeth himſelfe to be a great ſinner. God doth well knowe what wee can do, and he vnderſtandeth very well the ſtrength that we haue: and thereof it is, that he is not offended for that we bée not iuſt, but bycauſe we doe not confeſſe to be ſinners. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to ſay, that God doth not maruell that we be humane in ſinning, but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which doth offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him is, for that being as we
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:150934:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are ſo great ſinners, we would well make the world beléeue that we be very iuſt. Let the concluſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be in this matter, that they only fall backwards with <hi>Hely,</hi> and with the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> that ſo without remorſe ſit downe to ſinne, as they would ſit downe to eate, and lie downe to ſléepe. Of that whiche I doe moſt maruell in this matter is, that being as we are fallen into moſt grieuous ſinnes, we do ſo liue, and go ſo contented, as though we had receyued of God a ſafeconduit to be ſaued. Behold here my Lord your letter anſwered. Beholde youre doubt abſolued. Beholde here my fault excuſed. And alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold here your choler remoued.

Father Abbot I aſſure you of a troth, I did neuer ſée my ſelfe amongſt thoſe ſharpe crags, amongſt thoſe high mountains, amongſt thoſe cruell rocks, &amp; amongſt thoſe thick woods, that I did not purpoſe to be an other, that I did not ſorow for time paſt, and that I did not abhorre libertie, &amp; did loue to be alone. I did neuer paſſe by craggie moone that forthwith I was not contrite, that I was not repentant at great leyſure, that I did not celebrate with teares, that I did not watche one nyghte, that I gaue not to the poore: &amp; aboue all, that I did not fill my ſelfe with ſighing, and purpoſe to amend. Or that it pleaſed the God of heauen that I were ſuche here, and in my whole lyfe, as I haue purpoſed to bee when I was there. The more I goe laden with dayes, the more dull I féele my ſelfe in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, &amp; which is worſt of al, that in good deſires I am a ſaint, and in dooing good works I am a ſinner, preaching as I doe preach, that heauen is full of good works, &amp; hell is full of good thoughts. I knowe not whether they be my frendes that doe counſel me, parents that doth importune me, enimies that do direct me, buſineſſe that doth hinder me, <hi>Caeſar</hi> that withoute ceaſing commaundes me, or the diuell that temptes me. The more I doe purpoſe to parte from the worlde, more and more I fynde my ſelfe ſinkyng to the bottome thereof. The trouth is, that the lyfe of the Courte, is verie pleaſaunte for ſuch as haue an appetite therto: for there we ſuffer hunger, colde, thirſte, wearyneſſe, pouertie, ſorrowe, angers, diſfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours and perſecutions: all whyche be tollerable and verie eaſy to be ſuffered: for there is none that dothe hynder oure libertie, neyther taketh reckening of our ydleneſſe.

to the dregs. Your lordſhip aſketh a matter ſo high, &amp; a thing ſo profound, that I had rather vnderſtand than ſpeak it, taſt it than write it: for they know more therof that be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, than ſuch as be occupied in reading: but this is the doubt. Since God the father did ſend to Chriſt his ſon, a cup to drinke of bitterneſſe: wherof is <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> reprehended, for the cup that ſhe drank of wrath? the one was the cup, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was the cup: the one of bitterneſſe, the other of wrathe: the Synagogue did receyue the one, and the Churche the other: Chriſte dyd drinke the one, <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> dyd drynke the other: God ſent the one, and God ſent the other. But ſince it is ſo, why doe they ſo muche prayſe the cuppe that Chriſte taſted of, and condemne the ſorrowfull cuppe that <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> dyd drinke?</p>
               <p>To vnderſtand the profunditie of this ſcripture, we muſte preſuppoſe, that there be two maners of cuppes, which is to wit, the cup that is ſayd ſimply only of God, and the cup that is ſayd with an addition, that is, of the ire of God. There is ſo great difference betwixt theſe two cuppes, that in the one we drink heauen, in the other we ſwalow hell: the holy cup of God is no other thing but temptations, hunger, cold, thirſte, perſecutions, exile, pouertie, and martirdom: of which thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, God giues to drink and to taſt, to ſuch as he hathe choſen to ſerue him, and hath predeſtinate to be ſaued. Vnto whome God giueth this cup to drynke, it is a ſigne that he is regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred amongeſt them that ſhall be ſaued: in ſuche ſorte that we can not eſcape Hell, but at the coſte of verie great trauel. Profoundly it is to be conſidered what Chriſt ſayde: that the cup ſhould not only be giuen to his owne perſon, but that it ſhoulde alſo paſſe vnto his Church, in ſuch wiſe that he drank thereof, but he made not an ende: for if Chriſt had dronke al the cuppe, only Chriſt ſhould haue entred the glorie. And for this cauſe he prayed vnto his father that the cup ſhoulde paſſe vnto thoſe of his Churche, for that we ſhoulde all enter with him into the glorie. Oh high miſterie neuer heard of, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Chriſt being in the Garden, in the darke alone, flat vpon his knées,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:150934:96"/>
ſweating, praying, and wéeping, he did not craue of hys Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the elect of his Church ſhuld be cheriſhed or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pampred, but of that cup he would giue them a draught to drinke. Of that cup of bitterneſſe and trauell, only Chriſt did drinke his fill: bicauſe he only was ſufficient to redéeme vs. All we that came after Chriſt. If we cannot drinke our fill, I would to God we might drinke ſufficient for our Saluation: the ſword of ſaint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Croſſe of ſaint <hi>Andrew,</hi> the knife of ſaint <hi>Bartelmew,</hi> the girdierne of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> &amp; the ſheares of ſaint <hi>Steuen,</hi> what other things are they, but certaine bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they haue receyued of Chriſte,<note place="margin">Badges of Chriſt.</note> and certaine gulpes they haue drunke of his cup. So many more degrées we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in Heauen of Glorie, as we haue drunke of the cup of Chriſt in this life, and therefore we ought to pray vnto God euery day with teares, that if we cannot drinke all his cup, at the leaſt that he will ſuffer vs to taſt thereof. The cuppe of Chriſt (although it be bitter in drinking) after the drinking thereof, it doth greate profit: I would ſaye, that the trauells which we ſuffer to be good, they giue not ſo much paine when we endure them, as they afterwards giue pleaſure, hauing paſſed them. Prouide who will of the wines of <hi>Illana,</hi> of the buttes of <hi>Candia,</hi> and of the pipes of <hi>Rebedew:</hi> but for my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and ſaluation, I aſke not of God, but that al the days that remaine of my life, he giue me leaue to drink if he pleaſe but one drop of his cup.</p>
               <p>There is another Cup which is called the cup of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wrath of God: wherof to ſpeake, the entrailes do open, the hart doth faile, the fleſh doth tremble, and the eyes do wéepe: with thys God doth threaten vs, this is that whiche the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of: Of this the ſorowfull <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> did drinke: of this the vnfortunate Sinagogue did make hir ſelfe dronke. And the drunkenneſſe of this, was the cauſe that <hi>Iſraell</hi> was baniſhed from <hi>Iudea,</hi> and tranſlated into <hi>Babilon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He drinketh of the cup of wrath, that falleth from the ſtate of grace wherein he ſtood, wherof it foloweth that the ſoule is much more dead without grace, than a body without a ſoule.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:150934:97"/>
Then it is ſayde that God is an angred,<note place="margin">Withoute grace a ſoule is lyke a body without life.</note> when he is careleſſe of vs, and that day that we be forgetfull to feare him, and he not delighted to loue vs, and ſtumbling at euery ſteppe, in the end of the iorney we ſhall be condemned. Oh what diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is in the wrath that men doe ſhewe, and in that wrath and yre, which is ſayd to procéede from God: for when men be angry they reuenge, but God when he is angrie, hee ceaſeth to chaſtiſe. In ſuche wiſe that God doth more chaſten an euill man, when he deferreth &amp; doth diſſemble with hym, than when he doth preſently torment him. There is not a greater temptation, than not to be tempted: there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter trouble, than not to be troubled: there is not greater cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement, than not to be chaſtiſed: neyther is there a greater whip, than not to be ſcourged of God. The ſick man of whoſe helth the phiſition diſpaireth is in ſmall hope of his life, I would ſay, that his ſinne which God doth not chaſtiſe: I haue great ſuſpition of his ſaluation.</p>
               <p>It is much to be noted, that the Prophete dothe not onely threaten <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> for that ſhe did drinke the cuppe of wrath: but alſo bycauſe ſhe did drink the grounds and dregs therof, vntill nothing was left: in ſuche wiſe, that if there had bin more, ſhe woulde haue dronke more. To drinke of the cuppe vnto the dregges, is: that hauing offended God greeuouſly committing all manner of ſinnes wickedly, forſaken ſome articles of the faith peruerſely, and hauing ſinned with al the members damnably: As if the commaundements being ten, had bin ten thouſand, we had rather die than leaue any one of them diſobeyed.</p>
               <p>To drinke the Cup vnto the dregges, is when we be not contented with breaking of one commaundement or two or thrée, but that of force they muſt be broken al ten: to drinke y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cup vnto the dregs, is: if we leaue to commit any ſinnes, it is not for want of will, but for want of power, or for wante of occaſion: to drinke the cup vnto the dregges is, that we doe not onely content our ſelues with ſinning, but that we doe preſume and boaſte ourſelues of oure ſinning: to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:150934:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drinke the cuppe vnto the dregges is, committing as we doe all manner of ſinnes, we can not ſuffer that they call vs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: to drinke the cup vnto the dregges is, to haue ſo greate vnſhamefaſtnes in ſinning, that we dare not entire and vrge others to ſinne: to drinke the cup vnto the dregges is, to haue our deſires like a ſaint, and our deſerts like a deuill.</p>
               <p>Behold here my Lorde <hi>Admirall,</hi> what I conceaue of that text of the Prophet, beholde here what I do thinke of youre doubt, and I beſéech God our Lord that he being pleaſed, we may deſerue to drinke of the cup that Chriſt did drinke of, and not of the cup that <hi>Ieremie</hi> doth write of.

with whome they may repoſe and pleaſantly be conuerſant: for there is not in this mortall life a thing that doth ſo recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the hart: as is ſwéete conuerſation.

               <p>The old men of your age, ought not as nowe to vſe vayne and light paſtimes, but to haue regarde to the beſtowing of their goodes, and to conſider for their houſes: for the olde man that lookes not to his ſubſtance, ſhall want to eate, and hée that watcheth not his houſe, ſhall not lacke wherefore to wéepe. The old men of your age be bound to go cleanly, and well clad, but they haue not licence to be curious, either with niceneſſe to weare their garmentes: for in yong men to bée neat, is a good curioſitie, but in old men, it is great vanitie.</p>
               <p>The olde men of your age ought much to flée brawling with your aduerſaries, either trauerſe in words with your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: for if they replie any ouerthwart words, or ſpeake any bitter iniury, the hurt is, that you haue a hart to feele it, and not ſtrength to reuenge it. The old men of your age, oughte to be charitable, pitifull, and almes giuers: for yong menne without experience, walke ſo bedolted of the things of thys world, that it ſeemeth vnto them ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be termed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians: but the old men that time hath aduiſed, and age deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from diſceit, let them hold it for certaine that God of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will neuer haue pitie,<note place="margin">The exerciſe of good old men.</note> if they haue not charitie. The old men of your age, ought to haue ſome good Bookes to profite, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hiſtories to paſſe away the time: for as nowe their age doth not ſuffer to walke, muche leſſe to trauell, and as they are forced all day to be idle and penſiue, ſo is it of more deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that they fill themſelues with reading in bookes: than too be tired in thinking of times paſt. The old men of youre age ought to auoyde entering into conuocations, ſeſſions, and

Siſes: for in ſuch places they intreat not but cauſes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The olde men of your age, when you ſhall be in counſell, or called to counſell, ought not to be raſh, ianglers, or contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for it apertayneth to yong men to folow their opinion, &amp; the old men but only reaſon. The olde men of your age,<note place="margin">The notes of good old men.</note> ought to be ſober, pacient, and chaſt, and to preſume more to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vertuous than old: for in theſe times, and alſo in time paſt, they haue more reſpect to the life he leadeth, than to the hoare heares he weareth. The olde men of your age, ought to hold for their chiefe exerciſe, to go euery day to Church, and to heare ſeruice on the holyday: and if this ſhall ſéeme painefull or tedious, I giue him licence to go no ofter to Church being old, than he went to viſite his innamored when he was yong. The olde men of your age, ought to haue all things well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided for their ſoules, to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d alſo for the health of their perſons: for as <hi>Galene</hi> ſayth, old age is ſo monſtrous in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is neither a ſickneſſe finiſhed, or a perfect health. The old men of your age, before all thinges ought to procure their houſes good and healthy, ſcituate in a gladſome &amp; ſound ayre: for I am of opinion, that there is no goodes better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, than that whiche old men beſtowe vpon a good houſe. The old men of your age, ought to procure, not only to dwell in a good houſe, but alſo to ſléepe in a good chamber,<note place="margin">Neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſion for olde men.</note> in a bedde very clenly, and the chamber very cloſe: for as the old man is delicate and of ſmal ſtrength, ſo be is more offended by a little ayre that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes in at a chinke, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the cold of one whole win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter night did gréeue him when he was yong.

The old men of your age, ought too procure their bed curteyned, their Chamber hanged, a meane fire, the chimney without ſmoke: for the life of olde men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in going clenly, warme, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, and without anger. The old men of your age, ought vtterly to auoide to dwel vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon any riuer, either to do their buſines in moiſt groundes, either to ſléepe in ayry places, for olde men being delicate as they are, be like children, and naturally accraiſed: the ayre ſhall penetrate their powers, and moyſtneſſe ſhall enter their bones. The old me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of your age, vpon paine of their life ought to be temperate in their diet, refuſing to eate late: for old me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as they haue their ſtomacks weake and growen colde, they may not diſgeſt two meales in a day:<note place="margin">Temperance in old men prouoketh ſleepe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoydeth belke.</note> for the olde man that is vnſatiable and a glutton, vſing the contrary, ſhall belke much and ſléepe little.

The old men of your age ought to haue great care to auoyde all contentious brabbling amongſt their ſeruants, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time to beare with their negligences, to pay their wages, too the ende they go contented: for otherwiſe they will be negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſeruice, and very ſuttle in ſtealing.

               <p>Sir in this caſe I remit you to <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> to <hi>Teſiphontes,</hi> to <hi>Doreatius,</hi> to <hi>Plutarch,</hi> and to <hi>Ouid,</hi> which ſpent much time, and wrote many bookes, to giue order in what manner the enamored ſhoulde loue, and the remedies that for their loue they ſhould vſe. Let <hi>Ouid</hi> write what him pleaſeth, &amp; <hi>Dorcas</hi> ſay what he thinketh good, but in fine, there is no better reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for loue, than is, neuer to begin to loue:<note place="margin">A moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine remedie for loue.</note> for loue is ſo euill a beaſt, that with a thread he ſuffereth to be taken, but hée will not depart with thruſts of a launce. Let euery man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he attempteth, marke what he doth, beholde what he taketh in hand, note whither he dothe enter, and haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde where he may be taken: for if it were in his handes to ſet the tables, he is not certaine to win the game. There is in loue after it is begon, infinite ſhelues, immeſurable ſloughes, daungerous rockes, and vnknowen whirelpooles, in whych ſome remaine defaced, others blinded, ſome beſoilde, and alſo ſome others vtterly drowned, in ſuch wiſe, that he that is beſt deliuered, I accoumpt to be euill deliuered.</p>
               <p>Oh how many times did <hi>Hercules</hi> deſire to be deliuered from his loue <hi>Mithrida, Menelaus</hi> from <hi>Dortha, Pyrrhus</hi> from <hi>Helena, Alcibiades</hi> from <hi>Dorobella, Demophon</hi> from <hi>Phillis, Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>In caſe of loue, let no man truſt any man, and much leſſe him ſelfe: for loue is ſo naturall to man or woman, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be beloued, that where loue amongſt them dothe once cleaue, it is a ſore that neuer openeth, and a bond that neuer vnknitteth. Loue is a metall ſo delicat, &amp; a canker ſo ſecret, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he planteth not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> face where he may be ſene, nor in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pulſe where he may be felte, but in the ſorowfull hart where (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

he be ſenſible) they dare not diſcouer it. After all this, I ſay, that the remedie that I giue for loue, is, that they gyue him no place to enter amongſt the entrayles, nor giue theyr eyes libertie to behold windowes, or giue eare to bawdes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer any trade of Dames to come or goe, &amp; if any come to houſe, to ſhut the dores, and not to walke abroade after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening: if with theſe conditions loue may not altogither bée remedied, at the leaſt it may be eaſed and amended.</p>

The greateſt mercy that God vſeth to an old man is to giue him to vnderſtand, that he is become old: for if he know this of himſelf, of a trouth he ſhal fynd that the olde man hath not of any thing more certaintie, than euery day to look for death. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaide: <hi>Iuuenes citò moriuntur, ſenes aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diu viuere no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſunt,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, it is true that yong men die quickly, but the old men can not liue long.

They ſay vnto me that your Lordſhip is vexed, ſorowfull, and alſo vntractable: theſe are priuileges of olde menne, but not of wiſe olde men: for it ſhoulde be a muche greater loſſe to haue the wit blaſted, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Corne deſtroied.

Chriſt being as hée is, the whole truth and the ſumme of Iuſtice, it ſéemeth a thyng diſproporcioned to giue vnto the good, infinite glorie for temporall merites, and to giue vnto the euill eternall paine, for temporall faultes: Since he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> that by the weight of their deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites the wicked ſhould be tormented.

For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding hereof, it is to wit, that the paine they haue to giue vs in the other world, and the rewarde we ſhall receyue in the glorie, is not anſwerable to the many or fewe workes which wée do, but vnto the much or little charitie wherewith we worke them: for God dothe not beholde what wée doe preſently, but what we would do.

                     </note> the paine makes not the Martyr, but the cauſe wherefore he ſuffreth.

The Prophet to ſay, <hi>inclinaui cor meum in aeternum,</hi> is as if he ſhoulde ſay, I Lorde do bind my ſelfe to ſerue thée, ſo muche as ſhall pleaſe thée to be ſerued of me. In that if it ſhall pleaſe thée to perpetuat my life, it ſhall be always imployed in thy ſeruice, what wilt thou that I ſay more, (oh my God,) but if it ſhall pleaſe thée, and may be to thy ſeruice, that my dayes be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, that at the leaſt my good deſires may be infinite, <hi>quia in aeternum inclinaui cor meum.</hi> Oh with how greate deſire ought we to ſerue God, and how great hope ought we to haue of our ſaluation, for that we haue a Lord of ſo good condition, and a God of ſuche power, that without any ſcruple we maye ſet downe in his accompt, not only what we doe, but alſo what we deſire to do.

There are affaires of ſuche qualitie, that only to ſpeake in them were ſhamefull, and yet if they bée procured for others, it is great charitie. The thing that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the great moſt prayſed in the great philoſopher <hi>Caliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> was, that for others he craued many things, and for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe nothing. <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> were mortall enemies, but in the ende, on a certaine day in the Senate, <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſayd vnto <hi>Cicero,</hi> I cannot denie this (Oh <hi>Cicero</hi>) but that in the thinges that touche thy ſelfe, thou art remiſſe, and in matters that concerne the common wealth, very importune.</p>
               <p>There was a Law amongſt the <hi>Romaines</hi> much vſed and alſo obſerued, that vpon paine of death none ſhoulde preſume to approch the tent, where the Emperour did eate and ſléepe, except ſuch as did ſerue him by day and guard him by night, but the caſe was thus.

the ſoldiour obtayned life, the companions eſcaped diſtreſſe and ſhame, and the good Prince enioyed the renoume of cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. I thought good to alledge theſe old examples, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe ſuch as you that be ſupreme Iudges, and conſtituted in high eſtates, to the ende that if you will not doe all that wée craue, at the leaſt you will not chide vs when we be ſuters vnto you: bycauſe, that bond that holdeth the Iudge to be iuſt in that he iudgeth, the very ſame doth bind the good to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune when he ſueth for another. The office of the good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to pray and be importunate, not only for the good, but alſo for the euill: it is to wit, for the good that they maye be made better, and for the euill that they pardon them. Since there is no lawe in this worlde ſo rigorous, that in good or in euill part may not be interpreted, the Iudges haue to preſuppoſe we do not deſire them to breake their lawes, but that they do but moderate them: for many times the ſuter doth complaine, not of the ſentence of condemnation, but of the deſire that the iudge did ſhew to condemne him In the iudge it is not onely a vice intolerable to condiſcend to all that which they craue, but alſo a great extremitie to doe nothing of that they deſire: the good Iudge ought to be alwayes iuſt in that he giueth ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and in that they deſire him ſometime humaine. When the Conſull <hi>Aſcanius</hi> did boaſt himſelfe that in the office of Cenſor or iudge, he had neuer admittted, either ſo muche as heard the requeſts of his friends.<note place="margin">An anſwer of Cato to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canius.</note> The good Cenſor <hi>Cato</hi> ſayd vnto him on a certain day in the Senat, the offence ſtandeth not (oh <hi>Aſcanius</hi>) in that the Iudge ſuffreth himſelfe to be ſued vnto, but to conſent himſelfe of any man to be commaunded. Not of few, but of many Iudges we maye iuſtly ſaye, that which they do not at the intreatance of a gentleman, they doe afterwards by the Counſell of their priuat friend. I do lie if I did not intreat a Iudges wife to cauſe him to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider of a plée of a friend of mine, whiche aunſwered me, Intreat? what think not Maſter <hi>Gueuara,</hi> that my huſband hath a wife that muſt intreat, but commaund: And ſo it came to paſſe (as ſhe ſaid) for that which could not be obtained in halfe a yeare, ſhe

The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Iudges that naturally be ſeuere and vntractable, it is impoſſible but that they muſt be odious vnto all men, and for this cauſe I thinke it very méete, that one by one they ſhoulde heare all men with curteſie, and afterwards determine what they ſhall finde by Iuſtice. Many Iuſtices do holde it for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauncement of honour to heare their ſuters with an euill will, and not to doe anye thing wherein they bée intreated: which they do not, bycauſe they be iuſt in their offices, but for that of their nature they be euill condicioned.</p>

It is well to bée beléeued that ſome of theſe glorious linages were riſen in thoſe dayes, and if they were not put amongſt the knightes of the band, it was not bycauſe they wanted grauitie, but for that they had not at that tyme ſuche authoritie, and alſo by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (though they had ſufficient nobleneſſe) they wanted ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Alſo it is to be thought that of thoſe aunciente and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten linages there are inough at thys inſtant deſcending and decayed, that he noble and vertuous: whiche for that we ſée they haue little and may do little, we hold it for better too kéepe ſilence, than ſo name them. The ſonnes of Gentlemen and Knights, be they neuer ſo glorious in bloud, if they haue little, and may doe little, (let them hold it for certaine) they will eſtéeme them but little: and therefore it were very good counſell, that they ſhoulde rather remayne riche ſeruantes in their countries, than to come to the Courts of Kinges to bée poore Gentlemen. For after thys manner they ſhoulde in their countries be honored, that now go in Court diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunced.</p>
               <p>According to this purpoſe it came to paſſe in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Cicero</hi> being ſo valiaunt of perſon, and hauing ſo great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement and power in the common wealth, they dyd beare him great enuie on all ſides, and beheld him with ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much malice.

ſcarcely I can write you a letter wherof al in your houſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not. As much as it doth pleaſe me that al men know me to be your friende: ſo muche doth it gréeue me, when you diſcouer of me any ſecret, chiefly in graue and moſt waightie affaires: for comming to the intelligence of youre wife and children that you communicat with me your delicat affayres, they will make great complaint if to the profit of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I direct not your conſcience. My Lady the Ducheſſe did write vnto me, aduertiſing to haue ſome ſcruple in me, ſaying: that I was againſt hir as concerning the houſe of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uare,</hi> which I did neuer ſpeake or thinke: for the office that I do moſt boaſt myſelfe of, is to direct men that they be noble and vertuous, and not to vnderſtand in making or marring of heyres or Manor houſes.</p>
               <p>My Lorde Conſtable you do know, that at all times when you diſcouer your ſelfe, and take counſell of me, I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſayd, and do ſay, that the Gentleman of neceſſitie muſt pay that he oweth, and what he hath, deuide at his will: and that to make reſtitution there néedeth a conſcience, and too giue or deuide, iudgement and wiſdome: if there paſſe eyther more or leſſe betwixt vs two, it is without néede that youre nobleneſſe ſhould ſpeake it, or of my authoritie be confeſſed. For the things that naturally be graue, and do require ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, if we may not auoyde that they iudge or preſume of them, at the leaſt we may cut off, that they knowe them not. In that your Lordſhip hath let flie ſome words, or loſt ſome let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of mine, my Lady the Ducheſſe is not a little offended with me, and I do not maruell thereof, in that ſhe not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the miſterie of your ſpéech, or the ciphers of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, did kindle hir choller, and rayſed a quarrell againſt me: Beléeue me my Lorde Conſtable, that neither in ieſt or ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, you ought to put ſecret things in confidence of women: for to the end that others ſhall eſtéeme them more, they will diſcouer any ſecret. I hold the huſbands for very doltiſh that hide their money from their wiues, and truſt them wyth their ſecrets: for in the money there is no greater loſſe than

Of this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple your Lordſhip may gather, that the things that be graue and effectuall, ought not to be committed to the confidence of women, muche leſſe ſpoken in their preſence: for to them it importeth nothing the knowledge of them, and their huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds it toucheth much, if they be diſcouered. There is no reaſon to thinke, either is it iuſt to preſume and ſay, that all women are like, for that we ſée there are many of them honorable, honeſt, wiſe, diſcrete, and alſo ſecrete: whereof ſome haue huſbands ſo fooliſh and ſuch buzardes, that it ſhoulde be more ſure to truſt them than their huſbands. Not offending the gentlewomen that be diſcrete and ſecrete, but ſpeaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of all, I ſaye, that they haue more abilitie to breede children, than to kéepe ſecrets.

               <p>My Lord Conſtable, I ſhall moſt hartely deſire you not to haue ſuch care to make proues of triacle with my letters, but to reade them, and to teare or elſe burne them: for it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that ſome day you might reade them before ſome not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wiſe, either yet of good condition, that might deuine to my hurt, that which they vnderſtand not, to their owne profit.</p>

I ſet it downe in mine own account. Beſides the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my deſire, your Lordſhip hath performed that which you were bound to doe: for Princes and great Lordes haue no licence to doe iniuries, eyther ſo muche as to reuenge them. For as you know, that whiche is in the meaner called wrath, in the mightie is named pride: and that which amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the ſmaller ſort is chaſtiſement, in the mightie is termed ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As oft as you ſhall make coniugation with youre no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe and conſcience, and ſhall call to remembrance that you be a Chriſtian and a Knight, it ſhall not miſlike you of the offences you haue diſſimuled, and it ſhall grieue you of the iniuries you haue reuenged. The pardoning of iniuries gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth great contentation to the hart, and the deſire of reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is no ſmall torment thereof. By that whiche is ſaid, I woulde ſaye, that ſometimes for ſome man to reuenge ſome little iniurie, he eſcapeth from thence much more iniuried. There be ſome iniuries, that onely are not to be reuenged, neither as muche as to bée confeſſed: for things of honour are ſo delicate, that the ſame day that any confeſſeth to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued an iniurie, from that day he bindeth himſelfe to take reuengement.</p>

of man is growen ſo great, that many woulde pardon their enemies, and dare not for feare of their friends: for if they once perceiue them to ſpeake of pardoning any man, preſently they will ſay, they doe it more of cowardiſe, than of conſcience. Be it as be may, and let euery man ſpeake as he thinketh good in this caſe of pardon, your lordſhip hath done with that Gentleman like a faithfull Chriſtian, and with me like a very friend: and beſide fidelitie to God, and frendſhip to a friend.

that the ſhamefaſt man and of a noble minde, oughte to giue vnto his friendes money with liberalitie, and counſell with greate grauitie.</p>
               <p>If it bée true (as it is moſte certayne) that he oughte to haue all theſe conditions that ſhoulde giue counſell vnto an other, we dare wel ſay, that to giue counſell is an office ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>In this preſent letter you aduertiſe me that now you are enamored and taken with other new loues, and that ſince I ſayd the troth in the firſt, you pray me to write my opinion in the ſecond, (holding it for certaine, that my ſkil ſerueth to let bloud in the right vayne, and alſo to bind vp the wound.) Sir <hi>Moſen Rubin,</hi> I woulde you had written or demaunded ſome other matter: for ſpeaking the very troth in this matter of loue, you are not in the age to follow it, eyther may it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with my ingrauitie to write it: of my habit, of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and of my authoritie and grauitie, you ſhoulde haue demaunded caſes of counſell, and not remedies of loue: for I haue red more in <hi>Hoſtienſis</hi> that inſtructeth to giue counſell, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Ouid</hi> that teacheth to be enamored. Of a troth maſter <hi>Moſen Rubin</hi> I ſay, that it is neither you or I, that loue dothe like, and with whome ſhe doth delight. For you are now olde, and I am religious, in ſuch ſort, that in you age doth abound, and in me wanteth libertie. Beléeue me ſir &amp; be out of doubt, it is not loue but ſorow, not mirth but diſpleaſure, not taſt but torment, not recreation but confuſion: when in the enamored there is not youth, libertie, and liberalitie. The man that is now entred into age, and wil be yong againe and enamored, they neuer terme him an old louer, but a filthy old foole, and (as God ſaue me) they haue great reaſon that ſo do call them: for old rotten ſtrawes are more fit to make dung, than to bée kept.

The doltiſh louer beſides that his dame ſcorneth him, his neighbours ieſt at him: his ſeruantes beguile him, <hi>Pandar</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>péeleth him, he is blinded with gilefull ſpéeche, euill imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his iuels, goeth without foreſight, he is light of beliefe, and in the end findes himſelfe beflouted. All the offices, crafts, and ſciences in this world may be learned, except it be the ſkil and occupation to know to loue: the whiche, neither <hi>Salamon</hi> had ſkill to write, <hi>Aſclepius</hi> to paint, <hi>Ouid</hi> to teache, <hi>Helen</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, either yet <hi>Cleopatra</hi> to learne, but that from the ſchoole of the hart it muſt procéede, and pure diſcretion muſt giue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. There is not any thing wherein is more neceſſitie to be diſcréet, than in being a louer: for if a man haue hunger, cold, thirſt, and werineſſe, the only body feeleth it, but the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies that is committed in loue, the hart chiefly bewayleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. To the end that loue be fixed, ſure, perpetuall, and true, there muſt be equalities betwixt the enamored: for if the louer bée yong, and ſhe old, or he old and ſhe yong, or he wiſe and ſhe a foole, or he a foole and ſhe wiſe, or he loue hir, and ſhe abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him, or ſhe loue him, and he abhorreth hir: beléeue me ſir and be out of doubt that of fained louers, they ſhall ende aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and vnfained enemies. Maſter <hi>Moſen Rubin,</hi> I thought good to ſay thus muche vnto you, to the ende that if the louer that you haue now choſen be in poſſeſſion of thrée ſcore and thrée yeres as you are,<note place="margin">A louer in poſſeſſion of threeſcore and three yeares.</note> there is no greate perill that you loue and know hir.

               <p>Speaking more in particuler, I woulde knowe to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a man as you that hath paſſed thréeſcore yeares, that is full ſpent, and laden with the goute, will nowe take a Curti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan yong and faire, which will rather occupy hir ſelfe in rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, than delighting of you? To what ende will you haue a loue of whome you may not be ſerued, but to bind vp grieues, and to driue away flies? Wherefore will you haue a daintie Dame, ſince betwixt you and hir there may riſe no either co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For what cauſe wold you haue a loue ſince you want ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth to folowe hir, goodes to ſerue hir, patience to ſuffer hir, and youth to enioye hir? Why will you haue an amorous dame vnto whome you can not repreſente howe muche you haue ſuffered and endured for hir ſake, but reporte howe the goute is ryſen from the hande to the ſhoulders? To what conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will you loue an infamous woman, whiche will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at your dores that daye whiche you ceaſe to giue hir, or ſhall grow negligent to ſerue hir? To what conſideration doe you delite to haue a wanton loue, vnto whome you ſhall not dare to deny any thing that ſhe craueth, either chide for anye diſpleaſure ſhe giueth? To what ſeruice will you haue a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe loue, who may not be ſerued conformably to youre good, but agréeable to hir fooliſhneſſe? For what ſkill will you haue alemman, which muſt be gratified for the fauour ſhe beareth you, and dare not complayne of the ieloſies ſhe ſhal demaund of you? For what conceyt will you haue a ſeconde <hi>Lais,</hi> which when ſhe ſhall flatter you, it ſhall not only be to content you,<note place="margin">A chief cauſe of courtizans loue.</note> but ſomething to craue of you? For what intente will you haue a loue, before whome you muſt néedes laugh, althoughe the goute make you raue? For what meaning will you haue a diſſolute dame, with whom you ſhall ſpend all your goodes, before you ſhall haue acquaintance with hir conditions? And why deſire you a luſtie Laſſe, with whom you are ioyned for money, and alſo ſuſteyn hir with delights, and yet in the end muſt depart from hir with diſpleaſures? If you <hi>M.

               <p>For vs and our friends, we wil no other God but Chriſt, no other law but the Goſpell, or other king but the Emperoure <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Agnificent and extreme Gentlemen, I doe inuoke and call to witneſſe the God that made me, and I do ſweare by this holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that in all things that here I intende to ſpeake,<note place="margin">An eloquent perſwaſion.</note> my intent is not to defame any man, and leſſe to deceyue: bicauſe the religious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit wherewith I am clad, and the noble bloud from whence I deſcend, giue no place that I ſhould be of malicious entrailes, either double in words. Some of thoſe that are here preſent do very well know my condicion and my conuerſation: and alſo you doe knowe the libertie I vſe to take in ſpeaking franckly, and my bold plainneſſe in preaching, and in the vſe of lying very cold, and in reprehending abſolute. Yeſterday which was New yeres day, I preached vnto the gouernours, and to all the mightie and noble men of the kingdome that was there with them. And for that I did ſharply ſay what was to be cut off, and in the kingdome to be amended: to day they haue commaunded me to come hither with this letter of credite and of ſafe conduit, to the ende I ſhoulde ſay vnto you wherein you erre, as I ſaide vnto them wherein they fayled. Alſo gentlemen I bring with me a large inſtruction firmed by the Cardinall, the Admirall, and the Conſtable, in whiche is contayned what worde the King doth ſende you, and what they on his behalfe do offer: bycauſe his writing being ſéene, and my tale heard, from hencefoorth eyther cruell warre ſhal be determined, or a generall and godly peace concluded. In ſixtéene dayes I haue come hither to conferre with you ſeuen times: and bycauſe the gouernours will not any more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund me to come hither, neyther in theſe affaires farther to trauell, it is neceſſary that this day we determine, and as friends or enemies to declare our ſelues: for otherwiſe being

But firſt I haue to complaine of your captaine <hi>Lares</hi> which tooke me, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vſed me both in word and deede, he knowing very well that a mediator paſſing from Campe to Camp, in all places is accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to go ſafe. There is no reaſon that <hi>Lares</hi> ſhould carrye me taken as a thiefe, and vſe me with rudenes as a traytor, for I come in the Kings name, and at the commaundement of the gouernours, to bring peace and to auoyde warre, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, if I were one of the world, he would hold him ſelfe right happie to be one of my ſeruants: but leauing this apart, I will recite vnto you what I haue paſſed, and the hainous miſchaunces whereat I haue ben preſent.

I knowe not how you can ſay, that you wil refourme the kingdome ſince you obey not the King, you conſent to no gouernours, you admit no royall counſell, you ſuffer no Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celour, you haue no Iudges nor Iuſtices, no giuing of ſentence in matters of lawe, neyther any euill chaſtiſed: in ſuch wiſe, that your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to haue no iuſtice in the kingedome,<note place="margin">A wrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</note> is to refourme iuſtice. I can not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehende how you wil reforme this kingdome, ſince by your conſent there is no ſubiect that ſhall acknowledge a preacher, neither any Nunne that keepes hir cloyſter, no Frier that remayneth in his monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, neyther woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that obeyeth hir huſband, nor vaſſall that obſerueth loyalty, neyther any man that dealeth iuſtly: in ſo much that vnder the colour of liberty, euery man liueth at his owne wil.

So may my life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper as I like of your demaund: which is to weete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the King be not abſent out of this Realme, that he maintaine all men in iuſtice, that he ſuffer no money to be tranſported out of the Realme, that he giue his rewardes and offices vnto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſubiectes of <hi>Spaine,</hi> that they deuiſe not any new tributs: and aboue all, that the Offices be not ſolde, but gyuen to men of moſt vertue.</p>
               <p>Theſe and ſuch other like things you haue licence to craue, and only the King hath authoritie to graunt: but to demaund of princes with the lance, that which they haue to prouide by Iuſtice, is not the part of good vaſſalles, but of diſloyall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, wée well vnderſtand that many people of this lande doe complaine of the newe gouernement of <hi>Flemmings,</hi> and to ſpeake the truth, that fault was not all theirs, but in their ſmall experience, and our much enuie. Further, aduertiſing that the ſtraungers were not more to bée blamed than our owne countrie men, they knew not the ſtate of things, either what offices to craue, neither how they would be ſolde, but that they were aduiſed and alſo inſtructed in the ſkill thereof by the men of our owne nation, in ſuch wiſe, that if in them there did abound deſire of gain, in vs there did excéed the vice of cruell malice. Although Maiſter <hi>Xebes</hi> and the reſt haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The medicine that you haue inuented for the remedie of this miſchiefe, is not to purge but to kill. But ſince you will néedes make war, let vs examine here againſt whom is this war? not againſt the king, bycauſe his tender youth dothe excuſe him: not againſt the Counſell, for they appeare not: not againſt <hi>Xebes,</hi> for hée is in <hi>Flaunders,</hi> not againſt the Gouernors whiche haue but nowe entred their offices: not againſt the Gentlemen, who haue not offended: neither yet againſt tyrantes, for the Kingdome was in peace: than is this war againe your own countrie, and againſt our own (lamentable) common wealth. The wante of prouidence
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:150934:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the king, neither the auarice of <hi>Xebes</hi> is ſufficient cauſe that we ſhould ſée that whiche wée doe ſée, the people to ryſe againſt people, fathers againſt the ſonnes, the vncles againſt their couſins, friends againſt friends, neighbors againſt ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and brothers againſt brothers: but that our ſinne hath ſo deſerued to be chaſtiſed, and yours hath merited that you ſhuld be our ſcourge. Speaking more particular, you are not able to excuſe your faulte, for beginning as you did the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of <hi>Auila,</hi> from which counſell all this warre hath had his féeding, and of a trouth preſently I did diuine and alſo prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che that is to witte, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neuer was <hi>Monipody</hi> of any kingdome, whereof did not ariſe ſome notable ſcandall. The kingdom is nowe altered, the kyng is diſobeyed, the people are nowe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the hurt is alreadie begon, the fire is alreadye in flame, and the common wealth goeth ſinking to the bottom. But in the ende, if it like you, a good end may be made, from whence may procéede all the remedie, for that we haue firmely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue, that God will rather heare the hearts that praye for peace, than the fifes and drums that proclaime warre. If it may lyke you to forget ſome part of your anger, and the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours to loſe ſome part of their right, I hold it all for fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And to ſpeake you the trouth, in popular and ciuil war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, men do rather fight for the opinion they haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than for the reaſon that they hold. My iudgement ſhould be in this caſe, that you ſhould ioyne with the Gouernours to talke and conferre for the gréeues and things amiſſe, and to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for the remedie therof: for by this meanes you ſhould growe to more ripeneſſe for the things you haue to demaund, and in our king and maiſter more facilitie in that whiche he ſhoulde graunt. If it may pleaſe you to leaue your armour, and giue faith vnto my words, I ſweare by the faith of a Chriſtian, &amp; by this letter of credence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I bring with me, do promiſe you that you ſhall be pardoned of the king, and well intreated of his gouernors: that you ſhal neuer for this déed be chaſtized, neither yet in wordes be blamed or defamed.

Alſo they promiſe you that the royall rents of the people ſhall be rated at an indifferent rente, in ſuch wiſe, that the Cities may haue reaſonable gayne, and no greate loſſe to the king. Alſo they promiſe you that if in the regall counſell ſhal be found any examiner, or any other officer, (although it be the preſident) vnwiſe or vnapt for gouernement, and not learned to giue ſentence, or not honeſt of lyfe, that his maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie ſhall abſolue him of his office: notwithſtanding they may be affectionate to ſome, and alſo offended like other men.

Alſo they promiſe, that the King will commaund to reforme the exceſſes, giue lawe for banquets, reforme Monaſteries, viſit Chanceries, repayre ſorts, and fortifie all the frontiers: conſidering that in all theſe things there is neceſſitie of reformation and alſo of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.

Finally I ſay, that he that marieth not his daughter with his equall, ſhall finde it leſſe euill to burie than to marie hir: for if ſhe die, they ſhall bewayle hir but one day, but to be euill maried, is to bewayle hir many yeares.

that the counſell which I giue vnto the father to make no mariage without conſent of his ſonne, the ſame I giue vnto the ſonne, that he marie not againſt the will of his Father: for otherwiſe, it may come to paſſe, to receiue more offence by the malediction of his father, than his mariage portion may yéelde him profit. Yong men when they marry in their youth haue no further conſideration but of their pleaſure, and onely content them ſelues to haue their wiues beautifull: but the father and mother, for that it toucheth both honor and goods, they ſéeke him a wyfe that ſhall be wiſe, ritch, gentle, honeſt and chaſt: and the laſt thing they behold, is, hir beautie. The marriages that be made, hidden and in ſecret, I ſay it groweth of greate lightnes, and procéedeth of no ſmall crueltie: for it giueth to al the neighbours whereof to talke, and to their old parents wherfore to wéepe. It hapneth many times that the mother ouerwatcheth hir ſelfe to ſpinne, and the Father to grow old in gathering a ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t portion. And at the time they ſhall entreat or talke of an honeſt marriage, the fooliſh yong man remayneth ſecretly married, whereof after followeth, that the mother remayneth wéeping, the father aſhamed, the kindred offended, and the friende ſcandalized: and yet thereof procéedeth a greater griefe, which is, that the ſonne hath chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to matche with ſuche a wife, that the father holdeth his goods not onely euill employed, but is much aſhamed to admit hir into his houſe. Alſo another offence riſeth in the like mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, which is, many times the fathers doe determine, with the ſonnes portion to remedie and amend the daughters mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: and as the yong mans moſt principall intent is to enioye the mayde withoute care of goodes: the ſiſter remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth caſt awaye, the ſonne deceyued, and the father de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided. <hi>Plutarche</hi> in hys politikes ſayeth, that the ſonne whyche married withoute conſente of hys Parentes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Greekes,</hi> was publikely whipt: amongſt the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> they did not whippe, but diſinherite. <hi>Laertius</hi> ſayeth, that vnto ſuche (ſo married) it was a cuſtome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Thebanes,</hi> not that they ſhould only be diſinherited

                  <head>The Husbands be not ouer ielouſe.</head>
                  <p>ALſo it is a counſell to be imbraced, that married men doe auoyde to be with their neighbours malicious, and of their wiues ielouſe: bycauſe onely two kindes of people be ielous, which is to vnderſtand, ſuch as be of euill condition, and ſuche as in their youth haue ſpent their time in wantonnes. Such kind of men do imagine, that their wiues giue the like enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment vnto others, as they receyued of their neighbours wiues: the whiche is no ſmall vanitie to thinke, and no leſſe fooliſhneſſe to ſpeake: for if there be ſome that be diſſolute, ther be alſo other ſome wiſe, honeſt, and aduiſed. To ſay that all women be good, is of too much affection: and to ſay that all bée euill, is to great want of reaſon. It is ſufficient to ſay, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men there is many things to be reprehended, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt women there wanteth not wherefore to be prayſed: I hold it not for euill, that vnto hir whiche is vaine and light, they vſe hir not only with reaſon, but alſo taking away occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:<note place="margin">Good counſel.</note> but withall it is to be vnderſtoode with this condition, that they vſe hir not with ſuch ſtraytneſſe, either giue hir ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill a life: whereby vnder colour to kéepe herin, they bring hir to diſpayre. We cannot denie but there bée women of ſo euill condition, and ſo vnhoneſt of inclination, that will not be corrected with force, eyther amended by chaſtiſement. But it ſéemeth that ſuche were borne into this world, only to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their huſbands and to ſhame their kinred. And on the other ſide there be women many and very manye, whiche of theyr owne proper nature be of ſo tractable condition and chaſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination: that it ſéemeth not that they were borne into the worlde, but for a mirror to the common wealth, and a glory vnto their whole kinred. I retourne once more to ſaye, that ſometimes it is not euill to ſhut the dore, to remoue hir from the window, to denie hir going abroade, and to deliuer hir fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome ſuſpitious company:<note place="margin">Aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments worth the folowing.</note> but this the huſband muſt bring to paſſe with great ſkill, that he always ſhew a greater faith in the liberty ſhe hathe, than in the watch or direction he giueth.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:150934:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I do prayſe and approue, that men with their wiues be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telous, but I hold it not for ſure that they be ouer ielous: for women be of ſuch qualitie, that they procure nothing ſo much as that which is moſt forbidden them. If the huſbande haue the wife in ſuſpition, he ought to profite himſelfe by ſkill, not vttering it in words: for if a woman doe once find hir ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, ſhe will not fayle to find out the meanes and maner, to make the ſuſpition true, and not ſo muche for the appetite ſhe hath to be vicious, as ſhe hath to féele hir hart reuenged of hir huſband. The force of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> the ſcience of <hi>Homer,</hi> the prudence of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> the cautels of <hi>Pirrhus,</hi> the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of <hi>Iob,</hi> the ſagacity of <hi>Haniball,</hi> and the vigilancy of <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> bée not ſufficient to gouerne a woman, either to bring hir will in ſubiection: for finally and in the end, in all this world there is not ſo great force, that can make one good by force. The negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, wants, and weakeneſſe that the huſbande ſhall ſée in his wife, it were no wiſedome to proclayme them, neyther yet preſently to chaſtiſe them, but ſome he muſt gently cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, ſome aduiſedly admoniſh, ſome ſeuerely puniſh, ſome cut off, and the moſt and greateſt part he muſte diſſemble.<note place="margin">To be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> For wiſe and patient though a woman may be, only two thinges ſhe cannot endure to heare, neyther is hir patience ſufficiente to ſuff<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

But let it be for concluſion, that when the huſbande is ſure of all things, whiche is to witte: that his wife maketh no market of his perſon, that his fame wander not the ſtreates, and that his goodes goe not to wracke, in my iudgement it is méete, that he neuer handle hir as one that is ielouſe, or ſpeak vnto hir as one that is malicious: bycauſe the woman is much bound to be vertuous, when the huſbande in hir commendeth great confidence.</p>

                  <p>I retourne to ſaye, that it is of ſmall ſkill, and too much ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, ſince they will ſhew vnto none what they haue in their cheſts, and at times will vtter all that is in their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks.

The loue and hatred that is fixed in the harte, it is neceſſarye that it be lockt and alſo ſealed. For what do I reſerue for him that I like very well, if I ſay vnto all men what is hidden in my hart? vnto him that loueth vs with his hart, and we wiſh him good with all oure hart, to him alone and to none others we haue to manifeſt our hart.<note place="margin">A counſell to be imbraced.</note> The paſſions that they giue vs, and the miſfortunes that they offer vs, it is no wiſedome to diſcouer, but vnto hym that will help vs to remedie it, and alſo will helpe to bewayle the ſame: bycauſe the teares of a friende dothe not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burden the hart of trauell.

                  <p>That the wife ſhall demaund of hir huſband things ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and very coſtly, neyther ought ſhe to craue it, or the huſband to giue it: but if ſhe require thinges neceſſary, they ought not to be denied, for the huſbande hath to conceiue for moſt certaine, that vppon the gages of honor, many times the wife dothe prouide for hir ſelfe and hir houſholde. The

huſband that giueth not vnto his wife, a coate nor mantell, ſmocke nor ſhoe, kerchife nor ſléeue, neyther to clothe hir children, nor yet to pay ſeruants: and on the other parte hée ſéeth all theſe things prouided for frée, and made better: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynely ſuch a one may well thinke that ſhe rather getteth them trotting,<note place="margin">Rather trot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting than ſpinning.</note> than ſpinning.

Many times the huſbande is in fault, and ouer eaſely gyueth credite vnto his friends, neighbours, and alſo to his ſeruants, the whiche if they aduertiſe him of any euill of his wife: it is not ſo much for the zeale of his honour, as it is for the malice they beare vnto hir.

I ſhould think it good, that the wife ſhould loue the friendes of hir huſband, and that the huſband ſhould loue the kindred of his wife: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if he will obtaine peace in his houſe, he ought to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his wife, &amp; of hir kinred honoured.

Alſo you write vnto me to aduertiſe you how it ſtandeth with <hi>Moſen Burela,</hi> ſince the time he receyued that ſo great diſtreſſe in <hi>Xatina:</hi> Sir vnto this I anſwer, that vnto me he giueth great ſorow to beholde him, and no leſſe compaſſion to heare him: bycauſe I ſée hym wander laden with thoughts, and no leſſe forſaken of friends.

In the ſtate that men do get theyr
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:150934:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
liuing, in the ſame they ought to conſerue themſelues: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, of rich Merchantes, they become poore Seruantes. The Sonnes of <hi>Vesko Bello</hi> haue quartered their goodes, as if they ſhould haue quartered the ſame by iuſtice: for the one part they haue giuen to women, another to banquets, another to dice, and the other to wanton deuiſes, in ſuch wiſe, that that which their fathers gate in Fayres, they ſpend and conſume in follies. Sir, alſo you write me to aduertiſe you of my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of a certayne new marriage that they offer you in <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena</hi> with a woman that is rich, yong, fayre, gentle, and aboue all of good report and fame.</p>
               <p>As concerning the firſt, Sir I can ſay vnto you, that ſuch a marriage as this, is of many deſired, and of few obtayned, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not in this world, a woman ſo perfect and acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hath all in hir, that of hir huſband may be wiſhed, &amp; nothing found in hir to be remoued &amp; reiected. There be ſome Gentlewomen, the whiche if they on the one part be riche, of gentle bloud, yong, and faire, they hold on the other part, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ouerthwartneſſe in condition, and certain frowardneſſe in conuerſation, that their huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds hold it for leſſe euill to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble that they ſée, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to chide or grow angry for that which they féele. Leauing this apart, Sir you haue to conſider, that if ſhe be yong, you are old: and if ſhe be fayre, you are hoare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and that it is not ſufficient that ſhe doe content you, but that ſhe alſo of you haue very good liking: for otherwiſe, ſhée walking with a crooked face, you ſhall paſſe with hir a very tedious life. Amongſt the married, it is leſſe euill that miſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king do happen vnto the man, than vnto the woman: bycauſe the huſband if he be wiſe, can diſſemble his griefe: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wife, neyther can ſhe diſſemble it, neyther yet kéepe ſilence. If the wife which they giue you, be rich, I hold it for profitable: if ſhe be fayre, I hold it for delectable: if ſhe be of gentle bloud, I hold it for honorable: but if ſhe be yong, I holde it for perillous, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſhall haue wherefore to ſigh, to ſée you ſo old: and you ſhal not wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, wherfore to watch, to ſée hir ſo yong. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſay in whether of you both I may lay the blame, or rather which
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:150934:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I may not blame: you, for chooſing, or ſhe in accepting: bycauſe a yong wench of twenty yeares, with an old man of thréeſcore yeares, is a life of two yeares. Conſider well what you doe, and haue regard what you take in hande, and be aduiſed with whome you marry: for a man of ſo greate an age, to marry with ſo tender yeares, from henceforward I propheſy, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe ſhall hate you, or elſe defame you, eyther elſe finiſh or make an end of you. Sir, finally I ſay, that if you will accept my counſell, and eſcape anger and diſpleaſure, you ſhall kéepe your houſe, and procure and follow your profit: and if you wil néedes marry, you ſhall marrie with the fatlings of <hi>Algezi,</hi> with the lambs of <hi>Polop,</hi> with the white wine of <hi>Monuiedro,</hi> and with the Claret of <hi>Venicarlo,</hi> the whiche ſhall yéelde you ſubſtance, and enlarge your life.

fauour this good chaunce, one day going to chaſe, in purſute of a Hart was caſt downe Horſe and man into a ditche, out of which miſhappe ſprang his better lucke, for by meanes of the ſame he voyded from him the arrow head before left and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his fleſh, and became afterwards more healthfull than euer he was before. So as we may inferre by that which hath bin ſayd, that men full little know what is profitable or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to them: ſure it appeareth that <hi>Cornelius Rufus</hi> ſléeping in his bed became blind, <hi>Phalaris</hi> the <hi>Thebane</hi> by hurt of a ſpeare recouered remedie of his former ſickneſſe: and <hi>Mamilius</hi> by miſhappe of a fall to receyue happie auoydance of the arrowe head whiche before lay cloſed in his fleſh. Wherefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and ſay that all the chaunces of this preſent life haue in themſelues alone no more good or euill than according to their ſequele and effect they bring, ſo that if we find they haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to our liking, we count them happie and good: and if contrary to our deſires and expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they bring miſfortune, vnfortunate and euill, which giueth me iuſt cauſe to ſay that we ſhould not for any flatterie of fortune, or of any good hap be proude, nor yet for any hir frownings and contrary haps deſpaire. I haue made all this recitall before, to gratify your new recouered health and the departure of your ſickneſſe, that is to ſay, that hauing bin thrée yeares gréeuouſly ſicke of a feuer quartan, there hath hapned to your mind ſome ſo greate a griefe that the force thereof ſuffred to driue and beate the quartaine from your houſe, which maketh me once twice and thrice to affirme that we know not what to require to be hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to vs, bycauſe diuers times with greate care we ſéeke that we ſhould flée and eſchue, and we flée from that we ſhuld with all diligence ſéeke and follow. Amongſt the high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the diuine <hi>Plato</hi> this was one, that we ſhuld not pray to the Gods to giue vs this or that, but with importunat pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to require, that it would pleaſe them to giue vs that which ſtoode with deuine pleaſures beſt to beſtow, and to our néede moſt commodious. The <hi>Hebrewes</hi> being long time ruled by Iudges, demaunded of God a King to gouerne them, whome
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:150934:171" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they might obey, which God performed, rather to ſatiſfye their earneſt petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than of any procéeding from his merciful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: he gaue them ſuche a perſon to their King, as it had bin better for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neuer to haue demanded or had any at all. Now be it as it be may, or happen what ſhall happen, I returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to reioyce with you for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> departure of your troubleſome feuer, and the bitter anger whiche hathe chaced it from you: though I remember not that euer I red and much leſſe heard the <hi>Lady Sorrowe</hi> at any time cauſed any good thing to happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs. I certify you <hi>Sir Chanon,</hi> if al the diſeaſes might be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red like yours with heauineſſe and ſadneſſe, penſiueneſſe and cares would then be more déere in our hearts, than Rubarb is now in the Apoticaries ſhops: and if we ſhoulde buy ſighes, ſobbes, and teares in the market for money, I aſſure you very many both men and women woulde thereby grow excéeding riche and happie, whiche nowe are poore and vnfortunate, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſorow with euery body is ſo common, that there is ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corner nor place ſo ſecret wherein ſhe is not found.

I haue ſéene many in this world whereof ſome wanted their eyes, ſome their eares, and ſome their hands: otherſome lacke houſes, others goodes, and ſome other apparrell: But I neuer knew nor heard of perſon were he neuer ſo poore that had not ſorrow and griefe: ſo is there no houſe in the world ſo rich, that ſometimes wanteth not money, and of enuies and ſorrowes is neuer deſtitute.

All which place as well in length as breadth, the Iſraelites did name Tabernacle, whiche is as muche to ſaye, as a place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate onely to God. In the middes of this tabernacle, was placed a ſolemne and a magnificent altar, where vpon the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was done: there was alſo the greate baſon of water, where the Prieſtes did waſhe: and for that vnto that place, and no further, the Iſraelites might not enter, it was named <hi>Sanctuarium,</hi> which is to ſay, a place ſanctifyed.</p>
               <p>Within the Sanctuarie there was another ſeparation, of the ſpace of thirtie cubites in length, and ten of breadth, made of <hi>Sittim</hi> woodde, and alofte hauing the faſhion or forme of heauen, it was couered with a triple couerture, whereof the one was made of red ſhepes woolle, the other of goates heare, and the other of <hi>Taxus</hi> ſkinnes, whiche was for defence of the rayne and Sunne. Vnder this ſayde heauen, and in the mids of this ſayde place, there was the holy table, vpon which was ſette the holie breade, called the loues of propoſition, and the holie incenſe, and other ſwéete odors.

This place was called the Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie: bycauſe in that place, the Lorde God did manifeſt himſelfe more propice and neare, as well to pardon, as to anſwere them.

                  <p>Yf wée wyll haue the candle cleare, and of himſelfe gyue lyght, it is very neceſſary that he be oft ſnuffed. By this that I haue ſayde, I woulde ſay, that the man that hath ſhame in

                  <p>Wherefore God in commaunding that at the foote of the lampes that did light in the Temple, there ſhoulde be ſnuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to ſnuffe them, it is no other thing, as mée thinketh, but that euery man ought to ſéeke with whome to bée indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrined, in that whiche hee ought to followe, and remoued from his errour wherein hée offended. For in his owne cauſe, it is not permittible for any man to bée Iudge of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But how contrary is the faſhion at theſe dayes in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable worlde. The glorious Apoſtle <hi>S.

               <p>And to ſay the troth, and to ſpeake clerely of this matter, the exceſſe and the greate extremitie whiche the bliſſed Ieſus committed, was not, as it is ſayd, in drinking, eating, ſleping,<note place="margin">An extreme exceſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of Chriſt.</note> or in any other thing, but only in loue: for all his other works and actions were finiſhed, except the loue which he did beare, that was infinite and had no ende.

               <p>The loue of man is ſuch, that if they determine to loue any thing, it is moſte likely they loue the ſame, for the perfection therof.

In ſuch wiſe, that man aduaunceth not to loue any thing, in which he hath not ſome opinion, that it ſhall like or pleaſe him.

               <p>The cauſe was thys: at the very inſtant that <hi>Scipio</hi> hadde diſpatched theſe thrée Ladies aforeſayd, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Souldiers brought vnto him a certayne yong Damſell, the faireſt that euer they had ſéene: but <hi>Scipio</hi> vnderſtanding that ſhe was betrothed to <hi>Lucius</hi> Prince of the <hi>Celtibires,</hi> and that ſhe was diſcended of parents very noble, would in no wiſe touch hir, but rather had a duble care to defend hir honor.

neither of ſo great merit for their worthy vertues.</p>
               <p>Wherevnto <hi>Lucius</hi> coulde ſay no other thing, but kiſſing the right hande of <hi>Scipio,</hi> beſought the immortall Gods, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munerate the great goodneſſe and paſſing courteſie he had v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto him, confeſſing his great want of abilitie, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of ſo great a bountie.</p>
               <p>And after returning vnto the parents of the ſayd Damſell, rendering their daughter without any raunſome: They moſt inſtantly beſought him, that it might pleaſe him to accept the gold whiche they had brought for hir raunſome, in token and as a pledge of their amitie and dutifull affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scipio</hi> being preſſed of them, did accept the ſame: and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it at his feete, in the preſence of them all, called <hi>Lucius</hi> and ſayd:<note place="margin">A rendred raunſome gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the mariage of an enemie.</note> behold <hi>Lucius,</hi> I giue thée this gold which thy father and mother in law haue preſented me, as a gift vnto the marriage of thy wife, beſides that which before was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thée.

               <p>Then <hi>Lucius</hi> and his father and mother in lawe, receiuing the Damſell and the golde, did take their leaue of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and retired into their countrie, publiſhing in all places wher they paſt, moſt greateſt praiſe of <hi>Scipio</hi> and the Romaine people.</p>

               <p>And ſince we debate not vppon any matter of your goodes, much leſſe is my comming for the ſame or any ſuche purpoſe, but only for the verifying of the ſacred Scripture.

               <p>If ye will ſay, that thoſe whiche preſently be called Moores or Turkes, be the ſame people, whereof the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>Scrutati ſunt iniquitates,</hi> herevnto I anſwer,<note place="margin">The Turks, Moores, and Saraſins, were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by the propheſy of King Dauid, to be falſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters.

no leſſe ſkilfull, which obtayned ſuche credite and reputation among you, that he made you fully beléeue, that God had gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen twoo lawes vnto <hi>Moyſes</hi> in the mount of <hi>Sinay:</hi>

               <p>The firſt perſecution was in the raigne of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> the which (poſſeſſed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Deuil, in whoſe bonds his offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces did impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him) perceiuing the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s daily to increaſe at <hi>Rome</hi> (by grace of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> euangelical worde which <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul</hi> preached there, where they were martered for ſuch conuerſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people) determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his power to perſecute &amp; deſtroye the Church: whereby he murdred many Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as wel in Rome as els where, which was the firſt perſecution of the Church. For albeit the Church ſince the ſuffering of Chriſt hath béen continually perſecuted in hir perticuler
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:150934:207"/>
members, yet notwithſtanding vntyll the comming of <hi>Nero,</hi> there went forth no commaundement to perſecute the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Touching the conſtancy of the Martyrs, and the diuerſitie of the tormentes which they endured (beſide the Catholique Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers which write therof) <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> a Painim writer, and enemie to the Chriſtians (yet verye credible in his writing) doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the ſame: who making recitall of the perſecutions made by the ordinaunce of the Emperour <hi>Nero,</hi> (of whome <hi>Sueton</hi> maketh alſo mencion) doth ſay of the ſlaughter of Chriſtians, both men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: that amongeſt a thouſande diuerſities of puniſhmentes and deathes, they caſt the Chriſtians to be torne in péeces with dogges: And to make the dogges more fierce vpon them, the men were bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſkinnes of Beares, and other ſauadge Beaſtes. Which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was performed (as witneſſeth <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi>) after the huge fire of <hi>Rome:</hi> In the eleuenth yéere of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre of <hi>Nero:</hi> by whoſe decrée the glorious Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were martyrred. It maye well bée, as I alſo beléeue, that this mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome continued lytle more then thrée yéeres: For though it were done at that time (according to the Prior of <hi>Calatrana</hi> his opinion) yet God would preſerue his Apoſtles, and deferre their martyrdoms vntyll the foreſayde time.</p>
               <p>The ſecond perſecution was in the time of the Emperour <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian.</hi> This wicked and accurſed monſter, vnderſtanding that there ſhould one ſpring out of the lyne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which ſhould expell him out of the Empyre, he cauſed ſearch to be made with much diligence, for all thoſe whiche deſcended from the race of <hi>Dauid</hi> amongſt the Iewes, and cauſed them to be put to death: onelye raunſoming as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayth twoo perſons of the ſame familie, who further for the accompliſhment of his deuilliſhe deuices, at the motion of the fiende he determined to perſecute the Catholique Churche: Whereby at his commandement a great ſlaughter was made of Chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Rome and without. In which perſecution multitudes of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were at the firſt committed to baniſhment, who after were tormented, and then murdered by moſt horrible paines and cruell deaths, as affirmed <hi>Euſebius: Oroſius</hi> and many other Chriſtian Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers. This was the ſecond general perſecution of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church, in which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt was confined, or
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:150934:207"/>
exiled into the Yle of <hi>Pathinos</hi> where he ſawe the viſions of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalips.</hi> It were hard to know how long this perſecution endured, but as we may gather by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> it continued twoo yéeres &amp; a lytle more. For he ſayth that <hi>Domician</hi> dyd moderate and ceaſe his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and yet notwithſtanding aſwel by reaſon of the ſayd perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as for his other vices, the ſame <hi>Domician</hi> hath béene holden to be one of the moſt wicked and cruell Princes that euer liued.</p>
               <p>The third perſecution of the Church was vnder the gouernment of the Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> who allured by the Deuill &amp; his other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters determined by torments to puniſhe the Chriſtians: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by publique edict, ordayned that the Chriſtians ſhould worſhip the Idol of the Gentiles vpon paine of death: Wherevnto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians not wylling to obey, he made a great ſlaughter of them. This was the third perſecution of the Church Catholique, whereof <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> and diuers other Hiſtoriographers Chriſtians do make plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mencion, &amp; that was in the tenth yéere of the Empyre of <hi>Traian,</hi> which afterward alſo commaunded this perſecution to be ſtayed as doth apeare by ſome writers, &amp; eſpecially in the letters of <hi>Plyny</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to <hi>Traian,</hi> &amp; in the anſweres thereto ſent by the ſame Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror which are at this preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t extant, where he preſcribed that the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould be permitted to lyue in their Lawes and vnder theyr liberties: If they dyd not commit any other wickedneſſe therewith.</p>
               <p>The fourth perſecution was in the time, and vnder the dominion of the Emperor <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> ſurnamed the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> whoſe lyfe we haue diſcribed in another booke apart by it ſelfe, this Prince during the tyme that he made warres againſt the <hi>Parthians,</hi> as <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> and <hi>Oroſius</hi> do declare, endeuored his power to perſecute the Chriſtians, which remayned in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> where <hi>Lucus Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> was gouernour. This was the fourth perſecution of the Church myllitant, ſo that it followeth that God ſuffered this general peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to raigne amongſt them, and a thouſande other callamities to happen vnto them enduring the gouernment of this Prince as wee haue largely declared in his Cronicle.</p>
               <p>The fift perſecution of the Church was during the raigne of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus Seuerus</hi> the Emperour the which by the inſtigation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deuil, made a great butcherie of the faithful Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. This fift perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the cauſe (as fayth <hi>Oſorius</hi>) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God dyd not permit this Prince
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:150934:208"/>
to lyue in peace, for one of his Captaines rebelled againſt him, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Albinius,</hi> the which made all <hi>Brittany</hi> to reuolt from him, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him ſelfe Emperour during the time of his life.</p>
               <p>The ſixt perſecution of the Church was in the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Maximius,</hi> the curſed Prince being offended that <hi>Alexander Seuerus</hi> had ſupported the Chriſtians, by expreſſe ordinaunce &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion made a great and blooddye ſpoyle of the Chriſtians, &amp; princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſters of thoſe which executed any aucthoritie amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people: This was the ſixt perſecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi> &amp; <hi>Oroſius</hi> in the which this Prince vſed many vnacuſtomed torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, and cauſed diuers cruell puniſhmentes to be inuented, whereby the poore Chriſtians might be miſerablye handled, who had ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and preſumptuous pride of himſelfe &amp; his power, that he eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that no perſon might once hurt him, and that it were impoſſible to wounde or to kyll him. In which opinion he moſt deuilliſhlie pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued all his cruelties and tormentes.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth perſecution was in the rule of the Emperor <hi>Decius:</hi> This Prince although otherwiſe he were of good naturall diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was notwithſtanding in religion an Infidell, and in that reſpect ſought the vexation of the millitant Church, ſo that no ſuch crueltye were before tyme vſed, as nowe in his tyme towardes the afflicted Chriſtians. The which is affirmed that he onely dyd in deſpite of his prodeceſſour <hi>Phillip:</hi> who had before béene Chriſtened. And ſo this ſeuenth perſecution was in the time of this <hi>Decius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eyght perſecution was enduring the raigne of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Valerian:</hi> who (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth report) was ſo fauourable to the Chriſtians in the beginning of his raigne, that he would not permitte that any perſonne dyd them any wrong or violence: for he bare ſuch affection and honour vnto them that his pallace was a true colledge and ſanctuarie for the Chriſtians: but towardes the ende of his raigne, he ſuffred him ſelfe to be ſeduced by a Magicien of Egipt, who was a deadlye enemie to the Chriſtian religion, becauſe the ſame dyd impugne the deceiptes and Sorceries of the Magicians. In ſuch ſort that he dyd not all onely chaunge his opinion towardes the Chriſtians, but alſo perſecuted them with great ſlaughter. This was the eyght perſecution of which <hi>Oroſius</hi> doth liberally diſcourſe, but ſuch was the iuſtice of God for his cruell exceſſe, that ſuch euyll
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:150934:208"/>
fortune followed <hi>Valerian</hi> after this déede, that he was taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and fell into the handes of <hi>Sapor</hi> King of <hi>Percia</hi> which dyd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate and handle him moſt cruelly.</p>
               <p>The ninth perſecution of the Church was in the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Aurelian,</hi> who hauing moſt louinglie vſed the Chriſtians in the firſt ſixe yeares of his raigne (as appeareth by the writing of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> and <hi>Oroſius</hi>) in the ende by the prouocation of the Deuill and other moſt wicked perſons, he perſecuted the Chriſtians generally throughout all the confines of his Empire. And this was the ninth perſecution of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull. Now it happened that as this Prince was readie to ſigne a commiſſion which he was to diſpatche to the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the Princes of the Empire againſt the Chriſtians, an arrow fell from Heauen ſo neare vnto him that thoſe which were preſent, thought that it had kylled the Emperour. But beſides this ſigne and aduertiſement God ſuffered the effect to followe, that is to ſaye, the death of the aforeſayd Prince, for he was miſerablye ſlaine by his owne men and ſeruauntes, and by the ſame receyued the guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done and payment of his deſartes and offences.</p>
               <p>The tenth perſecution was in the time of the Emperour <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſian.</hi> This Prince being in quiet reſt from all his affaires, ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Belzebub and his miniſters: he being a Painim and noriſhed in the ſuperſticions of the Idolatrye of the Gentiles, beganne to perſecute and purſue the Catholike church, which was the tenth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall perſecution of the Chriſtians, (to accoumpt from the ſame of <hi>Nero</hi>) and this was the moſt cruell &amp; longeſt of continuaunce of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the which endured by the ſpace of ten continuall yeares. Now the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s had long time liued in reſt &amp; quiet ſince the perſecution which was in the gouernment of the Emperor <hi>Aurelian,</hi> in ſuch ſort y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Chriſtian religion was now become of great force in all chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. And all the Cities and Towns, as well within the dominions of the Emperour, as without the limmits of the ſame: and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were excéedinglie multiplied in nomber, and had great aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in their Churches. But as ſayth <hi>Euſebius,</hi> this reſt and libertie which they enioyed, was cauſe that the pollicie and maner of lyuing of the Chriſtians began to bee corrupted, ſo that many iniquities &amp; wickedneſſe dyd grow preſently, &amp; the old former ſanctimony began to deminiſhe, and ſuch diſorders &amp; diſcentions began to be moued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:150934:209"/>
the Biſhops and the Prelats, that as the ſayd <hi>Euſebius</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth: God permitted this perſecution to ſerue in place of reuenge, and chaſtiſement of his Church. This perſecution was ſo great, ſo cruell, and ſo blooddy: that it is impoſſible for any pen to write the vnnatural ſlaughters which the Paynims vſed: neither is there any tongue that is able to pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce them. The which <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth well declare, being a preſent witneſſe, beholding the ſame with his eies, as done in his owne ſight: for he ſayth that he cannot diſcribe nor ſpeake that which he ſaw executed before his face. To whom <hi>Oroſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> doth condiſcend, wryting in the ſame ſort, that there was not any heart ſo harde that would not be moued to compaſſion, reading the cruelties of this perſecution. Which amaſeth me to conſider of the conſtancie of the Martyrs which endured ſuch tormentes ſo valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and of the cruelty of thoſe which murdered and tormented them ſo maliciouſlye. And to the entent that you and all other ſhoulde know what puniſhments this butcherlie Prince miniſtred vnto the Chriſtians, I haue wyllinglie recited ſome notable partes of the ſame, which be theſe. Fyrſt this Prince dyd ruinate and ſacke al the Churches of the Chriſtians, and forbid them to make any aſſembles for the ſeruice of God in any part: be commaunded all the bookes of the holy Scriptures to be burned which they might finde. Alſo he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned that all Chriſtians of what eſtate or condition ſo euer they were, ſhould not be admitted to eſtate or any office of Magiſtrat, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thoſe preſentlie which were placed in any offices ſhould be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and counted infamed, and ſome were put to death for example.</p>
               <p>Further they appointed that the goodes of the Byſhops and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates Chriſtians, ſhoulde be declared to be conſticate and for fayted. The Chriſtian bond man could not be manumitted or enfranchiſed. And theſe Lawes were publiſhed through the confines of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pyre. Beſides the which conſtitucions, the poore miſerable Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, were otherwiſe moſt wickedly intreated, and receiued diuers outragious iniuries: diuers being enforced to dye cruellye and with much ſhame. And in ſome prouinces where they were blinded with affections &amp; perticular occaſions which the Deuil guided by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the diuine God, they vſed many cruelties and incredible horribleneſſe towardes the Chriſtians, as in <hi>Frigia, Suria, Egipt,</hi> and diuers other countreys, for ſome were broyled and ſcorched in
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:150934:209"/>
lyfe, and others had theyr fleſhe carded as though it had béene well, or flaxe, which poore Chriſtian creatures after ſuche burning and torments, were throwen into ſtraite priſon, in great féebleneſſe, and yet honeſt and conſtant in the faith, they were hanged naked by the féete, to prolong theyr deathes the more with ſhame and diſhoneſty. And by that meanes endured double torment, of ſome they cut of the nooſe, the eares, the fingers, the handes, and the féete, and onely left them theyr eyes to behold their miſerie, and to encreaſe their griefe and paine, they tare ſome alyue quite in the middeſt, tying one legge to a great arme of a Trée bended with force, and the other legge to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother trée crooked in the ſame manner: Afterward letting the ſame Trées to returne into his naturall place, for to cleaue the body in ſunder. So others they vſed this cruelty, that they pricked ſharpe néedles and great thornes betwéene the nayles of the fleſhe and the handes, which be the moſt ſenſible and tendereſt partes of al the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Some other men were beaten with rounde balles, and pellets of Leade and Tynne. In concluſion they were enforced to endure and ſuſtaine the moſt cruell tormentes which might bée deuiſed, by the Deuilles pollicie. And this ſlaughter of the Chriſtians was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeding great, during this perſecution.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth and laſt perſecution generally of the Church was enduring the gouernment of the Emperor <hi>Iulianus,</hi> which was an Idolater, &amp; Sacrificer to the Deuill: Which Emperour ſtudied by al meanes he might to perſecute the chriſtian church. Who likewiſe to attaine the effect of his purpoſed deuiſe, dyd vſe a ſinguler &amp; vnaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed ſubtiltie, by the which vnder cloked &amp; collor of ſhadowed cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie &amp; benignitie, he did enféeble the Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion as much as he could, giuing them alwaies yet to vnderſtand, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was ſoft &amp; gentle by nature, &amp; not cruel &amp; rigorous. This new inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cion in perſecuting the Church was ſubtilly found out by him as I think, bicauſe he had ſéen &amp; by experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce did vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the blood of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> martirs did cauſe the chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion to ſpring more frutefully. And therfore he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to worke &amp; procéede contrary to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Emperors his prode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had performed, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is to ſay, to draw y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vnto his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhipping by aduancement of eſtats, offices, &amp; dignities, as witneſſeth <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> S. <hi>Hierom</hi> &amp; <hi>Caſiodorus,</hi> ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hereby he cauſed diuers ambicious &amp; couetous perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to denie chriſtianity, &amp; to folow Idolatry, by means of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eſtates &amp; offices which they had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them.
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:150934:210"/>
This was the greateſt wound that euer the Church receiued, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Chriſtians by the meanes of this inuencion, remooued theyr faith, but in the ende when the Emperor <hi>Iulian</hi> perceyued that theſe deuiſes ſerued to ſmall ende to his entent, although he made them not to léeſe their lyues, neyther dyd violentlye conſtraine their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. Yet he publiſhed diuers hurtfull edictes againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and verye vitious for Chriſtianitie. Firſt he commaunded that no Chriſtian might obtaine any degrée in Schoole, kéepe Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or reade in any arte or ſcience, whatſoeuer, neyther that hée might be admitted to ſtuddie, vnleſſe he dyd worſhip the Idols. The which he dyd to the ende y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Chriſtians baniſhed from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of learning ſhould be brought to Idolatrie, or that they ſhould els remaine fooles and ignorant Ideots, and ſo by continuance that none ſhould be able to preache the Euangelie. Alſo he ordained that no Chriſtian ſhoulde be admitted to any eſtate, office, or dignitie of Magiſtrate, eyther in warre or peace. In concluſion this monſter ſearched out all the wayes to rayſe battaile againſt Ieſus Chriſt, without ſhaedding humaine blood, which was the right deuiſe of the Deuill, to depriue the bleſſed Martyrs from the glorye and crowne which they ſhould haue obtained for theyr martyrdome. Behold the firſt, &amp; moſt notable perſecutions, which the church millitant ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: ſince which time there hath béen many other, in euery ſeuerall place, but they were of ſmall importaunce in reſpect of theſe before ſayde. Touching the reſt, becauſe I am wéery of writing this long letter, &amp; that my pen can do me no more ſeruice therin. I ſay nothing elſe but this, that I wyl more redéelie employ my ſelfe towards the Countie of <hi>Oſarno,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> affaires of <hi>Vaſco lopes,</hi> which you haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended vnto my fauor: as ſoone as the ſayd Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie may attend the ſame, for he kéepeth his bed at this inſtant, &amp; laboreth gréeuouſly of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gowte. The Lord haue you in his kéeping, &amp; giue mée grace to ſerue him.</p>
