         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

all right and reason offred vnto our

we hope to goe thorow with) tendeth
to none other end, but first and chiefly to
the aduau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cing of the honor of God and his
word, to the profit of his Maiesty, countrey,
and subiects, and likewise of the Emperial
Maiesty our soueraigne Lord and his wel
beloued sonne: which in time to come (as
true successors of the said cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey) pretend
right thereto: likewise the rooting out of
the great (not euer tofore heard of, &amp; more
<pb facs="tcp:1992:3"/>
than barbarous) fury and rage of the Duke
of <hi>Alba</hi> and his adhere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which they haue
of long time vsed and put in effect.</p>
            <p>Neuertheles we haue thought good,
publikely to declare by these presents, the
vnauoydable occasions, by which we with
our Allies and frendes, haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and enforced to take in hand this our
defence: principally to put away all suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of rebellion, which we haue fled, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
hated all the dayes of our life.</p>
            <p>First we are not ignorant, that it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest
to all the world, how and after what
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, (through the practises and fetches
of the Cardinall of <hi>Granuelle,</hi> with other
couetous and bloud thirstye (which vnder
the colour and cloake of the religion, prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
catholick) sought none other thing but
the diminishing of the honor of God, the
aucthority of the king, and the weale of the
Commons, and louing nothing more than
their proper and particular profit, the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing
and destruction of other good men,
where through the intollerable Inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hath bene put forth, with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull
Placcards of the execution ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
notwithstanding that we and other our
<pb facs="tcp:1992:4"/>
brethren went about by all meanes to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
them from it, seing and considering
the great euils &amp; inconueniences that alre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sprang therof, &amp; the great likelyhoode of
more to ensue, they nothing regarding our
humble sutes therein: such I say (not long
since) haue brought and thrust in the sayd
Inquisition into this low countrey. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
is come to passe, that vnder coloure of
the said Inquisition, the Inquisitors and
dissembling hipocrites, haue with all outra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges
procéeded against such poore innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
and faithfull people, as desire to liue accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the pure doctrine of the Gospell.
First by confiscation of their goodes both
moueable and immoueable, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
torment and tortures, by fire, water,
gibbet, by prisons &amp; otherwise, dispatching
them in corners, by meanes as wel vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
as lawfull.</p>
            <p>All which tyrannies and persecutions
vntill this present, are nothing assuaged or
diinished, but rather since the vnhappy
entry of the sayd Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> into the
sayd low Countreys, from day to day are
encreased and augmented: so that daylye
they inuent now torments and executions
<pb facs="tcp:1992:4"/>
against y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore people, yea such as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Christians, but the very Turkes and
Sarazens would haue pity and compassy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of. I will not for shame reherse the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable
iniuryes and villanies that are
daily committed by the soldiors of the sayd
Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> so that there is no good ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but had rather choose to die, than to sée such
cruelty and tyranny executed, both vpon
him and his, before his face.</p>
            <p>And séeing that such crueltyes and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies
vsed by the sayde Duke of <hi>Alba</hi>
and his adherentes, couetous and bloud-thirsty
persons, doe wholy repugne the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes,
letters sealed, and promises made
betwene his said royall Maiesty, and those
of the low Countrey, yea agaynst the very
othe that his Maiesty sware and promised:
whereby we may sée and clearly perceiue,
that the sayd Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> abuseth the
charge that he hath obtained of his sayde
Maiesty, only for his owne auarice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of bloud, to the damage and hindrance
of his said Maiesty, and the destruction and
ruine of his faithfull subiects, chiefly wyth
this horrible fury and tyranny that he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
towards those poore people, (no dout)
<pb facs="tcp:1992:5"/>
against the kings will, who (according to
his accustomed clemency and gentlenesse)
neuer minded any such thing: This to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent,
there is none other meane to wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the sayd crueltyes, (considering also
that the passage or accesse to his Maiestye
is shut vp from vs,) but this our present &amp;
vnauoydable defence.</p>
            <p>For although that héeretofore the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chesse
of Parma. &amp;c. at that time Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
for his Maiesty in the low countreis,
hath expresly permitted and agréed to the
preaching of the word of God, (to the end to
auoid such imminent perils and daungers,
as at that time threatned the said cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey,)
with promise that none should atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt any
euil against such as had heard the said prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
or hereafter wold heare them: which
at commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dement of her highnes we cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to be published through all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
vnder our gouernement, binding vs
and our person, that the aforesayd shoulde
bene inuiolably obserued towards the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
of his sayd Maiesty.</p>
            <p>All this notwithstanding, the said Duke
of <hi>Alba</hi> and his adherentes haue constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
diuers of the Uassals and Subiects of
<pb facs="tcp:1992:5"/>
his Maiesty to anoyd the country, and that
for none other cause, but for that they haue
bene at suche Sermons, and haue shewed
themselues affectionate to that which they
found agreable to the word of God.</p>
            <p>And after they had brought it in, wyth
impertinent Citations, &amp; agaynst all right
and iustice, without obseruing of order, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
or vse of processe, they haue proceded
agaynst them by confiscation and violating
of their goodes, as well moueable as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable,
and all vnder coulor of Iustice.</p>
            <p>And the troth is, that for religions sake
diuers notable, honorable, and good men
as well by fire, swoorde, as other horrible
meanes, without cause and reason, yea hor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ribly
and tyrannously, both publicklye and
priuely, haue bene executed, some in darke
prisons, other through other fortures and
horrible paynes and tormentes, after they
had suffered diuers vnspeakeable tira<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nies
haue lost theyr lyues innocently and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause, yea euen to this day such execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and horrible executions are put in vre,
to the vtter destruction of the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
but especally of the poore Christians op<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pressed,
of which there are manye in that
countrye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1992:6"/>
And to this effect, it is not long since tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the whole low country, at one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
tyme, in one nyght, thorough all the
townes, a great number of them that they
suspected of such religion, were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
contrarye to all priuilegies, lawes,
contractes, and fréedomes, which hys Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty
him selfe (as is aforesayd) had agréed
and geuen them, yea such as he both sware
and promised vnto them.</p>
            <p>Also how they violently procéede to the
preiudice and interest of the sayde priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,
contracts, and fréedomes, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation
of goodes moueable and immoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
vsing and intreating the poore priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
at their pleasure, and scratching vnto
them selues the goodes of those, that wrong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fully
and against all right and iustice haue
bene driuen away, condemned, and slayne,
and by this meanes haue brought the afore
sayd country (who notwythstanding, the
better to shew their humble obedience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
hys maiesty, as to their souerayne
Prince &amp; Lord vsed no kinde of resistance)
into extreme bondage and vnspeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sery
and daunger. And if their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose,
gréedy couetousnes, and bloudthirsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
<pb facs="tcp:1992:6"/>
be not preuented, it is lyke to fall into
greater. Wythout consideration of the
great faythfulnes y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his low cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try shewed
in contributing so often, so louingly, so wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lingly,
as well to his Maiesty, as to hys wel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beloued
father <hi>Charles</hi> of most worthy me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mory,
so manye notable giftes, as amount
to many millions of florins, and infinite
summes, and especially in these last wars,
when so willingly they gaue about fourtye
millions of florins. And that of late they
haue offered to his sayd Maiesty thrée milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of florins, to obtaine leaue to preache
the word of God, and to exercise the same,
according to the writing of the Prophetes
and Apostels.</p>
            <p>And although that heretofore by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertising

it is manifest, that vnder this present ty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rannous
rule of the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> to the
detriment and mockery of hys Maiesties
promise, diuers notable personages, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
<pb facs="tcp:1992:7"/>
to the sayd promise, as well of his ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iestye,
as of her hyghnes the Gouernesse,
haue bene taken and throwen in dark dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,
whose goodes (with also the goodes
of those that fled) were without exception
of religion, contrary to all iustice, customs,
Statutes, lawes and ordinaunces, taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
and conficate. So that it séemeth that
in the ende none shall be exempt, of what
religion soeuer they be, so they haue anye
thing to lose.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding that wee for our
owne person, during the tyme of our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
yea euer since we came to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
state, haue desired nothing so muche as the
stablishing and encreasing of the authority,
power and force of his Maiesty, the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
of peace, quietnes and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
as well of the country, as of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes,
lykewyse that all mischiefe, do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mage
and interest, to our power, and as much as
in vs lyeth, might bee farre remoued from
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as heretofore, not sparing our goods,
yea with great daunger of our lyfe (be it
spoken without brag) we haue effectually
declared.</p>
            <p>Yet now w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out any regard hereto, we
<pb facs="tcp:1992:7"/>
(as well as other faultles both of hygh and
low degrée) by an vnorderlye citacion, and
blasphemous proclamation, vnder coulour
as though we had attempted the superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of the kynges Maiesty of Spayne, and
as committing <hi>Crimen rebellionis,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sufficient president, or reasonable
sentence, by violence are depriued of all
our country and subiectes, goods moueable
and immoueable: which to this daye they
kéepe violently from vs, against al humain
or diuine right.</p>
            <p>And it is maruelous, with what boldnes
our aduersaries dare propose, that we haue
attempted any thing against the authoritie
of the kinges Maiestie, and gone about to
take possession of his country, when wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther excuse, the contrary is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
by our wylling resignation of our
charge and gouernment of the countries
of Holland, Seland, and Utreght, also the
geuing ouer of the principall townes and
Fortresses in those partes: and to auoyde
all suspition, we went not secretly away in
to Germany, but publickly in the sight of
all men.</p>
            <p>Which we would not haue done, if our
<pb facs="tcp:1992:8"/>
mynde, intent, or enterprise, had beene en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to rebellion (as our aduersaries for
cloake of their horrible tyranny, wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lay to our charge) And we could be wel pleased;
yea we most humblye desire, that
the principall Captaines, Officers, and Iu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sticers
of such Townes, Fortresses, &amp; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stels
as were then, (according to our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment)
vnder our charge, (that the
truth may the better be knowen) may be
diligently examined, if they were euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by vs, to yeld or geue vp any town,
Fortresse, or Castel to our particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.
Of which pointes as of all other affairs
of the low country, ye shal finde more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
declaration in our iustification now of
late set-forth by vs.</p>
            <p>But if we, which haue done so good and
faithful seruice to his Maiestie, neither spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
body nor goods (without brag be it spo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)
yea beyng at this present ready with all
our heart to do much more, be now recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed
with such blasphemous accusations
(agaynst God &amp; all Iustice) &amp; further our
aduersaries assayle vs by so many sinister
practises, let all good men weighe by them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selues,
how intollerable it is to vs to beare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1992:8"/>
With all which tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nyes aforesayd, and
innumerable other violences, our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
with their adherents are not satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
but more manifestly to shew their rage
and crueltie, haue not long since taken out
of the Towne of <hi>Louain,</hi> our welbeloued
sonne, the Earle of <hi>Bueren</hi> (where we had
placed hym to continue in study, that he
might hereafter be better able to serue his
Maiestie) with intent to cary hym into
<hi>Spaine,</hi> as in déede they haue done.</p>
            <p>Besides that the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
since, more clearely to shew his bloudthyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
tyranny, hath taken and cruelly put to
death aboue thrée score Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
with other notable and rich perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
and Burgeses of the towne of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xelles,</hi>
with an infinite number in other
Townes, whose goodes he hath confiscate
and taken away, agaynst all right and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.
Wherby it is to be presumed, that he
goeth about to destroy and deface all the
the Nobilitie, yea the Egle it selfe.</p>
            <p>Yet all this could not satisfie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that
the two Earles of <hi>Egmont</hi> and of <hi>Horne</hi>
of famous memory, notwithstandyng their
faythfull seruice heretofore, in so many
<pb facs="tcp:1992:9"/>
warres, to the most mighty Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> of worthy memory, yea and also
to his Maiesty of <hi>Spaine,</hi> so many yeares,
with so great charge, in such daunger of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
(as all the world knoweth) without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
heard, without any forme of accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
processe vsed in such case, (not onely
agaynst all Gods and mans law, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
all Statutes of the Empire) hath
truelly put them to death by the sword: and
that with such great dishonor &amp; shame, not
only of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lordes iustified, but also of their
notable friendes and parentes, as to set vp
their heades for a spectacle to all the world
vpon staues and forkes.</p>
            <p>Further immediatly after the sayd exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
they tooke a fresh, more then ij. hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth

            <p>Which tyranny and incredible persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
and fury of the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> hath
driuen all men into such feare, that now of
late an infinite number, of both religions,
are withdrawen and fled away, for feare
of this generall tyranny without exception
of Religion.</p>
            <p>And the sayd Duke of <hi>Alba</hi> maketh his
vaunt openly, to pursue and séeke out to

the uttermost of his power, yea <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 word">

examples before our eyes.</p>
            <p>And forasmuch as hereby, the intent and
enterprise of the Duke, with his couetous

appeare to tend not only to the depriuyng
of vs, and all other good men, from such te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

true doctrine of the Gospell and confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of theyr horrible and Idolatrous Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery:
&amp; so to depriue vs of spirituall giftes,
which are to be preferred before all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Wherefore, we hope that all those
