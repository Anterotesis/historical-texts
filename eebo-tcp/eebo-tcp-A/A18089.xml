         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chapter, where I intreat of the Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
particularly.</p>
                     <p>I haue deliuered my Bill for the making
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:24813:5"/>
of the same, and other things, vnto Maister
<hi>Clapham</hi> in <hi>Fanchurch-street</hi> at the signe
of the Blew-bell &amp; Unicorne, <hi>Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi>
of whose good dealing since M <hi>Grayes</hi>
death, I haue made very sufficient tryall.</p>
                     <p>It may be kept good, and in perfect ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
three weekes, or a month, contrary to
the nature of other Purgers. If any man
minde to carry it farre, let him signifie so
much to M. <hi>Clapham,</hi> that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
of purpose.</p>
                     <p>And here I haue thought very requisite
to shew the causes why I haue not publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
the manner of making this Potion,
for that I am charged by some, that I haue
a yearely benefite by the same; and for
mine owne gaine, doe keepe it from the
multitude: which is most vntrue. For,
(as I haue a fayth vnto God) the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carie
hath the whole profit thereof. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it such, as that any man ought to
grieue thereat.</p>
                     <p>1 The first cause is, for that the composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Medicines doth properly pertaine
to the Apothecarie, and that it is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
euery man haue the benefit of his owne
profession.</p>
                     <p>2 The second cause is, the ignorance of
the multitude in chosing the simples or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:24813:6"/>
wherin is such skill, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecarie
himselfe (except he be of great
iudgement) is often deceiued.</p>
                     <p>3 The third cause, their ignoraunce in
making the Potion, yea, though happily
they haue good Simples. But because
some, dwelling farre from <hi>London,</hi> finde
themselues grieued, that they cannot haue
the Potion conueniently without great
charge, hauing sudden occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vse it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
keepe it so long good as they would;
I haue now deuised a Sirup of <hi>Lignum
aloes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">The Sirup of Lignum aloes</note> which may be kept one whole yeare
and longer, in perfect strength and vertue.
This Sirup is of the like nature with the
Potion, and is to be vsed as the Potion.
But by the addition of diuers thinges it is
of greater vertue, especially against Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,
the infirmities of the Spleene,
and the Diseases proceeding of wind. For
the vse hereof, and the quantitie, I referre
thee to the obseruations in the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and especially to the 12. Obseruation.
Onely this I will thee not to forget, that
now being a Sirup, it must be dissolued in
some liquor, and taken warme, either in
Broth, Wine, or Ale, clarified: in Ale or
Broth made thin, and without all Spices,
when the disease is hot &amp; cholericke: when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:24813:6"/>
the patient is grosse and full of Flegme, in
Wine; also in like sort, when the patient
is cold, dry, and full of dead melancholy.</p>

                     <head>Answers to such Obiections as may be
made against the vse of this Potion.</head>
                     <head>The second Chapter.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T will perhaps be obiected against me,
that it is very vnlikely, that one Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
should be good for so many diseases.</p>
                     <p>To which I answere, that we haue
receiued of our old and excellent Writers,
diuers Confections, wherein are conteined
sundry Purgers; whereof some purge
Flegme, some Choler, and others Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.
So that I conclude, of necessitie
they are good in al flegmaticke, cholericke,
and melancholicke Diseases; which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.
And following their example, I haue
made my Potion of like nature.</p>
                     <p>2 Further it may be obiected, that some
require to be purged with strong Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
others with gentle: for children, and
they which are brought to great weakenes
either by age, or by sicknesse, must be mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
vsed: but others, as the person &amp; disease
require, more roughly. Wherefore, how
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:24813:7"/>
can one Potion serue for both? Hath it two
contrary natures? Is it both strong and
gentle?</p>
                     <p>I answere, that where the disease or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
require a strong Purgation, I giue it
in the greater quantitie, and the oftner: <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>
where a gentle Purgation is required I
giue the lesse; as hereafter doth appeare.</p>
                     <p>3 Thirdly, it may be obiected, that in
some diseases of the Stomach, especially,
the patient is to be purged with Pilles,
Electuaries, or such like, which being of
more grosse substance then a Potion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
longer in the place where the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, and worke effectually: whereas a
thin Potion slippeth away, leauing the
worke vndone.</p>
                     <p>I answere, when I prescribe my Potion
for purging the Stomach, I wish my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to take it one houre before he rise: for
lying in his bed, it cannot more suddainly
passe the Stomach, then your grosser sort
of purgers; and then no doubt it will farre
excell Pilles, Electuaries, &amp;c. For being a
thinne substaunce, it will very easily ioyne
with the corruption which it findeth in the
Stomach, and dissolue the same: whereas
these grosser Medicines require first to be
dissolued themselues; which is no small
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:24813:7"/>
trouble to nature.</p>
                     <p>4 Fourthly, it may be obiected, that I
preferre my Potion before the Receiptes
of diuers excellent &amp; famous men, which
haue been alwayes esteemed euen as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of Physicke.</p>
                     <p>I must needs confesse, that whatsoeuer
I haue, I haue it from them. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
I hope no man thinketh nature
barren, or that she hath spent her self in our
Fathers, &amp; left nothing for their Children.
I haue read &amp; practised, according to that
which I found in these excellent men, and
haue herein only added to their inuentions.
So that if you receiue any benefite by this
Potion, or by ought else which here you
shall find, ascribe the honour vnto them: I
craue nothing, but accept my labour as a
sufficient recompence for my paines.</p>

                     <p>IN taking of my Potion, thou needest
not keepe thy Chamber, nor House
strictly, as in strong Purgations; but

obseruation of times for the taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
I onely aduise thee to forbeare euery
change and full of the Moone, in which are
conteined the Eclipses. For the Eclipse of

(although of more force then the ordinarie
change) neither the Eclipse of the Moone,
other then the perfect opposition or full.</p>
                     <p>3 It may be taken cold, of such whose
stomaches cannot beare the sauour of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
but haue their natures glutted with
often taking of Medicines.</p>
                     <p>4 If a Child and an elder body be sicke
both of one Disease, in which the Potion
is to be taken, let the Child take lesse, and
haue fewer stooles; but the elder more.
For as a small Uessell is sooner emptied
then a greater, conteining a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie:
euen so is the body of a Child sooner
purged, then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body of one of riper yeares;
specially, for that in a Child the humours
are more moyst and fluxible.</p>
                     <p>5 They, whose bodyes are full, and as it
were loden with corruption, shal find won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull
ease, if they take it ten dayes in the

now &amp; then one good spoonfull before sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
which will gather togither the relicks
of digestion, with other corruption, &amp; cause
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:24813:8"/>
the patient to haue the next morning one

                     <p>6 Take some broth within two houres,
or lesse, after the taking of the Potion, or a
Cawdle, or some like supping.</p>
                     <p>7 The Patient ought not to sleepe,
within three houres after the taking of the
Potion.</p>
                     <p>8 A child of three yeares old may take
of it very safely.</p>
                     <p>9 If it offende thy taste, vse Sugar, or
wash thy mouth with Wine, or some other
like thing, which I referre to thine owne
discretion.</p>
                     <p>10 If thy body be dry, and such as a
Purgation will hardly worke withall;
thou must take the greater quantitie.</p>
                     <p>11 If thy body be very moyst, and ouer
apt to be purged: thou canst not take too
little.</p>
                     <p>12 To finde a proportion betweene thy
body and the Potion, take thou first three,
foure, or fiue spoonefuls fasting, &amp; marke
how many Stooles that quantitie giueth
thee. If it giue thee more than thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
haue, take lesse the next day: if it giue
thee fewer, take more. By this meane,
when I shall hereafter, in any Disease, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise
thee to take so much as shall giue thee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:24813:9"/>
foure, fiue, or sixe stooles, more or lesse;
thou shalt be able, by this rule, to prescribe
thy selfe the quantitie. But for the most
part (thy body being neither very dry and
melancholy, neither ouer moyst and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
easie to be purged) euery good spoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
will cause and prouoke one stoole.</p>
                     <p>13 During the time of taking the Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
especially if thou take it long, to cause a
generall euacuation of thy body, abstaine
from those things which are very hot; as
Wines, Spices, Salt, and salt meates, &amp;c:
and also from raw fruites, greene hearbes,
and all cold thinges; or at the least, vse of
these as little as thou maiest. For thy body
being emptied, it is very requisite thou
make supply with those thinges, which are
of good nutriment, and fittest to breed good
blood: For otherwise, it is but vaine to take
away that which is bad, and to fill the place
with that which is worsse. Wherefore let
thy Drinke be Ale, thy Bread of the finest
of good Wheate; whereof also eate very
little thy Meates for the most part boyled,
and such as are fine and light of digestion.</p>
                     <p>14 In any wise read and marke well
these rules, before thou take of the potion.</p>

                     <p>THe Head-ach proceedeth of diuers
causes: First of heate, and chiefely
of the Sunne, which heateth the
Braine and blood about the Head:
and this kind of Head-ach is sayd to be of
heat alone, without the mixture of any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
causing the same.</p>
                     <p>2 The second kind of Head-ach (contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the first) is of cold alone, and happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
most vnto those, who hauing long
vsed to keepe their heads warme, suddainly
take cold. But because these two kindes
happen seldome, also for the most part stay
not long, and the causes being knowne, may
easily be preuented, I write nothing tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the cure of the same.</p>
                     <p>There are also diuers other griefes of
the Head; but mine intent is to speake here
onely of the cure of those which follow.</p>
                     <p>3 The third kind of headach is of fulnes,
when the partie liuing in great securitie,
some &amp; some feedeth his bodie excessiuelie,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:24813:10"/>
euen vntill his Eies swell with fatnesse,
and his whole Bodie be puffed vp like a
bladder,</p>
                     <p>4 The fourth kind is of corrupt humors,
which abounding in great quantitie, are the
verie present cause alone of the Headach,
without any other accidentall matter.</p>
                     <p>For cure of this third &amp; fourth kind, take
of my Potion, so much as shall giue thee
three, foure, or fiue stooles a daie for eight
daies or longer, vntill thy head and bodie
be well emptied. In this sort shalt thou vse
the potion for the cure of the swimming or
giddinesse of the head, and for sore and red
watering eies.</p>
                     <p>5 The fift kind is of the fume of corrupt
humors, &amp; not of the humors themselues:
for that the corruption lying in the stomach,
onely casteth vp to the braine euill fumes,
which offende the same, being of all other
partes the most sensible.</p>
                     <p>For cure of the fift kind, take of my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so much as shall giue thee foure or fiue
stooles a day, for three dayes, and keepe thy
bed one houre after the same; but sleep not.</p>
                     <p>6 There is also one other kind of head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach,
which proceedeth of the excrement,
continuing ouer-long in the body; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
I thinke it very necessarie to speake.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:24813:10"/>
After thou hast receiued thy food, first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
sucketh from it that which is thin and
pure, leauing the rest as grosse &amp; corrupt.
And if then it remaine longer in the body,
the noysome fumes thereof (it being now
an excrement, and hauing lost the nature of
a nutriment) ascend vp to the Braine, and
cause the Head-ach: also otherwise (nature
being as yet forced to feede thereupon) it
greatly infecteth the body: So that it is in
reason a thing vnpossible for him to be long
in health, who is much costiue or bound in
his body. For cure of this sixt and last kind,
take for ten or twelue dayes together (or
longer) euery morning fasting, so much of
my Potion, as shall giue thee one stoole a
day more then ordinarie. And when thou
hast brought thy body to good order, take
alway lesse and lesse: for by that meanes
thou shalt toll nature on to doe her worke
without helpe. And in any wise remember,
that euery morning, both whilest thou vsest
the Potion, and afterwards also, thou offer
thy selfe to the Stoole, although thou feele
no prouocation.</p>

wherein he is also troubled with tough and
slimie fleame; let him take now and then a
litle hereof vppon a kniues point, and hold
it long in his mouth: so that it melt downe
some &amp; some: For thereby the fume there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and part of the substance will passe with
the breath into the lunges, loose the fleame,
and cause it to void easilie.</p>
                     <p>For those that are troubled with the
shortnesse of breath, hauing their lunges
drie; so that it is a continuall labour for
them to fetch their wind: it is good first to
take of my Potion, now and then for a daie
or two, asmuch as will giue them three or
foure stooles at a time; and afterwards to
vse the Medicine before rehearsed made
with Malmesie, in this order following.
Clarifie a draught of Ale, and put therein
the yolk of a new laid egge, and one spoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of the medicine, when you are ready to
take it from the Fire: and let the patient
drinke it fasting, and fast one houre after
it. Although thou haue beene troubled
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:24813:13"/>
with this griefe many yeares, yet if thou
vse this medicine it will moisten and open
thy lungs or lights, and cure thee. Thou
canst not vse it too long, for it is both a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment
and a medicine. In this sort also
shalt thou greatlie ease them which are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into the consumption of the Lunges.
But if they will bee cured, they must with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
abstaine from all Spices, Wines, and
Salt meates, which fret or inflame their
bodies. Also they must haue a great care,
that they vse no violent Exercise to ouer
heate their Bodies; and that in Coughing
they straine their Lightes as little as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
may bee, least by violent Coughing
they teare them. Cheese, nuts, and all rawe
fruites also are verie euill for them. They
cannot haue too great care in their diet
and vsage. For this disease is verie harde,
and almost vnpossible to bee perfectlie cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                     <p>If any man, by vehement labour or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise,
heate his bodie excessiuelie, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his heate, either by Drinking, by rest,
or any meanes, suddenly coole himselfe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamelie,
for the most part he falleth sicke
vnto death: and if he escape, yet he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
weake and sicklie during his life, for
nature misliketh nothing more than a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:24813:14"/>
passage from the one contrarie, which
is extreame heate: vnto the other, which
is extreame cold. Now, if the partie thus
heating his Bodie, do keepe himselfe so
warme that he abate the extremitie by little
and little; vntill he come to that state, in
which he was before his heate: then he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not sicke, neither doth nature complain
at all. Wherevpon I thinke by great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and I am sure by long experience I
may conclude, that the best meane to cure a
man in this extremitie, is to bring his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
orderlie againe to the like heate, wherin
it was when he tooke cold, and to suffer the
same some and some as it were by degrees
to passe away: which thou shalt do in this
order.</p>
                     <p>Take a pint of ale, clarifie it, and dissolue
therein as much treacle as a walnut, and a
spooneful of the medicine before rehearsed,
made with malmesie. Let the patient drink
a good draught hereof warmed fasting, and
keepe his bed, &amp; sweat, foure or fiue hours
after it; and during his sweat, now and
then let him take of the Ale thus prepared
vntill he haue taken all. If it be a Child,
lesse quantitie will serue: and in anie wise
abate his sweate verie gentlie, and beware
he take no cold. For three mornings follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:24813:14"/>
let him take one draught of the like,
two howers before he rise, and keepe his
body warme without sweating.</p>
                     <p>Note, if in the beginning of his sicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
thou vse the order prescribed for the
first day, hee will presently recouer. But
if hee haue been long sicke, and so weake
that he bee not able to sweate as before,
there is no hope of life.</p>
                     <p>Note, that if the patient be much bound,
I wish thee to giue him fiue or sixe spoone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of my Potion, to ease and disburden
nature: and let him drinke oft, milde and
thin Broth warme.</p>

I wish thee also to take this for a generall

helpe by good diet or abstinence; in any
wise take no Physicke for the same. But if
thy long euill diet hath laden thy stomach
with hot, salt, &amp; cholericke humors, which
doe cause the heart burning: then take of

so much as shall giue thee foure or fiue

                        <p>THere are two speciall causes of this
Disease<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the one is, when the first
veines which receiue the nutriment
from the stomach, are stopped: the

the excrement very hard, so that the patient
goeth scarsely once in ten dayes to the
stoole. In some it groweth to such extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie,
that they neuer goe to the stoole: but
that which remayneth after digestion, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth

                        <p>For cure, take foure spoonefulles of my

more the next day; and so foorth, alwayes

                        <p>The next day, after it hath wrought,
boyle a pint of good White-wine, with one
handfull of Parsely, a quarter of an houre
or better; then straine it, and put thereto a
litle Sugar: and let the patient drinke a
reasonable quantitie thereof warme, and
keepe his bed, and sweat three houres: and
during his sweat, let him take now and

when the first Ueines doe not sucke,
which is their naturall action, whereby
they receiue food for the whole body: and
this is found in men of diuers constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The other is proper vnto fatte and
grosse bodyes, which are alwayes stuffed,
(as it were) and so full, that nature seemeth
contented with that she hath, and hath little
desire of more. For cure, take of my Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
euery day as much as will giue thee
two or three Stooles, and in few dayes
thou shalt feele thy selfe exceeding hungry:
But if thou haue not good appetite pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently

Take of my Potion so much as shall giue
thee three or foure Stooles a day, for fiue

age and body of the patient. For when his
Stomach &amp; Guts are cleansed, hee is very
perfectly cured. Then learne to auoyde all
windy and slimie meates, whereby thou
shalt be able to preuent these diseases. I
muse at the madnesse of such as in this case
vse Pepper, Ginger, and other hot spices:
also Coriander seed, or any thing of like
nature: for that in reason it is farre better
to take away the matter of the Disease,
in such sort as I haue sayd, then to ioyne

shalt stirre vp naturall heat, and consume
the waterish humours, which doe cause the
Rheume: but if the weather be such as thou

                           </gap>osse a great
yarne Ball against a wall, or driue a great
woodden Top in some conuenient place:
for both these are very good exercises. Use
them twise a day, and continue alwayes
one houre; but make an end an houre before
meate: and in the beginning, as also a
little before thou ende, vse gentle labour,
that thou abate thy heat by litle and litle:
this is the chiefe and principall meane,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:24813:18"/>
both to preuent &amp; cure this griefe. Which
dooth appeare manifestlie: first, for that
they, who labour much, are neuer troubled
with the Rheume: next, that students, and
such as vse litle stirring or motion of their
bodies, are most subiect thereto: for while
they sit still, the outwarde partes of their
bodies are cold; so that their bloud, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their humors, remaine within:
Neither haue they anie such euacuation by
the Pores, as nature requireth, to consume
the Rheumaticke humour, which then see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
another vent: and either the Patient
is forced to spit it out, or else it runneth out
at his Nose: or thirdly, it slily trickeleth
into the Lungs. Here also maiest thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
why Studentes are commonlie so

                     <head>For the Yellow Iaundise, and stopping

perfect cure.</head>
                     <head>The xiij. Chapter.</head>
                     <p>THE yellow I aundise proceedeth of
choler, being mixed with blood, and
therewith also dispearsed ouer the
whole body. There are diuerse cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of this Disease, which make diuerse
kindes thereof.</p>
                     <p>1 The first kind is by the biting of some
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:24813:20"/>
venemous Beast, whose Poyson ioyneth
with the blood, and maketh the same cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lericke.</p>
                     <p>2 The second kind is chiefly in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
or going away of an hot Feuer:
for when Nature hath got the vpper hand,
she dispearseth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yellow choler, which was
the matter of the Feuer, and driueth it out
of the bodie, by vrine, by stoole, and by the
pores: which are the three speciall and most
natural meanes, whereby she emptieth the
bodie. So that in this kind, the skin, which
is ful of pores, or insensible holes, the vrine
and Excrementes of the Patient are verie
yellow.</p>
                     <p>3 The third kinde is through the infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Liuer, which being ouer hot,
worketh too vehemently vpon the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which it receiueth, and conuerteth it
not into good bloud, according to his office
and dutie: but it selfe beeing distempered
into a matter of like heat, which is Choler,
or rather verie Cholericke bloud.</p>
                     <p>4 The fourth kind is through the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Gall, which is not able to su<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ke
or drawe from the Liuer the cholericke hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours;
but suffereth them together with
the Bloud to passe into the Bodie, which
thereby is coloured yellow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="34" facs="tcp:24813:21"/>
5 The fift kind is through the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or stopping of the vessels, that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the Liuer and the Gall; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
stopped, the Choler cannot passe into
the Gall, but is carried with the Blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the body, and stayneth it.</p>
                     <p>6 The sixt kind is through the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the passage, from the Gall, into the
bowels; for that being stopped, the Gall is
not able to emptie it selfe. But the Choler
is repelled, and passeth backe into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
which otherwise should colour and
staine the Excrement yellow. In this fift
and sixt kinds therefore, the Excrement of
the Patient is white, also he feeleth an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse
in his right side. These two last
kinds of Iaundies are most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, which
are thus to be cured. As for the rest, I
write nothing: for (to confesse a truth) since
I knew the vse of the roote of the white
Uine, otherwise called <hi>Brionia,</hi> a thing not
knowne, and yet of speciall vertue, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
vsed other meane to cure the Iaundise.
Whereby I gather, that either altogether,
or most commonly, the griefe riseth of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Take of the rootes of <hi>Brionia</hi>
halfe an ounce, and Parslie halfe an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full:
boyle these very gently in a pint of
White or Rhenish wine halfe an houre,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:24813:21"/>
close couered, then straine it, and let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
drinke a good draught therof reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hot, fasting, and keepe his bed, &amp; sweate
three or foure houres, as the continuance of
his disease doth require, &amp; his strength wil
permit, which I refer to his owne discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and during his sweat, let him drinke of
the rest, vntill he haue taken all: and if he
desire to drinke yet more in his sweat, giue
him Ale clarified, putting therto one whole
Mace, and a litle Sugar.</p>
                     <p>Note, the more he sweateth &amp; drinketh,
the more the vessels stopped are opened,
the matter digested, and his Iaundise the
sooner cured. The next day take so much
of my Potion as will giue thee seauen or
eight Stooles: for thy sweating doth but
open the vessels, and digest the corruption
which lieth in them: but the purging doth
take it away. It were also more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with physicke &amp; reason, if thou purge
a little before thy sweating, to cleanse thy
stomach and guts, least such corruption as
lyeth there, be caried into the body. But
in the meaner sort, who euer do expect sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
helpe, I often haue omitted the first
purging: yea, and sometimes also, they
feeling ease, haue neuer sought for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>

                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:24813:22"/>
Note, if the Iaundise in short time after,
shew not himselfe perfectly cured: let the
patient sweat againe, as before.</p>
                     <p>Note also, hereby thou shalt cure the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of the Liuer.</p>
                     <p>But the most easie and ready cure of the
Iaundise, is by the conserue for the Iaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise;
of which take euery morning fasting,
for ten dayes together, as much as a Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut,
and fast one houre after it.</p>

                     <p>THis Disease happeneth, when the
Liuer is also weakened, that it is
not able to conuert the nutriment
into blood; but the digestion thereof
is raw, so that the whole body is filled with
water and fleame, in stead of good blood.
It is found most in Maydens, who either
of folly desire to abate their colour, &amp; to be
ouer fine; or otherwise of childish appetite,
feede vpon such things, as change the state
of their bodyes, which are these: Apples,

that haue this Disease, are very pale and

are faint also, with shortnes of breath; and
haue their naturall course stayed.</p>

of the Ayre, which is of two sorts;

darke, cloudy, foggy, stifeling, very hot

to draw the corruption from the Earth,

such as they had taken away before. The
Ayre is particularly infected by the sauour
of dead Carcases; as it happeneth oft in

by the breath and sauour of the bodyes of
such as throng togither in a taynting or
stifeling sort, especially in some close or
sluttish place: as it happeneth (no doubt)
often in <hi>London,</hi> and such like Cities of
great resort, that many lodge together in
one small roome, hauing perhaps as many
Beds as the place will well containe. And
then, after one houre or two, how may any
of these draw fresh or sweete breath, but
such as his fellowes haue drawne often
before, as also the rancke fume of their
bodyes? Both which, are so contrary to
Nature, that some and some with continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
they infect the vitall spirites, and
breed such corruption as bursteth out into
the Plague.</p>
                     <p>The third kind of Plague riseth of the
corrupt Humours in mans body, by euill
diet ingendred. And these last sorts come
by the permission of God, like as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first by
his commandement. To preuent this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie
griefe, first I wish one old order to be
renewed; which was, to make Fires in all
great Cities &amp; Townes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> open streets,
vpon certaine dayes euery yeare: which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:24813:28"/>
no doubt doth greatly cleanse and purifie
the ayre. And although this order was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
obserued by the followers of the
Pope: yet I thinke they did it rather of
policie then of religion, and therefore being
good, it is not to be reiected. Secondly, I
thinke it very necessarie for Citizens, and
such as liue in a close ayre, now and then to
assemble themselues together in the fields
in some sweete and open place, there also to
vse moderate exercise; which will greatly
purifie their bodyes: and in the meane
time, to leaue a good huswife at home to see
the house made cleane &amp; sweete, by swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
by strowing good Hearbes, by ayring
the bedding, by opening the windowes,
to let fresh ayre into euery roome, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I wish that through all <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
in euery Ward, there may be certaine
appoynted to see, that no House or Roome
within any house, be ouer pestered with
lodgings or people, and to driue out of the
Citie such as vpon examination they shall
finde to be vagabondes, or vnnecessarie
members. For this is no lesse requisite for
such a Citie, then a Purgation for him
whose body is full of corruption.</p>

an handfull bruised: Boyle these together
gently a quarter of an houre, and when you
take it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fire, dissolue therein as much
Treacle as a Nut, and a litle Sugar; also
put thervnto three spoonefuls of Uineger.</p>
                     <p>As soone as euer the patient doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
&amp; nature being yet strong, giue him
fasting one good draught thereof warme,
and let him keepe his bed, and sweate ten
houres or lesse, as the strength of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
will beare. And in his sweating, giue
him now and then Ale clarified, and into
euery draught put two or three spoonefuls
of the decoction. When he riseth, giue him
some Broth not made ouer strong, neither
with much Spice; and be very carefull to
keepe him from the ayre. This decoction
thus vsed, will either force out the sore; or
else if the patient sweate throughly well,
cure him without any sore. And if thou find
he be not greatly eased within viii. houres
after his sweating, the next day vse the like
order. But whereas in this, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
diseases heretofore, I haue prescribed
the patient to drinke in his sweating, I
know it doth not agree with many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
neither do I take it to be absolutely
good; but herein rather I admit a small
euill, to auoyde a greater.</p>

                     <p>HE which hath his health, and would
so continue, I wish him either to
forbeare, or litle to vse those things
which greatly digresse from that
constitution or mediocritie, in which man
is created. Our Physitians doe call euery
thing hot, or cold, in respect of the nature of
man. For if it be some what hotter then his
nature, then it digresseth, and they tearme
it hot in the first degree: if yet hotter, hot
in the second degree: and in like manner to
the third and fourth. Which because it doth
so farre exceed his constitution, by dayly
proofe is found to be vnto him flat poyson.
The like consideration on the contrary side
haue they of cold thinges. Whereby you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:24813:31"/>
may gather, how like alwaies desireth like,
and abhorreth the contrarie. The thinges
which are like, &amp; best agree with the nature
of man, are good holesome vsuall meates &amp;
drinkes: a dry, fresh, &amp; sweet aire; moderate
sleepe &amp; trauell, or labour: which although
it were allotted to vs as a punishment by
God, yet mercifully withall he hath made
it a meane to preserue our health. The
things which greatly disagree, are wines,
spices, salt meates, &amp; all very hot things:
which thou shalt know by taste. For either
they bite like Pepper, fret like Salt, or
else shew some manifest great heate in the
mouth. Also on the other side, all rawe
fruites, &amp; cold hearbes, with diuers things
of like nature. Much vse of sauces, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

to vse a very sleight kind of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
Now and then they boyled
Hearbes in water, and therewith
did bath and rubbe their bodyes towardes

one generall Bath in this sort, and to that

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>COnsidering with my selfe (gentle
reader) how common a disease the
Stone is, and how little helpe the
parties grieued haue by vsuall
meanes in this our time, and of long time
haue had: and also hearing it diuers times
obiected, that the most learned Physitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
can neither preuent the Stone in those
who naturally are inclined thervnto, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cure it in those in whom it is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,
I did indeauour my selfe with all
studie and diligence, to finde out some
speciall thing, which might farre excell
the remedies now daily vsed, for the cure
of that grieuous disease.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon taking mine inuention
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Etius,</hi> who vsed very much the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of Goates blood for cure of the same:
also being further perswaded thereunto
by authoritie of diuers writing of the
nature of Goates blood: I did draw a
pure &amp; cleere liquor out of the blood of
the male Goate, which I haue thought
good to name the Quintessence for the
Stone.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:24813:38"/>
And hauing made experience thereof
now two yeares and better, with diuers, I
thought good to publish the same, to the
reliefe of many, which are grieued with
that infirmitie, and that in such sort, as it
shal appeare vnto the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that I rather
seeke herein to benefit my Country, then
any priuate gaine to my selfe.</p>
                  <p>For wheras no man troubled with that
disease, can haue the helpe of the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,
without his great charge: I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised
that meane, that any man so disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
may haue such ease with very small
charge, as I dare boldly auouch, can not
be had by any vsuall meanes.</p>
                  <p>But<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> for the commendation hereof, I
leaue it rather to be commended by the
helpe &amp; ease of those, who feare &amp; feele
the passions of that most terrible disease,
then vse any long rethorical perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
knowing that the good Wine needeth
no Garland; and that the fairest Garland
can be no long credit to sower Wine.</p>
                  <p>And now that this my Quintessence
may take the better effect, I thinke it very
necessarie, to signifie vnto such as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the Stone, and to those that are
already troubled with the same. First, the
causes of the Stone, and whereof it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:24813:38"/>
Secondly, the difference of
Stones ingendred in mans body. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the vsuall way both to preuent &amp; cure
the Stone. And fourthly, the way or
meane now late deuised, for preuenting
and curing of the same. Wherein being
somewhat instructed, they shall be the
better able to gouerne themselues in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyding
and curing the disease, as not
needing the Physitians continuall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,
but being Physitians to themselues.
Yet I would not haue any man think that
I minde to make any long or curious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of the Stone, touching all the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
poynts of the same, as indeauouring
to make the readers perfect Physitians
herein; but onely to shew them a superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

                     <head>The causes of the Stone, and how
it is ingendred in mans body.</head>
                     <head>The first Chapter.</head>
                     <p>IT is not vnknowne vnto such as haue
bestowed any time in the studie of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke,
that as well the old, as the new
Writers, with one consent agree,<note place="margin">Two causes the Stone.</note> that
there are two causes of the Stone: the
one materiall, the other formall. The mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
cause is an earthy, grosse, thicke, and
slimie humour: the formall cause is the
heate of mans body, digesting or baking
the sayd humour, vntill it be hard, which
then remayneth in the nature of a Stone:
this will I make more manifest to you by
a familiar example.</p>
                     <p>Clay of it selfe is an earthy and slimie
substance, which I will compare vnto the
humor whereof the Stone is ingendered.
Also the Fire I wil compare vnto the heat
of mans body; whereby you may see how
the Stone in ingendred. For this Clay,
being baked in the Fire, is made a Stone,
and looseth his nature of Clay.</p>
                     <p>Here also I thinke it good to note, that
Nature requireth alway a fit matter to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:24813:42"/>
worke vpon. For one onely action of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at one time worketh diuers and very
contrary effects: which happeneth, because
of contrarietie of the matters wherevpon
she worketh, and not by any diuersity of her
action. For as by Fire, Clay is made a
Stone: so Chalke being a Stone, by Fire
is conuerted into powder. And as Clay
by Fire is made a cast and firme substance,
which before was soft, and easie to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
in Water: so Chalke being before,
a fast and sound lumpe, is by the same fit to
be dissolued in Water, because of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuitie
or separation of his partes.</p>
                     <p>Whereby you may gather, that this
slimie humour, being in mans body, hath a
nature very apt to be turned into a Stone,
and yeeldeth it selfe to the speedie genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, wherevnto it is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined,
which otherwise by so small heate,
could hardly bee. And therefore I would
wish euery man to haue a speciall care in
refusing Mea<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>es, and other things, which
are apt to breed the Stone, and in vsing
the contrary; which hereafter in place con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient,

Stone, I will not omit,</p>

                     <head>The difference of Stones ingendred
in mans body.</head>
                     <head>The second Chapter.</head>
                     <p>I Haue (according to my promise) briefly
spoken of two causes of the Stone.
Now with like breuitie, I will speake
of the difference of Stones ingendred
in mans body; which I find by experience,
to differ in place, colour, forme, quantitie,
and hardnesse.</p>
                     <p>1 As touching the first, there are two
vsuall places where the Stone is ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
the Kidnies, and the Bladder. Unto
the stone of the Kidnies, the middle-aged,
and they that somewhat decline, are most
subiect. And these Stones of the Kidnies
are also of two sortes. For they are either
ingendred in the hollow vessels of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies;
or in the substance or fleshie partes.
But vnto the Stone of the Bladder, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are most inclined: which hapneth, for
that all Children (for the most part) first
eate often, ere that which they eate before
be digested. Next, after they haue eaten,
they vse violent exercise, and motion of
their bodyes continually, whereby they
force a thicker and more grosse iuice or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:24813:43"/>
from the stomach into the body,
then Nature requireth: and that grosse
substaunce, setling in the bottome of the
Bladder, by the temperate heate of the
child, is conuerted into a Stone. As in the
making of the artificiall Wmes, if you let
them passe through the strayner gently of
their owne accord, they come cleare: but if
hastily you force them by wringing, they
come thicke, and being setled, will be full
of Groundes in the bottome.</p>
                     <p>2 Secondly for colour, there are some
Stones white, some blacke, others yellow;
some red, some of ash-colour, &amp; some mixt
of diuers colours. Which diuersitie hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth
chiefly by difference of the matter,
whereof the Stones were ingendred: and
somewhat by digestion of the Stones, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by smaller or greater heat, with either
longer or shorter time.</p>
                     <p>3 The third difference of Stones, is in
forme or fashion. For some are round, as a
Ball: some like an Egge, some like a
Pease, some like a Barlie corne: some
sharpe, some piked, &amp; of diuers &amp; sundry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
formes, wherof I need not to speake.</p>
                     <p>4 The fourth difference is in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie:
for the Stone differeth in quantitie
from the bignesse of a pins head, or lesse,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:24813:43"/>
vnto the quantitie of an Egge, or greater.
And the smaller sort of Stones are (for the
most part) ingendred in the Kidnies, and
that either in the hollow vessels of the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
as I sayd before: which being but
small, the Stone cannot exceed the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
thereof, and therefore must be small
also. Or else in the substaunce or fleshie
partes of the Kidnies, here and there dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearsed,
which also are seldome found to be
great. But the greater sort of Stones are
alwayes ingendered in the Bladder, for
that the vessels being great, will also ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the generation of a great Stone.</p>
                     <p>5 The fift difference, is in hardnesse.
For there are some (as I haue often seene)
scant congealed or baked, so that one may
breake them to grite with this finger &amp; his
thumbe. Others somewhat harder, and not
easie to be broken. And others so hard, as
they will not easily yeeld to the Hammer.
The Stone that breaketh gently, is (for
the most part) red, or yellow. The middle
sort, is of diuers colours. The hardest,
white. There is also a mixt kind of Stone,
compact of hard stones lightly knit togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by soft Grauell; and this kind is most
dangerous and painefull in voyding.</p>

                     <head>The vsuall way how to preuent and
cure the Stone.</head>
                     <head>The third Chapter.</head>
                     <p>IN the two former Chapters, I haue
briefely touched the matter whereof the
Stone is ingendered, and the difference
of Stones. Now I will shew the vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
meanes, both to preuent and cure the
Stone, which (amongst the Physitians of
our time) are now dayly practised. The
Stone in those who onely feare the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease,
and are not yet troubled therewith,
is preuented by two speciall meanes. The
one is, by abstinence from Meates, and
thinges which are apt to breed the Stone.
Which are of 2. sortes also. For either they
breede in the body of a fitte matter, easie
to be conuerted into a Stone: as Ueale,
Pigge, Lambe, Ling, Greene-fish, Eeles,
Cheese, Milke; and generally, all very
grosse, slimie, sweete, and fatte Meates.
Or else, they cause an vnnaturall heate in
the Body, and inflame the Kidnies, and
other partes: as, heating the Backe at the
Fire, lying much vpon the Backe; also
great vse of Pepper, Ginger, and other
Spices, or any thing of like nature. The
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:24813:44"/>
other by purging that humour, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the body, is not yet digested to the
nature of a Stone: which is done by two
meanes also. Either by Purgation, and
lexatiue Medicines; or otherwise, by those
thinges, which beeing of a very subtile,
thin, and piercing nature, do passe sodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
through the Liuer, the Kidnies, and the
Bladder, and violently carry with them
such slimie and grosse humours, as they
finde by the way: as White-wine, &amp; Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish-wine,
with such like, taken fasting:
which being not taken fasting, worke not
this effect. For being vsed either with, or
soone after Meate, they hasten the digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,
and carry grosse and raw humours into
the body, whereby they worke a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
effect, and ingender the Stone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
much vsed.</p>
                     <p>But the Stone beeing already ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
by the vsuall meanes is to be cured;
chiefely by thinges which cause the Stone
to breake &amp; voyde: as Saxifrage, Parsely,
Pellitorie of the wall, Gromwell, &amp; other
thinges infinite; whereof I haue named
foure good, pleasant, &amp; easiest to be taken.
There are also diuers other meanes: as
letting Blood, Purging, Glisters, Uo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
and mollifying or distending the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:24813:45"/>
and strict vessels with Oyles, &amp;c.
wherein the Stone sticketh. But for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie
sake, all these I let passe.</p>

                     <head>The fourth Chapter.</head>
                     <p>I haue hitherto briefly touched the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of the Stone, the differences of
Stones, and the vsuall meanes for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting
and curing the Stone. Now
I minde to shew the way, both to preuent
and cure the same, by the <hi>Quintessence</hi> of
Goates blood.</p>
                     <p>The vse whereof, for those that are from
their father and mother, or either of them
naturally inclined therevnto, or otherwise
feare the Disease, and would preuent the
same: is, to take twentie or thirtie dayes
in the Spring, and likewise in the Fall
of the Leafe, two spoonefuls thereof in a
good draught of their accustomed drinke
fasting, and to fast one houre after it; which
will without all question preserue them
from the disease.</p>
                     <p>But vnto those, who are troubled with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:24813:45"/>
the Stone, and feele now &amp; then a passion
thereof, I haue thought good to prescribe
this order. Cause foure or fiue gallons of
Drinke to be brewed &amp; tunned vp in a litle
vessell fit for the same: and when it is new
tunned, adde thereto bound togeather, one
good handfull of Parselie, and one handful
of Pellitorie of the wall; but for want of
Pellitorie, take the more Parselie, though
the other were better. And when your
Drinke (being either Ale or Beere, as you
like best) is stale enough, drinke therof eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
morning fasting a good hearty draught,
adding thereto two spoonefuls or more of
the <hi>Quintessence</hi> (for in great quantitie
you cannot erre) and fast one houre after it,
as before. But whiles you take it, vse no
violent motion of your body, but gentle
walking, or such like: least the Stone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to breake, the peeces thereof fall
into the narrow vessels betweene the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
and the Bladder; or from the Bladder
into the Yard, to your great torment: and
this order I wish you to vse, as long as
you finde any Grauell to voyde. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
oftentimes the Grauell doth voyde,
and yet not to be discerned, as my late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
hath taught me, I thinke it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
here to shew the strange working of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:24813:46"/>
                        <hi>Quintessence.</hi> If you put into a cuppe of
Wine a peece of light, hollow, &amp; soft Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
the Wine presently entreth into all
partes thereof, and causeth it to fall like a
sandie substance. But if you put into the
same cup of Wine, a peece of white, hard,
and perfect good Sugar, it resisteth the
Wine, and suffereth onely the outwarde
parts in long time, some &amp; some to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued.
So likewise, if the <hi>Quintessence</hi>
finde in the body an hollow, soft, &amp; grittie
Stone, it entereth presently into the same,
dissolueth it, and causeth it to voyd in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
being not able to suffer the long action
or working of the <hi>Quintessence.</hi> But the
Stone being hard, long digested, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
his substance fast and soundly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
together, the <hi>Quintessence</hi> can not
enter into the same, but worketh vpon the
outwarde partes thereof; and the more
strongly it abideth and resisteth, the more
perfectly the <hi>Quintessence</hi> resolueth the
same. For manifest proo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e thereof, if in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>de, after
the taking of the <hi>Quintessence,</hi> in some
open vessell, vpon the Embers in a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heate; and suffer it so to stand vntill all
the Water be breathed away, &amp; that which
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:24813:46"/>
remayneth be perfect dry, which you shall
finde a grittie substance, if you were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with the Stone. And this is a very
perfect tryall. Now I thinke it good to
note, that if the Stone be great in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and in the Bladder, you must vse the
<hi>Quintessence</hi> the longer, and not looke to
be cured miraculously with the vse thereof
a weeke or two. And against this kind spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
I wish that Parsely be vsed (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
for that it is a great opener, and will
helpe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Quintessence</hi> to passe more swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vnto the Kidnies &amp; the Bladder, where
it ought to worke; which otherwise conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
long in the stomach, loseth part of
his vertue, and worketh no<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> so effectually.
But if the partie be very olde withall, and
hath his Kidnies and Bladder exulcerat,
or either of them, yet chiefly the Bladder;
then I wish him not only to vse the <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tessence</hi>
as before, but also to obserue very
diligently this Diet. Abstaine from all
Wine, Aqua vite, Aqua-composita, Be<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re,
Ueriuice, Uineger, Aliger, Perrie, Cider,
Salt and salt Meates; all Spices, Oren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
Lemmons, Mustarde; and all raw
Fruites, and generally from all thinges
which cause the Urine to be hot, sharpe, or
fretting. For then, although the Stone be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:24813:47"/>
cured, yet the partie hath litle ease, for
that the sharpe Urine, hauing accesse to the
sorenesse and rawnesse of the Kidnies or
Bladder, wil not suffer the partes infected
to heale, but rather increaseth the griefe.
If you be troubled with the exulceration
of the Bladder, the manifest and continuall
paine thereof will declare the same: also,
the griefe in making water, and hardinesse
of making water, which rather droppeth
then runneth, because the force expuisiue
is decayed: and if with the exulceration of
the Kidnies, then haue you paine in your
Loynes. But if you be grieued with either
of any continuance, with your Urin, there
voydeth often slimie corruption, like the
white of an Egge, or filthy Blood, &amp; such
like: I wish those who remaine in this
case, especially troubled with the exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Bladder, not to torment their
bodyes with much Phisicke. For although
eased, yet cured they cannot be. Onely I
counsell them (as before) to remooue the
Stone, and to auoyde (by abstinence from
the thinges afore recited) the sharpnesse of
Urin, which are the causes efficient of their
griefe; and that done, to vse for healing of
their sore Kidnies and Bladders, as neere
as may be, a reasonable quantitie of Gotes
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:24813:47"/>
milke, euery morning fasting: also, the
sirup of Plantine is a speciall thing in these
griefes, vsing one spoonefull thereof in the
morning in Ale clarified.</p>
                     <p>And now to end this my short worke,
I let passe that which a number of writers
set foorth of the nature of the Gote, and the
vertue of his bloud against the stone. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

cure thereof, after he had shewed diuers
remedies, he endeth thus: <hi>Sanguis denique
