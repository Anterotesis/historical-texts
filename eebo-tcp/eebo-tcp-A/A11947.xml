            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am not obliuious, neither carelesse, when, and how, your Honour (aboue my expectation) nobly satisfied the request of me your humble seruant. I am most as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, that the vertue of your noble heart expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth nothing of me, but that your goodnesse might abound to my profite: vppon which occasion, and bicause I would not be accounted ingratefull, I haue both boldly passed the limittes of my duetie, and also vnlearnedly taken vpon me to set foorth some thing worthie notice, in this last voyage of our Capteine and Generall, Maister Martine Frobisher, your Honours worthie Countrie man: vnder whome (as your Honours vnworthie ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant) I was one in the said voyage.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Vch countries and people, (good Christian Reader) which almost from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, or at the least, so long as anye humane creature hath had habitation on the earth, haue of late yeres, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> industrie of diligent sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers ben explored: it hath likewise plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should be found out by those people, which for the temperature of their habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are most apt to atchiue the same. As for example, the Spaniards, the West Indies. Spaine is situated much more neere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Tropike of Cancer, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christian countries be: wherby, the Spaniards are better able to tolerate Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus burning beames, then others whiche are more Septentrional the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I suppose them the most apte men for the inioying of the habitation of the West Indies: and especially so much, as is vexed with continual heate, or that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their temperature, God hath


<pb facs="tcp:11357:4"/>
ben pleased that they, as the most apt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, should both explore &amp; inioy y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same. Semblably, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Portugals, whose tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is correspondent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards, God is also contented, that they haue explored Africa, euen through the burning Zone, both the West and South coast, with al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coast of Asia, vnto the Oriental cape ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the Islands adiacent to them bothe wherefore, both for their habitation, and temperature, I account them y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most apt people to atchiue y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and to reape the benefite, where about they haue taken no small paines and labor. In like maner, the French men, where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Spaniards thought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place not apt for their temperature, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered Noua Francia, and other places in America: wherfore, I iudge them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the commoditie thereof, as people most apt to inioy and possesse the same. Lastly, it hath plesed God, at this present, by the great diligence &amp; care of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie Countrieman, Master Martine Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisher, in the 18. and 19. yeare of oure Queenes Maiesties reigne, to discouer,


<pb facs="tcp:11357:4"/>
for the vtilitie of his Prince and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, other regions more Septentrional, then those before rehearsed: which, from the beginning, as vnknowne till nowe, haue bene concealed and hidden. Which discouerie, I iudge most apt for vs English men, and more agreeing to our tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then others aboue rehearsed. I leaue the famous discouerie of Moscouie, and other countries on those partes, (whiche of late yeares haue bene explored by the industrie of other our worthie countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) to the diligent Reader: whereby he may consider, that this our countrie, hath fostered vp men of no lesse value and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, then those, which are intituled, The second, thirde, and fourth Neptune. And doubtlesse, hee, by whose endeuour this last discouerie of the world is explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, may bee celebrated as well with the title of Aeolus, as also of Neptune. By whose singular knowledge and cunning, God hath preserued vs in this voyage, from bothe their cruell daungers.</p>
            <p>Thus (Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Reader) thou maist per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,


<pb facs="tcp:11357:5"/>
that the worlde, of late yeares, hath beene discouered by sundrie regions of this our Europe: which God hath so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in the exploring of the same, that it seemeth apt and agreeable to the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer, more then to any other, to inioy all such commodities as they yealde and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorde. Consider also, that Christians haue discouered these countries and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which so long haue lyen vnknowne, and they not vs: which plainely may ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that it is Gods good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, that they should be instructed in his diuine seruice and religion, whiche from the beginning, haue beene nouzeled and nourished in Atheisme, grosse ignorance, and barbarous behauiour. Wherefore, this is my iudgement, (in conclusion) that who so euer can winne them from their infidelitie, to the perfect knowledge of his diuine institutions and seruice, hee or they are worthie to receiue the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test rewarde at Gods hands, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter benefites from those countries, which he hath discouered.
