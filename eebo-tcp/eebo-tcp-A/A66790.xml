         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the moſt honourable the Lords and Commons in Parliament aſſembled: The humble Declaration and Petition of Major <hi>Geo. Wither.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THough a <hi>prayer</hi> of this length, is not uſually preferred to your Honours, let it nevertheleſſe appeare, for this once, excuſable, in regard, the hardſhip of <hi>bearing,</hi> what occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons this tediouſneſſe, to exercize your patience in <hi>hearing,</hi> may perhaps, merit the more <hi>compaſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your ſaid Petitioner, having long and patiently waited when the</hi> Publike-Affaires, <hi>would afford leaſure to redreſſe his</hi> private-grievances; <hi>and, then, perceiving his many</hi> ſufferings, <hi>to be almoſt paſt remedy; his family nigh deſtroyed; his life declining to the grave, and his juſt expectations every day further off then before; he began to conſider, that,</hi> charity to himſelfe, <hi>being the rule of regulating his love to others, ought not to be infringed; that workes of</hi> juſtice <hi>and</hi> mercy, <hi>ſhould at no time be neglected, or ſeem impertinent; that, a</hi> generall-well-being <hi>is not poſſible where</hi> particulars <hi>and</hi> Individuals, (<hi>whereof a</hi> Generality <hi>conſiſteth</hi>) <hi>are needleſly expoſed to deſtruction; and, that, no man is bound, ſilently, to ſuffer in, or for, that</hi> Common-wealth, <hi>which is ſo unequall in her</hi> Diſtributions, <hi>as not to adminiſter, equally, deſerved</hi> rewards <hi>and</hi> puniſhments, <hi>to her own</hi> Members; <hi>much leſſe, when ſhe will find</hi> Times <hi>to heare</hi>; Bread <hi>to feed; and</hi> Bowells <hi>to compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate her</hi> malitious Deſtroyers; <hi>and, yet, hath neither</hi> Leiſure, <hi>nor</hi> Food, <hi>nor</hi> Pitie <hi>for them, who thought nothing too precious, to be hazzarded for her</hi> Preſervation: <hi>And, your ſaid</hi> Petitioner <hi>thereupon intended to expreſſe his</hi> Grievances, <hi>publikely, at large, and in ſuch manner, as an</hi> unſufferable Oppreſſion, <hi>joyned with</hi> Deſperation of reliefe, <hi>might ſeem to require. But, having ſomwhat renewed his loſt hopes, by diſcovering</hi> Symptomes <hi>of your removing thoſe</hi> Obſtructions, <hi>of</hi> juſtice <hi>and</hi> mercy, <hi>which of late, eclipſed the honour of the</hi> Parliament, <hi>fruſtrated the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of her</hi> beſt affected Members, <hi>and oppreſſed her moſt</hi> faithfull Servants; <hi>he hath now changed his purpoſe; and humbly offers unto this</hi> high Court, <hi>an occaſion of performing an</hi> Act of Juſtice, <hi>and a</hi> Work of Mercy, <hi>by imploring your favourable anſwer to his following</hi> Declaration <hi>and</hi> Petition; <hi>conceiving, it ſhall be a thing acceptable to</hi> God, <hi>honourable to the</hi> Parliament, <hi>and an</hi> Omen <hi>of a</hi> generall mercy <hi>to this</hi> Kingdome. Motives, <hi>to procure his humble</hi> Suit, <hi>he could alledge too many, to be here added; and, ſome of them are ſuch, that, out of</hi> reverence <hi>to the honour of this</hi> Nation, <hi>he will not openly mention them, whilſt he hath any hopes of redreſſe: And, yet, leaſt the concealing of all, may render him, and his</hi> neceſſities, <hi>inconſiderable, till his</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction <hi>be irrecoverable, he humbly offers theſe that follow:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That, your ſaid Petitioner hath not onely given <hi>publike teſtimonies</hi> of his love to this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> many years before this <hi>Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Army,</hi> appeared againſt her <hi>Oppreſſors</hi>; and hath continued conſtant to this <hi>Parliament,</hi> ever ſince it began, notwithſtanding many provocations, occaſioned by malignant <hi>Members:</hi> But, was the firſt alſo, (though without any particular encouragement) who, in thoſe, parts where he lived, contributed his goods, and ingaged his perſon, for the <hi>Publike-ſafety:</hi> And, that, he having frequent ſolicitations, and large offers from the <hi>contrary Party,</hi> did nevertheleſſe proceed, and disburſe, voluntarily, out of his owne eſtate and credit, above 700. l. in your greateſt need; for which, he muſt pay <hi>interest,</hi> untill the principall is diſcharged; and, for part of which money (the ſame having already been owing above four yeares, he is now a Priſoner in the Gate-houſe, to his great charge and diſgrace, who was never a Priſoner for any debt of his owne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That, in the beginning of this warre, he was by <hi>ſpeciall Order,</hi> plundered by the <hi>Kings Forces</hi>; and that, the honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> being certified, by an <hi>Inventorie</hi> teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under the hands of ſixteen perſons, that this Petitioners damages (as hath been ſince alſo averred by ſeverall Oaths) amounted to above 2000. l. did thereupon, by their Order, of the 19. of <hi>February,</hi> 1642. charitably, authorize your ſaid <hi>Petitioners</hi> repaire the ſaid dammages, out of the eſtates of his <hi>Plunderers,</hi> and other <hi>Delinquents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. That, your ſaid <hi>Petitioner,</hi> with humble thankfulneſſe, and with due reſpect to the honour of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> endeavoured to execute the ſaid <hi>Order</hi>; But, ſo diſcountenanced was he therein, <hi>Delinquents,</hi> ſo impudently befriended, and the ſaid Order ſo ſleighted; that, he could not, thereby, recover halfe ſo much as the Intereſt of his <hi>principall damages,</hi> (as by <hi>Accompts</hi> upon Oath, and by <hi>Inventories</hi> of the particulars apprized, by ſworne Apprizers; it doth, and may appeare) and, that, inſtead of the Repaire intended by the ſaid <hi>Order,</hi> he is ingaged into ſo many troubles and ſuits, by ſeeking to execute the ſame; that, he who had never before one <hi>Suit in Law,</hi> hath now five ſuits, unjuſtly occaſioned, meerly, by the ſaid Order, to his intolerable charge and vexation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That, by being plundered as aforeſaid, he hath now been deprived almoſt five yeares, both of his <hi>Stock,</hi> and of an <hi>Imployment</hi>: wherey he cleared, and might probably have clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for ſixteen yeares then to come, above 400. l. <hi>per annum,</hi> toward his <hi>maintenance,</hi> and the advance of his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> over and above all Rents and charges: And, that, by looſing the ſaid <hi>Stocke</hi> and <hi>imployment,</hi> in your Service; and by the Oppreſſions ſuſtained in ſeeking reliefe, by meanes of the foreſaid <hi>Order,</hi> this <hi>Petitioner,</hi> hath not onely loſt ſo much yearely profit; but, hath been thereby, compelled alſo, to borrow almoſt halfe ſo much, to maintaine his <hi>Family,</hi> and to pay <hi>Taxes, Houſe-rent,</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> during moſt part of the ſaid time.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That, there is likewiſe due to this Petitioner (as appeares by his Accompts ſtated in Febr. 1646.) above 1681. l. for Arreares, beſides other juſt demands, amounting to 523. l. more then was certified by the <hi>Accomptants</hi>; all which ought to have been paid unto him above three yeares now paſt, and moſt part of it above foure yeares ſince, as will appeare by <hi>Deben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>hat, inſtead of what was graciouſly promiſed to ſuch as had eminently ſuffered, and of what was charitably intended, by the honourable <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> to this <hi>Petitioner,</hi> he hath been many waies injuriouſly oppreſſed, yea publikely, and falſly ſcandalized and miſrepreſented to the ſaid <hi>Houſe,</hi> to the occaſioning of his being fined in 500. l. and of his confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to this day (being now almoſt a yeare and a halfe) by the unjuſt Report of one then ſitting in the ſaid <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> and by the concurrence of others, (of whom ſome are now departed the Kingdome) who did then condemne the <hi>innocent,</hi> and juſtifie the offender, contrary to evidence; and to the diſabling of your ſaid <hi>Petitioner,</hi> to defend himſelf, who was not only thereupon diſgracefully fined, &amp; confined, as aforeſaid, for having honeſtly diſcharged his duty; but, ſo impoveriſhed alſo, that of above twenty <hi>horſes</hi> (which he kept conſtantly, before his ingagement for the publike) he hath, now, none; of eighteen <hi>houſhold ſervants,</hi> he hath but one, which he is likewiſe unable to maintain; and, inſtead of many diſhes at a meale, is faine to make many meales of one diſh; which, at this preſent, also, he can hardly provide: yet, theſe are not the worſt requitalls of his knowne faithfulneſſe; as will appeare hereafter more at large, if there be cauſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That, your ſaid <hi>Petitioner,</hi> having had for many years paſt, as aforeſaid, neitheir <hi>Stocke</hi> nor Imployment, whereby to maintaine his Family, or defend himſelfe, againſt his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſcandalizers and oppreſſors, was forced (after he had borrowed, untill he was aſhamed to borrow more) firſt, to ſell, at low prizes, much of his moſt neceſſary goods; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that, which he would not have left, for ten times the value; even <hi>Jewels</hi> and Plate, given as teſtimonies of their reſpect, by the Queen of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the late Dutcheſſe of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, and other honourable perſons; and yet, had perhaps periſhed, if God had not moved a charitable Member of the Houſe of <hi>Commons,</hi> to ſupport him, hitherto, beyond hope.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Laſtly, that, your ſaid <hi>Petitioner,</hi> hath been impriſoned ſo long, for what the <hi>State</hi> owes; and ſuffered ſo much, by them, againſt whom the State ought to protect him; that, if he be not ſpeedily relieved, he perceives no poſſibility of feeding his Family, one moneth longer; much leſſe, of paying his Creditors, or avoiding the inconveniences, whereto hee ſhall be ſhortly liable, by not <hi>anſwering</hi> or <hi>proſecuting,</hi> according to the chargeable <hi>Formalities</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Chancery</hi>; and, whereby, he hath already ſuffered above 150. l. damage, through want of wherewith, to proſecute his right, and defend himſelfe, as the ſaid <hi>Formalities,</hi> require. In a word, he is totally ruined, meerly by his ingagements for you, and by Petitioning and attending, now above foure years, without redreſſe: his eſtate is ſo confuſed; his neceſſities are ſo many; his credit ſo impaired, by being clamor'd on, for truſting to the <hi>publike-faith,</hi> other mens goods, aſwell as his own; and, his friends have hitherto been ſo few, or ſo unable: that, he knowes not which way to turn himſelf; nor, by what, he may fully illuſtrate, his <hi>preſent condition,</hi> except by the <hi>diſtractions</hi> and <hi>confuſions</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> which, are epitomized in his: For, theſe <hi>lines</hi> containe not the <hi>tithe,</hi> of what, he can, and will further alledge, as motives of your commiſeration, if there be cauſe.</p>
            <p>In conſideration, therefore, of what is already expreſſed; and in regard your ſaid <hi>Petitioner</hi> hath now been wheeled about, <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>by References,</hi> and <hi>Committees,</hi> nigh foure years, as aforeſaid, without other effect, ſave increaſe of ſcandalls, coſt and troubles, which are likly to out-laſt the nigh expired terme of his life; and, whereby he is now diſabled to toile any longer in thoſe <hi>Labyrinths,</hi> which have made wiſer men <hi>giddie,</hi> and ſome of them <hi>mad,</hi> both to the <hi>publike ſcandall,</hi> and their owne <hi>deſtruction</hi>; he humbly beſeecheth your <hi>Honours,</hi> to ſet a period to his troubles; and not to expoſe him to thoſe <hi>deſperate courſes,</hi> or expreſſions, which others have imprudently fallen upon, in <hi>leſſe-ſufferable extremities,</hi> to the diſhonor of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the loſſe of the peoples affections thereunto, the prolonging of the generall calamity, and to the hazzarding of all our happineſſe. Be pleaſed, for preventing the ruine of his <hi>innocent children</hi>; the making of him a ſcorne to his <hi>Foes</hi>; a ſhame to the <hi>Nation</hi>; and a burthen to this <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> (whereto he might perhaps, be ſome way as ſerviceable, as many others, who have better thrived, by her undoing) to vouchſafe him, ſome part of thoſe great ſums, whereof others have ſhared: yea, for your owne honours ſake, be pleaſed, according to the ancient <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Clemency,</hi> of Engliſh <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and the many <hi>Religious Proteſtations</hi> made at the beginning of this, to take, his neceſſities and faithfulneſſe, into your ſpeedy and ſerious conſideration; and vouchſafe, that the money due to him for his <hi>Repaires, Diſburſements,</hi> and his <hi>Arrears</hi> (the price of his blood) may be forthwith paid; or, at leaſt, ſo much thereof, as may diſcharge his ingagements for the <hi>publike</hi>; being about 1400. l. and ſo much more, alſo, as may, once again, put him into ſome <hi>imployment,</hi> for his ſubſiſtance, before, that, which he hath in hope, be quite waſted, by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury,</hi> or his life, by time. And, be likewiſe pleaſed, to grant, that, the payment of the remainder, may be ſecured by an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> with intereſt for the ſame, untill the <hi>principall</hi> ſhall be diſcharged; or elſe, that in lieu of ſuch <hi>Intereſt,</hi> ſome <hi>Imployment,</hi>
(if he be thought worthy or capable of any, in this <hi>Kingdome</hi>) may be conferred upon him, whereby, without charge to the <hi>State,</hi> his <hi>Family</hi> may be fed, and his children edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the meane while, by his owne labours. Herein, your <hi>Wiſdome</hi> ſhall do an act of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and a work of <hi>Mercy</hi>; which, as this <hi>Petitioner</hi> is perſwaded, ſhall be improved to a bleſſing; redound as much to your honour, as, a <hi>free bounty,</hi> of greater ſums, conferred; give good contentment to all the <hi>well-affected,</hi> who ſhall heare thereof; enable this <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner,</hi> to perform ſome future ſervice, not altogether unworthy the deſired favour; and make the whole Kingdome hopefull, that, thoſe are, or, ſhall, ſuddenly (according to the generall deſire) be purged out of both Houſes, who have been the obſtructers of Juſtice, and the prolongers of our preſent miſeries. Howſoever it ſhall ſucceed, your ſaid <hi>Petitioner</hi>
will indeavour to reſt contented with Gods good pleaſure; to wait his leiſure, as patiently as he can; and, to pray for this Parliament, as in duty he is bound.</p>
