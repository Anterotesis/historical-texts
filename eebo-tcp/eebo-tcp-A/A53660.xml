            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Cause which these Papers Vindicate is not that of a Party, as some unthinking People may i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, but of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in General, which has been propagated and supported, in its most flourishing Branches, by the Ministry here pleaded for. The Ancient <hi>Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dois,</hi> or <hi>Waldenses,</hi> those eminent and faithful Witnesses against Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Usurpations, have had no other for near 500 years past<note n="*" place="margin">

Presbyters. These are they that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the first Fruits unto God; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Conduct of these the persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>WOMAN FLED</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ough a Sea of Blood <hi>into the Wilderness</hi>: by their Ministry she hath been <hi>fed and nourished,</hi> these make the first Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure among the <hi>Witnesses that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in Sackcloth</hi>; they have <hi>gone in mourning</hi> from one Generation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When others have assumed <hi>Beauty for Ashes,</hi> the <hi>Oyl of Ioy for mourning, the Garment of Praise for the Spirit of heaviness</hi>; these have been fed <hi>with the Bread of Tears,</hi> have been filled with bitterness, and made <hi>drunk with Wormwood.</hi> They have been <hi>Men of Sorrows,</hi> and <hi>acquainted with grief.</hi> They have been sore broken in the place of Dragons, and covered with the Shadow of Death, yet have they not forgotten the Name of their God, or stretched out their hand to a strange God.</p>
            <p>It's by the Ministry of these that the Truth prevailed, the Eyes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were opened, and vast Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes reduced to the Obedience of the Gospel. They seal'd their Ministry
<pb facs="tcp:60104:3"/>
with their Blood, and Heaven sealed it with the most glorious success.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Contra <hi>Waldens.</hi> cap. 4.</note> 
               <hi>Rainerius,</hi> one of their Tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, complains of them, that they had spread through all Countries, and crept into every Corner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Walsingham,</hi> our Country-man, tells us how the <hi>Lolards</hi> (as they were here called) had fill'd our Land,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Walsing.</hi> Hist. p. 339.</note> and had their Ministers <hi>Ordain'd by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters without Bishops:</hi> that they ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified these Ordinations, and asserted an inherent Power in Presbyters to put forth all Ecclesiastical Acts without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</p>
            <p>We may rationally presume that their practice was uniform in other Countries; and had we exact Records of their Church Administrations, we should find innumerable Instances of Ordination by Presbyters among them: but the account they give of themselves is so very imperfect, that had not their Enemies transmitted to Posterity a Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of their Actions and Sufferings (though very partially) we should have known little of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60104:4"/>We have no reason to think that those blessed Worthies did either al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Judgments, or supersede their Practice concerning Ordination by Presbyters; and therefore I take it for granted, that the same Ministry con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among them until the begining of the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Here in <hi>England</hi> several of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were eminently instrumental in promoting the Reformation, which gave them a deserved esteem in the thoughts of all good men, especially of the poor <hi>Lolards,</hi> to whom that great <hi>Change</hi> was a Resurrection from the dead.</p>
            <p>By this means the Bishops continued their stations in the Church, and were entrusted with the principal manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ordination, which their Popish Predecessors had ingrossed into their hands long before.</p>
            <p>But though Matters were thus set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, they were far from Claiming to themselves a superiour Power over Presbyters, or stamping a <hi>Ius Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> upon their Office. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the identity of Bishops and Presbyters, that Ordination by
<pb facs="tcp:60104:4"/>
Presbyters was valid, and that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy was a bare <hi>Constitution of the Civil Magistrate</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfl.</hi> Iren. p. 393.</note>, for the better go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning of the Church. All this will be fully proved in the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>Thus it was in <hi>England,</hi> but in the forreign Churches it was quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise; there the Bishops were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies to the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which gave the Presbyters an Opportunity of re-assuming their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent Power of Ordination, and of laying aside the pretended superiour Order of Bishops, as those who had appropriated to themselves the just Rights of Presbyters, and divested them of the inseparable Priviledges of their Order: and had been so far from answering the first design of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, of being <hi>a Remedy against Schism</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hier.</hi> in Ep. ad Tit.</note>, that partly by their Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Impositions, and partly by their boundless Ambition, they had misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly torn and divided the Christian Church for several Ages before, and contributed to the establishment of the usurping <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For these and other Reasons, they rejected Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb facs="tcp:60104:5"/>
from having any part in their Church-Government. This they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Presbyters, as their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Right<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>If a Popish Bishop happened to be Converted to the Protestant Religion, he was not capable of Exercising his Ministry among them, no not as a Presbyter, until he submitted to a new Ordination<note n="‖" place="margin">See <hi>La Rocque</hi>'s Conform. of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Establishment enraged the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prelates,</hi> and drew forth their strongest Efforts to assert their tottering Hierarchy, and to overthrow the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Ordinations.</p>
            <p>Therefore the principal and leading Antagonists we have to do with, in the present Controversie, are the <hi>Papists,</hi> especially the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> who with one Mouth condemn Ordinations by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
            <p>With us <hi>it's a very small thing that we should be judg'd of Man's day,</hi> we acquiesce in that Judgment which will dispense Rewards and Punishments, not according to the disputable Modes of

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE indispensible use of a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel Ministry must appear to such as at all consider, the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of Mankind in the way of Eternal Life, the innate aversion to the terms of Reconciliation with God, the Mystery of Gospel Revelations, the subtle and unwearied Attempts of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers against the Truth, the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to improvement in Grace and a Life according to the Rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity, which even they discern, who
<pb facs="tcp:60104:6"/>
are not utter Strangers to the Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of a Divine Power, by the Word, in the illumination of their Minds, and renovation of their Wills. Yea further, who would sustain the Labour and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of this holy Calling, or attend thereto with an assiduity requisite to the ends thereof, if not by Office obliged? Nay, how would it enervate our Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with Sinners, and abate that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance given to Believers by the Word and Sacraments, if we did not trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act between God and them, as cloathed with the Authority of Ambassadors, delegated by Christ thereto, and support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by his Presence and Power in our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations?</p>
            <p>The Lord Iesus, as Head of the Church, promiseth and dispenseth Gifts suitable to the Ministerial Office, and renders them so essential thereto, as that none can be duly admitted to this Trust, who are not in some good degree fit to teach, divide the Word aright, convince Gain-sayers; yea credibly appearing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to God, and concerned for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Men. No Ordainers can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
<pb facs="tcp:60104:7"/>
with the want of these; nor is the Ministerial Office conveighed by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Solemnities to any Man void of these Qualifications; though the best accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished may awfully say, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 2 Cor. 2. 16.</p>
            <p>The same holy Instituter of this Office <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath wisely provided against Intruders; and also for the encouragement of such as are capable, by subjecting Probationers ordinarily to the Enquiry and Iudgment of Men fit, and authorized to determine of their Call and Endowments, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest them in the Office of a Presbyter, by Fasting and Prayer, with imposition of Hands: the Authority and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of which Office are in the Scriptures adjusted by Christ, and can admit of no Change at the Will of the Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>
            <p>Reason directs that the Ordainers should be fit to judge of the necessary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of such as are proposed to this Charge: The Scriptures determine that the Ordainers be such as are invested and exercised in the same holy Office. And
<pb facs="tcp:60104:7"/>
who so capable to judge, or likely to be careful and faithful in their Admissions? These are appointed to make a Minister, though Churches are to elect who so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved shall be <hi>their</hi> Minister: Pastors invest in the Office, though the People do appropriate the more stated and usual Employment of the Officer. Confusion and a degenerate Ministry must ensue Mens attempting the Ministry, if they get but a good conceit of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or that particular Churches as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the sending forth Preachers, or making Ministers for themselves, unless in Cases very extraordinary.</p>
            <p>The Reverend Author in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatise hath no design to reflect on Episcopal Ordination, nor to raise any unseasonable Debates among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants. But being in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner assaulted as an Vsurper of the Ministerial Office, because separated thereto by the imposition of no Hands besides those of Presbyters. He here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in affirms, and I think with great Iudgment and Evidence proveth, That Presbyters, though no Prelates, are
<pb facs="tcp:60104:8"/>
authorized by the Lord Iesus to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain fit Persons to the Office of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and that the Ordination of such is valid. Many have successfully engaged in this Debate heretofore, yet thou wilt find some very considerable Addition to what occurs in most other Authors. It's not unworthy the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversion of all concerned for the meer being of Religion, that there is a general Attempt this day, not only against the Exercise of the Ministry in an aptitude to its end, but against the very Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry: many that widely differ in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, do yet center herein. The fordwardness of some to nullifie the Mission of their Brethren, conduceth as much thereto as any thing, except the Personal Faults of Ministers. Such decisions of the Subject in debate, yields no small Advantage to the Romish Hierarchy, whiles most Protestants are unchurched, and their Holy Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations arraigned as Nul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Vse and Efficacy of the Ministry. It's opposed by open Violence, false Teachers, Divisions; the last of which occasioned the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Vndertaking. The Case of Ordination by Presbyters stated.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Ministry of Reconciliation is that powerful Engine by which the strong Holds of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan are demolished, the Gates of Hell
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60104:10"/>
broken down, Sin's Captives reduced, and Trophies erected in honour of the victorious Prince of Peace. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation of the Gospel is the Glory of Nations, the Support of Christianity, the Shield of Truth, and the Triumph of the Cross. By this despised means Christ <hi>divides him a portion with the great,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 53. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and shares the spoil with the strong:</hi> by the foolishness of Preaching he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the Wise, and by weak earthen Vessels he breaks the Iron-Scepter of the Prince of the Power of the Air.</p>
            <p>For this reason it is that Gospel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters are so much opposed in the world, while the Prince of Darkness hath a Kingdom in it, he'l bend all his Forces against them, as Invaders of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and irreconcilable Enemies to his usurped Regiment.</p>
            <p>Many and various are his Serpentine Devices and repeated Stratagems to render their Endeavours of winning Souls ineffectual. Sometimes he assaults them by open Violence, he pours upon them the strength of Battel, to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing of their Persons, the spoiling of their Goods, the infringing of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and the sacrificing of their very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60104:10"/>
Lives to the insatiable Rage of unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Men.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 36, 37.</note> 
               <hi>They are killed all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the slaughter,</hi> and yet <hi>in all these things are more then Conquerors through him that loved them,</hi> and hath promised his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence with them to the end of Time: He holds the Stars in his right Hand, guides their Motions, and restores a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining World by their powerful Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>Their restless Adversary failing in his former method transforms himself into an Angel of Light, that he may more insensibly destroy the Angels of the Churches. What he cannot effect by Power, he will attempt by Craft. He'l send forth his daring Emissaries to undermine Preaching by Preaching. Thus the Adversaries of <hi>Iudah</hi> offered to build the Temple, that they might hinder the building of it. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies preached Christ <hi>of envy and strife,</hi> that they might obstruct his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Preaching. The Devil himself turns Preacher in the <hi>Pythonic</hi> Woman to scandalize the Apostle's Ministry. He emits Wolves in Sheeps cloathing to tear and devour the unwary Flock.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60104:11"/>If he be defeated in this Attempt, he'l <hi>make trial of skill</hi> in as pernicious a way as either of the former, to wit, by ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enating their Affections, and imbitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Spirits towards one another. He arms them with Weapons that are forreign to the nature of their warfare, he turns their Plow-shares into Swords, and makes Ambassadors of Peace to become Heralds of War, and the Fathers of <hi>Vnity</hi> Sons of Discord.<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11, 14.</note> Of all Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons those amongst Ministers have the saddest tendency; of all the Divisions of Ministers, those that concern their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterial Call are the most destructive.</p>
            <p>It is not strange that Romish Priests should Condemn all Reformed Ministers without distinction, that the spurious Offspring of the Scarlet Whore should conspire against the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that the Ministers of Antichrist should reject the Ministers of Christ. Their unmerited Condemnation is our Convincing Justification.</p>
            <p>But that which administers just cause of Sorrow, is to behold Protestant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters uncharitably Arraigning one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Some unthinking Dissenters ignorantly condemn <hi>all that are Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60104:11"/>
by Bishops as no Ministers of Christ,</hi> not considering that thereby they nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie their own Baptism, which most of them received from Episcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; if they are but meer Lay-men, their Baptism is no Baptism, and ought to be repeated in the Judgment of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. This Principle naturally leads to Anabaptism.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some Dignitaries of the Church of <hi>England</hi> condemn all that <hi>are not Ordained by Bishops as no Ministers,</hi> and so they Anathematize all the Reformed Churches that have no Bishops; they affirm their Ministry and Sacraments to be meer Nullities, and that there is no Salvation to be had in their Communion; and therefore that it is safer to continue in the Roman Church: as if the empty Name of a Bishop were more necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then an interest in the great Bishop of our Souls, the Lord Jesus; and an Idolatrous Heretical Church under the Conduct of Antichristian Bishops, were preferrable to an Evangelical Orthodox Church without them. But these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judges that pass a damnatory Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon the greatest, if not the best
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60104:12"/>
part of the Reformed Churches are worthily deserted by all sober and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Church-men.</p>
            <p>Others of that Communion own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by Presbyters without Bishops to be valid, but they look upon them as Schismatical, where Bishops may be had. We have no Controversie with these about the validity of Ordination by Presbyters, but about the Charge of Schism, which we conceive falls upon the Imposers of unscriptural Conditions of Ordination.</p>
            <p>Others allow Ordinations by Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Forreign Churches, who have no Bishops; but they Censure such Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations for Nullities, where Bishops may be had, as in <hi>England.</hi> Our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Controversie is with these. For the stating of the Point in difference, we'l consider, 1. Wherein we are agreed; 2. Wherein the real difference lies.</p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Our Agreement.</head>
               <p>We agree,</p>

               <p n="2">2. We agree that the Ministry is a standing Office to continue in the Christian Church to the end of Time, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.</p>

               <p>In these things which comprehend all the Essentials of the Ministry, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60104:13"/>
more, we are fully agreed.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <p>The main difference is about the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Ordaining. We say, Ordination may be perform'd by meer Presbyters. Some of our Brethren of the Episcopal Persuasion say, That no Ordinations are valid but such as are done by Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishops. The common Cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Protestant dissenting Ministers is, That they are no true Ministers of Christ, but Intruders and false Prophets. And why so? Not because they are not Orthodox in their Doctrine, for they have subscribed all the Doctrinal Articles of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> Nor can they charge them with Insufficiency or Scandal, for they are generally Persons of approved Abilities, exemplary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations, and great Industry in the Lord's Vineyard, who seek not their own things, but the things of Christ. They are willing to be tried by the Characters of Gospel Ministers. Where lies the defect then? why in this, they are not Ordained by <hi>Bishops.</hi> They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive not their Power from such Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans as pretend to an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession down from the Apostles. They were Ordained by meer Presbyters that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60104:13"/>
have not the Ordaining Power, and none can communicate that to another which he hath not in himself.</p>
               <p>Our Case then in short is this, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordination by meer Presbyter's, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Diocesan Bishops, be valid.</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion needs but little Explanation.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Ordination,</hi> I mean the setting of Persons apart by Imposition of Hands for the Sacred Office of the Ministry.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Presbyters,</hi> I understand Gospel Ministers, who are called to the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of Souls, and to whom the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven are committed.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Diocesan Bishops</hi> I intend that Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Church Officers which claim to themselves a Superior Power of Order and Jurisdiction above Presbyters, and to be the sole Pastors of several hundreds of Congregations, having Parish Priests under them who have no Power of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline in the Church.</p>
               <p>By <hi>valid,</hi> I mean not what the Old Canons make so, but what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures determine to be so. Those Sacred Oracles which are of Divine Inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not Arbitrary Canons of weak Men's devising, are the Foundation of our Faith, and the infallible Standard by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60104:14"/>
which Truth and Errour must be tried.</p>
               <p>The Question being thus explained, I affirm,</p>
               <q>That such as are set apart with Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Hands for the Office of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry by Gospel Ministers, without the Species of Church Officers who claim a superior Power over Presbyters, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly Ordained, and their Ordination is valid according to the Scriptures.</q>
               <p>This Truth I hope to demonstrate by the following Arguments.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Presbyters have power to Ordain, because they are Scripture Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. The Syriac Translation useth not different Names. If there be a difference, the prebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence belongs to the Presbyter. Objection concerning <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> answered. <hi>1.</hi> The Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits urge this against the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants. <hi>2.</hi> The Scripture doth not call them Bishops. <hi>3.</hi> The Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ephesus</hi> was in the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that Church. <hi>4.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not mention <hi>Timothy</hi> in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> as he doth in other Epistles. <hi>5.</hi> When St. <hi>Paul</hi> took his last leave of them, he made no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Timothy</hi> for his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, though he were present.

               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>THAT Ordination which hath all the Scripture requisits is valid,<note place="margin">Arg. 1.</note> but Ordination by Presbyters hath all the Scripture requisits, Therefore—The Major is undeniable to Persons that own the inspired Writings to be a perfect Rule. The Minor I thus prove: The Scripture requisits of Ordination, are some in the Ordainers, some in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, some in the Circumstances of Ordination. As to the Ordained, they must have such Qualifications as the Scripture requires 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.... These we are willing to be tried by. As to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances there must be Examination, Approbation, publick and solemn setting
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60104:15"/>
apart by imposition of Hands, with Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prayer. As to the Ordainers, 'tis enough that they were Presbyters, and as such had an inherent Power to Ordain; for according to Scripture, a Bishop and a Presbyter are one and the same, not only in Name, but in Office. The Elders or Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> are call'd Bishops of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to whom the sole over-sight of that Church did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 17, 28.

            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60104:16"/>The Scriptures own but two Orders of ordinary Church Officers, Bishops and Deacons<note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim, 3.

               <note n="†" place="margin">Acts 20. 17, 28.</note>. To be sure then, they were not Bishops of the English Species, <hi>i. e.</hi> sole Governors of many Churches, but Presbyters in a proper sence; many of which were Ordain'd in every Church, <hi>Antioch</hi> it self not excepted<note n="‖" place="margin">Acts 14. 21, 22, 23.</note> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles gave that Church no Primacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove <hi>Lystra</hi> and <hi>Iconium,</hi> but settled the same sort of Officers in all.

            <p>The <hi>Syriac</hi> Translation, which is so very ancient, that it comes nearest in time to the Original, useth not two words, one for Bishop, another for Presbyter, as our Translation and the Greek, but it hath only <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>If there be any distinction between a Bishop and a Presbyter, the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence must be given by the Scripture to the Presbyters; for as our Bishops say, their Office distinct from Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is to Rule and Govern, and the Office of a Presbyter is to Preach and Administer the Sacraments.

he had not been there at that time, how comes <hi>Paul</hi> to be so regardless (when he concluded he should never see their Faces any more<note n="*" place="margin">Ib. v. 25.</note>) as not to name his Successor? was he only ignorant of the prophecies concerning <hi>Timothy</hi>

If he had not been qualified for this Office now, he might have given the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> some hints concerning the Prophecies that went before on him, of his future usefulness as a Bishop in that Church. But why should any imagine so worthy a Person not qualified for this Undertaking? He that was qualified to be the Apostle's Messenger to so many Churches<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 17.

He told the Elders of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> at <hi>Miletus,</hi> that <hi>he had not spar'd to declare unto them all the Counsel of God.</hi> How can this be, when he neglects to inform them about his ordinary Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor?
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60104:21"/>
If Ministry and Churches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this Succession, 'twas no small part of the <hi>Counsel of God</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd unto them. He tells them <hi>he knew they should never see his face any more</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Acts 20. 25.</note>. Whether he did see them again, or no, is not material to the point.

            </argument>
            <p>THAT Ordination of which we have Scripture Examples is valid,<note place="margin">Arg. II.</note> but of Ordination by Presbyters we have Scripture Examples, therefore Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Presbyters is valid. The Major I hope will not be denied, it carries its own Evidence with it to such as are willing to be guided by the practise of Apostolical Churches, which is the first, and best Antiquity. The Minor I thus prove, St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60104:29"/>
by Presbyters, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2, 3. so was <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.</p>
            <p>These two Instances deserve a more particular consideration. Concerning the first, in <hi>Acts</hi> 13. these two things are evident: 1. That <hi>Luke</hi> speaks of Ordination, he mentions the separating of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to a Ministerial Work, by Fasting and Prayer, with the Laying on of Hands; and what more can be done in Ordination? It's true, they had an extraordinary Call before, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.1. yet being now to plant the Gospel among the Gentiles, they enter upon their Work at the ordinary Door of Ordination.<note place="margin">Vol. 1. p. 289.</note> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> thinks it was for this reason, <hi>That the Lord here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by might set down a Plat-form of Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ministers to the Church of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to future times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Ordainers were Prophets and Teachers, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1, 2. Now Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ordinary Presbyters, who are distinguished from Prophets and other extraordinary Officers, both in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. and in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12.

               <hi>Turrianus</hi> the Jesuit thinks to avoid the force of this quotation, by affirming the Prophets
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60104:29"/>
mentioned in this Ordination to have been Bishops, and the Teachers to have been meer Presbyters, and that these Presbyters were <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> who were now created Bishops. But this is a most ridiculous evasion. Was St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the chief of Apostles, but a meer Presbyter? was he inferior to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius, Niger,</hi> and <hi>Manaen?</hi> Apostles were superior to Prophets, much more to Teachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. The Prophets here could not be Bishops, because they were extraordinary Officers, and there were more then one in this Church, and in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.29. Neither is there any ground in the Text of this distribution, that Teachers should refer to the Ordained, and Prophets to the Ordainers. This is a meer fiction of the Jesuit to support the Cause of Prelacy.</p>
            <p>If any say, This separation of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> was not to the Office of the Ministry, but to a special Exercise of it. I answer, it doth not alter the Case: For here are all the outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of an Ordination properly so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, Fasting, Prayer, with Imposition of Hands to a Ministerial Work. Now the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60104:30"/>
Question is, Who have power to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form these Actions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here the Presbyters do it. They to whom all the outward Actions of Ordination belong, to them the Ordaining Power belongs, as he that hath power to wash a Child with Water in the Name of the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, hath power to Baptize; for what else is baptizing, but washing with Water in the Name of the Sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for special Dedication to God? He that hath power to set apart Bread and Wine for Sacramental use, hath power to Administer the Lord's Supper: So here, they that have power to dedicate Persons to God for the Work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry by Fasting, Prayer, and Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands, have power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It's true, a Lay-Patron may give one power to exercise his Ministry, that cannot give the Office; but can he do this by repeating all the solemn Acts of Ordination? Can he use the same form of Ordination with the Ordaining Bishop? Can he lay hands upon the Person ordained, and by Fasting and Prayer devote him to God in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation? I think none will affirm it. If he cannot invest a Person
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60104:30"/>
by repeating the whole form of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because he is a Lay-man, and hath not the Ordaining Power, therefore they that can use the form of Ordination have power to Ordain. The Bishops would not like it, if all those that are Ordained by them in <hi>Scotland</hi> should be declared uncapable of Exercising their Office there, until they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a Classis of Presbyters with solemn Imposition of Hands. It would scarce satisfie them to say, That the Presbyters imposed Hands only to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power the Person in the Exercise of his Office, and not to give the Office it self, when they performed all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Actions of Ordination, which are the ordinary means of conveying the Office.</p>
            <p>I proceed to the second Instance of Ordaining Presbyters mentioned in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, with the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery.</hi> Here <hi>Timothy</hi> is Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Presbytery; nothing can be more express then this Testimony.

               </gap>—do equally imply an instrumental efficiency. For all Ordainers are Ministerial Deliverers of Possession, and none of them princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal efficient Donors, Christ is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Giver of the Ministerial Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by his Law, which is the <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum Iuris.</hi> As the King's Charter to a Corporation determines who shall be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being Mayor, how he shall be chosen, and how invested, here the Mayor's Power is immediately from the King's Charter, as the efficient constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Instrument, and all that others do is but to determine of the Recipient, and

Invest him: so the Lord Jesus Christ hath hath in his Law determined the Office of the Ministry, the qualifications of the Persons, and how they are to be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the Work, all that belongs to the Ordainers is but ministerialty to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest a capable Recipient.

            <argument>
               <p>Presbyters have power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they have power to Preach, Baptize, and Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister the Lord's Supper. These are not inferior to Ordination, proved from the Nature of these Acts, from Christ's Commission, from the Sense of the Ancients. <hi>Object.</hi> The Apostles reserved Ordination to themselves and Successors. <hi>Answ. 1.</hi> They joyned the Presbyters with them. 2. The Apostles as such had no Successors, prov'd from the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiars of their Office, from the the Testimonies of <hi>Sadeel, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Lightfoot.</hi> Another Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction answered.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THey who have power to Preach the Gospel,<note place="margin">Arg. III.</note> to Baptize, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Lord's Supper, have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:60104:35"/>
of Ordination, but meer Presbyters have power to Preach, Baptize, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Lord's Supper, therefore they have power of Ordination.</p>
            <p>The Major only requires proof, which I thus prove; Preaching, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and Administring the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are Ministerial Acts not of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Nature to Ordination, <hi>&amp; parium par est ratio.</hi> That they are not inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to Ordination appears both from the nature of the thing, and from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It appears,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. From the nature of the thing it self. Let us consider each apart: As to Preaching the Gospel Authoritatively in the Name of Christ, it's a most glorious Ordinance; the Publishers of it are called Ambassadors for Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. And is an Ordainer any thing more? In the Act of Preaching they represent the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Prophet of the Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 40. and can any thing be more honourable? They are said to be workers together with God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. and is an Ordainer more then this?</p>
            <p>As to Baptism, It's a solemn dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Person to God; Ordination
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60104:35"/>
is no more; only the former is to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity as such, the latter to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar work. In this, Baptism hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, for it is a Sacramental Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Ordination is not.</p>
            <p>In the Lord's Supper, the Minister sets apart Bread and Wine, as Symboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Representations of Jesus Christ, who is exhibited with all his Benefits to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receivers. <hi>Ierom</hi> saith of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Ad quorum preces, Corpus &amp; San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Christi conficitur.</hi> Now which is greater, to impose Hands, or to make the Sacramental Body and Blood of Christ? If they have power to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate holy Things, why not holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons also?</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. It will appear from Scripture that the Ministerial Acts now mentioned are not inferiour to Ordination. When St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>That Christ did not send him to baptize, but to preach the Gospel,</hi> surely he means one of the highest Ministerial Acts, else he would have said, <hi>Christ sent me, neither to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, nor to preach, but to ordain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</hi> I would fain know, whether Christ did not mention the chiefest parts of a Ministers work in the Commission
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60104:36"/>
given in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19, 20. <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> If Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation had been the main and chiefest part, he would have said, <hi>Go, ordain Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, preach, and baptize.</hi> Christ's not mentioning it, is an Argument that it is not the principal part of a Minister's Office, but rather subordinate to preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing, and therefore inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here, as the lesser in the greater, though not expressed. A Commission usually specifies the Principal Acts which a Person is impower'd to do, when others of an inferiour Nature may be implied. Commissions do dot run <hi>à minori ad majus,</hi> a superiour Office may include the Duties of an Inferiour, but not on the contrary. It is the rather to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed Christ would have mentioned the Ordaining Power in the Ministers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, if it had been superiour to Preaching and Baptizing, because the Commission was immediately directed to the Apostles, whose Successors Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan Bishops pretend to be, and from whom they derive the Ordaining Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as proper to themselves.</p>
            <p>It may be, it will be said, That ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Lord's Supper is not
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:60104:36"/>
mentioned in their Commission, though it be not inferiour to Preaching and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing. True, but the not mentioning of it, is an Argument it is not a greater Ministerial Act then those that are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and that it is not to be Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred by Officers superiour to those that Preach and Baptize, but that the same Persons may Preach, Baptize, and Administer the Lord's Supper. The same I say of Ordination, it's not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expressed here is a sign it is not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then those Ministerial Acts that are mentioned, and that they that have power to Preach and Baptize, have also to Ordain. Though this Objection be grounded on a Mistake of the Text, for the Lord's Supper is mentioned in the following words of the Commission, <hi>Teaching them to observe all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I have commanded you,</hi> among which the Lord's Supper is one, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 26, 27.</p>

               </note>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is to beg the Question. We have proved already that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles reserved not the Power of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to themselves, but joyned the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters with them. Nor are the Bishops the Apostles Successors as such, for the Apostles had their Call immediately from Heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1. had extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary qualifications, could confer the Holy Ghost, were infallibly assisted in their Ministerial Conduct, and were U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Officers, none of which can belong to Diocesan Bishops. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were not tied to any one Nation, Province, or City; they were to preach the Gospel to all Nations; but they or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained Presbyters or Bishops in every Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. or City, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. to whom they committed the ordinary Government of the Church: These were not sent to preach the Gospel to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Nations, but to feed the particular Flock, over which the Holy Ghost made them Bishops, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Now these stated particular, and fixed Church-Officers
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60104:37"/>
vastly differ from universal, unlimited, and unfixed Officers. You may as well say, that a petty Constable, whose power is confined to the narrow limits of a little Village, succeeds the King, who governs a whole Kingdom. When I see Bishops immediately sent of God, infallibly assisted by the Holy Ghost, travelling to the remotest King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to preach the Gospel in their own Language to the Infidel Nations, and confirming their Doctrine by undoubted Miracles, I shall believe them to be the Apostles true Successors in the Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Office.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>The Ordinations of the greater part of the Reformed Churches are by Presbyters. Their not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving superiour Bishops cannot unchurch them; nor is it a Case of Necessity, as is pretended by some: For, <hi>1.</hi> They might have Bishops if they would. <hi>2.</hi> Some of them refused them, when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. <hi>3.</hi> Their Learned Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters assert an inherent Power in Presbyters to Ordain, and never use this Plea of Necessity. <hi>4.</hi> Their Confessions make all Ministers equal.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THAT Ordination which is the same with the Ordinations in the Reformed Churches beyond Sea,<note place="margin">Arg.IV.</note> is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, but such is Ordination by meer Presbyters, Therefore — If theirs be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60104:39"/>
null, and the Roman or Popish Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions valid, then it's better be of the Roman Popish Church, then of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; but the Consequence is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd.</p>
            <p>I know but two things can be replied to this Argument:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Reformed Churches have no true Ministers, for want of Episcopal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Ordination. Thus Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who would have us believe the Romish Church to be a true Church, and receive the Pope as the Patriarch of the West. These Gentlemen have cast off their Vizard, and give us to know what they would be at. They condemn the forreign Reformed Churches as no Churches, their Sacraments as no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and consequently no Salvation to be had in their Communion. Like the <hi>Donatists</hi> of old, they confine Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to their own Party and Way. It's unaccountable that any who call themselves Protestants, should unchurch the greatest and purest part of Reform'd Christians in favour of a Despotick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, which hath no foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the best Antiquity. The being of Ministry and Churches must depend
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60104:40"/>
upon a few Men, who look more like State-Ministers, then Ministers of Christ, and are generally more busie in managing Intrigues of Government, then <hi>in preaching the word in season and out of season.</hi> Can any imagine that such Pastors as rarely preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, as not above once in three years visit their Flock, that have many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of Souls under their charge whose Faces they never saw, that assume to themselves a Grandeur more agreeable to the Princes of the World,<note place="margin">Matth. 20. 25, 26.</note> then to the Simplicity and Humility required in the Ministers of the Gospel, that entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle themselves with the Affairs of this Life,<note place="margin">2 T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m. 2.4. Can. Ap.7. &amp; 80.</note> contrary to the Scriptures and the Old Canons: I say, can any imagine such Pastors to be so necessary to the Church, that there must be neither Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, nor Sacraments, nor Worship of God, nor Salvation without them? O happy <hi>Rome!</hi> O miserable Reformed Churches! if the Case be thus.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others that are more moderate, say, The Case of the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches is a Case of Necessity, they have no Bishops, nor can have them. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations by meer Presbyters may be lawful, where Bishops cannot be had.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:60104:40"/>I answer, 1 The Case of the forreign <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Churches is no Case of Necessity; for if they have a mind of Bishops, what hinders their having of them? Is it the Magistrates? It cannot be said of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Switzerland, Geneva,</hi> &amp;c. where they have Magistrates of their own. Suppose <hi>France,</hi> and some other places, would not have admitted of it, that should have been no bar to the Order, if they had been desirous of it. The primitive Christians were under Heathen Magistrates for three hundred years, who were generally professed Enemies to the Ministry and Churches, yet they wanted no Ministerial Order of Christ's appointment. Christ never appointed an Order of Ministers in his Church, which may not be had in the most dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult times. It's true, if the Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate be against Bishops, it may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse their Lordly greatness, but it need not prejudice their <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> if they have any. Why cannot the Apostles Successors subsist with as little depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon Authority, as the Apostles themselves did? Do Spiritual Men need Carnal Weapons to defend their Order? yet it cannot be denied, but that even
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60104:41"/>
in <hi>France</hi> the Protestants had their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, and a Polity of their own, by virtue of the <hi>Edict of Nants,</hi> which enabled them, had they pleas'd, to get Diocesan Bishops. They had their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods for Church Government, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators to preside in them; and why not Bishops also, had they judged them necessary? Nor is it to be supposed that their French Masters would have liked them the worse, for conforming to their own Ecclesiastical Government. <hi>Thua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> a moderate Papist, thinks it was an Errour in their Constitution, that they neglected the superiour Order of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in their first Reformation, for the supporting of their interest. The want of them did not prejudice their Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the Truth, as appears by their late Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Time hath been when the French Churches were earnestly sollicited, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by Bishop <hi>Morton,</hi> to receive a Clergy by the Ordination of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Bishops, which they refused.</p>

he pleads, That if he had laid the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence on that foundation, the French Churches would have silenced him.</hi>

            <p>Now if the Ordinations of such u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surping Monsters as these, that have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the empty name of Bishops, be valid, as the Church of <hi>England</hi> saith they are; how much more are the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations of Orthodox faithful Gospel Ministers or Bishops, to be judg'd law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful?
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60104:45"/>
Can any thing be more absurd then that the Ministers of Antichrist, should make true Ministers, and the Ministers of Christ make false Prophets by one and the same Ordaining Act. It's the received Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> that the Pope is Antichrist. See Homily against Idolatry, part 3. <hi>p.</hi> 69. and the sixth part of the Sermon against Rebellion, <hi>p.</hi> 316.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They derive their Power from the Pope, who hath no right to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Headship, either from Scripture or true Antiquity. The very Office of a Pope is contrary to the Prerogative and Laws of Christ, and consequently is a most Treasonable Usurpation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">II.</note> II. The manner of their Ordaining is Unscriptural and Superstitious<note n="*" place="margin">Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Rom.</note>. They ascend to the Priesthood by several Steps or Degrees, which have no footsteps in the Sacred Writings. They make them</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) <hi>Ostiarij,</hi> or Door-keepers, whose Office is to ring the Bell, to open the Church-Vestry, and the Priest's Book. <hi>Espencaeus</hi>
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Esp.</hi> in 1 Tim. p. 226. g.</note> a Popish Writer, sheweth out of <hi>Chrysostom</hi> that it belong'd to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Deacon, to admit into the Church, and shut out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:60104:45"/>Then (2.) they make them <hi>Lectores,</hi> Readers, whose work is to read and sing the Lessons, and to bless the Bread and all the first Fruits. In the primitive Church this was not a distinct Office, for in some places 'twas the Office of a Deacon, in some, of the Minister, and in some, it belonged to the Bishops to read the Scriptures, especially on Festivals.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) The next step is that of <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists,</hi> whose pretended Office is to cast out Devils, in a feigned imitation of the miraculous Operations of the first Ages of Christianity. These <hi>Sacred Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> who take upon them to dispossess Devils, are inferiour to the very Deacons that serve Tables, and yet equal to the very Apostles, were they able to perform what they undertake. Though one would wonder, why the Bishops, the pretended Successors of the Apostles, did not reserve to themselves the power of casting out unclean Spirits, as well as that of confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the H. Spirit, which, as they say, none but themselves can do. But these <hi>Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cists</hi> are Men of that extraordinary pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that they out-do the very Apostles, for they did not cast out Devils by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, as these pretend to do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:60104:46"/>The Bishop tells them that they are <hi>Spirituales Imperatores ad abjiciendos Daemones de Corporibus obsessis</hi>

            <p n="4">(4.) The next degree is that of the <hi>Acolythi</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="margin">Pontif. de ord. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colyth.</note>, whose Office is to be Taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, to light Candles, to bring Wine and Water for the Eucharist. They who were <hi>Spiritual Emperours</hi> a little before to conquer Devils, are now degraded, (which yet must be called an advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to the mean occupation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Servitors. The badge of their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is a <hi>Candlestick</hi> and <hi>a Pot,</hi> which are delivered to them by the Bishop. As he delivers the Candlestick, he saith, <hi>Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite cero-ferarium, &amp; sciatis vos ad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendenda Ecclesiae lumina mancipari.</hi>... And as he delivers the Pot, he saith, <hi>Accipite urceolum ad suggerendum vinum &amp; aquam in Eucharistiam Sanguinis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti</hi> ....</p>
            <p n="5">(5.) They climb after this to the degree of <hi>Sub-deacons</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Pontif. de ord. Subd.</note>, whose business is to prepare Water for the Ministry of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60104:46"/>
the Altar, to Minister to the Deacons, to wash the Palls of the Corporals, to present the Cup and Paten for the use of their abominable Sacrifice. The Bishop puts a Garment upon their Heads to signifie the Castigation of the Speech, and then puts the <hi>Manipulus</hi> upon their left Arm, to signifie Good Works, <hi>ib.</hi> After this he cloaths them with a Coat, to signifie Joy and Gladness, <hi>ibid.</hi> Last of all, he delivers to them the Book of Epistles to be read for the Living and the Dead, <hi>ibid.</hi> The Sub-deacons of old were but Letter-Carriers to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Espen.</hi> in Tim. p. 214.a.</note>.</p>
            <p n="6">(6.) Then they make them <hi>Deacons</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="margin">Ib. de Ord. Diac.</note>, whose Office is to Minister at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to Baptize and Preach, after the example of <hi>Stephen,</hi> as is pretended.

            </p>
            <p n="7">(7.) From Deacons<note n="‖" place="margin">Pontif. de Ord. Presb.</note> they ascend to the Order of <hi>Priesthood.</hi> The Form of making them is very ridiculous:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60104:47"/>
scarce any footsteps of the Apostolical Practice to be found in it.</p>
            <p>The Person to be Ordained presents himself to the Bishop with a multitude of superstitious Rags, such as the <hi>Alb, Cingulum, Stola,</hi> the <hi>Manipulus,</hi> the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta, &amp;c.</hi> holding a Candle in his right hand, to signifie he must be a shining Light to the People. Then the Bishop binds the <hi>Stole</hi> about his neck, to put him in mind of the Yoke of Christ, <hi>ib.</hi> After this the <hi>Capsula</hi> being folded, is put over his Shoulders to denote Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the Bishop unfolds it again, and cloaths the Priest with it, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Innocence, <hi>ib.</hi> The same white Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment signifies Charity when 'tis folded up, and Innocency when 'tis unfolded. You must not ask the reason of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent signification, for profound My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries are wrapt up in all the foldings of this sacred Garment, <hi>which is apt to stir up the dull mind of Man to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they have adorn'd them in this beggarly Garment, and made them look partly like those Priests that serv'd the old Tabernacle, and partly like those that ministred at Heathen Altars, they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60104:47"/>
anoint their Hands with Oyl, greasing them with the sign of the Cross, and adding these words, <hi>Consecrentur .... istae manus ... ut quaecunque benedixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, benedicantur.</hi> The Bishop also shaves their Heads, saying, <hi>Dominus pars haereditatis meae</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Pontif. de Cler. faciend.</note>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Learned Authors tell us of unaccountable My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries that are contained in this Pagan Ceremony. <hi>Lombard</hi> saith, the shaven Crown signifies Kingly Dignity<note n="†" place="margin">Mag.

The same Author adds, That <hi>Denudatio Capitis est revelatio mentis; Clericus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim secretorum Dei non ignarus esse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet.</hi>... And no wonder their shave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Priests are such great Clerks, since shaving the Pate is the mysterious Path to Knowledge.

            <p>How different is this Form of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the Scripture-Ordinations? Ministers in the Apostles times were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by Fasting and Prayer, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands, without any other Ceremonies that we read of. Let the World judge, whether our Ordinations, which follow the Scripture Pattern, or the Romish Ordinations, which are a meer Pageantry, are the better; and if theirs be admitted as valid, why should ours be condemned?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:60104:48"/>Shall they who pass under such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural Forms and Shapes of <hi>Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers, Readers, Exorcists, &amp;c.</hi> be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Ministers of Christ, and must those who vary not from the Scriptures in their Ordinations, be reckon'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders? Can any of the sincere Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of the Protestant Interest pass such a partial unjust Censure? Are they true Ministers, who recede from the Apostles practice as far as the East is from the West, and must those be none who make it their Rule? Shall those Ordinations which are Humane and Antichristian (and therefore laid aside in the Church of <hi>England</hi>) be received, and theirs which are Divine and Apostolical be rejected?

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> will be deny'd (that though they impose Hands they have not the Ordaining Power) I thus prove it; That which is an Ordaining Act bespeaks an Ordaining Power; but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of Hands in Ordination is an Ordaining Act, therefore \h. The <hi>Major</hi> is evident, for <hi>Actus praesupponit potentiam.</hi> As to the <hi>Minor,</hi> If imposing of Hands in Ordination be not <hi>Actus ordinans,</hi> what is it? I should be glad to see one Instance given in the Apostles times of Persons laying on Hands in Ordination, that had no Ordaining Power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:60104:54"/>If imposition of Hands in Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be no evidence of an Ordaining Power, how come the Bishops to urge that Scripture (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Lay hands suddenly on no man</hi>) in favour of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordaining Power, and thence to infer he was Bishop of <hi>Ephesus? Timothy</hi> might lay Hands for Ordination, and yet have no Ordaining Power, and so be no Bishop of <hi>Ephesus.</hi> Thus they unwarily undermine their own Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>It's a meer <hi>Subterfuge,</hi> and indeed such as betrays the Cause, to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Presbyters may perform all the outward Acts of Ordination, but not as Ordainers. 'Tis as if one should say, a Presbyter hath Power to apply Water to a Child in Baptism in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but he hath no power to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize. He may set apart Bread and Wine, and distribute it to the People according to Christ's Institution; but he hath no power to Administer the Lord's Supper.</p>
            <p>If Presbyters imposing of Hands sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie no Ordaining Power, what doth it signifie? <hi>Turrianus</hi> the Jesuit saith it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:60104:54"/>
signifies their Approbation of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops act—<hi>non Excludantur Presbyteri ab impositione manûs approbante, sed ab ordinante.</hi> He is followed herein by many of our own. Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>

                  <hi>Heyl.</hi> Hist. of <hi>Ep.</hi> p. 162.</note> saith, <hi>The Presbyters Hands confer nothing of the power of Order upon the Party or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, but only testifie their consent unto the business, and approbation of the man.</hi> To the same purpose speaks Dr. <hi>I.

But that cannot be the meaning of it; for they could signifie their approbation some other way, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out imposition of Hands; their saying <hi>Amen</hi> to the Ordination Prayer would be a sufficient expression of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. The Peoples approbation was required in primitive Ordinations<note n="‖" place="margin">

               <hi>I think rather they dedicate him to God for the Ministry, which is conferred on him by the Bishop.</hi> This specious Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is equally disserviceable to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Point, with the former. Where in all the <hi>New Testament</hi> have we any ground for this distinction? How can it be said that the Ministry is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Bishop first, and afterwards the Presbyters dedicate the Person to God, when both Bishops and Presbyters do lay Hands together; Can he be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and dedicated to God as two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Acts, the one inferiour to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that in the same moment of time, by the same Ceremony of Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Hands, and by the same words?</p>
            <p>How comes the Bishops Hand to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Ministry more then the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters? not by any inherent virtue in the one more then in the other; not from any Institution of Christ or his Apostles, appropriating an Ordaining, or Minisher making Power to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Hand, and a bare dedication to the Ministry actually conferred, to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters Hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60104:55"/>The Scriptures of the <hi>New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> make no mention of such distinct significations of that Ceremony, and therefore they cannot be <hi>ex instituto</hi>; and it's plain they are not <hi>ex naturâ rei.</hi> Might not the Presbyters dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Person to God without the laying on of Hands? Can there be no dedication to God without laying Hands on the Persons so dedicated? The whole Church dedicates him to God by Prayer, and yet don't lay on Hands, so that meer dedication to God in the Learned Bishop's sense as distinct from Ordination, cannot be the meaning of this Ceremony.</p>
            <p>But, I pray, what is Ordination it self but a dedication of the Person to God for the Ministry? what more doth the Bishop do in conferring the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry? He cannot confer it by a meer Physical Contact, if so, every touch of his Hand on the Head of a Man, Woman, or Child would make them Ministers. It must be therefore by a Moral Act that he doth it, <hi>i. e.</hi> by laying on Hands on a fit Person accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the appointment of God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate him to God for the Ministry.

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I prove: Either Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is an Act of the Exercise of the Power of the Keys, or of some other Power, but of no other; If any other, it's either of a Secular Power, or of an

Ecclesiastical; but neither of these: Not an Ecclesiastical, for there is no Ecclesiastical Power, (at least, which Ordination can be pretended to belong to) but the Power of the Keys; not of a Secular Power, for that belongs not to Ministers.</p>
            <p>That the Keys do contain in them the Power of Ordination is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by Papists and Protestants, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly by <hi>Cornelius à Lapide, Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius, Bucer, Chamier.

            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> I thus prove; Christ gave the Keys together, and did not divide them, therefore they that have the Key of Doctrine have the Key of Jurisdiction and Order. <hi>To thee I give the Keys,</hi> saith our Lord, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. <hi>Io.</hi> 20.23. He did not give one Key to one, and both to another; he gives no <hi>single Key</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Person, but <hi>Keys,</hi> and so whatever these Keys serve for. We know no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of the Keys, but what is grounded upon Scripture.</p>
            <p>He that hath the Keys of a House or Castle delivered to him, hath power to admit or exclude Persons, as he seeth cause. Except there be a Limitation in his Order or Commission, his power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all Persons without exception.

            <p>ORders conferred by such as are in Orders,<note place="margin">Arg.

            <p>As to the <hi>Major,</hi> it's founded on that Maxim frequently used by Arch-Bishop <hi>Vsher, Ordinis est conferre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ordines,</hi> a Man that is in Orders, <hi>quoad Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum,</hi> may <hi>coeteris paribus</hi> confer Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, it being like Generation, or Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocal Causation.

            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60104:62"/>If among the Papists Men of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Order do make the Pope, and among our selves Bishops do make Arch-Bishops; how much more may Men of the same Order give what they have, that is, <hi>Ordinem Sacerdotii,</hi> as the School-men call it. Why may not Presbyters make Presbyters, as Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians make Physicians? All Ranks or Orders of Beings generate their own kind, but the impotent Order of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters must prove extinct, if the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Influences of a superiour Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der do not propagate it, by a sort of equivocal Generation. Must Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters be reckoned amongst those Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in Nature that cannot perpetuate themselves by Propagation?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor,</hi> That Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters have the power of Order equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will be acknowledged by most Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants and Papists. The Scripture no where mentions any distinction of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der among ordinary Ministers.

in the same Instant, by the same words, and by the same actions.

            <p>The truth is, this Notion of the <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> of Episcopacy, as a superiour Order, was first promoted in the Church of <hi>England</hi> by Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud.</hi> Dr. <hi>Holland,</hi> the King's Professor of Divinity in <hi>Oxon,</hi> was much offended with Dr. <hi>Laud,</hi> for asserting it in a Disputation for his Degrees, he checked him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and told him, <hi>He was a Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and went about to make a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion between the English and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed

Churches.</hi> This Prelate had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured his Tongue to say, <hi>Ecclesia Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and <hi>Turba Genevensis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cressy,</hi> who apostatized to the <hi>Romish</hi> Church,<note place="margin">Exomolog. c.7. p.37.</note> conceives that the reason <hi>why Episcopacy took no firm rooting in the Consciences of English Subjects before Archbishop</hi> Lauds <hi>time, was because the Succession and Authority of Bishops, and other Ecclesiastical Orders received from the Roman Church, was never confidently and generally taught in</hi> England <hi>to be of Divine Right.</hi> His Disciples since have rectified that Errour, by obliging all the Conforming Ministers to subscribe, <hi>That Episcopacy is a distinct Order,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vid.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60104:67"/>
it includes also the Civil Government, and requires Passive Obedience and Non-resistance in all Cases whatever, which rendred it acceptable to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then in being, and gave them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to trample upon Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Laws and Constitutions, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming upon the security of an Oath, that <hi>neither they, nor any commissioned by them, must be resisted upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatsoever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Proofs brought for this distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and superiority of Order are so very weak, that scarce two of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters of Episcopacy agree in any one of them. No Scripture, no primitive General Council, no general Consent of primitive Doctors and Fathers, no not one Father of note in the first Ages, speak particularly and home to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>
            <p>The Point of Re-ordination began to be urged here in Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s time, his Influence was such, and the Cause then in hand did work so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully upon good Bishop <hi>Hall</hi> himself, that he adventured, as Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> tells us, to Re-ordain Mr. <hi>Iohn Dury,</hi> though he had been before Ordained in some
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60104:68"/>
Reformed Church. But from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not so. The old Church of <hi>England</hi> did not require Re-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is now done.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth his time, <hi>Peter Martyr, Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>P.

               <hi>Iohn à Lasco,</hi> with his Congregation of <hi>Germans,</hi> was settled in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth's Patent, he to be Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-intendent, and four other Ministers with him; and though he wrote against some Orders of our Church,<note place="margin">

            <p n="3">3. He brings this as an Argument of the Identity of Bishops and Presbyters, that Presbyters at first made Bishops: A Bishop in <hi>Ierom</hi>'s Opinion is that to the Presbyters, that an Arch-deacon is to the Deacons. As an Arch-deacon chosen out of the Deacons is but a Deacon still, though the chief Deacon; so a Bishop set over Presbyters is but a Presbyter still, though the chief Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter. <hi>Is Episcopus qui inter Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros primus.</hi>

Neither do we read of any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration. <hi>Polydor Virgil</hi> confesseth that anciently in the making of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,<note place="margin">De Invent. rer. l. 4. c 6.</note> there were no Ceremonies used, but the People met together to give their Testimony and Suffrage in their Election, both Ministers and People did pray, and Presbyters gave Imposition of Hands.</p>

            <p>Here is a full proof of Presbyters choosing and creating their Bishop, (whom <hi>Eutychius</hi> speaking in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his Age, calls Patriarch) and that by Imposition of Hands and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,

            <p>Here we have also an Instance of Presbyters making Presbyters; for <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tychius</hi> tells us, That the same Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that made their Bishop, <hi>chose and ordained another person Presbyter in his room;</hi> and so <hi>constituted both Presbyters and Bishops</hi> for several Ages together.</p>

            <p>Two things are remarkable in this Decision of <hi>Leo</hi> the Great.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that want the Election of the Clergy, and are not desired by the People, nor Consecrated by the Bishops of the Province, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are <hi>Pseudo-episcopi,</hi> false Bishops in <hi>Leo</hi>'s Opinion, which is agreeable to the old Canons, as we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served before. Our English Bishops want the Election of the Clergy and People, and therefore their Ordinations have a Canonical nullity in them. They would have been reckon'd but <hi>Pseudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopi</hi> in <hi>Leo</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Consent <hi>ex post facto</hi> of the true Bishops, made the Ordinations of meer Presbyters lawful, which could not be unless they had an intrinsick power of Ordination, which was only restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Laws of the Church; for if they have no power of Ordination, it is impossible they should confer any by their Ordination. The bare consent of the true Bishops could not have made them Ministers, if they had not been such before.</p>

               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:60104:75"/>IV. The power of Ordination and Government was in the Hands of the Captive Presbyters under the <hi>Seythians</hi> beyond <hi>1ster</hi> for about Seventy years, from the Year 260 to the Year 327;<note place="margin">

Thus far the Bishop.</p>
            <p>I would further be resolved in these Queries.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Fathers mention <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, Simeon Zelotes,</hi> &amp;c. to have preached the Gospel in <hi>Brittain,</hi> what reason have we to exclude <hi>North-Britain</hi> from partaking in the Blessing? The whole Island, <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> was then called <hi>Britain.</hi> It is most reasonable to think that those Apostles and Apostolical Men that came into this Land, did cause the joyful sound of the Gospel to be heard in every part of the Island, North as well as South. When we consider their Zeal, unwearied En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, together with the wonderful Success attending their Ministry, it is not likely that <hi>Scotland</hi> remained long in Heathenism, after the Conversion of <hi>South-Brittain.</hi> And can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that the Christians of <hi>South-Brittain</hi> were so cruelly uncharitable as not to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60104:82"/>
endeavour the propagation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel among their Country-men and Neighbours of <hi>North-Britain,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally under King <hi>Lucius,</hi> in whose time Christianity may be supposed to be the publick Profession of the Land. To this add, that a great part of that we call <hi>Scotland</hi> now, belonged then to the Dominions of the <hi>British</hi> Kings, who doubtless endeavoured the planting of Christianity among all their Subjects.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Inhabitants of <hi>North-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> received their first Conversion by Men sent from <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Bede</hi> suggests,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bed.</hi> Hist. III. 4.</note> how comes it to pass that for so long a time after, they kept their <hi>Easter</hi> after the Eastern manner, and not after the Roman?

            <p>The <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Britains</hi> were as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Nonconformists as he in this Point, and are termed by <hi>Wilfride,</hi> at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Disputation, <hi>obstinationis eorum com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices</hi>

            <p>As the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishops were growing in greatness, and arriving towards the Perfection of the <hi>Man of Sin,</hi> they sent their Bishops to most Nations, to bring them to a dependence upon them; so they did send <hi>Palladius</hi> to <hi>Ireland, Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Bede</hi> himself acknowledges that the first Bishop the <hi>Scots</hi> had was <hi>Palladius,</hi> though they were Christians before; <note place="margin">

            <p>It is objected further, out of <hi>Bede,</hi> That <hi>Britain</hi> in <hi>Palladius</hi>'s time had such Bishops as were in all other parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire.</p>

               <hi>Answ. Bede</hi> acknowledges that the <hi>British</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Bishops were many of them Ordained only by one Bishop. They were not then such Bishops as were in all other parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; for in other parts of the Empire

they were Ordained by three Bishops, according to the fourth Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice.</hi> It's an evidence that they thought themselves not obliged by General Councils.</p>
            <p>But suppose there were such Bishops here, as were in all other parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as it is not very unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly but the Church-Government of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> being a Province of that Empire, might be in some degree modelled ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Forms used in other parts of the Empire.

               <hi>Ordain'd perhaps only by the Bishop of</hi> Hy, saith the Learned Historian: Here is a plain begging of the Question; It is taken for granted that this Man was Ordained by the Bishop of <hi>Hy,</hi> which we deny, and which <hi>Bede</hi> no where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. <hi>Finan</hi>'s Ordination was by the <hi>Seniores</hi> and their <hi>Abbot,</hi>

               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:60104:95"/>Thus we see the vanity of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Succession, who they be that maintain it, and who are the Opposers of it. It's one of the Pillars of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Church, which supports that tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Fabrick.</p>
            <p>The Arguments against our Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must needs be very defective, when no other can be found, but those which the Jesuits urge against all Protestant Ordinations. It's an ill Cause that must be defended by Weapons borrowed out of their Tents. Is there no Sword in <hi>Israel</hi> that you go to the <hi>Philistines</hi> to sharpen your Goads?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The violent Assertors and Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of this Opinion, little consider that by this Hypothesis there can be no true Ministers in the Church of <hi>England</hi>; for it's certain the Chain of Succession pleaded for, hath been broken again and again. One Nullity makes a breach in the whole Chain. All our Bishops, as such, derive their Succession from <hi>Rome.</hi> Now if we can find any Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in the Succession of Bishops there, it Nullifies all the Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those that depend upon them. If the Pope succeeds <hi>Peter,</hi> as Darkness
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60104:96"/>
doth Light; if he who calls himself <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Vicar,</hi> proves to be the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi>; if many Popes were <hi>Hereticks, Sodomites, Idolaters, Conjurers, Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Murderers,</hi> &amp;c. as some of their own Authors affirm; if there were two or three Popes at a time, and if they were rather <hi>Apostatical</hi> then <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolical</hi> for fifty years together, as their own <hi>Baronius</hi> confesseth, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the pretended Line of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession? If none of these things can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe it, what can? We may as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally affirm that a Dog may generate a Man, as that <hi>the Man of God</hi> may be the Off-spring of the <hi>Man of Sin.</hi> I doubt not but Christ had his Ministers in the darkest Ages of the Church, but not by virtue of this Succession in debate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay, this Principle destroys all Churches in the World. For there's no Church this day can produce such a Testimonial of Succession, as hath met with no Canonical Interruption. They that bid fairest for it, are the <hi>Greek</hi> Churches,<note place="margin">Vide Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thol. Trad. Q 4.</note> the <hi>Latine,</hi> and the <hi>African</hi> Churches; and all of them derive the Succession from the same Source, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Peter</hi> the Head of it. The <hi>Greeks</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:60104:96"/>
produce a large Catalogue of Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs proceeding from <hi>Peter,</hi> until the time of <hi>Neophytus,</hi> who not many years ago held the See at <hi>Constantinople.</hi> The Christians of <hi>Affrica,</hi> especially the <hi>Habassines,</hi> who are the most considerable among them, derive their Succession from the <hi>Patriarch</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and he from <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> The Western Churches also derive the Succession from the same Spring. Thus we have the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Sects of Christians in the World, deriving their Claim from one and the same Apostle. All would be reputed the Off-spring of the Chief Apostle, and glory in their Relation to him. It seems <hi>Paul,</hi> the Great Apostle of the Gentiles, who laboured more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then all the rest, either left no Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour behind him, or no Body knows what is become of him? <hi>Sic vos non vobis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle of the Circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, must be the Universal Head of all the Gentile-Churches; and <hi>Paul,</hi> with the rest of the Apostles, must be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Childless, or be the Progenitors of such an Off-spring that is long ago ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, or so very obscure, that their Names are written in the Dust.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:60104:97"/>But how comes <hi>Peter</hi> to Canton his Bishoprick into three Parts, and to leave three Successors behind him? By the same Rule, every Bishop must have more Successors then one, three at least, and each of them as many, and so forward until Bishopricks be crumbled into Parochial Churches; and the Patrimony of <hi>Peter,</hi> by an <hi>Apostolical Gavel kind,</hi> be equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded between his Parochial Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</p>
            <p>But the unhappiness of it is, the three Patriarchal Successors cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree about the divided Inheritance. The eldest Brother (for so the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> reckons himself) Condemns the two others as spurious, and Claims to himself the Universal Inheritance.

            <p n="5">5. By this Principle no Man can know himself to be a Minister of Christ. Can any Man know that all the Predecessors of that Bishop that Ordained him were Canonical Bishops? that none of them came in by Simony, or err'd in the Fundamentals, so as to be guilty of Heresie? that none of them lost their Authority by involving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Secular and Publick Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations<note n="*" place="margin">Can.

A great part of the Christian World is uncertain what Apostles did first Convert their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Countries, which were it known,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:60104:98"/>
would not yet resolve the Point.

So that this Notion serves only to perplex Ministers and People, with insuperable difficulties about their acceptance with God, and to leave Christianity it self upon such precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Foundations, as will be, in the power of every Critick in Church-History to shake, if not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>How is it possible, That plain il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate People should know this Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, which is learnt only by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the length and obscurity of which wearieth the wisest Men, and which oftentimes contradict themselves. Ought not the Consciences of the meanest to be satisfied in the Call of their Ministers? Must they act in a Matter of so great importance by an Implicit Faith? What Rule shall they judge by? not by the Line of Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; that will but lead them into an

            <p n="6">6. Let it be further considered, That the Catalogues that are brought by some of the Ancients, of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors of the Apostles, were made by Conjecture<note n="*" place="margin">
