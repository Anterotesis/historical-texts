            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>CHriſt was borne in <hi>Bethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> a little Village in <hi>Iury,</hi> not farre from <hi>Ieruſalem: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> (a Virgin) was his Mother, and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> (a Carpenter) his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Father. He liued in the raigne of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar,</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Rome,</hi> and was put to death in the time of <hi>Tiberius.</hi> At twelue yeares of age hée diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the Temple, and put downe the Doctors. He was the beſt Maſter that euer was, for hée gaue (and to this day ſtill giues) Heauen to his followers, yet had but bad Seruants, for <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed him, <hi>Peter</hi> deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, all forſooke him. Hée was the beſt Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>man that euer was, for he walked vpon the Waters, and at his bidding the Windes lay ſtill. No man euer did ſuch Cures as he did, for hée raiſed the dead to life, gaue ſight to the Blind, made the Lame to walke, and caſt out Diuels. No man euer made ſuch Feaſts as hée, his laſt Supper being one, where he and his twelue Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſate together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> At which time, riſing from Table, he tyed a Towell about his middle, and then waſhing all their féet, hée dryed them with that Towell: Another Feaſt was, which hée fed fiue thouſands with fiue Barly Loaues and two Fiſhes: At another time (béeing at a wedding) he turned Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Wine.</p>
               <p>His whole life was ſpent in labor, in Preaching, in faſting, praying, healing ſicke People, and doing myracles, yet for all this the <hi>Iewes</hi> hated him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Herod</hi> diſpiſed him, <hi>Annas, Caiphas, Pilate,</hi> the Scribes &amp; Phariſies, with all the Doctors of the Law ſate in conſultation together, how to intrap him, and put him to death, and for that cauſe hired many falſe witneſſes, who came in againſt him, but they agréed not in their teſtimonies: yet he was betrayed by his owne Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Iudas,</hi> who for thirty <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Penes ſold his Maſter, came to him, cryed, <hi>All hayle,</hi> and with a kiſſe deliuered him into the hands of ſuch, as with Bils and Staues in the night came to apprehend him as a Thiefe; Hée was thus haled to Priſon. Then the cuſtome of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> being (at euery Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) to haue a Priſoner deliuered to them to be put to death; and <hi>Pilate</hi> asked the people if they would haue one <hi>Barrabas</hi> (a Malefactor) or Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they cryed out to haue Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> to be made frée. Hereupon, Chriſt with ſtrong Cords was tyed to a Pillar, and with Cords &amp; Whips ſcourged. At his Arraignment, he was ſpet vpon, and ſtrucke ouer the face: At his comming from the Hall of Iudgment, he was whooped at, reuiled, mocked, and miſerably abuſed. That day then which we call good Friday, béeing ſet downe for his day of Death, he was forced on his ſore ſhoulders to carry his owne heauy Croſſe, on which he was to ſuffer, &amp; to carry it through <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to Mount <hi>Caluarie,</hi> his place of Execution: But before this, in the open Hall, the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſet a Crowne of ſharpe pricking Thornes vpon his head, ſtrucke him with a Réed, and Iéered at him: To that Croſſe hée was nayl'd with his Thorny Crowne on; his Hands and Féet bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through, hung betwéene two common Théeues: His ſide pierced with a Speare; Vineger and Gall giuen him to drink as he hung: Cloſe to the Croſſe ſtood his mother, her Siſter, and <hi>Mary Magdalen:</hi> Chriſt ſaid to his Mother, <hi>Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Sonne.</hi> In the end giuing vp the Ghoſt, the Body was taken downe; He was buried, yet roſe againe, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Diſciples vntill be went vp into Heauen.</p>
