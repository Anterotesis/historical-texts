            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53894:5"/>
They were dictated by him to divers Gentlemen then under his charge, and the objects of his care, as fast as his pious soul conceived them, which breaking forth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed it self in an active and burning charity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold therefore deep sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies proceeding from a zealous heart. They are not a miscellany of frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments stolen out of other mens works; but a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy discourse, issuing
<pb facs="tcp:53894:5"/>
from a profound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, compacted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and tied up with such a strength of reason, so close, and pressing the motives so home, that Vice hath nothing to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour her deformity, which he hath not unmasked; nor have the Vertues any lustre to set forth their inviting beauties, which are not likewise by him discovered.</p>
            <p>Finally, that man who is but meanly considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<pb facs="tcp:53894:6"/>
must be mainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in his capacity, if he doth not easily of himself fall upon firm resolutions to perform the duties correspondent to a good Christian. And if yet either a dulness of nature, or a quickness of unmortified affections, make the soul cold and drie in the consideration of spirituall objects; the Authour comes in again at every turn, and assists with conclusions, sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
<pb facs="tcp:53894:6"/>
and substantially raised upon the firme Basis of his wel-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed motives.</p>
            <p>As for the persons to whom he delivered them, they were Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of good condition, well qualified, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks; who yet (by an unhappy mistake of some seduced Zelots) were therefore disestee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and cast off, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing scarcely either good Christians, or loyall Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
<pb facs="tcp:53894:7"/>
An errour nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by some of our greatest (whose honour and name I spare) and so far drove on by design, under pretence of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the State, their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Interest, and the new-established Gospel; that now at length they have lost and undone themselves, their best Subjects and Friends, and the Formalities (though that be least to be lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) of their supposed
<pb facs="tcp:53894:7"/>
Church, and all that flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they pretended; the storm rising (according to Gods judgements) in another quarter, where some of them did least fear it. But in the mean time, while they ruffled it in their glory, many honest Catholick Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians lost both life and fortunes. Nor had these distressed Gentlemen any other comfort, but their prayers, joyned with
<pb facs="tcp:53894:8"/>
the practise of vertues, and a good conscience, for which they suffered.</p>
            <p>To the almighty, whose loynes are girded with power, they offered up their daily supplications, beseeching him to regard and pity his holy Spouse, the Church; to cast an eye of mercy upon his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants misery; to look gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously upon their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; innocency; to grant them patience, obedience, and humility; to mollifie
<pb facs="tcp:53894:8"/>
the obdurate hearts of their adversaries; &amp; in the bowels of his eternall charitie, for his son Christ Jesus sake, to recall, and receive into the bosome of his Church, their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, yet still their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-beloved Countrymen. Such were their weapons to advance Religion, such was their armour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, and such use they made of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations &amp; conclusions to be seen in this ensuing Treatise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53894:9"/>
Wherein, towards the latter end, you shall find some Meditations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed properly for those, who after a long time spent in praier and study, having mortified their own wills, were called by God and their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours to assist their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in an active life, and to undertake the sublime function of Priesthood. And albeit those conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of single life, and some other points more
<pb facs="tcp:53894:9"/>
immediately conducing to that particular state, are not so generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all men; yet I would not defraud thee of whatsoever was in the originall Copie.</p>
            <p>I was willing therefore to dress those Meditatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s also in our <hi>English</hi> habit, since the least spirituall profit of the Reader is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more worth then all my labours; and I ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believe there be many who will read them, and
<pb facs="tcp:53894:10"/>
make good use of them, learning daily more and more to esteem and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease that talent w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> God hath given them, for the benefit of their own souls, &amp; the salvation of others, and to watch and guard their steps warily, when they see to what a high pitch of perfection they are obliged by vertue of their profession, how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous and pernicious every the least slip may prove to themselves, and
<pb facs="tcp:53894:10"/>
how scandalous to others, being to act upon a slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery stage, before the eyes of many curious obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. God forbid that they should cause his Name to be blasphemed, his holy Spouse to be despised, or his sacred Priesthood to be vilified among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which do not know him; when as their Saint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vertues, as well as their sublime vocation, ought to make them a spectacle of reverence to
<pb facs="tcp:53894:11"/>
Angels and men. Nor wil those discourses be only profitable to such as are, or should be in a state of perfection; but they also who hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly creep along, &amp; lead a secular life; may among other good les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, learn to obey and honor that celestial state, whereof he ought to acknowledge himself much unworthy, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever best deserves it.</p>
            <p>Lastly, I assure you that although I extremely li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb facs="tcp:53894:11"/>
the Latine piece, and loved the Authour for it; yet being contented with the Originall, I was not ambitious to translate it, by reason of difficulties, and those more then many will imagine, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I was sollicited and engaged, and had the help of a powerfull friend. And then also, at first, I intended it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the private use of my Familie, neither did I therefore dress it up
<pb facs="tcp:53894:12"/>
so accurately, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I would have done; albeit to my utmost ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie I delivered the sense of the Originall, and followed it closely, it being that which I principally aimed at. But now since I publish it, and invite all, especially the honourable Societie of those, who were once my fellow Collegiats, to peruse it in our mother tongue; I could wish I had made it more polished,
<pb facs="tcp:53894:12"/>
and pleasing. However (such as the Translation is) I am confident it is worth your reading, and will with Gods grace make you happie, if seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously put in practice; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, a hastie run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning over it will onely prove a fruitless curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and not able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or reach that end, for which it was either composed or translated. For certainly, when the day of judgement shall
<pb facs="tcp:53894:13"/>
come, saith <hi>Thomas à Kempis,</hi> it will not be examined what we have read, but what we have done; nor how well we have spoken, but how religiously we have lived.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Sin therefore, as much as it hath from sinfulnesse, is contrary to Nature; as heat is an enemy to water: it is a disease of the soul, and weakens it in the operations which are connaturall unto it; it is a blemish, deforming her beauty.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, sithence reason was given to us as a Governesse, and aimeth at nothing else then what is absolutely best to be done, all things being considered; it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that he who runs astray

from it by sin, doth by so doing fall into mischiefs; and by how much thesin is more grievous, by so much are the mischiefs more grievous into which he falls.</p>

Now because the desire of that which is according to reason is fundamentall, and in a manner established in the soul, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be extinguished; it is necessary, that the soul of a sinner remain divided against it self, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wavering and inconstant.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Not withstanding, God brought them back again repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, in a small number, and as it were for the last remedy subjected them to the temporall rule of Priests and Scribes, expecting in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that themselves would have been kept in their duties by the bait of temporall honour, and that at least for the worlds sake, they should have retained the common people in the true service of God.

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, how God, when other remedies did fail, was forced to the extremity of all boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; so that he communicated the bounty of his very self, really and identificatively uniting the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same in one Person with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature: for neither had the all-goodnesse satisfied it self, if it had been never so freely bestowed by participation, when as it might be done essentially, and entitative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; nor when it saw humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by its misery thrown down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a state, as it seemed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to deserve so great a commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and pitty, because no other remedy could be sufficient, could very goodnesse contain it self, but that it must spring forth, where
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:53894:32"/>
there was a possibility to be good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Adde moreover, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the rest of the works of the Divine wisedome did require, that among the second causes, there should be some firm principle of those qualities, which it caused perpetually and constantly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in humane nature: but of Grace, and like supernaturall gifts, seeing they are participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine Essence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its properties, there was found no root, or stedfast foundation out of the Divine Essence to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate those; therefore in humane nature by a connaturall root, it was necessary that God should become Man.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But otherwise also, when as the order of Grace was in such manner to exceed inferiour substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to equall them amongst themselves, and sometimes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt the lower above the higher; there was no principall cause, nor sufficiently authorizing so great
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:53894:33"/>
an innovation, besides God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Creatour of all things.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And moreover, to receive an alien nature to his own, without a confusion of those natures, was the onely work of existency subsisting, and by consequence not of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or restrained being.</p>
               <p n="5">5. What should we say more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, but that the master and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher of the secrets of the divine knowledge and wisedome, could not be, but he that did compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, and to exact of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable creature, accustomed to the evidence of axiomes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, a belief unmove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, must be of such an one, whose authority should be more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, then nature it self, and both the one and the other proper to God alone?</p>
               <p n="6">6. Besides, this Oeconomy of the world, was to be governed and perfected by the ministeries of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, both of good, and bad, and an innovation of the order of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:53894:33"/>
Universe to be added where it was needfull; and therefore without doubt the work proper to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of this great Universe, and the absolute Lord both of corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall and intellectuall substances.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Lastly, the load of sin by a mixture of supernaturalls, with the weight of the Deity added unto it, was increased so immensely, that vertue, had it not been ennobled by the Person of God added to it, would not have been able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match it.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Chiefly, because indeed all these things are not evils, nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing to the Divine nature, since they are the works of his hands, and he cannot hate any thing which he hath made: again, because they could not reach to the Deity, although they pressed upon God in his humanity. But as the Sun in the dung-hill, and God, who is in hell by his essence, is neither defiled, nor ofless account, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the filthiness and horrour of the place: So in like manner doth the God-head neither suffer pains nor contempt, through the miseries of the humanity, although in a more sublime manner united to it.</p>

ourstock was to be damned in one lump.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

               <p>Conclude, when thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standest that the Catholick Church doth testifie, that she received some Article from God by a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Doctours, to behave thy self in the same manner, as if thou didst hear the same from God thy self, and that thou canst not doubt, or admit any disputes concerning the same Article, without prejudice of the Divine Truth.</p>

               <p n="2">2.

His love is also most free in the beginning of his affection, seeing we as then were nothing, nor could it any wayes be thought wherein we could be profitable to him.

As he, by his will and good pleasure, absolutely governs all things; so we also should use all externall things for our own profit, the most holy Virgin his Mother not excepted; that the Elements, and their Inhabitants, the Heavens, and the holy Spirits that govern them, should serve us, and that nothing should hurt our souls, in which part we are amiable, but our selves; and our selves ought not, although the whole world, and whatsoever is in it should fall away to nothing.</p>

love, and good will. If any thing that is sharp, or not so vertuous as should be, proceeds from them, to remember, that to suffer some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities, among many profits, is not considerable; That if they do otherwise then well, we must pardon them as men, but we must be indebted to them for whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is well done, as to friends.</p>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53894:50"/>
and to publish it abroad.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Gratitude also for a benefit received, doth intice and draw forth a second, if the benefactour bears a noble heart; but with him that is base, it satisfies, and stifles clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous complaints.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, there is not a reproach more odious, then that of a benefit received with ingratitude; from whence it proceeds, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the imperiall constitution, a curtesie done might be revoked, if ingratitude were proved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, God among other causes by which goods are to be acquired, hath placed the prayers of the poor, that, as it were out of the nature of the thing, he would blesse those, for whose prosperity the poor make supplication to him. Therefore he that receives a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit with obligation, or hopes of prayers to be offered for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, is absolutely bound to pray for him; and if he doth it not, the mischiefs which shall happen to the

               <p>Conclude, gifts are prudently to be asked, and accepted, to wit, when necessity compelleth thee; when they are received, they are to be acknowledged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and if there be any thing wherein thou canst profit thy bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour, it is to be done with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. This is the condition of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, that if thou hast done any, thou shouldest esteem them as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: but if thou hast received them, esteem them as great. Last of all, when you can return nothing else, endeavour in your prayers to God to obtain all good for those that have conferred any benefit upon you, do it fervently, and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and in the first place take care thy prayers may be such, as shall be to God acceptable.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Again, consider, it is a work more then humane to govern men; whereupon Princes are instiled with the Title of Gods. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, since it is the propertie of wisedome to dispose in order, to arrange and keep in order wise men, is an affair of the highest, and mastering wisedome, and a work approaching to God. And therefore ample honours and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

Again, they are obliged, who are set in Office, to give an account for all that evill, which through their negligence, shall chance to those who are under their government and charge, their labours are to be more heavy, and more continuall, then other mens whatsoever. So that when there is any need, they ought with their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to tread out the path, where in their subjects should follow, in whatsoever laborious, or contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible exercise.

are intolerable, and of all most horrible.</p>
               <p>Conclude, that an Office is a thing worthy, and to be wished for, but not to be demanded; since thou knowest not how thou shalt manage thy self in it. Nor yet is it to be refused, when God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the judgement of those whom it concerneth, shall impose it upon thee; because it is a great good; nor mayest thou doubt of Gods assistance, nor refuse it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sin, when he shall be pleased to call thee up to it.

               <p n="2">2. Again, other goods, as those of Vertue, Science, and the rest, are in themselves but particular goods, and of their own nature to be effected in singular persons, and but by accident in more; onely Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of it self is the good of the whole Community.

Dost thou take away one dish of a halfpeny? it increaseth sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto pounds.

the effects which it brings along with it. Of it self it is painfull, in effects it is worse.

               <p n="1">1.

Therefore is it necessary, that to whatsoever good, although temporall, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, power, riches, pleasure, the passage must be more efficacious, and secure by Vertue, then by Vices; but

unto evill, the tract is full of thorns, and there is no constant methode: neither to temporall goods, can any high-way be made by doing ill.</p>

And therefore how foolish is it to think to govern kingdoms, and to bring unto perfection great affairs, without the Patronage of God, or contrary to his pleasure?</p>
               <p>Conclude, not to be confident of any action, before thou dost see it fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, and brought to perfection; because there are many things in it whereof thou never did it consider: nor yet to glory in it when it is done;

for all that which is thy share in it had never brought it to perfection.

our understanding, and will, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disposed; which is done by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and Prayer; and that by them we are capable of all good whatsoever: know certainly that there is nothing in Gods Treasure, which by force of Prayer may not be drawn forth and applied to thee.</p>

according to the quality of those that receive them, and that the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his mother was without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, or measure; he must have powred upon her the fulnesse of dignity, power, grace, and eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, not in a higher degree of the same nature, but in a manner more noble, and large, by the whole kind and nature of it.</p>

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, that whereas a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is the consumption of some creature, without our own profit, for a testimony that we acknowledge God to be the fountain of all being, and from whom are both our selves, and all that is ours; that he is the end, for whom all things are, and to whom we direct our selves, and what is ours; that he is Lord of life, and death, of bodies, and of souls, and according to whose will, all things are, or are not: it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought only to be offered unto God, and by consequence is the principall act of religion and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, which we can possibly set forth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Adde moreover, that it is a gift, by the oblation whereof our prayers
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:53894:75"/>
are rendred more acceptable unto God, and more efficacious; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, that our soul is more lifted up when we bestow any thing, or that it requireth a proportion of humane prayer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the Christian sacrifice is the most noble, the life of the man God being the offering, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of which, the whole world is nothing, full of infinite mysteries, and beyond understanding: as that the host sacrificed should not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main dead; that a quantitative body, whole, with its figure, should exsist in every particle of an alien quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that a substance should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented under other likenesses, and that they should subsist in it after a manner impossible to be uttered.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To conclude, this sacrifice is not of the Priests alone, but of every one in the Catholick Church, who, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be carelesse, may offer it up by the hands of the Priest, for themselves and theirs, as much as he himself can do it, yea, although

               <p>Conclude, what a rashnesse, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, slothfulnesse, nay, and infidelity it is, to be present at an act the only most religious, and most holy, the most mysterious, and the greatest of all others, lastly, wherein in a manner the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of advantage in a Christian life doth consist, without attention, or affection; either for custome, or by command; and in the mean time to have the mind absent, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in other thoughts.</p>

               <p n="2">2. As many members as thou hast, so many are the seats of severall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases, occasions of thy sufferings, and springs of thy griefs. Read but the books of Physitians, and it will prove a miracle in a manner, that in so great a multitude, and such an easie accesse of sufferings, any one should be possibly free. Moreover, how great is the grief and torment of them, how tedious are they to thy self, and to such as live with thee,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53894:76"/>
we can hardly attain to speak it, no nor to think it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again consider, what a needy creature thou art: look upon thy garments, how many trades have there been imployed in making them up? from how many creatures, herbs, elements, and countries have they been fetched? are those any thing fewer that are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for thy food? Then for medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines? as also for the building, and furniture of thy house? If any part of the world were wanting, thou wouldst be destitute of some of these: so that the whole world is necessary, and conspires together for the relief of thy person.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Moreover, the vertues of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, how little praise deserve they? Beauty serves but for other mens eyes, thou receivest no fruit thereof. Besides, of what great frailty is it? obnoxious to age, diseases, casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; nothing more of substance, then a shadow, or a dyed light, that in what it resides it would
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:53894:77"/>

               <p n="5">5. The strength of a beast, unto thee, whose honour it is with wit to subdue the strongest things, will turn neither to vertue nor to profit, since thou must give place to the vigorous force of a little engine or vise, to an horse, oxe, or the like creature. As for nimblenesse, it is but a toy, and a commendation of vagabonds, who expose their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to sale for other mens pleasure: and for what else serveth it for the most part, more then to make thy self servile, and a game for others to look upon, being compared to a Monkey, or some little bird?</p>

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, how thy soul may be rather said to be admitted to the sight, then the participation of what is good unto her: how misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble &amp; unhappy is she how subject to all the maladyes of the body? If the body grieves, if it rejoyceth, if it be hot, or cold, if it suffers any the least discommodity; the soul doth not only suffer with it, but is also tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to her self, and strugleth along, being intangled, and unprofitable in the performance of her own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover, with how many passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is she vexed, and in a manner rent into pieces, when as the itching desire of pleasure allures one way, the swelling ambition of honour inticeth the contrary, the hope of gaining wealth perswades another,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53894:78"/>
envy a fourth? Thus passion oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth her, when through rashnesse she thinks not of it, and afflicteth her also, when she doth think of it, and hurries her away from the very thought. Hence it is that she feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth matters most easy, to be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and things impossible, to be most easy, and carrieth and scattereth miserable man among precipices, and rocky passages.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But that which is the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of misery is this, that the whole universe of creatures sufficeth not to exalt her to the beatitude she is born to: and when as all other things enjoy for the most part their end, &amp; not any considerable part are deprived of it; the greatest part of man alone is intangled and wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in miserable punishments, and torments, which cannot be comprehended by thought, and a few of the remainders only are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: whereas notwithstanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the contributed service of all the bulk of corporeall creatures,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53894:78"/>
and the Celestiall Hierarchy; God employed himself for almost four and thirty years together, and by a death most cruell, by Sacraments of a stupendious efficacy, and in the chief place, by an eternall presence of himself in the chief of them, made himself the minister and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to help and bring him to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now as for the excellencies of the soul, what are they? For science, thou hast none; or so little, that by how much the more thou knowest, so much the more is thy grief, by knowing better the multitude of those things whereof thou art igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, which are infinite in respect of those whereunto thy knowledge is arrived; nor is there any one work of God, no not the least dusty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, whereof thou canst attain to a perfect knowledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. As for thy vertue, thou canst ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be secure; in every moment thou art ready to be proud of it, and loose it: and for the snares of the

Devil, they are infinite, and past finding out by means of which they would snatch it from thee every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but only that God restrains him beyond thy strength.</p>
               <p>Conclude therefore, not to wax insolent, but to bewail thy misery; since it is truly such, as thou canst never acknowledge, or bewail it sufficiently enough.</p>

And then, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is it that thou excellest another? In beauty? Thou canst not enjoy that which thou canst not behold. In strength or nimblenesse? It is the commendation of beasts. And
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53894:79"/>
how fraile also are these things, which chance, or a disease will take from thee? neither canst thou be sure of it to morrow: which being also anothers gift, is not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to thy praise, but to his that bestowed it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But they are the dowries of the mind wherein thou art excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: thou art a Philosopher, a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, thou teachest great matters. I pray God thou doest, and not cracking things uncertain for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being deceived thy self, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivest thy Scholars, acting the part of a blind guide to such as are blind already.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Art thou skilfull in affairs of Commonweals? 'Tis a businesse very dangerous, changeable every hour, never constant, and whereof there can be no certainty. Lastly, art thou profitable to many, being excellent in any art? Weigh, how the name of profit is a name of servitude throughout all things, and therefore art thou lesse then

those to whom thou art profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. Adde, that there can be no u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility without use; and how many, and how necessary are those things for thee, which do not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, that thy utility may be use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, whatsoever thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderest not, it is not thy self, but God, and nature which work and effect it by thy means. See then, that thou canst not consider the least part, and in a manner nothing of the things that are to be done. The most part thou dost by habit, that is, naturally; in what thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that thou preferrest thy self before others?</p>

                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:53894:80"/>

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, that abundance of the goods of fortune is sought for to supply the needinesse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but it happens contrarily, that he that hath more, is more needy: for the poor man seeks only to beg a penny, the rich man looks after a pound, a Prince after millions. Wherefore there is nothing that satisfies the appetite, except a man sets a measure to himself, which in the beginning he may excellently do. In the mean time man runs on his course, and looseth this present life in affliction, and labour, that after some years he may live hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily; which years he knows not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53894:81"/>
whether he shall live to see them: and if they do come, yet are they shorter then those that are passed, and in which he cannot enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and he hath lost more by his folly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And after riches are obtained, a greater care is necessary for the conservation of them: for thou hast more servants, for whose actions thou art a surety before God, and men. In the mean time they with their whole endeavours study to spend wastfully thy goods, as much as lies in their reach, or as much as thou dost not carefully keep from them: so that the care of keeping them is greater then the labour to attain them. And after this, where is the fruit, when as thou hast no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thy food, and raiment, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers eat up the rest, thy eyes look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and seeing how they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour thy wealth, who will be most ingratefull towards thee?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But let it be granted, they are good upon whom thou bestowest
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53894:81"/>
thy goods; yet they cannot be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen without care, nor without care can thy goods be dispersed among them: and it is impossible but thou shouldest take many that are not such, and of those others thou canst be in no wise certain.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides, by how much thy wealth is more eminent, thy state is so much more hard, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: they move the greedy appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite of more, and more mighty ones, and provoke them to lay more trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous snares against thee, and are defended with more labour and care.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, with how much study and care they are obtained, and kept, with so much grief and pain they are lost, and so much also is life more miserable without them, and death also when they are to be forsaken.</p>
               <p>Conclude, to set a bound to the desire of wealth, that thou maist wish for no more but what may be conveniently obtained, and kept

with such labour, and care for change, that life may not be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to thee; for the rest to make use of life, and enjoy it, that this day thou maist serve God, being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing solicitous for food or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

his own, and the body of his confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, is contrary to an inclination of nature inbred, and not subject to him that hath it; and again, in that it is committed not against any one part in speciall, but against the whole person; the offence hereby becomes more hainous, then if it were against justice, or then if it were the cutting away of some member of the body.</p>

And lastly, if <hi>Boetius</hi> may have credit, it is a pleasure not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; whenas those wretches who
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53894:83"/>
commit the crime, know not in what part they feel it, nor of what kind it is; insomuch, that it is not comparable to one smack of the tast, and is more discerned by the itch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then the act: and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this very thing is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of in numerable mischiefs, and an insnaring labyrinth beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression; for this time, which is so precious, is lost among jealousies and griefs, the soul pines away with bitternesse, same and honour is neglected, friends are lost, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes dissipated, the body weakned, and cast into most horrible disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and torments, the conscience is vexed, God is rejected with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and the whole man consumes away, soul, body, and substance, becoming vile, and contemptible to his very self.</p>

If thy wife be a fool, if a scold, if proud, or infamous, or slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish, thou hast made thy self a slave to a most cruell prison: and how small a number are free from such like vices? or how canst thou be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

cautious, not to light upon some one that is such?</p>
               <p n="2">2. But let it be granted, that she is the best that may be; yet art thou no longer at liberty to choose thy friends, and familiar companions: thou art tyed and must perforce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure those who are of your mutuall alliance, of what condition soever. If thou lovest thy wife, all thy mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series are doubled, because thou dost licence fortune to sway over thee in two bodies; nay, every misery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades thee with advantage, because thy own sufferings grieve thee for her sake.</p>

Then if thou hast no children, thy house is solitary, thy bed unfruitfull, thy thoughts full of tedious emulation, and thy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours seem unprofitable. But if thou
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53894:84"/>
hast children, thou must dread their infancy, have a watchfull care over their vouth, and provide for every age. By a communication of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thou art so many times mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as thou numbrest so dear pledges. And who can promise thee they shall be good? if they are unfortunate, if wicked, if ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if foolish, if deformed, they must not be cast away: before thine eyes thou must perpetually bear the burthen of thine own folly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All these, if thou diest before them, thou forsakest them being needy, and orphans. If they passe out of the world before thee, thou hast obtained a mournfull old age. Whichsoever happens, with what a torment of thy bowells art thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and as it were torn away from so dear pledges? What should I speak of the attentive care of thy substance, whereby to nourish and enrich them? It is necessary, that the soul which descended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, should be enslaved to dirt and

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, that the peculiar deformity of drunkennesse consisteth, in that the reason weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with too much drink is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to serve the domineering ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, so that a drunkard is truly a beast, nay, so much worse, as it is a thing more deformed, for to make reason a slave, then that it should be altogether wanting.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Weigh considerately the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment of a drunkard, in his words, in his eyes, in his motion, in his face; how confounded and different is he from himself, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ridiculous to children?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The life moreover of a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard is a shop of brawls and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53894:87"/>
he never passeth out of his house that he is not alwaies subject either to do some mischief, or suffer it, for what he acted when he was in drink, remains to be satisfied for when he is sober.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Add, that he is much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the operations of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he betraies secrets, he tattles out his appetites, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers his designs, and actions, he is tracked out by all men, he is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, he is scorned; he is also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for the duties of a common life: how many mischiefs through drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse do fall upon a souldier, a mariner, or whosoever it is that hath any businesse of weight or moment committed to his charge? In truth who is there that will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any slight matter to the care of a drunkard, since it is certain, that he will in his drink either betray the businesse, or spoil it by being circumvented?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, the life of a drunkard is base and odious, ingratefull to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53894:87"/>
ones familiars, dishonourable to parents, infamous to all, and by custome usually arrives to that height of turpitude, that neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, nor body, can execute the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary functions of humane life.</p>
               <p>Conclude, to abominate so filthy a kind of vice, and abhorre the company of drunkards as of so many beasts: when any occasion of drinking offers it self, if thou canst not avoid it, be thou the last, and trembling avoid every stroke: know assuredly, that there is poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son contained in every cup that is drunk with excesse; shun therefore what thou art able every glasse that is coming towards thee, untill there creeps in some occasion whereby thou canst privily slip from the rest who are disturbed with drink. Thou canst not perswade a beast to drink more then is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; esteem therefore him unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of thy company, nor to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted a friend or kinsman, who induceth thee to the like.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. COnsider, that anger is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of revenge; revenge, a part of justice, to wit, that he may suffer evil, who hath done evil, which is an act of reason; anger is therefore so much the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, when it strayeth from rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, by how much it is naturall for it to be joined with it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, anger is joined with grief: he therefore brings grief upon himself, who cherisheth his anger. See now, how senselesse it is, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as another hath done thee an inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that thou shouldst therefore frame and create a new scourge for thy self. He therefore who is angry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth his enemy, and completes his desire, which was, that he should bring u pon himself misery and grief: but he who ispatient, in that
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53894:88"/>
very thing is a conquerour, since he hinders that his enemy cannot heap a mischief and sorrow upon him; for other miseries are therefore mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, in that they sad the soul.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Farther, a man that is angry is an impediment also to himself: for whiles he betrayeth the mind that he hath to do a mischief, he both makes his enemy wary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, and that he also, disturbed with his own passion, sees not what is needfull to be done to effect his purpose.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But for a wise man, with whom should he be angry? for he that commits the mischief doth it either justly, and then it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just thing to be angry for it; or through ignorance, and then it is unbeseeming a wise man, for to wish any hurt to another, for any thing which was done by chance, or through ignorance: or lastly, out of passion, or through an evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; whom it is fit we should pitty, for if it had been well with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53894:89"/>
him, he had never done the injury; but being in a passion for the time, he was a beast: and as you are not angry with a dog, or a bear, so neither is it a thing becoming to be angry with such a man. But he that hath contracted an irrationall affection is so much worse then a beast, by how much he is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severantly and more deeply the same, that a passionate man is for a short space.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde to these, the turpitude of an angry man in his countenance, in the headlong rashnesse of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and gestures, not seeing what is fit to be done, speaking things unworthy himself, vexing himself, and hindring that very revenge which he most of all desireth. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, anger is also hurtfull and causeth diseases in the body.</p>
               <p>Conclude, to embrace meeknesse, and not to give the reins of reason to so unbridled, and inconsiderate an affection: when thou seest one angry, view, and consider in him,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:53894:89"/>
how in thy anger thou art wont to behave thy self, and learn to be vertuous by the consideration of the foulnesse of another mans vice.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Adde, that whenas man is man, by reason of his soul, those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men ought to be most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, who take the care of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting

               <p n="3">3. But the whole life of such as practise arts, and sciences, how much doth it excell others? their pleasures, purged from lees, are purely tasted; whenas corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall delights, disturbed with a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of passions, and sensible alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, make that themselves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be known. They are constant and persevering; but the corporall passeth presently into lothsomnesse, and disdain. They are more easily

               <p n="4">4. Lastly, it is quiet, and free from infinite troubles, because it doth not mingle it self with such things, for the obtaining whereof strifes, and cares do besiege the life of man, with so much importunity, and by labours chained together draw it along in misery.

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, that the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a humane soul consisteth either in this, that it self is made a partaker of those consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations which are of the highest rank and order, or that it extends its own to such things as are inferiour to its self; of the which, the first comes by contemplation, the other by action: and for both these ends sacred Theology doth most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently instruct it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For it reacheth to the highest contemplation of God, and those

spirituall substances which are next unto him; it treateth also of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, the end, substance, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and constitution of all things; it considereth the operation, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and command as well of God, as of spirituall substances, and of all kind of action which is proper unto man, and from whom neither the meanest of things can ly hid, nor the greatest escape his capacity: it is Theology that frameth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulateth the principles, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectonick Idea.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover, the profit of it is such, that it confirmeth our faith, governs our manners, and exempts a man from the servitude of pinning himself upon anothers judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, concerning those things which become and are proper to man as man. But its eminency is such, that the Divine is alwaies to be called to counsell to advise what is to be done, and to give his approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in all other Arts and Sciences whatsoever, especially such as are
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53894:92"/>

               <p n="1">1. COnsider, that a Priest is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midst, between God, and his people, to carry and offer up the oblations of the people unto God, and bring down those graces which God shall please to bestow upon his people. And out of the former consideration he hath assigned unto him two offices: for he is as a Master to instruct, and direct the people in those things wherein they are to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their duty towards God; by which dignity and title, he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the professours of other sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and arts, and is seated upon the top of all honour whatsoever, which may be had from humane
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53894:93"/>
science or vertue, and consequently is to be preferred before any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate person, in all kind of eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; with whatsoever science or ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue he shall be adorned, by reason of his dignity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides, he is set to be an Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer of the solemn devotions of the people: and therefore seeing the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of the people towards God, is greater then any other ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation towards themselves, their country, or their parents; it is clear, no other office in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weal, whether it be of Judges, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, or Kings is, or can be comparable to the office of Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Moreover the businesse which Priests do deal in, since it is of the soul, and an eternity of salvation, or misery, which are infinitely high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and of more concernment then those goods which are administred, and taken care of by others; it is therefore to be esteemed a great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse to accompt the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53894:93"/>
any other then the supreme dignity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Now on the other part, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Priests communicating of the mercies of God to man, it is a certain dignity which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, &amp; not otherwise to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to other men, then as the Sea to rivolets, or the Sun, or the whole element of fire to one of our little fires; because those supernatuall gifts of God are to be received uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly in him, which are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be divided among the people, according to the diversity of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure whereof every one is capable; and this is not in such things as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company our nature, but in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, by an effusion of the fulnesse of its very essence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, overflowing the world, by vertue of the holy Ghost, through, and after Christs passion.</p>

will make thee able for thy vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: cast thy self upon him, but let it be thy whole self, with all the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thy heart, because so great an honour requires more then all: follow him confidently, yet not trusting in thy self, but in him; for gifts of such a nature are not of mortall birth, or of humane condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but spring from God.</p>

First of all, thou hast bound thy self with an oath, which is a greater obligation then if thou wert only tyed by a vow, for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is strengthened by an oath, as it is manifest in the very promises of God: for in a vow thy faith and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53894:94"/>
truth is obliged unto God, which is to be kept for the reverence thou ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est unto him; but in an oath the very truth of God is engaged, to be observed with the same reverence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou dost moreover incurre the obligation of justice, receiving thy sustenance upon this condition and contract, that thou wilt assist with thy labours and endeavours thy Country in extreme want of men that are fit (which is to say, of such who are esteemed so, by them to whose care the nation it self is committed) to help her in spiritualls, that is to say, in the chiefest and extremest necessity; which obligation doth necessarily prevent, and make void every vow of a thing that is not compatible with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thou art also bound by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; which bond is far more noble then any private obligation of ones self, for it proceeds forth of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of a common good, which is more eminent then any private
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53894:95"/>
profit, and it implies the authority of a superiour, for what is done by office is done by command. Since therefore publick authority excells by far, private power, it is a sin more grievous to act contrary to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, then contrary to a private pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

               <p n="5">5. Moreover, which way the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation of charity doth bind other men, it ties thee first, and strongest, since the aforesaid obligations do not dissolve it, but encrease it, and strain it closer.

See now in what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree your state is placed; and if so
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53894:96"/>
be that you look upon the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereunto you are called, the highest speculative action is to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelise, that is, to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of such as contemplate: the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall, is to govern souls: both of them the chief works of charity, to teach the ignorant, and correct sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

COnsider, of how much digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it is, and honour, to have received the administring of God himself, although it be only for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour sake, to bear him in your hands, to have him in your power, to give him to whom you will, and to deny him to whom you list. See,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53894:97"/>
how the Priest hath received that which is not granted to the Angels, nor was ever lawfull for any but only to his blessed mother. See, how not only men, and Monarchs, but the Angels also fall prone before the knees of a Priest; not only to adore God in his hands, but also to reverence such power granted unto men. For without doubt it is a certain degree above their dignity, and senting of the infinity of the Divinity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Adde moreover, of what great power it is to sit a judge of men, not as concerning strifes and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but as of their very persons; what they have done unbeseeming God, and themselves: judging it not by proofs, and allegations, but by the simple truth, and a view of the very spirit of the man himself. Of how much sovereignty is it, that the counsellours of Kings, and those that deal in mysteries of State are obliged to speak nakedly, and clearly, before them, and to conceal
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53894:98"/>
nothing; to accuse themselves, and to undergo as well the orders, as the punishments which the Pr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>st will impose upon them. And how great dignity is it that God doth not open, if the Priest doth shut, or loose, if there be any thing that he doth bind; that he hath put the kingdome of heaven in a manner into his hands, that he may bestow it upon such as he judgeth worthy, and keep him away whom he belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unworthy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. These are things that are wonderfull, and of a fearfull alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and admiration, which we may yet in no wise doubt of, except we dare to reprove Christ of false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and infidelity. And is there yet any one so foolish, that can think any thing besides this to be sublime, any thing else to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, or to be esteemed in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane dignities?</p>
               <p>Conclude for to strive with all your strength to obtain befitting vertues, as knowledge, prudence,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53894:98"/>
and the love of God, and your neighbour: and knowing what is committed to your charge, contemn all things, besides what may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or hinder you from the better performing of it. Be all wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of God, nor defile your self with secular affairs, which, since they are by so much inferiour, are very unbeseeming you and your calling.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. COnsider, specially, the charge that lies upon you: for it is commanded that you both make them good that are sinfull, and keep them so when you have made them. Of which the first requires that you remove the heart and mind of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from those goods whereof he
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53894:99"/>
hath a strong conceipt, to new ones; a businesse that is the hardest of hard things. And I adde, from goods of such a nature, that we see them with our eyes, and our senses; to such as are invisible, of which we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bring experience, nor perceive any sensible argument, or footstep, and they most opposite, and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to those whereof we have the present possession.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither are you to deal by il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrious miracles in an apostolicall manner, which of their own force are able to move and shake a mans heart; but by reasons scarcely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible, and authorities to which they give no credit.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor are you to convince a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is yet rude, &amp; unfashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and thereupon amuzed with a new splendor of reason shining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, or the curious strangenesse of such things as are denounced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; but rather, with men that are hardned, who have formerly fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len from the true faith, who have a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53894:99"/>
brawny heart to repulse your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and who by perpetuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, are bred up, to believe that you are not to be believed, and how the things whereto you perswade them, are but mere impostures.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But now, when they are brought to goodnesse, neither can you nurse them up, and keep them in with civile laws, nor with eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall discipline, nor with any outward splendour, or profit, as it were with milk, untill they should grow more ripe: but you have all the weight of humane diligence, and power, pressing backwards, and leading contrary waies. And you are to work by means that are purely spirituall, and not intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: which very thing, of what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and difficulty it is, he doth not understand, who hath not had experience.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Adde to these, the incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities of your person, your dangers, I say, and persecutions continuall, and when it shall please God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53894:100"/>
a prison, or death. Oftentimes you shall have no certain home to put your head in, nor scarce a friend to whom you will not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted troublesome, if you make your accesse to his house. Your poverty is to be endured, and dissembled; and when there is wanting for your self, you must yet be giving some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to others. Your adversaries are both abroad, and at home: and if you have gained any thing, there will be those who will lay perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all snares for you, and backbite you. Others who are no waies better then you, will carry themselves insolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have many to help them: they will domineer and abound, who yet professe the contrary, when you are in want, who justly might enjoy those things, and do suffer in very deed what others do avoid by professing to suffer them.</p>
               <p>Conclude, if you favour any thing of matters which are celesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to march on with courage in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53894:100"/>
the path of life, and to strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the narrow gate. Do not through pusillammity or feeblenesse of courage, or any other fault of yours, commit any thing that may make God esteem you unworthy of your calling; bearing well in your mind, that the rewards are great, both of comfort in this life, and of beatitude in the next, which wait for you.</p>
