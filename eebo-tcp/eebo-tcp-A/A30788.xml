                  <note>The dedication is signed Will. Mountfort, and states that the play was a present to him. It was included in "Six plays written by Mr. Mountfort," 1720, the editor stating that though "not wholly composed by him, he had at least a share in fitting it for the stage." Coxeter states that it was written by John Bancroft and given by him to Mountfort. Cf. DNB; BM (new ed.), and Nicoll, A. History of restoration drama, 1940, p. 158.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Right Honourable <hi>HENRY</hi> Lord Viscount <hi>SYDNEY</hi> of <hi>Sheppey,</hi> one of the Lords of their Majesties most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Trivy-Council, Principal Secretary of State in this Kingdom, one of the Lords Iustices of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Lord Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Kent.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WEre not your goodness Equall with your Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, I durst not presume to lay this humble of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering before you; But as in distress, the Poorer the object, the Nobler the Charity; so in my Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the meaner the Dedicator, the more worthy and esteem'd will be the Condescending Patronage of your Lordship. Nor ought I to doubt your Generous favours, since your Predecessors were always great Encouragers of Poetry.</p>
            <p>I must not omit the Renowned Sr. <hi>Philip Sidney</hi> (whose Father was thrice Lord Deputy of <hi>Ireland</hi>) which was not only an Admirable Writer (besides his vast Accomplishments in other things) But so Indulgent a Patron to the Sons of the Muses, that the famous <hi>Spencer</hi> Dedicated his Works to him as the only Person Capable of Espousing 'em. But this Illustrious Worthy was at last
<pb facs="tcp:50610:3"/>
taken from us (tho' to the Eternall honour of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> in that Glorious and never to be forgotten Action in the Low-Countries, the battle of <hi>Zutphen</hi> in <hi>Gelderland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I go too far from my purpose;</p>
            <p>My Lord, I could not help my presumption in beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Protection of this Play, it being a Present to me, and an English Story so fam'd for the Reign of its Monarch, and the management of those few good Men about him, who with great difficulty preserv'd this Prince from the evill Machinations of <hi>Mortimer</hi> and his Faction, from the Potent Enemies of an Interested State; and the unnatural Connivance of a Mother (who design'd as much to usurp his Right as she really did destroy his Fathers) and the delivering their Country from the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny and Oppression it had been long afflicted with, and which in all probability threatned the totall overthrow of the Establish'd Liberties of the Subject. I say, these weighty Motives induc'd me to Consecrate this Piece to your Lordship, as a true bred Son of the Country, and a Person who has always valued the freedom of his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Brethren, above the Temptations of a prejudic'd and designing Court.</p>
            <p>If Preferment could have drawn you from your esteem to the Publick, never bait was better manag'd then that which was offer'd to decoy your Lordship: But you stood it out with the Resolution of <hi>Sr. Robert Holland,</hi> went on with the sincerity and Prudence of <hi>Sr. Tho. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamore,</hi> and maintain'd it with the spirit of Lord <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The World cannot be insensible of the unalterable
<pb facs="tcp:50610:3"/>
esteem the Family of the <hi>Sydneys</hi> have constantly shewn both in their Endeavours and Sufferings for the benefit of the Common-Weal. And sure (if we are honest to our selves) we must thrive since those who always op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the Enemies of our Country have with much Patience and Diligence overcome their Industrious Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, and have now the care of what they've so hard tugg'd for.</p>
            <p>We have a King who thinks his Life no longer usefull then when employed for the service of his People; We have a Parliament stedfast and generous, the Publick Employments in the hands of Men of Worth, Fortunes, and Honour: (not lyable to be brib'd from abroad) The necessary part of the Nation satisfy'd and United with a Providence that has prov'd (by its care of our Monarch, both abroad and at home) how our choice is esteem'd above.</p>
            <p>That these blessings may not be withdrawn is surely the hearty Prayer of all the Well-Affected; and that the Country may never want a Friend like your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is the zealous wish of him who shall always begg the Honour of subscribing himself,</p>
