         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Attempt was as ſtoutly oppoſed for fourteen dayes by the moderate ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Patriots of the Houſe as the former; the undoubted Right of the antient Peers aſſerted, and all the ſaid grounds and arguments confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except that of Force, which was not to take place with any thing like a free Parliament of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men: But in the cloſe of the fourteen dayes debate, wherein much of the honeſty, ingenuity and courage of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation did appear, (ſeeing all affairs at a ſtand till ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were reſolved in this point) they came in a very fall Houſe to this well qualified Reſolution.</p>

The Committee alſo for Inſpection, before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, had brought in and reported to the Houſe the ſtate of the Accounts and Publick, and of the Martial and Civil Liſts in the three Nations, by which it did appear, That the yearly incomes of <hi>England, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> came to <hi>Eighteen hundred ſixty eight thouſand ſeven hundred

            <p>Many other particulars were under their conſideration, as to the Religion and Civil Rights of the People, too long now to be mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but in ſhort, to give them their due, they did ſome good whileſt they ſate, both to the Publick and particulars, and intended much more, and did no hurt, gave no Offices nor Gratuities to themſelves out of the Publick Treaſure, nor granted any money from the People, which is more than can be ſaid of any Parliament in our memory.</p>
            <p>Proceeding thus ſucceſsfully and hopefully to the general ſatisfaction of the People in the three Nations, who choſe them; the Protector and chief Officers of the Army, who were jealous of one another before, and Competitors for Government, grew now jealous of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons alſo, who being the Repreſentatives of the People, were become alſo their <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This <hi>Repreſentation</hi> was like Lightning before Thunder, both to the Protector and the Houſe; for though it hath ſome ſeeming fair Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions intermixed, it is written in ſuch a <hi>canting aequivocating</hi> language, whereof the Sword was like to be Interpreter, that the ſting was eaſily viſible through the honey, and their former actions and ſuitable conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing honeſty better credited than their words.</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Protector begins too late to think of ſecuring himſelf from being ſurprized with their complements, and ſtands upon his guard. And the Commons houſe, as became <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> wiſely and couragiouſly reſolved to let the Officers know that they took them ſtill to be their Servants, though they had for too many years ill deſerved their wages, rebelling and uſurping the Government at their pleaſure; and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to try what they meant by the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> which, as they ſeemed to repreſent it, ſmelt of Gunpowder and ball, and whether the repentance held forth in their ſaid <hi>Repreſentation</hi> were real or <hi>Military,</hi> paſſed theſe votes on Monday <hi>April</hi> the 18.</p>

            <p>Whileſt the Houſe ſpent the reſt of their time in conſidering how to Provide money, without laying new burthens on the people, great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts grew between the <hi>Protector</hi> and the oppoſite Officers of the Army, both ſides keeping guards night and day againſt one another, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector having in purſuance of the votes of the houſe forbidden the meetings of the Officers.</p>
            <p>In this divided poſture, affairs continued till Friday the 22. of <hi>April,</hi> on which morning early, <hi>Fleetwood</hi> the Protectors Brother, <hi>Desborough</hi> his Uncle, and the reſt of the mutinous Officers, carrying the greater part of the Army after them, and the Protectors party flinching, the Conqueſt was made without one drop of blood, (which was ſtrange in ſo antient, hereditary, juſt, and undoubted a Title) and the Protector forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to a Commiſſion and Proclamation ready prepared, giving <hi>Desbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and others power to diſolve the Parliament, contrary to the beſt advice, and his own Intereſs and Promiſe.

            <p>VVho though with much ado, they got into the Lobby, they were not ſuffered by the Officers of the Army to go into the Houſe, though they diſputed their priviledge of ſitting (if the Parliament were yet in being;) but Reaſon, as well as the Laws, muſt be ſilent amongſt men of VVar; and therefore after they had fairly made their Claim, and found the Houſe under force, they retired, and reſolved by Letter to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Speaker, and thoſe Gentlemen aſſembled with him, what uſage they had received.</p>
            <p>And according'y on Monday the 9. of May, they went to <hi>Weſtminſt.</hi> where underſtanding that there were no Guards upon the Houſe, Mr. <hi>Anſley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hungerford</hi> went up to the Houſe, and had free admittance, receiving the Declaration of the 7. of May at the door, which were publiſhed this day; but M. <hi>Anſley</hi> walking after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the Hall (the Houſe not being ready to ſit) to let the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers know, that though they were repulſed by force on <hi>Saturday,</hi> the Houſe was open for honeſt men this day; at his return, Capt. <hi>Lewſon</hi> of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:110792:7"/>
               <hi>Goffe</hi>'s Regiment (as he confeſſed himſelf) and other Officers denied him entrance; he asking them whether they were a Committee to judge of Members without doors: they ſaid no; but they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by their ſuperiour officers to let none in, that had not ſate till <hi>Apr.</hi> 1653. After ſome reaſoning the caſe with them, the Capt. told Mr. <hi>Anſley,</hi> that if he would give his Paroll to return without ſitting, he might go in and ſpeak with whom he pleaſed; ſo upon his paroll paſſed to the Captain, he was permitted to go in the ſecond time, and ſoon after returned, telling the Captain as he came out, that he had kept his Paroll, and wiſhed he and his ſouldiers would do the like. Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> continued ſtill there, and reſolved ſo to do, ſince he ſaw there was force again upon the Houſe. The diſcourſe Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dores, and how he made them loſe that morning, and adjourn by reaſon of his preſence without the Speakers taking the chair, you may expect from another pen. And how he attempted to ſit again in the afternoon, but found there a troop of horſe, and two companies of red coats, Keepers of the liberties of <hi>England,</hi> and ſo bid them farre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel; immediately after which, to prevent further inturruption in their works of darkneſs from honeſt men, they barred the door againſt three parts of four of the Members of the Houſe by the following Votes.</p>

At the end of the War when they were full and free which they cauſed to be affixed in all the Churches of <hi>England,</hi> to call God and Man to witneſſe their ſincerity therein. And becauſe the title of it is very ſignificant and comprehenſive take that at large. <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>Die veneris April</hi> 17. 1646.</p>
                  <p>A Declaration of the Commons of <hi>England</hi> aſſembled in Parliament of their true intentions concerning the Antient and Fundamental Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Realm;</hi> the Goverment of the Church, The preſent peace, ſecuring the people againſt all arbitrary Government, and maintaining a right underſtanding between the two Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> according to the Covenant and Treaties.</p>
               </q>
The <hi>Preamble</hi> recites how their good intentions had been miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by divers Declarations and Suggeſtions of the King, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and by other practices the minds of many poſſeſſed with a belief that there was no juſt <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the War, And that now they had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the War they deſired to exceed or ſwarve from their firſt Aims and Principles in the undertaking the War, and to recede from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant and treaties between the two Kingdoms, and that they would prolong theſe uncomfortable troubles and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtractions in order to alter the fundamental conſtitution and frame of this Kingdom, To leave all Government in the Church looſe and unſetled, and themſelves to exerciſe the ſame arbitrary power over the perſons and eſtates of the ſubjects which that Parliament had thought fit to aboliſh by taking away <hi>The Star Chamber, High Commiſſion, and other arbitrary Courts, and the exorbitant power of the Councel Table.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they declare in General that they will ſettle Religion in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, according to the Covenant maintain the antient and fundamental Government of this Kingdom, preſerve the rights and liberties of the ſubject, lay hold on the firſt opportunity of procuring a ſafe and well grounded peace in the three Kingdomes, and to keep a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between the two Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Covenant and Treaties.</p>
            <p>Then to give fuller ſatisfaction they declare particularly concerning Church Government, that they are for the Presbiterial Government with a due regard that tender conſciences <hi>which differ not in any fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Religion</hi> may be ſo provided for, as may ſtand with the word of God and the peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Then they declare, that there was nothing they had more earneſtly deſired, nor more conſtantly laboured after, than a ſafe and good peace (with the King) which is the juſt end of a juſt War, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

aſſert the fundamental conſtitution and Government of this Kingdome to be by King, Lords and Commons, which they will not alter.</p>
            <p>Then they conclude that the firſt and chiefeſt grounds of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments taking up Armes in this cauſe was to ſuppreſs attempts of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing an arbitrary Government over this Nation, and <hi>Protecting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents,</hi> enemies of our Religion and liberties, by force from the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Parliament, and declare that they will not interrupt the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary courſe of Juſtice in the ſeveral Courts and Judicatories of this Kingdome.</p>

               <hi>This is the good old Cauſe the Parliament owned.</hi>

            <p>4.

            <p>Let me only tell you the time is now come; for having tryed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways, inſomuch that we are going round again where we firſt turned aſide; you ſee no Foundation to build upon but our Ancient one, ſtrive therefore for the reſtoring of <hi>King, Lords and Commons,</hi> that you may enjoy them and be happy: Remember how the Miniſters and others of <hi>London, Eſſex, Suffolk, Northamptonſhire, Lancaſhire, and other Counties</hi> gave their Teſtimony againſt the King's death in 1648: and repent for that Bloud with which the land is defiled: Let thoſe who ſo boldly in their late mutinous <hi>Repreſentation</hi> to the Protector moved for a <hi>Juſtification of the Kings death and all acts done in purſuance thereof</hi> know, that they may as ſoon pull the Stars out of God's right hand, as make thoſe that fear his name in <hi>England</hi> juſtifie ſuch a horrid impiety for which God hath made us an unſetled people ever ſince, and hath given them and the Kingdome no reſt ever ſince; nor will till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and do their firſt works, and call all <hi>the Members of the Long-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament together to ſit free,</hi> that they or a new Parliament called by their advice may upon the ſecure Terms offered at the <hi>iſle of wight</hi> by the <hi>KING,</hi> and ſuch further reaſonable Additions as the Times may require, reſtore us to our <hi>Antient Government,</hi> and put an End to our Giddineſſe and Confuſion, which deſtroys <hi>Trade, encreaſeth Poor, and threatens ruine to our Religion and Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let none be any longer deluded with the <hi>Baſtard Good Old Cauſe</hi> now cryed up by ſome, which is but the ſetting a ſelf-ſeeking Generation of Unſtable Bloody men in ſupreme Authority; who as zealous as ſome of them ſeemed lately in the new diſſolved Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Liberties of the People, think, now that by their Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and Falſhood as well as Force they have advanced themſelves upon the Ruine of their Countrey, that the work is done: And though they have cryed down a ſingle Perſon, and another Houſe, think you ſuch Fools or Slaves that you will not take Notice that an armed Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is a worſe <hi>single Perſon,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Coordinate Senate</hi> as they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by the <hi>Propoſals</hi> of the Army (which now are come to the Houſe by way of Petition as if they had not been agreed on before) <hi>a worſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſe</hi> than the laſt, which was the worſt that <hi>England</hi> ever ſaw: And this <hi>Rump</hi> of a caſhiered Houſe of Commons, taken into ſervice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at Mercy, and new dreſſed by Sir <hi>Henry Vane</hi> (another ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon amongſt them) worſe than the late Houſe of <hi>Commons</hi> which was full and free; or than the <hi>Long Parliament reſtored to its Freedom,</hi> or than any other that may be choſen by the free Votes of your ſelves and Legally ſummoned to Sit and Decree our Settlement.</p>

Let all of you therefore inſiſt on this, <hi>That the Members of the Long Parliament who have been unjustly impriſoned and ſecluded,</hi> may be Reſtored to Diſcharge the Truſt you have put in them, and then we may hope for Settlement, which we have tryed almoſt Eleven yeares that we cannot have without them. And if the Army ſhall again inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and interrupt you in your Sober and honeſt Endeavours for Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, Let them find by your vigorous Appearing againſt them, that you know them to be the Meaneſt of the People; and ſo Few in Number that they are not One in every Pariſh in <hi>England,</hi> and many ſingle Pariſhes have Ten times their Number of PEOPLE.</p>

            <p>2. Remember and be aſhamed that you have ſtuck at no oaths but have taken the oaths of <hi>Allegiance and Supremacy, The Proteſtation, The vow and Covenant, The ſolemn league and Covenant, The engagement, The Recognition of Protector Oliver, The oath to be true and faithful to Protector Richard,</hi> and have kept theſe contrary oaths and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments all alike, and now do ſet men of the ſame ſtamp in offices and places of truſt inſtead of men of courage fearing God and hating cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe.
