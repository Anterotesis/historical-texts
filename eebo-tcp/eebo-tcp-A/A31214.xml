         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the famous Authour of theſe enſuing
Diſcourſes of the <hi>Menſuration of
Running Waters,</hi> is deſcended from
the Worſhipful FAMILY of the
<hi>CASTELLII,</hi> and took his
firſt breath near to the lake THRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIMENVS,
(where <hi>Hanibal</hi> gave
a fatal overthrow to the <hi>Roman</hi>
Legions) in that ſweet and fertile part
of happy <hi>ITALY,</hi> called the <hi>Territory</hi>
of <hi>PERUGIA,</hi> a branch of the Dukedome of <hi>TUSCANY,</hi> which
at preſent ſubmitteth to the Juriſdiction of the Church, as being a
part of <hi>St. PETER'S Patrimony.</hi> His Parents, who were more
zealous of the good of his Soul than obſervant of the Propenſion of
his Genius, dedicated him (according to the Devotion of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try)
to the Service of the Church; and entered him into the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
Order of Black-Friers, called from the place Moncks
of <hi>Monte Caſino,</hi> and from the Founder <hi>Benedictines.</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that She might conſummate the Profuſion of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours

ennobled and illuminated with Eminent Scholars in all Kinds of

the like.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60312:4"/>
§. In particular, the <hi>SCIENCES MATHEMATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAL</hi>
had then got that Fame and Eſteem in the Learned World,
that all men of Spirit or Quality became either Students in, or
Patrons of thoſe Sublime Knowledges. On this occaſion the Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
of our <hi>AUTHOUR</hi> being awakened, his Active Wit
could not endure to be any longer confined to the Slaviſh Tuition
of Hermetical Pedagogues; but in concurrence with the Genius
of the Age, he alſo betook himſelf to thoſe moſt Generous and
Liberal Studies. His helps in this his deſign were ſo many, and
ſo extraordinary, that had his Inclination been weaker, or his
Apprehenſion leſſer, he could hardly have failed attaining more
than a Common Eminency in theſe Sciences. For beſides the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge
of Learned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Books, which the Preſſe at that
time ſent forth from all parts of <hi>EUROPE,</hi> he had the good
Fortune to fall into the Acquaintance, and under the Inſtruction
of the moſt Demonſtrative and moſt Familiar Man in the World,
the Famous <hi>GALILEO:</hi> whoſe ſucceſſe being no leſſe upon
this his <hi>Pupil</hi> than upon the reſt of thoſe Illuſtrious and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſons that reſorted from all parts to ſit under his Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Lectures, he in a ſhort time attained to that Name in the
Mathematicks, that he was invited to <hi>ROME,</hi> Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and Preferred by his then Holineſſe the Eighth <hi>URBAN,</hi>
upon his very firſt Acceſſion to the <hi>Papacy,</hi> which was in the
Year 1623.</p>
            <p>§. This Pope being moved with a Paternal Providence for the
Concerns of his Subjects in that part of <hi>ITALY</hi> about <hi>BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGNA,
FERRARA,</hi> and <hi>COMMACHIO,</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between the Rivers of <hi>PO</hi> and <hi>RENO,</hi> which is part of
<hi>Lo Stato della Chieſa,</hi> or the Church Patrimony, appoints this
our <hi>CASTELLI</hi> in the Year 1625, to accompany the Right
Honourable <hi>Monſignore CORSINI</hi> (a moſt obſervant and
intelligent perſon in theſe affaires, and at that time Superinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of the General Draines, and Preſident of <hi>ROMAGNA</hi>)
in the Grand Viſitation which he was then ordered to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the diſorders occaſioned by the Waters of thoſe parts.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>CASTELLI,</hi> having now an Opportunity to employ,
yea more, to improve ſuch Notions as he had imbued from the
Lectures of his Excellent <hi>MASTER,</hi> falls to his work with
all induſtry: and in the time that his Occaſions detained him in
<hi>ROMAGNA</hi> he perfected the Firſt Book of this his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
concerning the <hi>Menſuration of Running Waters.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
that he had ſome years before applyed himſelf to this part
of Practical Geometry, and from ſeveral Obſervations collected
part of that Doctrine which at this time he put into Method, and
which had procured him the Repute of ſo much Skill that he began
<pb facs="tcp:60312:4"/>
to be Courted by ſundry Princes, and great Prelates. In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
about the beginning of the Year 1623. and before his Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to <hi>ROME</hi> he was employed by Prince <hi>Ferdinando I,</hi> Grand
Duke of <hi>TUSCANY,</hi> to remedy the Diſorders which at that
time happened in the Valley of <hi>PISA</hi> in the Meadows that lye
upon the Banks of <hi>Serchio</hi> and <hi>Fiume Morto:</hi> and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Grand Duke, Grand Dutcheſſe Mother, the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners
of Sewers, and ſundry other Perſons in a few hours he
made ſo great a progreſſe in that affair, as gave his Moſt Serene
Highneſſe high ſatisfaction, and gained himſelf much Honour.</p>
            <p>§. No ſooner had he in his fore-mentioned Voiage to <hi>RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAGNA</hi>
(which was but few Moneths after, in the ſame
Year) committed his Conceptions to paper, but he communicated
them to certain of his Friends. In which number we finde <hi>Signo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
Ciampoli</hi> Secretary of the Popes Private Affaires; whom in
the beginning of the Firſt Book he gratefully acknowledgeth to
have been contributary, in his Purſe, towards defraying the
charge of Experiments, and in his Perſon, towards the debating
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>pleating of Arguments upon this Subject. Some few years
after the importunity of Friends, and the Zeal he had for the
Publique Good prevailed with him to preſent the World with his
Firſt Diſcourſe, accompanied with a Treatiſe of the Geometrical
Demonſtrations of his whole Doctrine. What Reception it found
with the Judicious muſt needs be imagined by any one that hath
obſerved how <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Facility</hi> in conjunction with <hi>Verity</hi>
make a Charm of irreſiſtable Operation.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>New</hi> it was, for that no man before him had ever attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Demonſtrate all the three Dimenſions, to wit, the Length,
Breadth and Profundity, of this Fluid and Current Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And he detecteth ſuch groſſe Errours in thoſe few that
had untertook to write upon the Subject (of which he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth
in <hi>Frontinus</hi> and <hi>Fontana,</hi> as thoſe that include the rest)
and delivereth ſuch ſingular and unheard-of Paradoxes (for ſo
they ſound in Vulgar Eares) as cannot but procure unſpeakable
delight to his Reader.</p>
            <p>§. <hi>Eaſie</hi> it is likewiſe and <hi>True;</hi> and that upon ſo Familiar
Experiments and Manifeſt Demonſtrations, that I have oft que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned
with my ſelf which merited the greater wonder, he, for
diſcovering, or all men that handled the Argument before him
for not diſcovering a Doctrine of ſuch ſtrange Facility and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility.
But yet as if our Authour deſigned to oblige the whole
World to him by ſo excellent a <hi>Preſent,</hi> he ſelects a Subject that
he knew would be carreſſed by all perſons of Nobler Souls, upon
the accounts afore-named, and by all Mankind in General, as
gratifying them in their much adored Idol <hi>Utility.</hi> And to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:60312:5"/>
his Art the more profitable, he reduceth the lofty, and eaſie-to-be-miſtaken
Speculations of the Theory, into certain and facile
Directions for Practice; teaching us how to prevent and repaire
the Breaches of Seas, and Inundations of Rivers; to draine
and recover Fenns and Marches; to divert, conveigh and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute
Waters for the Flowing and Stercoration of Grounds,
ſtrengthening of Fortifications, ſerving of Aquaducts, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
of Health (by cleanſing Streets, and ſcowring Sewers) and
maintaining of Commerſe (by defending Bridges, cleering Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
and opening Ports and Channels) with innumerable other
Benefits of the like nature. And, that I may omit no circumſtance
that may recommend my Authour, the Fortune of this his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
hath been ſuch, that as if he intended a <hi>Plus ultra</hi> by it,
or as if all men deſpaired to out-do it, or laſtly, as if <hi>CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STELLI</hi>
hath been ſo great a <hi>Maſter</hi> that none have preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to take Pencil in hand for the finiſhing of what he <hi>Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foild,</hi>
this ſmall Tract like the Arabian Phoenix (of which it is
ſaid <hi>Unica ſemper Avis</hi>) did for ſeveral years together continue
ſingle in the World, till that to verifie it to be truly <hi>Phoenician,</hi>
it renewed its Age by undergoing a ſecond Impreſſion. And as if
this did not make out the Immortal vertue of it, it hath had
<hi>Anno</hi> 1660 a third Circulation, and riſen in this laſt Edition as
it were from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rne of its Authour; and that ſo improved by
the Addition of a ſecond part, that it promiſeth to perpetuate
his Merits to all Poſterity. To be brief, the meer Fame of this
Work reſounded the Honourable Name of <hi>CASTELLI</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
all the Corners of <hi>Italy,</hi> I may ſay of <hi>Europe;</hi> inſomuch,
that, in hopes to reap great benefit by his Art, the reſpective
Grandees of the adjacent Countries courted his Judgment and
Advice about their Draining of Fenns, Diverſion of Rivers,
Evacuation of Ports, Preventing of Inundations, &amp;c. So that
every Summer he made one or more of theſe Journies or Viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Particularly, the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> conſulted him about their
Lake; to whom he delivered his Opinion in <hi>May</hi> 1641. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
farther thoughts he preſented them with another Paper of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
the 20 <hi>December</hi> following. Prince <hi>LEOPOLDO</hi>
of <hi>TUSCANY</hi> likewiſe requeſted his Advice in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of the enſuing year 1642, which occaſioned his Letter to
Father <hi>Franceſco di San Giuſeppe,</hi> bearing date <hi>February</hi> 1,
To which <hi>Signore Bartolotti</hi> oppoſing, he writes a ſecond Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
directed to one of the Commiſſioners of Sewers, vindicating
his former, and refuting <hi>Bartolotti,</hi> both which I here give
you.</p>
            <p>§. The Preferments which his Merits recommended him unto,
were firſt to be Abbot of <hi>Caſſino,</hi> from which he was removed
<pb facs="tcp:60312:5"/>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1640, or thereabouts, unto the Abbey of <hi>Santo Benedet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Aloyſio;</hi> and much about the ſame time preferred to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chief Mathematician to his grand Patron Pope <hi>URBAN
VIII.</hi> and Publique Profeſſour of Mathematicks in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
of <hi>ROME.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§. Here a Stop was put to the Carier of his Fortunes, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fuller of Honour than of Years, was by Death, the Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Intrerupter of Generous Deſigns, prevented in doing that
farther Good which the World had good reaſon to promiſe it ſelf
from ſo Profound and Induſtrious a Perſonage, leaving many
Friends and Diſciples of all Degrees and Qualities to lament
his loſſe, and honour his Memory.</p>
            <p>§. His ſingular Virtues and Abilities had gained him the
Friendſhip of very many; as to inſtance in ſome, he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
ſtrict Amity with <hi>Monſignore Maffei Barberino</hi> a Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
Praefect of the Publique Wayes, and afterwards Pope with
the Name of <hi>URBAN VIII.</hi> as was ſaid before; with the
above-named <hi>Monſignore Corſini</hi> Superintendant of the General
Draines: with <hi>Monſignore Piccolomini</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Siena:</hi>
with Cardinal <hi>Serra:</hi> with Cardinal <hi>Caponi,</hi> who hath ſtudied
much and writ well upon this Subject; and with Cardinal <hi>Gae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tano</hi>
who frequently conſulted with him in his deſign of Drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Fenns of <hi>ROMAGNA.</hi> Moreover Prince <hi>LEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLDO,</hi>
and his Brother the Grand Duke had very great
kindneſſe for him; which ſpeaks no ſmall attractions in him,
conſidering him as a favourite of the Family of <hi>Barberini,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom and the Houſe of <hi>Medeci</hi> there is an inveterate
Fewd. Amongſt perſons of a lower Quality he acknowledgeth
<hi>Signore Ciampoli</hi> the Popes Secretary, <hi>Sig. Ferrante Ceſarini,
Sig. Giovanni Baſadonna</hi> Senator of <hi>Venice;</hi> and I find menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Sig. Lana, Sig. Albano, Padre Serafino, Pad. Franceſco
de San. Giuſeppe,</hi> and many others.</p>
            <p>§. The Works in which he will ſurvive to all ſucceeding Ages
are firſt His ſolid and ſober Confutation of the Arguments of
<hi>Signore Lodovico dell Columbo,</hi> and <hi>Signore Vincentio di
Gratia</hi> againſt the Tract of <hi>Galileo Delle coſe che ſtanno ſopra
Aqua,</hi> wherein he vindicates bis ſaid <hi>Maſter</hi> with a Gratitude
that Tutors very rarely reap from the pains they take in Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating
their Pupils. This Apology was firſt Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1615.
and was a ſecond time publiſhed, as alſo thoſe of his Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
amongſt the Works of <hi>GALILEO,</hi> ſet forth by the
Learned <hi>Viviani</hi> 1656. He hath likewiſe writ ſeveral other
curious Pieces, as I am informed by the moſt Courteous <hi>Carolo

concerning <hi>Colours,</hi> which he putteth me in hopes to ſee printed

very ſpeedily. And laſt of all theſe Diſcourſes and Reflections
upon the <hi>Menſuration of Running Waters,</hi> with the addition of
a Second Book, three Epiſtles, and four Conſiderations upon
the ſame Argument, which conduce much to Illuſtrate his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and Facilitate the Practice of it; and which with a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Monſignore Corſini,</hi> make the ſecond part of my Firſt

            <p>§. <hi>I might here ſally forth into the Citation of ſundry Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
of Good Account, that have tranſmitted his Character
to Poſterity, but ſhall confine my ſelf to onely two; the one is
of his</hi> Maſter, <hi>the other of his</hi> Scholar; <hi>than whom there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

Signore Evangeliſta Terricelli, <hi>late Profeſſour to the Grand

Honourable and Grateful Mention of him, and his Book:</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">De Motu A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarum. Lib. 2. Prop. 37. p. 191.</note> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitto

            <p>§. I have onely two particulars more to offer the Engliſh Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
The one concerns the Book, and it is this, That after the
general Aprobation it hath had in <hi>Italy,</hi> I cannot but think it
deſerveth the ſame Civil Entertainment with us, in regard that
it cometh with no leſſe <hi>Novelty, Facility, Verity, and Utility</hi> to
us than to thoſe whom the Authour favoured with the Original.
Our Rivers and Sewers through Publique Diſtractions and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Incroachments are in great diſorder, as thoſe Channels for
inſtance which formerly were Navigable unto the very Walls of
<pb facs="tcp:60312:6"/>
               <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Salisbury,</hi> &amp;c: Our Ports are choaked and obſtructed
by Shelfes and Setlements: Our Fenns do in a great part lie waſte
and unimproved: Now all theſe may be (and, as I find by the
Confeſſion of ſome whoſe Practiſes upon the Copy of the Firſt
Book onely of our Authour hath got them both Money and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
in part have been) remedied by the Ways and Means he
here ſets down. The truth is the Argument hath been paſt over
with an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Silence; ſo that to this day I have not ſeen
any thing that hath been written Demonſtratively and with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Certainty concerning the ſame, ſave onely what this
Learned Prelate hath delivered of his Own Invention in theſe
Treatiſes: who yet hath ſo fully and plainly handled the Whole
Doctrine, that I may affirm his Work to be every way abſolute. It
muſt be confeſt the Demonſtration of the Second Propoſition of the
Second Book did not well pleaſe the Authour, and had he lived
he would have ſupplyed that defect, but being prevented by
Death, the Reader muſt content himſelf with the Mechanical
Proof that he giveth you of the truth of ſo Excellent a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</p>
            <p>§. The other particular that I am to offer is, that out of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to contribute what lyeth in me to the compleating of this Piece
for Engliſh Practice, I have exeeded my promiſe not onely in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
you the Second and following Books which were not extant at
the time of tendering my Overtures, but alſo in that I have added
a Map or Plat of all the Rivers, Lakes, Fenns, &amp;c. mentioned
thorowout the Work. And if I have not kept touch in point of
Time, let it be conſidered that I am the Tranſlator and not the
Printer. To conclude, according to your acceptance of theſe my
endeavours, you may expect ſome other Tracts of no leſſe Profit

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60312:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And becauſe that in the years paſt I had occaſion by Order of
our Lord Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> 8. to apply my thoughts to the motion of
the Waters of Rivers, (a matter difficult, moſt important, and
little handled by others) having concerning the ſame obſerved
ſome particulars not well obſerved, or conſidered till now, but of
great moment both in publick and private affairs; I have thought
good to publiſh them, to the end that ingenious ſpirits might
have occaſion to diſcuſſe more exactly then hitherto hath been
done, ſo neceſſary and profitable a matter, and to ſupply alſo my
defects in this ſhort and difficult Tractate. Difficult I ſay, for
the truth is, theſe knowledges, though of things next our ſenſes,
are ſometimes more abſtruce and hidden, then the knowledge of
things more remote; and much better, and with greater exquiſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
are known the motions of the Planets, and Periods of the
Stars, than thoſe of Rivers and Seas: As that ſingular light of
Philoſophie of our times, and my Maſter <hi>Signore Galileo Galilei</hi>
wiſely obſerveth in his Book concerning the Solar ſpots. And
to proceed with a due order in Sciences, I will take ſome ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
and cognitions ſufficiently clear; from which I will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
proceed to the deducing of the principal concluſions. But
to the end that what I have written at the end of this diſcourſe in
a demonſtrative and Geometrical method, may alſo be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
of thoſe which never have applyed their thoughts to the
ſtudy of Geometry; I have endeavoured to explain my conceit
by an example, and with the conſideration of the natural things
themſelves, muſt after the ſame order in which I began to doubt
in this matter; and have placed this particular Treatiſe here in
the beginning, adverting nevertheleſs, that he who deſires more
full and abſolute ſolidity of Reaſons, may overpaſs this prefatory
diſcourſe, and onely conſider what is treated of in the demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
placed towards the end, and return afterwards to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the things collected in the <hi>Corollaries</hi> and Appendices;
which demonſtrations notwithſtanding, may be pretermitted by
him that hath not ſeen at leaſt the firſt ſix Books of the Elements
of Euclid; ſo that he diligently obſerveth that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
                  <p>I ſay therefore, that having in times paſt, on divers occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
heard ſpeak of the meaſures of the waters of Rivers, and
Fountains, ſaying, ſuch a River is two or three thouſand feet of
water; ſuch a ſpring-water is twenty, thirty, or forty inches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Although in ſuch manner I have found all to treat thereof in
word and writing, without variety, and as we are wont to ſay,
<hi>conſtanti ſermone,</hi> yea even Artiſts and Ingeneers, as if it were
a thing that admitted not of any doubt, yet howſoever I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
ſtill infolded in ſuch an obſcurity, that I well knew I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60312:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing at all, of that which others pretended full and
clearly to underſtand. And my doubt aroſe from my frequent
obſervation of many Trenches and Channels, which carry
water to turn Mills, in which Trenches, and Channels, the
water being meaſured, was found pretty deep; but if afterwards
the ſame water was meaſured in the fall it made to turn the
Wheel of the Mill, it was much leſſe, not amounting often to the
tenth part, nor ſometimes to the twentieth, inſomuch, that the
ſame running water came to be one while more, another while leſs
in meaſure, in divers parts of its Channel; and for that reaſon this
vulgar manner of meaſuring running Waters, as indeterminate and
uncertain, was by me juſtly ſuſpected, the meaſure being to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate,
and the ſame. And here I freely confeſſe that I had ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
help to reſolve this difficulty from the excellent &amp; accurate
way of diſcourſing, as in allother matters, ſo alſo in this, of the
Right Honourable and Truly Noble Signior <hi>Ciampoli,</hi> Secretary
of the Popes ſecret affairs. Who moreover, not ſparing for the coſts
of the ſame, generouſly gave me occaſion a few years paſt to try by
exact experiments that which paſt concerning this particular. And
to explain all more clearly with an example; we ſuppoſe a Veſſel
filled with Water, as for inſtance a Butt, which is kept full, though
ſtill water runneth out, and the Water run out by two Taps equal
of bigneſſe, one put in the bottom of the Veſſel, and the other in
the upper part; it is manifeſt that in the time wherein from the
upper part ſhall iſſue a determinate meaſure of water from
the inferiour part there ſhall iſſue four, five, and many more of
the ſame meaſures, according to the difference of the height of
the Taps, and the diſtance of the upper Tap from the Superfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
and level of the water of the Veſſel: and all this will alwayes
follow, though, as hath been ſaid, the Taps be equal, and the
water in diſcharging keep the ſaid Taps alwayes full. Where firſt
we note, that, although the meaſure of the Taps be equal, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
there iſſueth from them in equal times unequal quantities
of water, And if we ſhould more attentively conſider this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
we ſhould find, that the water by the lower Tap, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
and paſſeth with much greater velocity, then it doth by the
upper, whatever is the reaſon. If therefore we would have
ſuch a quantity of Water diſcharge from the upper tap, as
would diſcharge from the neather in the ſame time, it is plain, that
either the upper Tap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> muſt be multiplyed in ſuch ſort, that ſo
many more Taps in number be placed above than below, as the
neather tap ſhall be more ſwift than the upper, or the upper Tap
made ſo much bigger than the nether, by how much that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
ſhall be more ſwift than that above; and ſo then in equal
times, the ſame quantity of Water ſhall diſcharge from the upper,
as doth from the neather part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60312:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I will declare my ſelf by another example. If we ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that two cords or lines of equal thickneſs, be drawn through
two holes of equal bore; but ſo that the firſt paſs with quadruple
velocity to the ſecond: It is manifeſt, that if in a determinate
time, we ſhall by the firſt bore have drawn four Ells of the line,
in the ſame time, by the ſecond hole we ſhall have drawn but one
Ell of cord onely; and if by the firſt there paſſe twelve Ells, then
through the ſecond there ſhall paſſe onely three Ells; and in
ſhort the quantity of cord ſhall have the ſame proportion to the
cord, that the volocity hath to the velocity. And therefore we
deſiring to compenſate the tardity of the ſecond cord, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the ſame tardity to draw through the ſecond hole as much
cord as through the firſt, it will be neceſſary to draw through the
ſecond bore four ends of cord; ſo that the thickneſs of all the
cords by the ſecond hole, have the ſame proportion to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the cord which paſſeth onely by the firſt, as the velocity
of the cord by the firſt hole hath reciprocally to the velocity of
the cod's by the ſecond hole. And thus its clear, that when
there is drawn through two holes equal quantity of cords in
equal time, but with unequal velocity, it will be neceſſary, that
the thickneſs of all the four cords ſhall have the ſame reciprocal
proportion to the thickneſs of the ſwifter cord, that the velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the ſwifter cord hath to the velocity of the ſlower. The
which is verified likewiſe in the fluid Element of Water.</p>
                  <p>And to the end that this principal fundamental be well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
I will alſo note a certain obſervation made my me in the
Art of Wyer-drawing, or ſpinning Gold, Silver, Braſs, and Iron,
and it is this; That ſuch Artificers deſiring more and more to
diſgroſſe and ſubtillize the ſaid Metals, having wound about a
Rocket or Barrel, the thread of the Metal, they place the Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket
in a frame upon a ſtedfaſt Axis, in ſuch ſort that the Rocket
may turn about in it ſelf; then making one end of the thread to
paſſe by force through a Plate of Steel pierced with divers holes,
greater and leſſer, as need requireth, faſtning the ſame end of the
thread to another Rocket, they wind up the thread, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
through a bore leſs than the thickneſſe of the thread, is of
force conſtrained to diſgroſſe and ſubtillize. Now that which is
intenſly to be obſerved in this buſineſs, is this, That the parts of
the thread before the hole, are of ſuch a thickneſſe, but the parts
of the ſame thread after it is paſſed the hole, are of a leſſer thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
and yet nevertheleſſe the maſſe and weight of the thread
which is drawn forth, is ever equal to the maſſe and weight of the
thread which is winded up. But if we ſhould well conſider the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
we ſhould finde, that the thicker the thread before the hole is,
than the thread paſſed the hole, the greater reciprocally is the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60312:9"/>
velocity of the parts of the thread paſſed the hole, than the volo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the parts before the hole: Inſomuch that if <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rbi gratia</hi>
the thickneſſe of the thread before the hole, were double to the
thickneſſe after the hole, in ſuch caſe the velocity of the parts of
the thread paſſed the hole, ſhould be double to the velocity of the
parts of the thread before the hole; and thus the thickneſſe
compenſates the velocity, and the velocity compenſates the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.
So that the ſame occurreth in the ſolid Metals of Gold,
Silver, Braſs, Iron, &amp;c. that eveneth alſo in the fluid Element of
Water, and other liquids, namely, That the velocity beareth the
ſame proportion to the velocity, that the thickneſſe of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
or Water, hath to the thickneſſe.</p>
                  <p>And therefore granting this diſcourſe, we may ſay, that as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as two Taps with different velocity diſcharge equal quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Water in equal times, it will be neceſſary that the Tap
leſſe ſwift be ſo much greater, and larger, than the Tap more
ſwift, by how much the ſwifter ſuperates in velocity the ſlower;
and to pronounce the Propoſition in more proper terms, we ſay;
That if two Taps of unequal velocity, diſcharge in equal times
equal quantities of Water, the greatneſſe of the firſt ſhall be to
the greatneſſe of the ſecond, in reciprocal proportion, as the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of the ſecond to the velocity of the firſt. As for example,
if the firſt Tap ſhall be ten times ſwifter than the ſecond Tap, it
will be neceſſary, that the ſecond be ten times bigger and larger
than the firſt; and in ſuch caſe the Taps ſhall diſcharge equall
quantities of water in equal times; and this is the principal and
moſt important point, which ought to be kept alwayes in minde,
for that on it well underſtood depend many things profitable,
and worthy of our knowledge.</p>
                  <p>Now applying all that hath been ſaid neerer to our purpoſe, I
conſider, that it being moſt true, that in divers parts of the ſame
River or Current of running water, there doth always paſſe equal
quantity of Water in equal time (which thing is alſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
in our firſt Propoſition) and it being alſo true, that in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
parts the ſame River may have various and different veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
it follows of neceſſary conſequence, that where the River
hath leſſe velocity, it ſhall be of greater meaſure, and in thoſe
parts, in which it hath greater velocity, it ſhall be of leſſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and in ſum, the velocity of ſeveral parts of the ſaid River,
ſhall have eternally reciprocall and like proportion with
their meaſures. This principle and fundamental well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that the ſame Current of Water changeth meaſure, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to its varying of velocity; that is, leſſening the meaſure,
when the velocity encreaſeth, and encreaſing the meaſure, when
the velocity decreaſeth; I paſſe to the conſideration of many
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60312:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
particular accidents in this admirable matter, and all depending
on this ſole Propoſition, the ſenſe of which I have oft repeated,

And its moſt certain, that as often as a ſtrong and continual wind
ſhall blow againſt the Current of a River, and ſhall reduce the
water of the River to ſuch tardity of motion, that in the time
wherein before it run five miles, it now moveth but one, ſuch a

in altering its meaſure, &amp; augmenting it when the velocity
diminiſheth; and diminiſhing it when the velocity augmenteth:
The Architect <hi>Giovanni Fontana,</hi> endeavoured to meaſure, and
and to cauſe to be meaſured by his Nephew, all the Brooks and
Rivers which diſcharged their Waters into <hi>Tiber,</hi> at the time of
the Innundation; which happened at <hi>Rome</hi> in the year 1598,
and publiſhed a ſmall Treatiſe thereof, wherein he ſummeth up
the meaſures of the extraordinary Water which fell into <hi>Tiber,</hi>
and made account that it was about five hundred Ells more than
ordinary; and in the end of that Treatiſe concludeth, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Innundation wholly from <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be neceſſary
to make two other Channels, equal to that at preſent, and that
leſſe would not ſuffice; and finding afterwards that the whole
Stream paſſed under the Bridge <hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> (the Arch where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is of a far leſs meaſure then five hundred Ells) concludeth,
that under the ſaid Bridge paſt a hundred fifty one Ells of Water
compreſſed, (I have ſet down the preciſe term of compreſt Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
written by <hi>Fontana</hi>) wherein I finde many errors.</p>
                     <p>The firſt of which is to think that the meaſures of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
compreſſed in the Channels of thoſe Brooks and Rivers,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60312:12"/>
ſhould maintain themſelves the ſame in <hi>Tiber,</hi> which by his leave,
is moſt falſe, when ever thoſe waters reduced into <hi>Tiber,</hi> retain
not the ſame velocity which they had in the place in which <hi>Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tana</hi>
and his Nephew meaſured them: And all this is manifeſt
from the things which we have above explained; for, if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
reduced into <hi>Tiber</hi> increaſe in velocity, they decreaſe in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and if they decreaſe in velocity, they increaſe in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, I conſider that the meaſures of thoſe Brooks and
Rivers, which enter into <hi>Tiber</hi> at the time of Innundation, are
not between themſelves really the ſame, when their velocities are
not equal, though they have the ſame names of Ells and Feet;
for that its poſſible that a diſinboguement of ten Ells requadrated
(to ſpeak in the phraſe of <hi>Fontana</hi>) of one of thoſe Brooks,
might diſcharge into <hi>Tiber</hi> at the time of Innundation, four, ten,
and twenty times leſs Water, than another mouth equal to the
firſt in greatneſs, as would occur when the firſt mouth were four,
ten, or twenty times leſs ſwift than the ſecond. Whereupon,
whilſt <hi>Fontana</hi> ſummes up the Ells and Feet of the meaſures of
thoſe Brooks and Rivers into a total aggregate, he commits the
ſame error with him, which would add into one ſumme diverſe
moneys of diverſe values, and diverſe places, but that had the
ſame name; as if one ſhould ſay ten Crowns of <hi>Roman</hi> money,
four Crowns of Gold, thirteen Crowns of <hi>Florence,</hi> five Crowns
of <hi>Venice,</hi> and eight Crowns of <hi>Mantua,</hi> ſhould make the ſame
ſumme with forty Crowns of Gold, or forty Crowns of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, It might happen that ſome River or Current in the
parts nearer <hi>Rome,</hi> in the time of its flowing, did not ſend forth
more Water than ordinary; and however, its a thing very clear,
that whilſt the ſtream came from the ſuperior parts, that ſame
Brook or River would be augmented in meaſure, as hath been
noted in the fourth <hi>Corollary;</hi> in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Fontana</hi> might
have inculcated, and noted that ſame River or Current as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
to the Innundation, although it were therein altogether
unconcerned.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, in the fourth place we muſt note, That it might
ſo fall out, that ſuch a River not onely was unintereſſed in the
Innundation, though augmented in meaſure, but it might I ſay
happen, that it was inſtrumental to the aſſwaging the Innunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by augmenting in the meaſure of its own Channel; which
matter is ſufficiently evident; for if it be ſuppoſed that the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in the time of flood, had not had of it ſelf, and from its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſprings more Water than ordinary, its a thing certain, that
the Water of <hi>Tiber</hi> riſing and increaſing; alſo that River, to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
it ſelf with the Water of <hi>Tiber,</hi> would have retained ſome of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60312:12"/>
its Waters in its own Chanel, without diſcharging them into <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
or elſe would have ingorged and ſwallowed (if I may ſo ſay)
ſome of the water of <hi>Tyber;</hi> and in this caſe, at the time of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation,
leſſe abundance of water would have come to <hi>Rome,</hi>
and yet nevertheleſſe the meaſure of that River would have been
increaſed.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, <hi>Fontana</hi> deceiveth himſelf, when he concludeth, that
to remove the Inundation from <hi>Rome,</hi> it would be neceſſary to
make two other Chanels of Rivers, that were as large as that,
which is the preſent one, and that leſs would not ſuffice, which,
I ſay, is a fallacy: and to convince him eaſily of his errour, it
ſufficeth to ſay, that all the Streams being paſſed under the Bridge
<hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> as he himſelf atteſts, a Channel would ſuffice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of the capacity of the ſaid Bridge, provided that the water
there might run with the ſame velocity, as it did under the Bridge
at the time of Inundation; and on the contrary, twenty Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of capacity equal to the preſent one, would not ſuffice, if
the water ſhould run with twenty times leſs velocity, than it made
at the time of the Inundation.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, to me it ſeemeth a great weakneſſe to ſay, that there
ſhould paſſe under the Bridge <hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> an hundred fifty one
ells of water compreſſed; for that I do not underſtand that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is like Cotton or Wool, which matters may be preſt and trod,
as it happeneth alſo to the air, which receiveth compreſſion in
ſuch ſort, that after that in ſome certain place a quantity of air
ſhall be reduced to its natural conſtitution; and having taken up
all the ſaid place, yet nevertheleſſe compreſſing the firſt Air
with force and violence, it is reduced into far leſs room, and will
admit four or ſix times as much air, as before, as is experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<note n="*" place="margin">And as is at large demonſtrated by that moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſonage Mr. <hi>Boile</hi> in the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious experiment of his Pneumatical Engine.</note>ſeen in the Wind-Gun, invented in our dayes by <hi>M. Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenzo
Vincenti</hi> of <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin,</hi> which property of the Air of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
condenſation, is alſo ſeen in the portable Fountains of the
ſame <hi>M. Vincenzo:</hi> which Fountains ſpirt the Water on high,
by force of the Air compreſſed, which whilſt it ſeeks to reduce
its ſelf to its natural conſtitution, in the dilation cauſeth that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence.
But the water can never, for any thing I know, crowd,
or preſs ſo, as that if before the compreſſion it held or poſſeſt a
place, being in its natural conſtitution, I believe not, I ſay, that it
is poſſible, by preſſing and crowding to make it poſſeſs leſs room,
for if it were poſſible to compreſs the Water, and make it to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
a leſs place, it would thence follow, that two Veſſels of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
meaſure, but of unequal height, ſhould be of unequal capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and that ſhould hold more water which was higher; alſo a
Cylinder, or other Veſſel more high than broad, would containe
more water erected, than being laid along; for that being erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60312:13"/>
the water put therein would be more preſſed and crowded.</p>
                     <p>And therefore, in our caſe, according to our principles we will
ſay, that the water of that Stream paſseth all under the ſaid
Bridge <hi>Quattro-Capi,</hi> for that being there moſt ſwift, it ought of
conſequence to be leſs in meaſure.</p>
                     <p>And here one may ſee, into how many errours a man may run
through ignorance of a true and real Principle, which once known
and well underſtood, takes away all miſts of doubting, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily

of velocity in the ſame Current, there are committed by Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
and Learned men, errours of very great moment (and I
could thereof produce examples, but for good reaſons I paſs
them over in ſilence) when they think, and propoſe, by deriving
new Channels from great Rivers, to diminiſh the meaſure of the
water in the River, and to diminiſh it proportionally, according
to the meaſure of the Water which they make to paſs through
the Channel, as making <hi>v.g.</hi> a Channel fifty foot broad, in which
the derived water is to run waſte, ten foot deep, they think they
have diminiſhed the meaſure of the Water in the River five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

is plain; for that the Chanel being derived, the reſt of the
main River, diminiſheth in velocity, and therefore retains a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

conſerve the ſame velocity which it had at firſt in the main Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

to accompt aright, there ſhall not be ſo much water derived into
the Channel, as ſhall diminiſh the River, according to the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

                     <p>THis ſame conſideration giveth me occaſion to diſcover a moſt
ordinary errour, obſerved by me in the buſineſſe of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Ferara,</hi> when I was in thoſe parts, in ſervice of the moſt
Reverend and Illuſtrious Monſignor <hi>Corſini;</hi> the ſublime wit of
whom hath been a very great help to me in theſe contemplations;
its very true, I have been much perplexed, whether I ſhould
commit this particular to paper, or paſſe it over in ſilence, for
that I have ever doubted, that the opinion ſo common and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60312:13"/>
moreover confirmed with a moſt manifeſt experiment, may not
onely make this my conjecture to be eſteemed far from true,
but alſo to diſcredit with the World the reſt of this my Treatiſe:
Nevertheleſſe I have at laſt reſolved not to be wanting to my
ſelf, and to truth in a matter of it ſelf, and for other conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
moſt important; nor doth it ſeem to me requiſite in
difficult matters, ſuch as theſe we have in hand, to reſigne our
ſelves to the common opinion, ſince it would be very ſtrange if
the multitude in ſuch matters ſhould hit on the truth, nor ought
that to be held difficult, in which even the vulgar do know the
truth and right; beſides that I hope moreover to prove all in ſuch
ſort, that perſons of ſolid judgment, ſhall reſt fully perſwaded,
ſo that they but keep in mind the principal ground and foundation
of all this Treatiſe; and though that which I will propoſe, be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
as I have ſaid, pertaining onely to the intereſts of <hi>Ferara;</hi>
yet nevertheleſſe from this particular Doctrine well underſtood,
good judgement may be made of other the like caſes in general.</p>
                     <p>I ſay then, for greater perſpecuity, and better underſtanding
of the whole, That about thirteen miles above <hi>Ferara,</hi> near to
<hi>Stellata,</hi> the main of <hi>Po,</hi> branching it ſelf into two parts, with one
of its Arms it cometh cloſe to <hi>Ferara,</hi> retaining the name of the
<hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara;</hi> and here again it divideth it ſelf into two other
branches, and that which continueth on the right hand, is called
the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta,</hi> and of <hi>Primaro;</hi> and that on the left the <hi>Po</hi>
of <hi>Volana.</hi> But for that the bed of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
augmented and raiſed, it followeth that it reſteth wholly
deprived of the Water of the great <hi>Po,</hi> except in the time of its
greater ſwelling; for in that caſe, this <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
with a Bank near to <hi>Bondeno,</hi> would come alſo in the
overflowings of the main <hi>Po,</hi> to be free from its Waters: But the
Lords of <hi>Ferara</hi> are wont at ſuch time as the <hi>Po</hi> threateneth to
break out, to cut the bank; by which cutting, there diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorgeth
ſuch a Torrent of Water, that it is obſerved, that the
main <hi>Po</hi> in the ſpace of ſome few hours abateth near a foot, and
all perſons that I have ſpoken with hitherto, moved by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment,
think that it is of great profit and benefit to keep ready
this Vent, and to make uſe of it in the time of its fullneſſe. And
indeed, the thing conſidered ſimply, and at the firſt appearance,
it ſeemeth that none can think otherwiſe; the rather, for that
many examining the matter narrowly, meaſure that body of
Water which runneth by the Channel, or Bed of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Fera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
and make account, that the body of the Water of the great
<hi>Po,</hi> is diminiſhed the quantity of the body of the Water which
runneth by the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara.</hi> But if we well remember what
hath been ſaid in the beginning of the Treatiſe, and how much
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60312:14"/>
the variety of the velocities of the ſaid Water importeth, and the
knowledge of them is neceſſary to conclude the true quantity of
the running Water, we ſhall finde it manifeſt, that the benefit of
this Vent is far leſſe than it is generally thought: And mereover,
we ſhall finde, if I deceive not my ſelf, that there follow from
thence ſo many miſchiefs, that I could greatly incline to believe,
that it were more to the purpoſe wholly to ſtop it up, than to
maintain it open: yet I am not ſo wedded to my opinion, but
that I am ready to change my judgement upon ſtrength of better
reaſons; eſpecially of one that ſhall have firſt well underſtood
the beginning of this my diſcourſe, which I frequently inculcate,
becauſe its abſolutely impoſſible without this advertiſement to
treat of theſe matters, and not commit very great errours.</p>
                     <p>I propoſe therefore to conſideration, that although it be true,
that whilſt the water of the main <hi>Po</hi> is at its greateſt height, the
Bank and Dam then cut of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara,</hi> and the ſuperior
waters having a very great fall into the Channel of <hi>Ferara,</hi> they
precipitate into the ſame with great violence and velocity, and
with the ſame in the beginning, or little leſſe, they run towards
the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Volana,</hi> and of <hi>Argenta</hi> on the ſea coaſts; yet after the
ſpace of ſome few hours, the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> being full, and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
Waters not finding ſo great a diclivity there, as they had
at the beginning of the cutting, they fall not into the ſame with
the former velocity, but with far leſſe, and thereby a great deal
leſſe Water begins to iſſue from the great <hi>Po;</hi> and if we dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
compare the velocity at the firſt cutting, with the velocity
of the Water after the cutting made, and when the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi>
ſhall be full of Water, we ſhall finde perhaps that to be fifteen or
twenty times greater than this, and conſequently the Water
which iſſues from the great <hi>Po,</hi> that firſt impetuoſity being paſt,
ſhall be onely the fifteenth or twentieth part of that which iſſued
at the beginning; and therefore the Waters of the main <hi>Po</hi> will
return in a ſmall time almoſt to the firſt height. And here I will
pray thoſe who reſt not wholly ſatisfied with what hath been ſaid,
that for the love of truth, and the common good, they would
pleaſe to make diligent obſervation whether in the time of great
Floods, the ſaid Bank or Dam at <hi>Bondeno</hi> is cut, and that in few
hours the main <hi>Po</hi> diminiſheth, as hath been ſaid about a foot in
its height; that they would obſerve I ſay, whether, a day or two
being paſt, the Waters of the main <hi>Po</hi> return almoſt to their firſt
height; for if this ſhould follow, it would be very clear, that the
benefit which reſulteth from this diverſion or Vent, is not ſo great
as is univerſally preſumed; I ſay, it is not ſo great as is
preſumed; becauſe, though it be granted for true, that
the Waters of the main <hi>Po,</hi> abate at the beginning of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60312:14"/>
the Vent, yet this benefit happens to be but temporary and for a
few hours: If the riſing of <hi>Po,</hi> and the dangers of breaking forth
were of ſhort duration, as it ordinarily befalleth in the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of Torrents, in ſuch a caſe the profit of the Vent would be
of ſome eſteem: But becauſe the ſwellings of <hi>Po</hi> continue for
thirty, or ſometimes for forty dayes, therefore the gain which
reſults from the Vent proveth to be inconſiderable. It remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
now to conſider the notable harms which follow the ſaid
Sluice or Vent, that ſo reflection being made, and the profit and
the detriment compared, one may rightly judge, and chooſe that
which ſhall be moſt convenient. The firſt prejudice therefore
which ariſeth from this Vent or Sluice, is; That the Channels of
<hi>Ferara, Primaro,</hi> and <hi>Volana</hi> filling with Water, all thoſe parts
from <hi>Bondeno</hi> to the Sea ſide are allarmed and endangered
thereby. Secondly, The Waters of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro</hi> having
free ingreſſe into the upper Valleys, they fill them to the great
damage of the Fields adjacent, and obſtruct the courſe of the
ordinary Trenches in the ſame Valleys; inſomuch that all the
care, coſt, and labour about the draining, and freeing the upper
Valleys from Water, would alſo become vain and ineffectual.
Thirdly, I conſider that theſe Waters of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> being
paſſed downwards towards the Sea, at the time that the main <hi>Po</hi>
was in its greater excreſcences and heights, it is manifeſt by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
that when the great <hi>Po</hi> diminiſheth, then theſe Waters
paſſed by the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Ferara</hi> begin to retard in their courſe, and
finally come to turn the current upwards towards <hi>Stellata,</hi> reſting
firſt in the intermediate time, almoſt fixed and ſtanding, and
therefore depoſing the muddineſſe, they fill up the Channel of
the River or Current of <hi>Ferara.</hi> Fourthly and laſtly, There
followeth from this ſame diverſion another notable damage, and
it is like to that which followeth the breaches made by Rivers;
near to which breaches in the lower parts, namely below the
breach, there is begot in the Channel of the River, a certain ridge
or ſhelf, that is, the bottom of the River is raiſed, as is ſufficiently
manifeſt by experience; and thus juſt in the ſame manner cutting
the Bank at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> there is at it were a breach made, from which
followeth the riſing in the lower parts of the main <hi>Po,</hi> being paſt
the mouth of <hi>Pamaro;</hi> which thing, how pernitious it is, let any one
judge that underſtandeth theſe matters. And therefore both for
the ſmall benefit, and ſo many harms that enſue from maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this diverſion, I ſhould think it were more ſound advice to
keep that Bank alwaies whole at <hi>Bondeno,</hi> or in any other conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
place, and not to permit that the Water of the Grand <hi>Po</hi>
ſhould ever come near to <hi>Ferara.</hi>

excreſcencies, its obſerved that far from the Sea, they need
Banks of a notable height; which height goeth afterwards by
degrees diminiſhing, the more it approacheth to the Sea-coaſts:
in ſuch ſort, that the <hi>Po,</hi> diſtant from the Sea about fifty or ſixty
miles at <hi>Ferara,</hi> ſhall have Banks that be above twenty feet
higher than the ordinary Water-marks; but ten or twelve miles
from the Sea, the Banks are not twelve feet higher than the ſaid
ordinary Water-marks, though the breadth of the River be the
ſame, ſo that the excreſcence of the ſame Innundation happens
to be far greater in meaſure remote from the Sea, then near; and
yet it ſhould ſeem, that the ſame quantity of Water paſſing by
every place, the River ſhould need to have the ſame altitude of
Banks in all places: But we by our Principles and fundamentals
may be able to render the reaſon of that effect, and ſay; That
that exceſſe of quantity of Water, above the ordinary Water,
goeth alwaies acquiring greater velocity; the nearer it approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

in one and the ſame plain, equidiſtant from the level, or ſuperior
ſuperficies of the water of the Well; and the ſaid meaſures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt exactly made, the VVater ought conſequently alſo to
be equally divided, and parted according to the proportion of
the meaſures. But if we well conſider every particular, we ſhall
finde, that the Cocks, as they ſucceſſively are greater, diſcharge
alwaies more VVater than the juſt quantity, in compariſon of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60312:17"/>
the leſſer; that is, to ſpeak more properly, The VVater which
paſſeth through the greater Cock, hath alwaies a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to that which paſſeth through the leſſer, than the greater
Cock hath to the leſſer. All which I will declare by an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                     <p>Let there be ſuppoſed for more plainneſs two Squares; (the
ſame may be underſtood of Circles, and other like Figures) The
firſt Square is, as we will ſuppoſe, quadruple to the other, and
theſe Squares are the mouths of two Cocks; one of four inches,
the other of one: Now its manifeſt by what hath been ſaid, that
the VVater which paſſeth by the leſs Cock, findeth its velocity
impeded in the circumference of the Cock; which impediment
is meaſured by the ſaid circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<figure/>
Now it is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that if we would have the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which paſſeth through the
greater Cock, to be onely qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>druple
to that which paſſeth
through the leſſe, in equal ſpaces of time, it would be neceſſary,
that not onely the capacity and the meaſure of the greater Cock
be quadruple to the leſſer Cock, but that alſo the impediment be
quadrupled. Now in our caſe it is true, That the belly and
mouth of the Cock is quadrupled, and yet the impediment is not
quadrupled, but is onely doubled; ſeeing that the circumference
of the greater Square, is onely double to the circumference of
the leſſer Square; for the greater circumference containeth eight
of thoſe parts, of which the leſſer containeth but four, as is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
by the deſcribed Figure; and for that cauſe there ſhall
paſs by the greater Cock, above four times as much VVater, as
ſhall paſs by the leſſer Cock.</p>
                     <p>The like errour occurreth alſo in the other manner of meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the VVater of a Fountain, as may eaſily be collected from
what hath been ſaid and obſerved above.</p>

two impediments which retard its velocity; namely, the touching

the ſame water in paſſing under the Bridge, in our caſe meeteth
with eight of the ſame impediments, bearing, and thruſting upon

                     <p>IT is alſo worthy to conſider the great and admirable benefit
that thoſe fields receive, which are wont to drink up the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
with difficulty, through the height of the water in the
principal Ditches; in which caſe the careful Husbandman cutteth
away the reeds and ruſhes in the Ditches, through which the
waters paſs; whereupon may be preſently ſeen, ſo ſoon as the
reeds and ruſhes are cut, a notable Ebb in the level of the water
in the Ditches; inſomuch that ſometimes it is obſerved, that the
water is abated after the ſaid cutting a third and more, of what it
was before the cutting. The which effect ſeemingly might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on this, That, before thoſe weeds took up room in the
Ditch, and for that cauſe the water kept a higher level, and the
ſaid Plants being afterwards cut and removed, the water came to
abate, poſſeſſing the place that before was occupied by the
weeds: Which opinion, though probable, and at firſt ſight ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
is nevertheleſs inſufficient to give the total reaſon of
that notable abatement which hath been ſpoken of: But it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to have recourſe to our conſideration of the velocity in
the courſe of the water, the chiefeſt and true cauſe of the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the meaſure of the ſame Running-Water; for, that
multitudes of reeds, weeds, and plants diſperſed through the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of the Ditch, do chance notably to retard the courſe of the
water, and therefore the meaſure of the water increaſeth; and
thoſe impediments removed, the ſame water gaineth velocity,
and therefore decreaſeth in meaſure, and conſequently in
height.</p>
                     <p>And perhaps this point well underſtood, may be of great
profit to the fields adjacent to the <hi>Pontine</hi> Fens, and I doubt not
but if the River <hi>Ninfa,</hi> and the other principal Brooks of thoſe
Territories were kept well cleanſed from weeds, their waters
would be at a lower level, and conſequently the drains of the
fields would run into them more readily; it being alwayes to be
held for undoubted, that the meaſure of the water before the
cleanſing, hath the ſame proportion to the meaſure after clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
that the velocity after the cleanſing hath to the velocity
before the cleanſing: And becauſe thoſe weeds being cleanſed
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60312:18"/>
away, the courſe of the water notably increaſeth, it is therefore
neceſſary that the ſaid water abate in meaſure, and become
lower.</p>

                     <p>WE having above obſerved ſome errors that are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in diſtributing the waters of Fountains, and thoſe
that ſerve to water fields; it ſeemeth now fit, by way of
a cloſe to this diſcourſe, to advertiſe by what means theſe divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
may be made juſtly and without error. I therefore think
that one might two ſeveral wayes exquiſitly divide the water of
Fountains; The firſt would be by diligently examining, Firſt,
how much water the whole Fountain diſchargeth in a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
time, as for inſtance: How many Barrels, or Tuns it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in a ſet time; and in caſe you are afterwards to diſtribute
the water, diſtribute it at the rate of ſomany Barrels or Tuns, in
that ſame time; and in this caſe the participants would have
their punctual ſhares: Nor could it ever happen to ſend out more
water, than is reckoned to be in the principal Fountain; as befel
<hi>Giulio Frontino,</hi> and as alſo it frequently happeneth in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Aqueducts, to the publick and private detriment.</p>
                     <p>The other way of dividing the ſame waters of a Fountain, is
alſo ſufficiently exact and eaſie; and may be, by having one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſize for the Cock or Pipe, as ſuppoſe of an inch, or of half an
inch; and when the caſe requireth to diſpence two, three, and
more inches, take ſo many Cocks of the ſaid meaſure as do eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate
the water, which is to be emitted; and if we are to make
uſe onely of one greater Cock, we being to place one to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
for example four inches; and having the former ſole mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of an inch, we muſt make a Cock that is bigger, its true, than
the Cock of one inch; but not ſimply in a quadruple propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
for that it would diſcharge more than juſt ſo much water,
as hath been ſaid above; but we ought to examine diligently
how much water the little Cock emitteth in an hour; and then
enlarge, and contract the greater Cock, ſo, that it may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
four times as much water as the leſſer in the ſame time;
and by this means we ſhall avoid the diſorder hinted in the
ſeventh Appendix. It would be neceſſary nevertheleſs, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
the Cocks of the Ciſtern ſo, that the level of the
water in the Ciſtern may alwayes reſt at one determinate mark
above the Cock, otherwiſe the Cocks will emit ſometimes
greater, and ſometimes leſſe abundance of water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And becauſe
it may be that the ſame water of the Fountain may be ſome times
more abundant, ſometimes leſs; in ſuch caſe it will be neceſſary
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60312:18"/>
to adjuſt the Ciſtern ſo, that the exceſs above the ordinary wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
diſcharge into the publick Fountains, that ſo the particular

water.</p>

                     <p>MUch more difficult is the diviſion of the waters which
ſerve to water the fields, it not being poſſible to obſerve
ſo commodiouſly, what quantity of water the whole
Ditch ſends forth in one determinate time, as may be done in
Fountains: Yet nevertheleſs, if the ſecond propoſition by us a
little below demonſtrated, be well underſtood, there may be
thence taken a very ſafe and juſt way to diſtribute ſuch waters.
The Propoſition therefore by us demonſtrated is this: If there
be two Sections, (namely two mouths of Rivers) the quantity of
the water which paſſeth by the firſt, hath a proportion to that
which paſſeth by the ſecond, compounded of the proportions of
the firſt Section to the ſecond, and of the velocity through
the firſt, to the velocity through the ſecond: As I will declare
for example by help of practice, that I may be underſtood by
all, in a matter ſo important. Let the two mouths of the
Rivers be A, and B, and let 
<figure/>
the mouth A be in meaſure
and content thirty two feet,
and the mouth B, eight feet.
Here you muſt take notice,
that it is not alwayes true, that
the Water which paſſeth by A,
hath the ſame proportion to that which paſſeth by B, that the
mouth A hath to the mouth B; but onely when the velocityes
by each of thoſe paſſages are equal: But if the velocityes ſhall
be unequal, it may be that the ſaid mouths may emit equal
quantity of Water in equal times, though their meaſure be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal;
and it may be alſo, that the bigger doth diſcharge a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
quantity of Water: And laſtly, it may be, that the leſs mouth
diſchargeth more Water than the greater; and all this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
by the things noted in the beginning of this diſcourſe, and
by the ſaid ſecond Propoſition. Now to examine the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Water that paſſeth by one Ditch, to that which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
by another, that this being known, the ſame Waters and
mouths of Ditches may be then adjuſted; we are to keep ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
not onely of the greatneſs of the mouths or paſſages of the
Water, but of the velocity alſo; which we will do, by firſt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
two numbers that have the ſame proportion between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60312:19"/>
as have the mouths, which are the numbers 32 and 8
in our example: Then this 
<figure/>
being done, let the velocity
of the Water by the paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
A and B, be examined
(which may be done keeping
account what ſpace a piece
of Wood, or other body that
ſwimmeth, is carried by the ſtream in one determinate time; as
for inſtance in 50 pulſes) and then work by the golden Rule, as
the velocity by A, is to the velocity by B, ſo is the number 8, to
another number, which is 4. It is clear by what is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ſaid ſecond Propoſition, that the quantity of water,
which paſſeth by the mouth A, ſhall have the ſame proportion of
that which paſſeth by the mouth B, that 8 hath to 1. Such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
being compoſed of the proportions of 32 to 8, and of 8 to
4; namely, to the greatneſs of the mouth A, to the greatneſs of the
mouth B, and of the velocity in A, to the velocity in B. This being
done, we muſt then contract the mouth which diſchargeth more
then its juſt quantity of water, or enlarge the other which diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
leſs, as ſhal be moſt commodious in practice, which to him that
hath underſtood this little that hath been delivered, will be very
eaſie.</p>

                     <p>THeſe opperations about Water, as I have hitherto on ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
occaſions obſerved, are involved in ſo many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſuch a multiplicity of moſt extravagant accidents,
that it is no marvel if continually many, and very important er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
be therein committed by many, and even by Ingeneers
themſelves, and Learned-men; and becauſe many times they
concern not onely the publique, but private intereſts: Hence it
is, that it not onely belongeth to Artiſts to treat thereof, but very
oft even the vulgar themſelves pretend to give their judgement
therein: And I have been troubled many times with a neceſſity
of treating, not onely with thoſe, which either by practice, or
particular ſtudy, underſtood ſomewhat in theſe matters; but alſo
with people wholly void of thoſe notions, which are neceſſary for
one that would on good grounds diſcourſe about this particular;
and thus many times have met with more difficulty in the thick
skulls of men, than in precipitous Torrents, and vaſt Fennes.
And in particular, I had occaſion ſome years paſt to go ſee the
Cave or Emiſſary of the Lake of <hi>Perugia,</hi> made many years agon
by <hi>Braccio Fortobraccio,</hi> but for that it was with great ruines by
Time decayed, and rendred unuſeful, it was repaired with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60312:19"/>
truly heroicall and admirable, by Monſignor <hi>Maffei Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berino,</hi>
then Prefect for the Wayes, and now Pope. And being
neceſſitated, that I might be able to walk in the Cave, and for
other cauſes, I let down the Sluices of the ſaid Cave, at the mouth
of the Lake: No ſooner were they ſtopt, but a great many of the
people of the Towns and Villages coaſting upon the Lake
flocking thither, began to make grievous complaints, that if thoſe
Sluices were kept ſhut, not onely the Lake would want its due
Vent, but alſo the parts adjacent to the Lake would be over
flown to their very great detriment. And becauſe at firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
their motion ſeemed very reaſonable, I found my ſelf hard
put to it, ſeeing no way to perſwade ſuch a multitude, that the
prejudice which they pretended I ſhould do them by keeping
the Sluices ſhut for two dayes, was abſolutely inſenſible; and that
by keeping them open, the Lake did not ebb in the ſame time ſo
much as the thickneſs of a ſheet of Paper: And therefore I was
neceſſitated to make uſe of the authority I had, and ſo followed
my buſineſs as cauſe required, without any regard to that Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
tumultuouſly aſſembled. Now when I am not working with
Mattock or Spade, but with the Pen and Diſcourſe, I intend to
demonſtrate clearly to thoſe that are capable of reaſon, and that
have well underſtood the ground of this my Treatiſe, that the
fear was altogether vain which thoſe people conceited. And
therefore I ſay, that the Emiſſary or Sluice of the Lake of <hi>Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia,</hi>
ſtanding in the ſame manner as at preſent, and the water
paſſing thorow it with the ſame velocity as now; to examine
how much the Lake may abate in two days ſpace, we ought to
conſider, what proportion the ſuperficies of the whole Lake hath
to the meaſure of the Section of the Emiſſary, and afterwards to
infer, that the velocity of the water by the Emiſſary or Sluice,
ſhall have the ſame proportion to the abatement of the Lake,
and to prove thorowly and clearly this diſcourſe, I intend to
demonſtrate the following Propoſition.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe a Veſſel of any bigneſſe, and that it hath an Emiſſary
or Cock, by which it diſchargeth its water. And look what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
the ſuperficies of the 
<figure/>
veſſel hath to the meaſure of
the ſection of the cock, ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
ſhall the velocity of the
Water in the Cock have to the
abatement of the Lake. Let the
Veſſel be ABCD, HILB, through which the Water runneth,
the ſuperficies of the Water in the Veſſel AD, and the ſection
of the Cock H L: and let the Water in the Veſſel
be ſuppoſed to have falne in one determinate time from A to F.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60312:20"/>
I ſay that the proportion of the ſuperficies of the Veſſel AD is
in proportion to the meaſure of the ſection of the Emiſſary
HL, as the velocity of the Emiſſary or Cock to the line AF;
which is manifeſt, for that the Water in the Veſsel moving by
the line AF; as far as F, and the whole maſs of Water AG
diſcharging it ſelf, and in the ſame time the ſame quantity of
Water being diſcharged by the ſection of the Emiſſary HL; it
is neceſſary by what I have demonſtrated in the third Propoſition,
and alſo explained in the beginning of this Treatiſe, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
by the Emiſſary or Cock be in proportion to the velocity
of the abatement, as the ſuperficies of the Veſſel to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the ſection of the Emiſſary, which was to be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                     <p>That which hath been demonſtrated in the Veſſel, falls out ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
alſo in our Lake of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and its Emiſsary; and becauſe
the immenſity of the ſuperficies of the Lake is in proportion to
the ſuperficies of the Emiſsary or Sluice, as many millions to
one, as may be eaſily calculated; it is manifeſt, that ſuch abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhall be imperceptible, and almoſt nothing, in two dayes
ſpace, nay in four or ſix: and all this will be true, when we
ſuppoſe that for that time there entreth no other Water into the
Lake from Ditches or Rivolets, which falling into the Lake would
render ſuch abatement yet leſs.</p>
                     <p>Now we ſee, that it's neceſsary to examine ſuch abatements
and riſings, with excellent reaſons, or at leaſt, with accurate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments,
before we reſolve and conclude any thing; and how
farre the vulgar are diſtant from a right judgement in ſuch
matters.</p>

                     <p>FOR greater confirmation of all this which I have ſaid, I
will inſtance in another like caſe, which alſo I met with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,
wherein, for that the buſineſs was not rightly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
many diſorders, vaſt expences, and conſiderable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
have followed. There was heretofore an Emiſsary or
Sluice made to drain the Waters, which from Rains, Springs, and
Rivolets fall into a Lake; to the end, the ſhores adjoyning on
the Lake, ſhould be free from the overflowing of the Waters;
but becauſe perhaps the enterprize was not well managed and
carried on, it fell out, that the Fields adjacent to the ſaid Chanel
could not drain, but continued under water; to which diſorders
a preſent remedy hath been uſed, namely, in a time convenient
to ſtop up the Sluice, by meanes of certain Floodgates kept on
purpoſe for that end; and thus abating the Level of the Water
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60312:20"/>
in the Emiſſary, in the ſpace of three or four dayes, the Fields
have been haply drained. But on the other part, the proprietors
bordering on the Lake oppoſed this, grievouſly complaining, that
whilſt the Floodgates are ſhut, and the courſe of the Water of
the Sluice hindered, the Lake overflowes the Lands adjacent, by
meanes of the Rivers that fell into it, to their very great damage;
and ſo continuing their ſuits, they got more of vexation than ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
Now, being asked my opinion herein, I judged it
requiſite (ſince the point in controverſie was about the riſing
and falling of the Lake) that the ſaid abatement, when the
Floodgates are open, and increaſe when they are ſhut ſhould be
exactly meaſured, and told them, that it might be eaſily done at
a time when no extraordinary Waters fell into the Lake, neither
of Rain, or otherwiſe; and the Lake was undiſturbed by winds
that might drive the Water to any ſide, by planting neer to an
Iſlet, which is about the middle of the Lake, a thick poſt, on
which ſhould be made the marks of the Lakes riſing and falling
for two or three dayes. I would not, at that time, pawn, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
declare, my judgment, in regard I might be, by divers
accidents miſſed. But this I told them, that (by what I have
demonſtrated, and particularly that which I have ſaid above
touching the Lake of <hi>Perugia</hi>) I inclined greatly to think,
that theſe riſings and fallings would prove imperceptible, and
inconſiderable; and therefore, that in caſe experience ſhould
make good my reaſon, it would be to no purpoſe for them to
continue diſputing and wrangling, which cauſeth, (according

paſt, being in <hi>Perugia,</hi> where we held our General
Convention, having underſtood that the Lake <hi>Thraſimeno,</hi> by
the great drought of many Moneths was much abated, It came
into my head, to go privately and ſee this novelty, both for my
particular ſatisfaction, as alſo that I might be able to relate the
whole to my Patrons, upon the certitude of my own ſight of the
place. And ſo being come to the Emiſſary of the Lake, I found
that the Level of the Lakes ſurface was ebbed about five Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Palmes of its wonted watermark, inſomuch that it was lower
than the tranſome of the mouth of the Emiſſary, by the length
of—this deſcribed line, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no Water iſſued out of the Lake, to the great prejudice of
all the places and villages circumjacent, in regard that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which uſed to run from the ſaid Lake turned 22 Mills, which
not going, neceſſitated the inhabitants of thoſe parts to go a

to <hi>Perugia,</hi> there followed a Rain, not very great, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
and even, which laſted for the ſpace of eight hours, or

in <hi>Perugia,</hi> how much the Lake was increaſed and raiſed by this
Rain, ſuppoſing (as it was probable enough) that the Rain had
been univerſal over all the Lake; and like to that which fell in
<hi>Perugia,</hi> and to this purpoſe I took a Glaſſe formed like a Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder,
about a palme high, and half a palme broad; and having
put in water ſufficient to cover the bottome of the Glaſſe, I no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
diligently the mark of the height of the Water in the Glaſſe,
and afterwards expoſed it to the open weather, to receive the
Raine-water, which fell into it; and I let it ſtand for the
ſpace of an hour; and having obſerved that in that time the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
was riſen in the Veſſel the height of the following line—,
I conſidered that if I had expoſed to the ſame rain ſuch other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
equal to that, the Water would have riſen in them all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that meaſure: And thereupon concluded, that alſo in all
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60312:21"/>
the whole extent of the Lake, it was neceſſary the Water ſhould
be raiſed in the ſpace of an hour the ſame meaſure. Yet here I
conſidered two difficulties that might diſturb and altar ſuch an
effect, or at leaſt render it inobſerveable, which afterwards well
weighed, and reſolved, left me (as I will tell you anon) in the
concluſion the more confirmed; that the Lake ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
in the ſpace of eight hours, that the rain laſted eight
times that meaſure. And whilſt I again expoſed the Glaſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the experiment, there came unto me an Ingeneer to talk
with me touching certain affairs of our Monaſtary of <hi>Perugia,</hi> and
diſcourſing with him, I ſhewed him the Glaſs out at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
window, expoſed in a Court-yard; and communicated to
him my fancy, relating unto him all that I had done. But I
ſoon perceived that this brave fellow conceited me to be but of
a dull brain, for he ſmiling ſaid unto me; Sir, you deceive
your ſelf: I am of opinion that the Lake will not be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by this rain, ſo much as the thickneſſe of a<note n="*" place="margin">A Coyn of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> worth ſix pence.</note> 
                        <hi>Julio.</hi>
Hearing him pronounce this his opinion with freeneſs and
confidence, I urged him to give me ſome reaſon for what he
ſaid, aſſuring him, that I would change my judgement, when I
ſaw the ſtrength of his Arguments: To which he anſwered, that
he had been very converſant about the Lake, and was every day
upon it, and was well aſſured that it was not at all increaſed. And
importuning him further, that he would give me ſome reaſon
for his ſo thinking, he propoſed to my conſideration the great
drought paſſed, and that that ſame rain was nothing for the
great parching: To which I anſwered, I believe Sir that the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the Lake, on which the rain had fallen was moiſtned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore ſaw not how its drought, which was nothing at all,
could have drunk up any part of the rain. For all this he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in his conceit, without yielding in the leaſt to my allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
he granted in the end (I believe in civility to me) that
my reaſon was plauſible and good, but that in practiſe it could
not hold. At laſt to clear up all, I made one be called, and
ſent him to the mouth of the Emiſſary of the Lake, with order
to bring me an exact account, how he found the water of the
Lake, in reſpect of the Tranſome of the Sluice. Now here,
Signore <hi>Galilaeo,</hi> I would not have you think that I had brought
the matter in hand to concern me in my honour; but believe me
(and there are witneſſes of the ſame ſtill living) that my meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
returning in the evening to <hi>Perugia,</hi> he brought me word,
that the water of the Lake began to run through the Cave; and
that it was riſen almoſt a fingers breadth above the Tranſome:
Inſomuch, that adding this meaſure, to that of the lowneſs of
the ſurface of the Lake, beneath the Tranſome before the rain,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60312:22"/>
it was manifeſt that the riſing of the Lake cauſed by the rain, was
to a hair thoſe four fingers breadth that I had judged it to be.
Two dayes after I had another bout with the Ingeneer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to him the whole buſineſs, to which he knew not what to
anſwer.</p>
                     <p>Now the two difficulties which I thought of, able to impede
my concluſion, were theſe following: Firſt, I conſidered that
it might be, that the Wind blowing from the ſide where the
Sluice ſtood, to the Lake-ward; the mole and maſs of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Lake might be driven to the contrary ſhore; on which
the Water riſing, it might be fallen at the mouth of the Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and ſo the obſervation might be much obſcured. But this
difficulty wholly vaniſhed by reaſon of the Aires great tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
which it kept at that time, for no Wind was ſtirring on any
ſide, neither whilſt it rained, nor afterwards.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond difficulty which put the riſing in doubt, was, That
having obſerved in <hi>Florence,</hi> and elſewhere, thoſe Ponds into
which the rain-water, falling from the houſe, is conveyed
through the Common-ſhores: And that they are not thereby
ever filled, but that they ſwallow all that abundance of water,
that runs into them by thoſe conveyances which ſerve them with
water; inſomuch that thoſe conveyances which in time of
drought maintain the Pond, when there comes new abundance
of water into the Pond, they drink it up, and ſwallow it: A like
effect might alſo fall out in the Lake, in which there being many
veins (as it is very likely) that maintain and feed the Lake; theſe
veins might imbibe the new addition of the Rain-water, and ſo
by that means annull the riſing; or elſe diminiſh it in ſuch ſort, as
to render it inobſervable. But this difficulty was eaſily reſolved
by conſidering my Treatiſe of the meaſure of Running-Waters;
foraſmuch as having demonſtrated, that the abatement of a Lake
beareth the reciprocal proportion to the velocity of the Emiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which the meaſure of the Section of the Emiſſary of the Lake,
hath to the meaſure of the ſurface of the Lake: making the
calculation and account, though in groſs; by ſuppoſing that its
veins were ſufficiently large, and that the velocity in them were
notable in drinking up the water of the Lake; yet I found never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
that many weeks and moneths would be ſpent in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the new-come abundance of water by the rain, ſo that
I reſted ſure, that the riſing would enſue, as in effect it did.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe many of accurate judgement, have again cauſed
me to queſtion this riſing, ſetting before me, that the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
parched by the great drought, that had ſo long continued, it
might be, that that Bank of Earth which environed the brink of
the Lake, being dry, and imbibing great abundance of Water
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60312:22"/>
from the increaſing Lake, would not ſuffer it to increaſe in
height: I ſay therefore, that if we would rightly conſider this
doubt here propoſed, we ſhould, in the very conſideration of it,
ſee it reſolved; for, it being ſuppoſed that that liſt or border of
Banks which was to be occupied by the increaſe of the Lake, be
a Brace in breadth quite round the Lake, and that by reaſon of
its dryneſs it ſucks in water, and that by that means this propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water co-operates not in raiſing of the Lake: It is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary on the other hand, that we conſider, That the
Circuit of the water of the Lake being thirty miles, as its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
held, that is to ſay, Ninety thouſand Braces of <hi>Florence</hi>
in compaſs; and therefore admitting for true, that each Brace of
this Bank drink two quarts of water, and that for the ſpreading
it require three quarts more, we ſhall finde, that the whole agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
of this portion of water, which is not imployed in the raiſing
of the Lake, will be four hundred and fifty thouſand Quarts of
water; and ſuppoſing that the Lake be ſixty ſquare miles, three
thouſand Braces long, we ſhall finde, that to diſpence the water
poſſeſt by the Bank about the Lake, above the total ſurface of
the Lake, it ought to be ſpread ſo thin, that one ſole quart of
water may over-ſpread ten thouſand ſquare Braces of ſurface:
ſuch a thinneſs, as muſt much exceed that of a leaf of beaten
Gold, and alſo leſs than that skin of water which covers the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of it: and ſuch would that be, which thoſe men would have
ſubſtracted from the riſing of the Lake: But again, in the ſpace
of a quarter of an hour at the beginning of the rain, all that
Bank is ſoaked by the ſaid rain, ſo that we need not for the
moiſtning of it, imploy a drop of that water which falleth into
the Lake. Beſides we have not brought to account that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of water which runs in time of rain into the Lake, from
the ſteepneſs of the adjacent Hills and Mountains; which would
be enough to ſupply all our occaſions: So that, neither ought
we for this reaſon to queſtion our pretended riſing. And this
is what hath fallen in my way touching the conſideration of the
<hi>Thraſimcnian</hi> Lake.</p>
                     <p>After which, perhaps ſomewhat raſhly, wandring beyond my
bounds, I proceeded to another contemplation, which I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to you, hoping that you will receive it, as collected with
theſe cautions requiſite in ſuch like affairs; wherein we ought
not too poſitively to affirm any thing of our own heads for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
but ought to ſubmit all to the ſound and ſecure delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Holy Mother-Church, as I do this of mine, and all
others; moſt ready to change my judgement, and conform my
ſelf alwaies to the deliberations of my Superiors. Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60312:23"/>
therefore my above-ſaid conceit about the riſing of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in the glaſs tried before, it came into my minde, that the
forementioned rain having been very gentle, it might well be,
that if there ſhould have faln a Rain fifty, an hundred, or a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
times greater than this, and much more intenſe (which
would inſue as oft as thoſe falling drops were four, five or ten
times bigger than thoſe of the above-mentioned rain, keeping
the ſame number) in ſuch a caſe its manifeſt, that in the ſpace
of an hour the Water would riſe in our Glaſs, two, three, and
perhaps more Yards or Braces; and conſequently, if ſuch a
Raine ſhould fall upon a Lake, that the ſaid Lake would
riſe, according to the ſame rate: And likewiſe, if ſuch a
Rain were univerſall, over the whole Terreſtriall Globe, it
would neceſſarily, in the ſpace of an hour, make a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of two, or three braces round about the ſaid Globe.
And becauſe we have from Sacred Records, that in the
time of the Deluge, it rained fourty dayes and fourty nights;
namely, for the ſpace of 960 houres; its clear, that if the ſaid
Rain had been ten times bigger than ours at <hi>Perugia,</hi> the riſing
of the Waters above the Terreſtrial Globe would reach and paſs
a mile higher than the tops of the Hills and Mountains that are
upon the ſuperficies of the Earth; and they alſo would concur
to increaſe the riſe. And therefore I conclude, that the riſe of
the Waters of the Deluge have a rational congruity with natural
Diſcourſes, of which I know very well that the eternal truths of
the Divine leaves have no need; but however I think ſo clear an
agreement is worthy of our conſideration, which gives us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to adore and admire the greatneſſe of God in his mighty
Works, in that we are ſometimes able, in ſome ſort, to meaſure
them by the ſhort Standard of our Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>Many Leſſons alſo may be deduced from the ſame Doctrine,
which I paſſe by, for that every man of himſelf may eaſily know
them, having once ſtabliſhed this Maxime; That it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to pronounce any thing, of a certainty, touching the quantity
of Running Waters, by conſidering only the ſingle vulgar mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of the Water without the velocity; and ſo on the contrary,
he that computes only the velocity, without the meaſure, ſhall
commit very great errours; for treating of the meaſure of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Waters, it is neceſſary, the water being a body, in handling
its quantity, to conſider in it all the three dimenſions of breadth,
depth, and length: the two firſt dimenſions are obſerved by all
in the common manner, and ordinary way of meaſuring Running
Waters; but the third dimenſion of length is omitted; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſuch an overſight is committed, by reaſon the length of Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60312:23"/>
Water is reputed in ſome ſenſe infinite, in that it never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
to move away, and as infinite is judged incomprehenſible;
and ſuch as that there is no exact knowledge to be had thereof;
&amp; ſo there comes to be no account made thereof; but if we ſhould
make ſtrict reflection upon our conſideration of the velocity of
Water, we ſhould find, that keeping account of the ſame, there
is a reckoning alſo made of the length; foraſmuch as whilſt we
ſay, the Water of ſuch a Spring runs with the velocity of paſſing
a thouſand or two thouſand paces an hour: this in ſubſtance is
no other than if we had ſaid, ſuch a Fountain diſchargeth in an
hour a Water of a thouſand or two thouſand paces long. So
that, albeit the total length of Running water be incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
as being infinite, yet nevertheleſſe its rendered intelligible
by parts in its velocity. And ſo much ſufficeth to have hinted
about this matter, hoping to impart on ſome other occaſion other
more accurate Obſervations in this affair.</p>

                        <head type="sub">A Chanel of Water being given whoſe breadth exceeds not
twenty Palms, or thereabouts, and whoſe quick height
is leſs than five Palms, to meaſure the quantity of the
Water that runneth thorow the Chanel in a time

                        <p>PLace in the Chanel a Regulator, and obſerve the quick
height in the ſaid Regulator; then let the water be turned
away from the Chanel by a Chanellet of three or four Palms
in breadth, or thereabouts: And that being done, meaſure the
quantity of the water which paſſeth thorow the ſaid Chanellet,
as hath been taught in the ſecond Propoſition; and at the ſame
time obſerve exactly how much the quick height ſhall be abated
in the greater Chanel, by means of the diverſion of the Chanel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let;
and all theſe particulars being performed, multiply the quick
height of the greater Chanel into it ſelf, and likewiſe multiply
into it ſelf the leſſer height of the ſaid bigger Chanel, and the
leſſer ſquare being taken, from the greater, the remainder ſhall
have the ſame proportion to the whole greater ſquare, as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Chanellet diverted, hath to the water of the bigger
Chanel: And becauſe the water of the Chanellet is known by
the Method laid down in the firſt Theorem, and the terms of the
Theorem being alſo known, the quantity of the water which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
thorow the bigger Chanel, ſhall be alſo known by the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Rule, which was that that was deſired to be known. We
will explain the whole buſineſs by an example.</p>
                        <p>Let a Chanel be, for example, 15 Palms broad, its quick height
before its diverſion by the Chanellet ſhall be ſuppoſed to be 24
inches; but after the diverſion, let the quick height of the Chanel
be onely 22 inches. Therefore the greater height to the leſſer,
is as the number 11. to 12. But the ſquare of 11. is 121, and the
ſquare of 12. is 144, the difference between the ſaid leſſer
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60312:33"/>
ſquare and the greater is 23. Therefore the diverted water, is
to the whole water, as 23. to 144: which is well near as 1 to
6 6/23: and that is the proportion that the quantity of the water
which runneth through the Chanellet ſhall have, to all the water
that runneth thorow the great Chanel. Now if we ſhould finde
by the Rule mentioned above in the firſt Propoſition, that the
quantity of the water that runneth through the Chanellet, is
<hi>v. g.</hi> an hundred Barrels, in the ſpace of 15 ſecond minutes of
an hour, it is manifeſt, that the water which runneth through the
great Chanel in the ſaid time of 35 min. ſec. ſhall be about 600
Barrels.</p>

                           <p>ANd becauſe very often in applying the Theory to Practice
it happeneth, that all the neceſſary particulars in the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory
cannot ſo eaſily be put in execution; therefore we will
here add another way of performing the ſame Problem, if it ſhould
chance to happen that the Chanellet could not commodiouſly be
diverted from the great Chanel, but that it were eaſier for the
water of another ſmaller Chanel to be brought into the greater
Chanel; which water of the ſmaller Chanel might be eaſily mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
as hath been ſhewen in the firſt Probleme; or in caſe that
there did fall into a greater Chanel, a leſſer Chanel that might
be diverted and meaſured. Therefore I ſay in the firſt caſe, If
we would meaſure the quantity of the water that runneth in a
certain time thorow the greater Chanel, into which another leſſer
Chanel that is meaſurable may be brought, we muſt firſt exactly
meaſure the Chanellet, and then obſerve the quick height of the
greater Chanel, before the introduction of the leſſer; and having
brought in the ſaid Chanellet, we muſt agnin find the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that the water of the Chanellet hath to all the water of the
great Chanel; for theſe terms of the proportion being known, as
alſo the quantity of the water of the Chanellet, we ſhall alſo
come to know the quantity of the water that runneth thorow
the great Chanel. It is likewiſe manifeſt, that we ſhall obtain
our intent, if the caſe were that there entered into the great
Chanel, another leſſer Chanel that was meaſurable, and that
might be diverted.</p>

only one third of its whole height; but moreover diverting the 4/9, it
ſhall abate two other thirds, a moſt principal point; and ſuch,
that its not having been well underſtood, hath cauſed very great
diſorders, and there would now, more than ever, follow extream
dammage, if one ſhould put in execution the diverſion of the <hi>Sile</hi>
and other Rivers; and it is manifeſt, that in the ſame manner,
wherewith it hath been demonſtrated, that the quantity of the

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60312:35"/>
double, and the quantity increaſing nonuple, the height increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
triple; ſo that, by adding to units all the odde numbers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Series, the heights increaſe according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural

there paſſing thorow a Regulator ſuch a certain quantity of

height is two of thoſe parts, which at firſt was one; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to adde five of thoſe ſaid meaſures, the height is three of

that is placed under the number 9. in the Additions, and 5. in

requiſite to add to make the River riſe ſo, as that it may run in
height 8. of thoſe parts of which before it ran but 5; one
ought to take the ſum of the number of the Series of Additions

afterwards ſhould ſee that it runneth 8 Palms high, finding in the
row of quantity the number placed under 8. which is 64. we would
ſay that the River heightned, carrieth of water 64. of thoſe parts
whereof it carried before but 25; and becauſe before it carried
2500. meaſures, by the Golden Rule we will ſay, that the River
carrieth 6400. of thoſe meaſures, of which before it carried 2500.</p>
                           <p>In this progreſs of Nature, is one thing really curious, and that

think that a River in height, <hi>v. g.</hi> 10. Palms, running and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an hundred meaſures in a minute of an hour, is to abate but
one Palm, onely by the diverſion of 19. of thoſe meaſures; and
then again, that the buiſineſs cometh to that paſs, that it abateth
likewiſe a Palm by the diverſion of three onely of thoſe meaſures,
nay, by the diverſion of but one meaſure? and yet it is moſt
certain: And this truth meets with ſo manifeſt proofs in experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that it is very admirable! And for the full ſatisfaction of
thoſe, who not being able to comprehend ſubtil demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
deſire to be clearly inform'd by the matters of fact, and to
ſee with their bodily eyes, and touch with their hands, what their
underſtanding and reaſon cannot reach unto: I will hear add
another very eaſie way to reduce all to an experiment, the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60312:36"/>
which may be made in little, in great, or in very great; of
which I make uſe frequently, to the admiration of ſuch as ſee it.</p>
                           <p>I prepared an hundred Siphons, or, if you will, bowed Pipes,
all equal; and placed them at the brim of a Veſſel, wherein the
water is kept at one and the ſame level (whether all the Syphons
work, or but a certain number of them) the mouths by which
the water iſſueth being all placed in the ſame level, parallel to
the Horizon; but lower in level than the water in the Veſſel; and
gathered all the water falling from the Syphons into another
Veſſel ſtanding lower than the former, I made it to run away
thorow a Chanel, in ſuch manner inclined, that wanting water
from the Syphons, the ſaid Chanel remained quite dry.</p>
                           <p>And this done, I meaſured the quick height of the Chanel
with care, and afterwards divided it exactly into 10 equal parts,
and cauſing 19. of thoſe Syphons to be taken away, ſo that the
Chanel did not run water, ſave onely with 81 of thoſe Syphons,
I again obſerved the quick height of the water in the ſame ſite
obſerved before, and found that its height was diminiſhed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
the tenth part of all its firſt height; and thus continuing to
take away 17. other Syphons, the height was likewiſe diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
1/10 of all its firſt quick height; and trying to take away 15.
Syphons, then 13, then 11, then 9, then 7, then 5, and then 3.
alwaies in theſe diverſions, made in order as hath been ſaid, there
enſued ſtill an abatement of 1/10 of the whole height.</p>
                           <p>And here was one thing worthy of obſervation, that the water
encreaſing in [<hi>or through</hi>] the Chanel, its quick height was diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in different ſites of the Chanel, that is ſtill leſſer, the more
one approached to the Out-let; notwithſtanding which the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
followed in all places proportionably, that is in all its ſites
the firſt part of the height of that ſite diminiſhed: And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
the water iſſued from the Chanel, and dilated into a broader
courſe, from which likewiſe having divers Out-lets and Mouths;
yet nevertheleſs in that breadth alſo the quick heights ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
varied and altered in the ſame proportions. Nor did I here
deſiſt my obſervation, but the water being diminiſhed, that iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the Syphons, and there being but one of them left that
diſcharged water; I obſerved the quick height that it made in the
above-ſaid ſites, (the which was likewiſe 1/10 of all the firſt height)
there being added to the water of that Syphon, the water of
three other Syphons; ſo that all the water was of 4 Syphons,
and conſequently quadruple to the firſt Syphon; but the quick
height was onely double, and adding five Siphons, the quick
height became triple, and with adding ſeven Syphons, the height
increaſed quadruple; and ſo by adding of 9. it increaſed quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuple,
and by adding of 11. it increaſed ſextuple, and by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60312:36"/>
of 13. it increaſed ſeptuple, and by adding of 15. octuple,
and by adding of 17. nonuple, and laſtly by adding 19. Syphons;
ſo that all the water was centuple to the water of one Syphon,
yet nevertheleſs the quick height of all this water was onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuple
to the firſt height conjoyned by the water that iſſued from
one onely Syphon.</p>
                           <p>For the more clear underſtanding of all which, I have made
the following Figure; in which we have the mouth A, that
maintaineth the water of the Veſſel BC in the ſame level; though
it continually run; to the brim of the Veſſel are put 25. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons
(and there may be many more) divided into 5 Claſſes,
DEFGH, and the firſt D, are of one onely Syphon; the ſecond
E, of three Syphons; the third F, of five; the fourth G, of 7; the
fifth H, of 9; and one may ſuppoſe the ſixth of 11, the ſeventh
of 13 Syphons, and ſo of the other Claſſes, all containing in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
odd numbers ſucceſſively (we are content to repreſent in
the Figure no more but the five forenamed Claſſes to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion)
the gathered water DEFGH, which runneth thorow
the Chanel IKL, and falleth into the out-let MNOP; and ſo
much ſufficeth for the explanation of this experiment.</p>

almoſt impoſſible to make uſe of the Regulator number, if
one be about to meaſure the water of ſome great River,
and conſequently would be impoſſible, or at leaſt very difficult
to reduce the Theory of the firſt Probleme into practice: Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
I could ſay that ſuch great conceits of meaſuring the
water of a great River, are not to come into the minds of any
but great Perſonages, and potent Princes; of whom it is expected
for their extraordinary concerns, that they will make theſe kinde
of enquiries; as if here in <hi>Italy</hi> it ſhould be of the Rivers <hi>Tyber,
Velino, Chiana, Arno, Serchio, Adice,</hi> in which it ſeemeth real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
difficult to apply the Regulator, to finde exactly the quick
height of the River: But becauſe in ſuch like caſes ſometimes
it would turn to account to be at ſome charge, to come to the
exact and true knowledge of the quantity of water which that
River carrieth, by knowledge whereof, other greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſments
might afterwards be avoided, that would oft times be
made in vain; and prevent the diſguſts, which ſometimes happen
amongſt Princes: Upon this ground I think it will be well to
ſhew alſo the way how to make uſe of the Regulator in theſe
great Rivers; in which if we will but open our eyes, we ſhall meet
with good ones, and thoſe made without great coſt or labour,
which will ſerve our turn.</p>
                        <p>For upon ſuch like Rivers there are Wears, or Lockes made,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60312:37"/>
to cauſe the Waters to riſe, and to turn them for the ſervice of
Mills, or the like. Now in theſe Caſes it is ſufficient, that one
erect upon the two extreames of the Weare two Pilaſters either
of Wood or Brick, which with the bottome of the Weare do
compoſe our Regulator, wherewith we may make our deſired
operation, yea the Chanel it ſelf diverted ſhall ſerve, without
making any other diverſion or union. And in brief, if the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes

and helps be made uſe of, according to occaſion, of which it
would be too tedious to ſpeak, and therefore this little that hath

                        <p>
                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough the principal cauſe be but one
onely, that in my judgment threatneth
irreparable ruine to the Lake of
<hi>Venice,</hi> in the preſent ſtate in which it
now ſtands; Yet nevertheleſſe, I think
that two Heads may be conſidered.
And this Conſideration may peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſerve us for to facilitate and explain
the opportune remedies, though not to
render the ſtate of things abſolutely unchangeable and eternal:
an enterprize impoſſible, and eſpecially in that which having had
ſome beginning, ought likewiſe neceſſarily to have its end; or
at leaſt to prevent the danger for many hundreds of years; and
poſſibly it may, in the mean time, by the mutation it ſelf be
brought into a better condition.</p>
                        <p>I ſay therefore, that the preſent diſorder may be conſidered
under two Heads; One is the very notable diſcovery of Land
that is obſerved at the time of low Water, the which, beſides
the obſtructing of Navigation in the Lake and alſo in the
Chanels, doth likewiſe threaten another miſchief and diſorder
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60312:39"/>
worthy of very particular conſideration, which is, That the Sun
drying up that mudde, eſpecially in the times of hot Summers,
doth raiſe thence the putrified and pernicious vapours, fogs, and
exhalations that infect the Air, and may render the City unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Head is the great Stoppage that daily is grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Ports, eſpecially of <hi>Venice,</hi> at <hi>Malamoco;</hi> concerning
which matters I will hint certain general points, and then
will proceed to the more particular and important affairs.</p>
                        <p>And firſt, I ſay, that I hold it altogether impoſſible to effect
any thing, though never ſo profitable, which doth not bring with
it ſome miſchief; and therefore the good and the hurt ought to
be very well weighed, and then the leſſe harmful part to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I propoſe to conſideration, that the ſo notable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
of Earth &amp; Mud, hath not been long obſerved, as I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
from old perſons that can remember paſſages for fifty
years paſt; which thing being true, as to me it ſeemeth moſt
true, it ſhould appear that it could not but be good to reduce
matters to that paſſe that they were at formerly, (laying aſide
all affection or paſſion that ſelf-flattering minds have entertained
for their own conceits) or at leaſt it ſhall be neceſſary ſpeedily to
conſult the whole.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, I hold that it is neceſſary to weigh, whether from the
foreſaid diſcovery of Land, it followeth, that onely the Earth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
as it is commonly thought by all, without diſpute; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Waters are abated and faln away; or elſe whether it
proceedeth from both the one and other cauſe. And here it would
be ſeaſonable to enquire, what ſhare the ſaid cauſes may have,
each conſidered apart in the foreſaid effect. For, in the firſt
caſe, if the Earth have been raiſed, it would be neceſſary to
conſider of taking it down, and removing it: But if the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have failed or abated, I believe that it would be extreamly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to reſtore and raiſe them: And if both theſe reaſons have
conſpired in this effect, it will be neceſſary to remedy them each
apart. And I do, for my part, think, that the ſo notable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of Shelves at the time of low Water, proceeds principally
from the decreaſe and abatement of the Waters, which may
confidently be affirmed to need no other proof, in regard that the
<hi>Brent</hi> hath been actually diverted which did formerly diſcharge
its Water into the Lake.</p>
                        <p>As to the other point of the great Stoppage of Ports, I hold,
that all proceedeth from the violence of the Sea, which being
ſometimes diſturbed by windes, eſpecially at the time of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
flowing, doth continually raiſe from its bottome immenſe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60312:39"/>
heaps of ſand, carrying them by the tide; and force of the waves
into the Lake; it not having on its part any ſttength of current
that may raiſe and carry them away, they ſink to the bottom, and
ſo they choke up the Ports. And that this effect happeneth in
this manner, we have moſt frequent experiences thereof along the
Sea-coaſts: And I have obſerved in <hi>Tuſcany</hi> on the <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhores,</hi>
and in the Kingdom of of <hi>Naples,</hi> that when a river fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into the Sea, there is alwaies ſeen in the Sea it ſelf, at the place
of the rivers out-let, the reſemblance, as it were, of an half-Moon,
or a great ſhelf of ſettled ſand under water, much higher then the
reſt of the ſhore, and it is called in <hi>Tuſcany, il Cavallo;</hi> and here
in <hi>Venice, lo S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>anto:</hi> the which cometh to be cut by the current
of the river, one while on the right ſide; another while on the
left, and ſometimes in the midſt, according as the Wind ſits. And
a like effect I have obſerved in certain little Rillets of water,
along the Lake of <hi>Bolſena;</hi> with no other difference, ſave that of
ſmall and great.</p>
                        <p>Now whoſo well conſidereth this effect, plainly ſeeth that it
proceeds from no other, than from the contrariety of the ſtream
of the River, to the <hi>impetus</hi> of the Sea-waves; ſeeing that
great abundance of ſand which the Sea continually throws upon
the ſhore, cometh to be driven into the Sea by the ſtream of the
river; and in that place where thoſe two impediments meet
with equal force, the ſand ſetleth under water, and thereupon is
made that ſame Shelf for <hi>Cavallo;</hi> the which if the river carry
water, and that any conſiderable ſtore, it ſhall be thereby cut
and broken; one while in one place, and another while in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as hath been ſaid, according as the Wind blows: And
through that Chanel it is that Veſſels fall down into the Sea, and
again make to the river, as into a Port. But if the Water of
the river ſhall not be continual or ſhall be weak, in that caſe the
force of the Sea-Wind ſhall drive ſuch a quantity of ſand into
the mouth of the Port, and of the river, as ſhall wholly choak it
up. And hereupon there are ſeen along the Sea-ſide, very many
Lakes and Meers, which at certain times of the year abound with
waters, and the Lakes bear down that encloſure, and run into
the Sea.</p>
                        <p>Now it is neceſſary to make the like reflections on our Ports
of <hi>Venice, Malamocco, Bondolo,</hi> and <hi>Chiozza;</hi> which in a certain
ſenſe are no other than Creeks, mouths, and openings of the ſhore
that parts the Lake from the main Sea; and therefore I hold that
if the Waters in the Lake were plentiful, they would have
ſtrength to ſcowr the mouths of the Ports thorowly, &amp; with great
force; but the Water in the Lake failing, the Sea will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any oppoſal, bring ſuch a drift of ſand into the Ports; that if
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60312:40"/>
it doth not wholly choke them up, it ſhall render them at leaſt
unprofitable, and impoſſible for Barks and great Veſſels.</p>
                        <p>Many other conſiderations might be propounded concerning
theſe two heads of the ſtoppage of the Ports, and of the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Ouze and Mud in the Lakes, but ſo much ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
us to have hinted, to make way for diſcourſing of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
about the oportune remedies.</p>
                        <p>Yet before that I propound my opinion, I ſay, That I know
very well that my propoſal, at firſt ſight, will ſeem abſurd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient;
and therefore, as ſuch, will perhaps be rejected by
the moſt: and ſo much the rather, for that it will prove directly
contrary to what hath hitherto been, and as I hear, is intended to
be done: And I am not ſo wedded to my opinions, but that I
do conſider what others may judge thereof: But be it as it will,
I am obliged to ſpeak my thoughts freely, and that being done,
I will leave it to wiſer men than my ſelf; when they ſhall have
well conſidered my reaſons, to judge and deliberate of the <hi>quid
agendum:</hi> And if the ſentence ſhall go againſt me, I appeal to the
moſt equitable and inexorable Tribunal of Nature, who not
caring in the leaſt to pleaſe either one party or another, will be
alwaies a punctual and inviolable executrix of her eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
againſt which neither humane deliberations, nor our vain
deſires, ſhall ever have power to rebell. I added by word of
mouth that which followeth.</p>

I refer my ſelf.</p>
                        <p>By what hath been ſaid, in my opinion, that is made very clear
and manifeſt, which in the beginning of this diſcourſe I glanced
at; namely, That the whole diſorder, although it be divided into
two heads, into the diſcovery of the Mud, and of the ſtoppage
Ports, yet nevertheleſs, by the application of one onely remedy,
and that in my eſteem very eaſie, the whole ſhall be removed:
And this it is; That there be reſtored into the Lake as much
Water as can be poſſible, and in particular from the upper parts
of <hi>Venice,</hi> taking care that the Water be as free from Mud as is
poſſible. And that this is the true and real remedy of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
diſorders, is manifeſt: For in the paſſage that this Water
ſhall make thorow the Lakes, it ſhall of it ſelf by degrees clear
the Chanels in ſundry parts of them, according to the currents
that it ſhall ſucceſſively acquire, and in this manner being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60312:40"/>
thorow the Lake, it ſhall maintain the waters in the ſame,
and in the Chanels much higher, as I ſhall prove hereafter; a
thing that will make Navigation commodious; and that, which
moreover is of great moment in our buſineſſe; thoſe Shelves
of Mud which now diſcover themſelves at the time of Low-Waters
ſhall be alwayes covered, ſo that the putrefaction of
the Air ſhall alſo be remedied.</p>
                        <p>And laſtly, this abundance of Water being alwayes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
it ſelf into the Sea by the Ports, I do not doubt, but that
their bottomes will be ſcoured. And that theſe effects muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
Nature her ſelf ſeemeth to perſwade, there remaining onely
one great doubt, whether that abundance of Water that ſhall be
brought into the Lake may be really ſufficient to make the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

and the more to confirm the difficulties, one might ſay, reducing

broad, and two and an half high, and the breadth of the

the Lake would be but onely 1/200 of a Brace in height, which is
imperceptible, and would be of no avail to our purpoſe; nay
more, it being very certain that the <hi>brent</hi> runneth very muddy
and foul, this would occaſion very great miſchief, filling and
contracting the Lake, and for that reaſon this remedy ought, as
pernicious, to be totally excluded and condemned.</p>
                        <p>I here confeſſe that I am ſurprized at the forme of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as if I were in a certain manner convinced, that I dare not
adventure to ſay more, or open my mouth in this matter; but
the ſtrength it ſelf of the Argument, as being founded upon

opened me the way to diſcover a very crafty fraud that is couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſo clearly, as that more it cannot be deſired, the errour and fraud
wherein thoſe Ancients and Moderns have been, and alwayes
are intangled, that have in any way yet handled this matter of
conſidering the Meaſure and Quantity of the Waters that move.</p>

And ſo great is the eſteem that I have for that which I am now
about to ſay touching this particular, that I am content that all
the reſt of my Diſcourſe be rejected; provided, that that be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
underſtood, which I am hereafter to propoſe, I holding
and knowing it to be a main Principle, upon which all that is
founded that can be ſaid either well or handſomely on this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
The other Diſcourſes may have an appearance of being
probable, but this hits the mark as full as can be deſired, arriving
at the higheſt degree of certainty.</p>
                        <p>I have, ſeventeen years ſince, as I repreſented to the moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
Prince, and to the Right Honourable the Preſident of the
Lords the Commiſſioners of the<note n="*" place="margin">
                              <hi>I. Savii dell' Acque,</hi> a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Council that take care of the Lakes and other Aquatick affairs.</note> Sewers, written a Treatiſe of the
Meaſure of the waters that move, in which I Geometrically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
and declare this buſineſſe, and they who ſhall have
well underſtood the ground of my Diſcourſe, will reſt fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with that which I am now about to propoſe: But that all
may become rhe more eaſie, I will more briefly explicate and
declare ſo much thereof as I have demonſtrated in the Diſcourſe,
which will ſuffice for our purpoſe: And if that ſhould not be
enough, we have alwayes the experiment of a very eaſie and
cheap way to clear up the whole buſineſſe. And moreover I
will take the boldneſſe to affirm, that in caſe there ſhould not for
the preſent any deliberation be made concerning this affair, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to my opinion; yet nevertheleſſe it will be, at ſome
time or other; or if it be not, things will grow worſe and
worſe.</p>
                        <p>For more clear underſtanding, therefore, it ought to be known,
that it being required, as it is generally uſed, to meaſure the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a River, its breadth and its depth is taken, and theſe two
dimenſions being multiplied together, the product is affirmed to
be the quantity of that River: As for example, if a River ſhall
be 100. feet broad, and 20. feet high, it will be ſaid, that that
River is 2000 feet of Water, and ſo if a Ditch ſhall be 15. feet
broad, and 5. feet high, this ſame Ditch will be affirmed to be
75. feet of Water: And this manner of meaſuring Running
Water hath been uſed by the Ancients, and by Moderns, with
no other difference, ſave onely that ſome have made uſe of the
Foot, others of the Palme, others of the Brace, and others of
other meaſures.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe that in obſerving theſe Waters that move, I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
found, that the ſame Water of the ſame River was in
ſome ſites of its Chanel pretty big, and in others much leſſe,
not arriving in ſome places to the twentieth, nor to the hundreth
part of that which it is ſeen to be in other places; therefore this
vulgar way of meaſuring the Waters that move, for that they did
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60312:41"/>
not give me a certain and ſtable meaſure and quantity of Water,
began deſervedly to be ſuſpected by me, as difficult and defective,
being alwayes various, and the meaſure, on the contrary, being
to be alwayes determinate, and the ſame; it is therefore written,
that <hi>Pondus &amp; Pondus, Menſura &amp; Menſura, utrumque abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabile
eſt apud Deum,</hi> Exod. I conſidered that in the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
of <hi>Breſcia,</hi> my native Countrey, and in other places, where
Waters are divided to overflow the Grounds, by the like way of
meaſuring them, there were committed grievous and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
errours, to the great prejudice of the Publique and of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſons, neither they that ſell, nor they that buy under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the true quantity of that which is ſold and bought: In
regard that the ſame ſquare meaſure, as is accuſtomed in thoſe
parts, aſſigned one particular perſon, carried to ſometimes above
twice or thrice as much water, as did the ſame ſquare meaſure aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to another. Which thing proveth to be the ſame incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
as if the meaſure wherewith Wine and Oil is bought
and ſold, ſhould hold twice or thrice as much Wine or Oil at one
time as at another. Now this Conſideration invited my minde
and curioſity to the finding out of the true meaſure of Running
Waters. And in the end, by occaſion of a moſt important bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
that I was imployed in ſome years ſince, with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſſe
of minde, and with the ſure direction of <hi>Geometry,</hi> I
have diſcovered the miſtake, which was, that we being upon the
buſineſſe of taking the meaſure of the Waters that move, do make
uſe of two dimenſions onely, namely, breadth and depth, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no account of the length. And yet the Water being, though
running, a Body, it is neceſſary in forming a conceit of its quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
in relation to another, to keep account of all the three Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions,
that is of length, breadth, and depth.</p>
                        <p>Here an objection hath been put to me, in behalf of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
way of meaſuring Running Waters, in oppoſition to what
I have above conſidered and propoſed: and I was told, Its true,
that in meaſuring a Body that ſtands ſtill, one ought to take all
the three Dimenſions; but in meaſuring a Body that continually
moveth, as the Water, the caſe is not the ſame: For the length
is not to be had, the length of the water that moveth being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
as never finiſhing its running; and conſequently is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
by humane underſtanding, and therefore with reaſon,
nay upon neceſſity it cometh to be omitted.</p>
                        <p>In anſwer to this, I ſay, that in the aboveſaid Diſcourſe, two
things are to be conſidered diſtinctly; Firſt, whether it be poſſible
to frame any conceit of the quantity of the Body of the Water
with two Dimenſions onely. And ſecondly, whether this length
be to be found. As to the firſt, I am very certain that no man, let
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60312:42"/>
him be never ſo great a Wit, can never promiſe to frame a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the quantity of the Body of Water, without the third
Dimenſion of length: and hereupon I return to affirm, that the
vulgar Rule of meaſuring Running water is vain and erroneous.
This point being agreed on, I come to the ſecond, which is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the third Dimenſion of length may be meaſured. And I ſay,
that if one would know the whole length of the water of a
Fountain or River, thereby to come to know the quantity of all
the Water, it would prove an impoſſible enterprize, nay the
knowing of it would not be uſeful. But if one would know how
much water a Fountain, or a River carrieth in a determinate time
of an hour, of a day, or of a moneth, &amp;c. I ſay, that it is a very
poſſible and profitable enquiry, by reaſon of the innumerable
benefits that may be derived thence, it much importing to know
how much Water a Chanel carrieth in a time given; and I have
demonſtrated the ſame above in the beginning of this Book; and
of this we ſtand in need in the buſineſſe of the Lake, that ſo we
may be able to determine how much ſhall be the height of the
<hi>Brent,</hi> when it is ſpread all over the Lake: For the three dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of a Body being given, the Body is known; and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of a Body being given, if you have but two dimenſions, the
third ſhall be known. And thus diving farther and farther into
this Conſideration, I found that the Velocity of the courſe of the
water may be an hundred times greater or leſſer in one part of
its Chanel than in another. And therefore although there ſhould
be two mouths of Waters equal in bigneſſe; yet nevertheleſs it
might come to paſſe, that one might diſcharge an hundred or a
thouſand-times more water than another: and this would be, if
the water in one of the mouths ſhould run with an hundred or a
thouſand times greater velocity, than the other; for that it
would be the ſame as to ſay, that the ſwifter was an hundred or
a thouſand times longer, than the ſlower: and in this manner I
diſcovered that to keep account of the velocity, was the keeping
account of the Length.</p>
                        <p>And therefore it is manifeſt, that when two Mouths diſcharge
the ſame quantity of Water in an equal velocity, it is neceſſary
that the leſs ſwift Mouth be ſo much bigger than the more ſwift;
as the more ſwift exceedeth in velocity the leſs ſwift; as for
example.</p>
                        <p>In caſe two Rivers ſhould carry equal quantity of water in
equal times, but that one of them ſhould be four times more
ſwift than the other, the more ſlow ſhould of neceſſity be four
times more large. And becauſe the ſame River in any part
thereof alwaies diſchargeth the ſame quantity of Water in equal
times (as is demonſtrated in the firſt Propoſition of the firſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60312:42"/>
Book<note n="*" place="margin">He here intends the Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following, at the end of the firſt Book</note> of the meaſure of Running Waters;) but yet doth not
run thorowout with the ſame velocity: Hence it is, that the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
meaſures of the ſaid River, in divers parts of its Chanel, are
alwaies divers; inſomuch, that if a River paſſing through its cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
had ſuch velocity, that it ran 100 Braces in the 1/60 of an hour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
afterwards the ſaid River ſhould be reduced to ſo much tardi,
ty of motion, as that in the ſame time it ſhould not run more than
one Brace, it would be neceſſary that that ſame River ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
100. times bigger in that place where it was retarded; I
mean, 100. times bigger than it was in the place where it was
ſwifter. And let it be kept well in mind, that this point rightly
underſtood, will clear the underſtanding to diſcover very many
accidents worthy to be known. But for this time let it ſuffice,
that we have onely declared that which makes for our purpoſe,
referring apprehenſive and ſtudious Wits to the peruſal of my
aforenamed Treatiſe; for therein he ſhall finde profit and delight
both together.</p>
                        <p>Now applying all to our principal intent, I ſay, That by what
hath been declared it is manifeſt, that if the <hi>Brent</hi> were 48. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
broad, and 2 ½ high, in ſome one part of its Chanel, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the ſame Water of the <hi>Brent</hi> falling into the Lake, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
thorow the ſame to the Sea, it ſhould loſe ſo much of its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity,
that it ſhould run but one Brace, in the time wherein
whilſt it was in its Chanel at the place aforeſaid, it ran 100. Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
It would be abſolutely neceſſary, that increaſing in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
it ſhould become an hundred times<note n="*" place="margin">Deeper.</note> thicker; and therefore
if we ſhould ſuppoſe that the Lake were 20000. Braces, the
<hi>Brent</hi> that already hath been ſuppoſed in its Chanel 100. Braces,
being brought into the Lake, ſhould be 100. times 100. Brates;
that is, ſhall be 10000. Braces in thickneſs, and conſequently ſhall
be in height half a Brace; that is, 100/200 of a Brace, and not 1/200 of a
Brace, as was concluded in the Argument.</p>
                        <p>Now one may ſee into what a groſs errour of 99. in 100. one
may fall through the not well underſtanding the true quantity
of Running Water, which being well underſtood, doth open a
direct way to our judging aright in this moſt conſiderable affair.</p>
                        <p>And therefore admitting that wich hath been demonſtrated,
I ſay, that I would (if it did concern me) greatly encline to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
upon the returning of the <hi>Brent</hi> again into the Lake: For it
being moſt evident, that the <hi>Brent</hi> in the Chanel of its mouth, is
much ſwifter than the <hi>Brent</hi> being brought into the Lake, it will
certainly follow thereupon, that the thickneſs of the Water of
<hi>Brent</hi> in the Lake, ſhall be ſo much greater than that of <hi>Brent</hi> in
<hi>Brent,</hi> by how much the <hi>Bront</hi> in <hi>Brent</hi> is ſwifter than thh <hi>Brent</hi>
in the Lake.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="72" facs="tcp:60312:43"/>
1. From which operation doth follow in the firſt place, that
the Lake being filled and increaſed by theſe Waters, ſhall be
more Navigable, and paſſible, than at preſent we ſee it to be.</p>
                        <p>2. By the current of theſe Waters, the Chanels will be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and will be kept clean from time to time.</p>
                        <p>3. There will not appear at the times of low-waters ſo many
Shelves, and ſuch heaps of Mud, as do now appear.</p>
                        <p>4. The Ayr will become more wholeſom, for that it ſhall not
be ſo infected by putrid vapours exhaled by the Sun, ſo long as
the Miery Ouze ſhall be covered by the Waters.</p>
                        <p>5. Laſtly, in the current of theſe advantagious Waters,, which
muſt iſſue out of the Lake into the Sea, beſides thoſe of the Tyde,
the Ports will be kept ſcoured, and clear: And this is as much as
I ſhall offer for the preſent, touching this weighty buſineſs; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
ſubmitting my ſelf to ſounder judgements.</p>
                        <p>Of the above-ſaid Writing I preſented a Copy at <hi>Venice,</hi> at a
full Colledge, in which I read it all, and it was hearkned to with
very great attention; and at laſt I preſented it to the Duke, and
left ſome Copies thereof with ſundry Senators, and went my way,
promiſing with all intenſeneſs to apply my pains with reiterated
ſtudies in the publick ſervice; and if any other things ſhould come
into my minde, I promiſed to declare them ſincerely, and ſo took
leave of <hi>His ſerenity,</hi> and that Noble Council. When I was
returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> this buſineſs night and day continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in my mind, I hapned to think of another admirable and
moſt important conceit, which with effectual reaſons, confirmed
by exact operations, I with the Divine aſſiſtance, made clear and
manifeſt; and though the thing at firſt ſight ſeemed to me a moſt
extravagant Paradox, yet notwithſtanding, having ſatisfied my
ſelf of the whole buſineſs, I ſent it in writing to the moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and moſt Noble <hi>Signore Gio. Baſadonna;</hi> who after he had
well conſidered my Paper, carried it to the Council; and after
that thoſe Lords had for many months maturely conſidered
thereon, they in the end reſolved to ſuſpend the execution of the
diverſion which they had before conſulted to make of the River
<hi>Sile,</hi> and of four other Rivers, which alſo fall into the Lake; a
thing by me blamed in this ſecond Paper, as moſt prejudicial,
and harmful. The writing ſpake as followeth.</p>

things, Moſt Serene Prince, were as the
carrying of Burdens, in which we ſee
that an hundred Horſes carry a greater
weight than one Horſe onely; it would
ſeem that one might make more account
of the opinion of many men, than of
one alone; But becauſe that diſcourſing
more reſembleth running, than carrying
Burdens, in which we ſee that one Barb alone runneth faſter
than an hundred heavy-heel'd Jades; therefore I have ever more
eſteemed one Concluſion well managed, and well conſidered by
one underſtanding man, although alone, than the common and
Vulgar opinions; eſpecially, when they concern abſtruce and
arduous points: Nay in ſuch caſes the opinions moulded and
framed by the moſt ignorant and ſtupid Vulgar, have been ever
ſuſpected by me as falſe, for that it would be a great wonder if
in difficult matters a common capacity ſhould hit upon that
which is handſom, good, and true. Hence I have, and do hold
in very great veneration the ſumme of the Government of the
moſt Serene, and eternal Republick of <hi>Venice;</hi> which although,
as being in nature a Common-wealth, it ought to be governed by
the greater part; yet nevertheleſs, in arduous affairs, it is alwaies

is not to be deſerted in moſt weighty affairs, but ought rather to
be explained in due place and time with all poſſible perſpicuity;
that ſo being well underſtood, and conſidered, it may come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
for the Common good to be embraced.</p>
                        <p>This which I ſpeak in general, hath often been my fortune in
very many particulars, not onely when I have kept within the
bounds of meer ſpeculation, but alſo when I have chanced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to Practice, and to Operations: and your Highneſs know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
very well what befel me the laſt Summer 1641. when in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to your Soveraign Command, I did in full Colledge repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
my thoughts touching the ſtate of the Lake of <hi>Venice;</hi> for
there not being ſuch wanting, who without ſo much as vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafing
to underſtand me, but having onely had an inkling, and
bad apprehenſion of my opinion, fell furiouſly upon me, and by
violent means both with the Pen and Preſs, full of Gall, did abuſe
me in reward of the readineſs that I had expreſt to obey and
ſerve them: But I was above meaſure encouraged and pleaſed, to
ſee that thoſe few who vouchſafed to hear me, were all either
thorowly perſwaded that my opinion was well grounded, or at
leaſt ſuſpended their prudent verdict to more mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And though at the firſt bout I chanced to propoſe a thing
that was totally contrary to the moſt received and antiquated
opinion, and to the reſolutions and conſultations taken above an
hundred years ago: Moved by theſe things, and to ſatisfie alſo
to the promiſe that I had made of tendering unto them what
ſhould farther offer it ſelf unto me touching the ſame buſineſs; I
have reſolved to preſent to the Throne of your Highneſs, another
Conſideration of no leſs importance, which perhaps at firſt ſight
will appear a ſtranger Paradox; but yet brought to the Teſt and
Touch-ſtone of experience, it ſhall prove moſt clear and evident.
If it ſhall be accounted of, ſo that it ſucceedeth to the benefit of
your Highneſs, I ſhall have obtained my deſire and intent: And
if not, I ſhall have ſatisfied my ſelf, and ſhall not have been
wanting to the Obligation of your moſt faithful Servant, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

                        <p>That which I propounded in the Mouths paſs, touching the
moſt important buſineſs of the Lake, though it did onely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concern the point of the diverſion of the Mouth of the Lake,
already made and put in execution; yet it may be underſtood
and applyed alſo to the diverſion under debate, to be made of
the other five Rivers, and of the <hi>Sile</hi> in particular.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="75" facs="tcp:60312:44"/>
Now touching this, I had the fortune to offer an admirable
accident that we meet with when we come to the effect, which
I verily believe will be an utter ruine to the Lake of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I ſay therefore, that by diverting theſe five Rivers that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
although their water that they diſcharge for the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lake is not all taken together 4/5 parts of what the <hi>Brent</hi>
alone did carry, yet nevertheleſſe the abatement of the water of
the Lake which ſhall enſue upon this laſt diverſion of four parts,
which was the whole water, ſhall prove double to that which hath
happened by the diverſion of <hi>Brent</hi> onely, although that the
<hi>Brent</hi> alone carried five parts of that water, of which the Rivers
that are to be diverted carry four: A wonder really great, and
altogether unlikely; for the reducing all this Propoſition to be
underſtood, is as if we ſhould ſay, that there being given us
three Rivers, of which the firſt diſchargeth five parts, the ſecond
three, and the third one, and that from the diverſion of the
firſt, there did follow ſuch a certain abatement or fall; from
the taking away of the ſecond there ought to follow alſo ſo
much more abatement; And laſtly, from the withdrawing of
the third the water ought to fall ſo much more, which is wholly
impoſſible: And yet it is moſt certain, and beſides the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
that perſwades me to it, which I ſhall explain in due
time, I can ſet before your eyes ſuch an experiment as is not to
be denied by any one, although obſtinate: and I will make it
plainly ſeen and felt, that by taking away only four parts of the
five, which ſhall have been taken away, the abatement proveth
double to the abatement enſuing upon the diverting firſt of the
five onely; which thing being true, as moſt certainly it is, it
will give us to underſtand how pernicious this diverſion of five
Rivers is like to prove, if it ſhall be put in execution.</p>
                        <p>By this little that I have hinted, and the much that I could
ſay, let your Highneſſe gather with what circumſpection this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe
ought to be managed, and with how great skill he ought

I am able to make in confirmation of what I have ſaid, that ſo

                        </opener>
                        <p>TWo very conſiderable Objections have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
my opinion concerning the Lake of <hi>Venice:</hi> One
was that, of which I have ſpoken at large in my firſt
Conſideration, namely, that the <hi>Brents</hi> having been taken out of
the Lake, cannot have been the occaſion of the notable fall of
the Waters in the Lake, as I pretend, and conſequently, that
the turning <hi>Brent</hi> into the Lake would be no conſiderable reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in regard that the water of <hi>Brent,</hi> and the great expanſion
of the Lake over which the water of <hi>Brent</hi> is to diffuſe and
ſpread being conſidered, it is found that the riſe proveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Objection was, that the <hi>Brent</hi> is very muddy, and
therefore if it ſhould fall muddy into the Lake, the Sand would
ſink and fill up the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Touching the firſt Query, enough hath been ſaid in my firſt
Conſideration, where I have plainly diſcovered the deceipt of the
Argument, and ſhewn its fallacy; It remaineth now to examine
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60312:45"/>
the ſecond: to which in the firſt place I ſay, that one of the firſt
things that I propoſed in this affair was, that I held it impoſſible
to do any act, though never ſo beneficial, that was not alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
by ſome inconvenience and miſchief; and therefore
we are to conſider well the profit, and the loſſe and prejudice;
and they both being weighed, we ſhall be able to chooſe the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
evil: Secondly, I admit it to be moſt true, that <hi>Brent</hi> is at ſome
times muddy, but it is alſo true, that for the greater part of the
year it is not muddy. Thirdly, I do not ſee nor underſtand
what ſtrength this objection hath, being taken ſo at large, and in
general; and methinks that it is not enough to ſay, that the
<hi>Brent</hi> runneth muddy, and to aſſert that it depoſeth its Muddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the Lake, but we ought moreover to proceed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
and ſhew how much this Mud is, and in what time this
choaking up of the Ports may be effected. For the Reaſons are
but too apparent and particular, that conclude the ruine of the
Lake, and that in a very ſhort time, (for mention is made of
dayes) the Waters diverſion being made, and moreover we
have the circumſtance of an Experiment, the ſtate of things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
obſerved to have grown worſe ſince the ſaid diverſion. And
I have demonſtrated, that in caſe the Diverſion of the <hi>Sile</hi> and
the other Rivers ſhould be put in execution, the Lake would in a
few dayes become almoſt dry; and the Ports would be loſt, with
other miſchievous conſequences. But on the other ſide, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that we did grant the choaking of them, we may very
probably ſay, that it will not happen, ſave onely in the ſucceſſion
of many and many Centuries of years. Nor can I think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
counſel to take a reſolution and imbrace a Deſigne now, to
obtain a benefit very uncertain, and more than that, which only
ſhall concern thoſe who are to come very many Ages after us,
and thereby bring a cetain inconvenience upon our ſelves, and
upon our children that are now alive and preſent.</p>
                        <p>Let it be alledged therefore, (although I hold it falſe) that by
the diverſions of the Rivers the Lake may be kept in good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
for ſeveral years to come.</p>
                        <p>But I ſay confidently, and hope to demonſtrate it; That the
Diverſions will bring the Lake, even in our dayes, to be almoſt
dry, and at leaſt will leave ſo little water in it, that it ſhall ceaſe
to be Navigable, and the Ports ſhall moſt infallibly be choaked
up. I will therefore ſay upon experience, in anſwer to this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,
that it is very neceſſary firſt well to diſcourſe, and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to particularize and aſcertain the beſt that may be this
point of the quantity of this ſinking Mud or Sand.</p>
                        <p>Now I fear I ſhall make my ſelf ridiculous to thoſe, who mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
the things of Nature with the ſhallowneſſe of their brains
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60312:46"/>
do think that it is abſolutely impoſſible to make this enquiry, and
will ſay unto me, <hi>Quis menſus eſt pugillo aquas, &amp; terram palmo
ponderavit?</hi> Yet nevertheleſs I will propound a way whereby,
at leaſt in groſs, one may find out the ſame.</p>
                        <p>Take a Veſſel of Cylindrical Figure, holding two barrels of
water, or thereabouts; and then fill it with the water of <hi>Brent,</hi>
at its Mouth or Fall into the Lake; but in the Lake at the time
that the <hi>Brent</hi> runneth muddy, and after it hath begun to run
muddy for eight or ten hours, to give the mud time to go as far
as S. <hi>Nicolo,</hi> to iſſue into the Sea; and at the ſame time take
another Veſſel, like, and equal to the firſt, and fill it with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Lake towards S. <hi>Nicolo,</hi> (but take notice that this ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
ought to be made at the time when the waters go out,
and when the Sea is calm) and then, when the waters ſhall have
ſetled in the aforeſaid Veſſels, take out the clear water, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the quantity of Sand that remains behind, and let it be ſet
down, or kept in mind: And I am eaſily induced to think, that
that ſhall be a greater quantity of Sand which ſhall be left in the
firſt Veſſel, than that left in the ſecond Veſſel. Afterwards
when the <hi>Brent</hi> ſhall come to be clear, let both the operations be
repeated, and obſerve the quantity of Sand in the aforeſaid Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels;
for if the Sand in the firſt Veſſel ſhould be moſt, it would
be a ſign, that in the revolution of a year the <hi>Brent</hi> would depoſe
Sand in the Lake: And in this manner one may calculate to a
ſmall matter what proportion the Sand that entreth into the Lake,
hath to that which remains: And by that proportion one may
judge how expedient it ſhall be for publick benefit. And if at
ſeveral times of the year you carefully repeat the ſame operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or rather obſervations, you would come to a more exact
knowledge in this buſineſs: And it would be good to make the
ſaid operations at thoſe times, when the Lake is diſturbed by
ſtrong high Winds, and made muddy by its own Mud, raiſed by
the commotion of the Waters.</p>
                        <p>This notion would give us great light, if the ſame obſervations
ſhould be made towards the Mouth of <hi>Lio,</hi> at ſuch time as the
waters flow and ebb, in calm ſeaſons; for ſo one ſhould come to
know whether the waters of the Lake are more thick at the going
out, than at the entrance. I have propounded the foregoing
way of meaſuring Sands and Mud, to ſhew that we are not ſo
generally, and inconſiderately to pronounce any ſentence, but
proceed to ſtricter inquiries, and then deliberate what ſhall be
moſt expedient to be done. Others may propoſe more equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
examinations, but this ſhall ſerve me for the preſent.</p>
                        <p>I will add onely, that if any one had greater curioſity (it would
be profitable to have it) in inveſtigating more exactly the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60312:46"/>
of the Water that entereth into the Lake, by the means that
I have ſhewen in the beginning of this Book: When he ſhall
have found the proportion of the quantity of water to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of Sand or Mud, he ſhall come to know how much Sand the
<hi>Brent</hi> ſhall leave in the Lake in the ſpace of a year. But to
perform theſe things, there are required perſons of diſcretion, and
fidelity, and that are imployed by publick Order; for there
would thence reſult eminent benefit and profit.</p>

                              <p>IN execution of the command that you laid upon me in your
former Letters, by order from the moſt Serene, my Lord,
<hi>Prince Leopold;</hi> that I ſhould ſpeak my judgement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the diſimboguement of the River called <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ought to be let into the Sea, or into <hi>Serchio;</hi> I ſay, that
I chanced 18. years ſince to be preſent, when the ſaid Mouth was
opened into the Sea, and that of <hi>Serchio</hi> ſtopt; which work was
done to remedy the great Innundation that was made in all that
Country, and Plain of <hi>Piſa,</hi> that lyeth between the River <hi>Arno,</hi>
and the Mountains of <hi>S. Giuliano,</hi> and the River <hi>Serchio;</hi> which
Plain continued long under water, inſomuch that not onely in the
Winter, but alſo for a great part of the Summer, thoſe fields
were overflowed; and when that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> was
effectually opened into the Sea, the place was preſently freed from
the waters. and drained, to the great ſatisfaction of the Owners
of thoſe Grounds. And here I judge it worth your notice, that
for the generality of thoſe that poſſeſs eſtates in thoſe parts, they
deſired that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> might ſtand open to the
Sea, and thoſe who would have it open into <hi>Serchio,</hi> are perſons
that have no other concernment there, ſave the hopes of gaining
by having the diſpoſe of Commiſſions, and the like, &amp;c,</p>
                              <p>But for the more plain underſtanding of that which is to be
ſaid, it muſt be known, That the reſolution of opening the ſaid
Mouth into <hi>Serchio,</hi> was taken in the time of the Great Duke
<hi>Ferdinando</hi> the firſt, upon the ſame motives that are at this time
again propoſed, as your Letters tell me, Since that, it manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appearing, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> had, and hath its Mouth open to
the Sea, the Plain hath been kept dry; and it being alſo true, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60312:47"/>
the fury of the South, and South-Weſt-Winds carryed ſuch
abundance of ſand into the Mouth, or Out-let of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi>
that it wholly ſtopt it up: eſpecially when the waters on <hi>Piſa</hi>
ſide were low and ſhallow, And they think, that turning the
Lake of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> into <hi>Serchio,</hi> and the <hi>Serchio</hi> maintaining
continually its own Mouth with the force of its waters open to the
Sea, and conſequently alſo <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> they would have had the
Out-let clear and open; and in this manner they think, that the
Plain of <hi>Piſa</hi> would have been freed from the waters. The bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
paſſeth for current, at firſt ſight; but experience proveth
the contrary, and Reaſon confirmeth the ſame: For the height
of the water of thoſe Plains, was regulated by the height of the
waters in the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> that is, The waters at the
Mouth being high, the waters alſo do riſe in the fields; and when
the waters at the Mouth are low, the waters of the fields do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
abate: Nor is it enough to ſay, That the Out-let or Vent
of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is continual, but it muſt be very low: Now if
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> did determine in <hi>Serchio,</hi> it is manifeſt that it
would determine high; for <hi>Serchio</hi> terminating in the Sea, when
ever it more and more aboundeth with water, and riſeth, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that alſo <hi>Fiume morto</hi> hath its level higher, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſhall keep the waters in the Plains higher. Nay, it hath
happened ſometimes (and I ſpeak it upon my own ſight) that
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> hath reverſed its courſe upwards towards <hi>Piſa;</hi>
which caſe will ever happen, whenſoever the <hi>Piſan</hi> waters chance
to be lower than the level of thoſe of <hi>Serchio;</hi> for in that caſe
the waters of <hi>Serchio</hi> return back upon the Plains thorow <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> in ſuch ſort, that the Muddineſſes, and the <hi>Serchio</hi> have
been obſerved to be carried by this return as farr as the Walls of
<hi>Piſa;</hi> and then before ſuch time as ſo great waters can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaged,
which come in with great fury, and go out by little and
little, there do paſs very many days, and moneths, nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
one being never able to find the waters of <hi>Serchio,</hi>
when at the ſhalloweſt, ſo low as the Sea in level; (which is the
loweſt place of the waters) it thence doth follow, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> ſhould never at any time of the year, ſo long
as they determine in <hi>Serchio,</hi> be ſo low; as they come to be when
the ſame <hi>Fiume morto</hi> determineth in the Sea. Tis true indeed,
that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> opened into the Sea, is ſubject to
the inconvenience of being ſtopt up by the force of Winds: But
in this caſe, it is neceſſary to take ſome pains in opening it; which
may eaſily be done, by cutting that Sand a little which ſtayeth
in the Mouth, after that the Wind is laid, and it is enough if you
make a Trench little more than two Palms in breadth; for the
water once beginning to run into it, it will in a few hours carry
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60312:47"/>
that Sand away with it, and there will enſue a deep and broad
Trench that will drain away all the water of the Plains in very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time. And I have found by practice, that there having been
a great quantity of Sand driven back, by the fury of the South-Weſt-Wind,
into the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> I having cauſed the
little gutter to be made in the Morning, ſomewhat before Noon,
a Mouth hath been opened of 40. Braces wide, and notably deep,
inſomuch that the water, which before had incommoded all the
Champian ran away in leſs than three dayes, and left the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
free and dry, to the admiration of all men. There was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
upon the place, at this buſineſs, on the ſame day that I
opened the Mouth, the moſt Serene great Duke, the moſt Serene
Arch-Dutcheſs Mother, all the Commiſſioners of Sewers; with
many other Perſons and Peaſants of thoſe parts; and they all ſaw
very well, that it was never poſſible that a little Bark of eight
Oars, which was come from <hi>Legorn</hi> to wait upon the great
Duke, ſhould ever be able to maſter the Current, and to make
up into <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> and his Highneſs, who came with an intent
to cauſe the ſaid Mouth towards the Sea to be ſtopt; and that
into <hi>Serchio</hi> to be opened, changed his judgement, giving order
that it ſhould be left open towards the Sea, as it was done. And
if at this day it ſhall return into <hi>Serchio,</hi> I am very certain that it
will be neceſſary to open it again into the Sea. And there was
alſo charge and order given to a perſon appointed for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that he ſhould take care to open the ſaid Mouth, as hath
been ſaid upon occaſion. And thus things have ſucceeded very
well unto this very time. But from the middle of <hi>October,</hi> until
this firſt of <hi>February,</hi> there having continued high South, and
South-Weſt-Winds, with frequent and abundant Rains; it is no
wonder that ſome innundation hath happened; but yet I will
affirm, that greater miſchiefs would have followed, if the Mouth
had been opened into <hi>Serchio.</hi> This which I have hitherto ſaid,
is very clear and intelligible to all ſuch as have but competent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
and indifferent skill in theſe affairs. But that which I am
now about to propoſe farther, will, I am very certain, be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
by your ſelf, but it will ſeem ſtrange and unlikely to many
others. The point is, that I ſay, That by raiſing the level of
<hi>Fiume morto,</hi> one half Brace, onely at its Mouth, (it will peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitrate
into <hi>Serchio</hi> farther than it would into the Sea) it ſhall
cauſe the waters to riſe three, or perhaps more Braces upon the
fields towards <hi>Piſa,</hi> and ſtill more by degrees as they ſhall recede
farther from the Sea-ſide; and thus there will follow very great
Innundations, and conſiderable miſchiefs. And to know that
this is true, you are to take notice of an accident, which I give
warning of in my diſcourſe of the Meaſure of Running Waters:
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60312:48"/>
where alſo I give the reaſon thereof,<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. 1.</note> 
                                 <hi>Coroll.</hi> 14. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
is this, That there coming a Land-Flood, for example,
into <hi>Arno,</hi> which maketh it to riſe above its ordinary Mouth
wthin <hi>Piſa,</hi> or a little above or below the City ſix or ſeven Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
this ſame height becometh alwaies leſſer and leſſer, the more
we approach towards the Sea-ſide; inſomuch, that near to the
Sea the ſaid River ſhall be raiſed hardly half a Brace: Whence
it followeth of neceſſary conſequence, that ſhould I again be at
the Sea-ſide, and knowing nothing of what hapneth, ſhould ſee
the River <hi>Arno</hi> raiſed by the acceſſion of a Land-flood, one third
of a Brace; I could certainly infer, that the ſame River was raiſed
in <hi>Piſa</hi> thoſe ſame ſix or ſeven Braces. And that which I ſay of
<hi>Arno,</hi> is true of all Rivers that fall into the Sea. Which thing
being true, it is neceſſary to make great account of every ſmall
riſing, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> maketh towards the Sea-ſide by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into <hi>Serchio.</hi> For although the riſing of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> by
being to diſgorge its Waters into <hi>Serchio,</hi> towards the Sea, were
onely a quarter of a Brace; we might very well be ſure, that farr
from the Sea, about <hi>Piſa,</hi> and upon thoſe fields the riſe ſhall be
much greater, and ſhall become two or three Braces: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Countrey lyeth low, that ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>iſe will cauſe a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Innundation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the Plains, like as it did before; I cauſed the
Mouth to be opened into the Sea. And therefore I conclude
that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> ought by no means to be opened
into <hi>Serchio;</hi> but ought to be continued into the Sea, uſing all
diligence to keep it open after the manner aforeſaid, ſo ſoon as
ever the Wind ſhall be laid. And if they ſhall do otherwiſe, I
confidently affirm, that there will daily follow greater damages;
not onely in the Plains, but alſo in the wholeſomneſs of the
Air; as hath been ſeen in times paſt. And again, It oughs with
all care to be procured, that no waters do by any means run or
fall from the Trench of <hi>Libra,</hi> into the Plain of <hi>Piſa,</hi> for theſe
Waters being to diſcharge into <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> they maintain it
much higher than is imagined, according to that which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
in my conſideration upon the ſtate of the Lake of
<hi>Venice.</hi> I have ſaid but little, but I ſpeak to you, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth

                              <p>ANd firſt I ſay, Whereas I ſuppoſe that the level of the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio</hi>
is higher than that of <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> this is moſt true,
at ſuch time as the waters of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> are diſcharged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea; but I did never ſay that things could never be brought
to that paſs, as that the level of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> ſhould be higher than
<hi>Serchio:</hi> and ſo I grant that it will follow, that the waters of
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> ſhall go into <hi>Serchio,</hi> and its very poſſible, that the
Drain of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> into <hi>Serchio</hi> may be continuate; and I far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
grant, that its poſſible, that the <hi>Serchio</hi> doth never diſgorge
thorow <hi>Fiume morto</hi> towards <hi>Piſa;</hi> Nay, I will yet farther grant
that it might have happened, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> might have had
ſuch a fall into <hi>Serchio,</hi> as would have ſufficed to have turned
Mills: But then I add withall, that the Plains of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and the
City it ſelf muſt be a meer Lake.</p>
                              <p>2. <hi>Signore Bartolotti</hi> ſaith confidently, that when the Sea ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
by the South-Weſt, or other Winds, the level of <hi>Serchio</hi> in
the place marked A in the Platt, diſtant about 200. Braces, riſeth
very little: But that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> in D, and in E, many miles
more up into Land riſeth very much, and that certain Fiſhermen
confirm this, and ſhew him the ſignes of the riſing of the Water.
I grant it to be very true, and I have ſeen it with my own eyes:
But this cometh to paſs, when the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is ſtopt
up by the Sea; as I ſhall ſhew by and by. And this riſing near
the Sea-ſide, is of no conſiderable prejudice to the fields. And
this is as much as I find to be true in the aſſertion of <hi>Signore Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolotti,</hi>
(without his confirming it by any other proof; as indeed
it needs none) That the level of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> riſeth in E, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miles farther upwards it riſeth much; nor did I ever affirm the
contrary.</p>
                              <p>3. Concerning the difficulty of opening the Mouth of <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> into the Sea, that which <hi>Il Caſtellano</hi> ſaith is moſt certain;
namely, That at the entrance upon the opening of the Mouth, it
is neceſſary to make a deep Trench: But I ſay, that at that time
it is difficult to open it, unleſs upon great occaſions; for that the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60312:49"/>
difficulty proceedeth from the waters of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> being low,
and the fields drained.</p>
                              <p>4. As to the particular of the Cauſes that you tell me men
preſs ſo much unto the moſt <hi>Serene Grand Duke,</hi> and to the
Prince, I have not much to ſay, becauſe it is not my profeſſion;
nor have I conſidered of the ſame: Yet I believe, that when the
Prince and his Highneſſe ſee the benefit of his People and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
in one ſcale of the Ballance, and the accomodation of
Huntſmen in the other, his Highneſſe will incline to the profit
of his ſubjects; ſuch have I alwayes found his Clemency and
Nobleneſſe of minde. But if I were to put in my vote upon
this buſineſſe, I would ſay, that the points of Spears, and the
mouths of Guns, the yelping of Dogs, the wilyneſſe of Huntſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
who run thorow and narrowly ſearch all thoſe Woods,
Thickets and Heathes, are the true deſtroyers of Bucks and
Boares, and not a little Salt-water, which ſetleth at laſt in ſome
low places, and ſpreadeth not very far. Yet nevertheleſſe, I will
not enter upon any ſuch point, but confine my ſelf ſolely to the
buſineſſe before me.</p>
                              <p>5. That Experiment of joyning together the water of <hi>Fiume
morto,</hi> and that of <hi>Serchio</hi> by a little trench to ſee what advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Level E hath upon the Level I, doth not give me full
ſatisfaction, taken ſo particularly, for it may come to paſſe, that
ſometimes E may be higher, and ſometimes A lower, and I do
not queſtion but that when <hi>Serchio</hi> is low, and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> full
of Water, the level of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> will be higher than that of
<hi>Serchio.</hi> But <hi>Serchio</hi> being full, and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> ſcant of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the contrary will follow, if the Mouth ſhall be opened to
the Sea. And here it ſhould ſeem to me, that it ought to be
conſidered, that there is as much advantage from E to the Sea
through the little Trench opened anew into <hi>Serchio,</hi> as from E to
the Sea by the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto.</hi> But the difficulty (which
is that we are to regard in our caſe) is, that the courſe of the
Waters thorow the Trench is three times longer than the courſe
of the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> as appeareth by the Draught or
Plat which you ſent me, which I know to be very exactly drawn,
for that the ſituation of thoſe places are freſh in my memory.
Here I muſt give notice, that the waters of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thorow the Trench in <hi>Serchio</hi> (the waters of which <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> are, for certain, never ſo low as the Sea) their pendency or
declivity ſhall, for two cauſes, be leſſe than the pendency of thoſe
waters through the Mouth towards the Sea, that is, becauſe of
the length of the line through the Trench, and becauſe of the
height of their entrance into <hi>Serchio,</hi> a thing which is of very
great import in diſcharging the waters which come ſuddenly, as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60312:49"/>
he ſhall plainly ſee, who ſhall have underſtood my Book of the
Meaſure of Running Waters. And this was the Reaſon why all
the Countrey did grow dry upon the opening of the Mouth into
the Sea. And here I propoſe to conſideration that which the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants
about <hi>Piſa</hi> relate, namely, That the Water in the Fields
doth no conſiderable harm by continuing there five or ſix, yea, or
eight dayes. And therefore the work of the Countrey is to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> in ſuch manner, that the Water
being come, they may have the Trench free and ready, when that
the Water cometh it may have a free drain, and may not ſtay
there above eight or nine dayes, for then the overflowings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
hurtful. It is to be deſired alſo, that if any Propoſition is
produced touching theſe affairs, it might be propounded the moſt
diſtinctly that may be poſſible, and not conſiſt in generals, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when the Diſpute is of the riſings, of velocity, of tardity,
of much and little water; things that are all to be ſpecified by
meaſures.</p>
                              <p>6. Your Letter ſaith, in the next place, that <hi>Signore Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotti</hi>
confeſſeth, that if the Mouth of the <hi>Fiume morto</hi> might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be kept open, it would be better to let it continue as it is:
the which, that I may not yield to him in courteſie, I confeſſe,
for the keeping it ſtopt on all ſides would be a thing moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.
But admitting of his confeſſion I again reply, that <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume
morto</hi> ought not to be let into <hi>Serchio,</hi> but immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea; becauſe although ſometimes the Mouth to Sea-wards
be ſtopt up, yet for all that, the raiſing of the Bank above
the Plains (which is all the buſineſſe of importance) ſhall be ever
leſſer, if we make uſe of the Mouth leading to the Sea, than u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that of <hi>Serchio.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>7. I will not omit to mention a kinde of ſcruple that I have
concerning the poſition of <hi>Sign. Bartolotti,</hi> that is, where he ſaith
that the two Mouths A and D are equal to the like Mouths into
the Sea; Now it ſeems to me, that the Mouth A of <hi>Fiume morto</hi>
into <hi>Serchio</hi> is abſolutely within <hi>Serchio,</hi> nor can it be made low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and is regulated by the height of <hi>Serchio:</hi> But the Mouth
of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> terminates, and ought to be underſtood to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
in the Sea it ſelf, the loweſt place. And this I believe
was very well perceived by <hi>Sig. Bartolotti,</hi> but I cannot tell why
he paſt it over without declaring it: and we ſee not that the
Mouth D falleth far from the Sea, which Mouth ought to be let
into the Sea it ſelf, and ſo the advantage of the Mouth into the
Sea more clearly appeareth.</p>
                              <p>8. That which <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> addeth, that when it is high
Waters, at ſuch time as the Waters are out, and when Winds
choak up <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> they not only retard it, but return the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60312:50"/>
courſe of the Waters upwards very leaſurely, perſwadeth me
more readily to believe that <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> knoweth very well,
that the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> let into <hi>Serchio</hi> is hurtful: for
by this he acknowledgeth that the Mouth towards the Sea doth
in ſuch ſort drain the Countrey of the Waters, as that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
very low; and therefore upon every little <hi>impetus</hi> the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
turn their courſe: And from the motions, being exceeding
ſlow, is inferred, that the abundance of Sea-water that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
into <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> is ſo much as is believed, and as <hi>Sig. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolotti</hi>
affirmeth.</p>
                              <p>9. After that <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> hath ſaid what he promiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
namely, that when the Windes blowing ſtrongly do ſtop
up <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> and not onely retard but turn the courſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the time being Rainy, and the Mouth of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> ſhut
up, the Waves of the Sea paſſe over the Bank of <hi>Fiume morto;</hi> at
that time, ſaith <hi>Signore Bartolotti,</hi> the Champain ſhall know the
benefit of <hi>Fiume morto</hi> diſcharged into <hi>Serchio,</hi> and the mouth A
ſhall ſtand alwayes open; and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> may alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
run out, as alſo the Rains and Rain-waters, although the
hurtful Tempeſt ſhould laſt many dayes, &amp;c. And I reply, that
all the Art conſiſts in this; for the benefit of thoſe Fields doth
not depend on, or conſiſt in ſaying, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is alwayes
open, and <hi>Fiume morto</hi> draineth continually; But all the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of profit lyeth and conſiſteth in maintaining the Waters
low in thoſe Plaines, and thoſe Ditches, which ſhall never be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
whilſt the World ſtands, if you let <hi>Fiume morto</hi> into <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio;</hi>
but yet it may, by opening the mouth into the Sea: and
ſo much reaſon and nature proveth, and (which importeth) Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
confirmeth.</p>
                              <p>10. In the tenth place I come to conſider the anſwer that
was made to another Propoſition in the Letter which I writ to
Father <hi>Franceſco,</hi> which prudently of it ſelf alone might ſerve
to clear this whole buſineſſe. I ſaid in my Letter, That great
account is to be made of every ſmall riſing and ebbing of the
Waters neer to the Sea in <hi>Fiume morto,</hi> for that theſe riſings and
fallings, although that they be ſmall neer to the Sea-ſide, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
they operate and are accompanied by notable riſings
and fallings within Land, and far from the Sea-ſide, and I have
declared by an example of <hi>Arno,</hi> in which a Land-flood falling,
that made it increaſe above its ordinary height within <hi>Piſa</hi> ſix or
ſeven Braces, that this height of the ſame Flood becometh ſtill
leſſer, the neerer we approach to the Sea-coaſts. Nor ſhall the
ſaid River be raiſed hardly half a Brace; whereupon it neceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
followeth, that if I ſhould return to the Sea-ſide, and not
knowing any think of that which happeneth at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and ſeeing
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60312:50"/>
the River <hi>Arno</hi> raiſed by a Land-flood half a Brace, I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
affirm the ſaid River to be raiſed in <hi>Piſa</hi> thoſe ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Braces, &amp;c. From ſuch like accidents I conclude in the ſame
Letter, that it is neceſſary to make great account of every little
riſe that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> ſhall make towards the Sea. Now cometh
<hi>Bartolotti</hi> (and perhaps becauſe I knew not how to expreſs my
ſelf better, underſtandeth not my Propoſition) and ſpeaketh that
which indeed is true, but yet beſides our caſe: Nor have I ever
ſaid the contrary; and withall doth not apply it to his purpoſe.
Nay I ſay, that if he had well applyed it, this alone had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to have made him change his opinion. And becauſe he ſaith,
that I ſaid, that it is true, when the abatement proceedeth from
ſome cauſe above, as namely by Rain, or opening of Lakes;
But when the cauſe is from below, that is, by ſome ſtop, as for
inſtance ſome Fiſhers Wears or Locks, or ſome impediment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the Sea, although at the Level it ſhall riſe ſome Braces
where the impediment is, yet that riſing ſhall go upwards; and
here he finiſheth his Diſcourſe, and concludeth not any thing
more. To which I ſay firſt, that I have alſo ſaid the ſame in the
Propoſition, namely, that a Flood coming (which maketh <hi>Arno</hi>
to riſe in <hi>Piſa</hi> ſix or ſeven Braces (which I take to be a ſuperiour
cauſe whether it be Rain or the opening of Lakes, as beſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<hi>Bartolotti</hi>) in ſuch a caſe I ſay, and in no other (for towards
the Sea-coaſts it ſhall not cauſe a riſing of full half a Brace; and
therefore ſeeing <hi>Arno</hi> at the Sea-ſide to be raiſed by a Flood, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Rain, or of opening of Lakes half a Brace) it may be
inferred, that at <hi>Piſa</hi> it ſhall be raiſed thoſe ſix or ſeven Braces;
which variety, well conſidered, explaineth all this affair in favour
of my opinion: For the riſing that is made by the impediment
placed below, of Fiſhing Weares and Locks, operateth at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
raiſing the Waters that are neer to the impediment;
and afterwards leſs and leſs, as we retire upwards from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment:
provided yet that we ſpeak not of a Flood that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
by acceſſion, but onely of the ordinary Water impeded.
But there being a new acceſſion, as in our caſe, then the Water
of the Flood, I ſay, ſhall make a greater riſing in the parts ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
far from the impediment; and theſe impediments ſhall
come to be thoſe that ſhall overflow the Plains, as happened
eighteen or nineteen years ago, before the opening of <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> into the Sea, The ſame will certainly follow, if <hi>Fiume
morto</hi> be let into <hi>Serchio.</hi> Here I could alledge a very pretty
caſe that befell me in <hi>la</hi>

where I drained a Bog or Fen, of the nature of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Piſa,</hi> and I ſucceeded in the enterprize, the Waters in their
ſite towards the Sea abating only three Palmes, and yet in the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:60312:51"/>
Fen they fell more than fifteen Palmes. But the buſineſſe
would be long, and not ſo eaſily to be declared, and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>Sig. Bartolotti</hi> having conſidered this, would alter his
judgment, and withall would know that remitting that impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
anew, which I had left for leſſe than three I almes towards
the Sea, the Waters in the Fen would return with the firſt Floods
and Raines to the ſame height as before, as likewiſe <hi>Fiume morto</hi>
will do if it ſhall be let again into <hi>Serchio.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Here I intreat your Honour to do me the favour to importune
<hi>P. Franceſco</hi> in my behalf, that he would be pleaſed to declare
my meaning in the aforeſaid Letter to <hi>Sig. Bartolotti,</hi> for I hope
that if he will underſtand this point, he will be no longer ſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious
in his opinion.</p>
                              <p>Next that theſe Lords in the Commiſſion of Sewers, with the
Right Honourable the Marqueſſe of S. <hi>Angelo,</hi> and your Honour
do approve of my judgment, doth very much rejoyce me; but
becauſe that I know that they do it not in deſign to complement
me, but onely to ſerve his Highneſs our Grand Duke, I freely
profeſs that I will pretend no farther obligations from them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
than I account my ſelf to owe to thoſe whoſe opinions are
contrary to mine, for that I know that they have the ſame end.
The definitive ſentence of this whole buſineſs is, that they give
theſe Plains, theſe Draines, and theſe Waters farre fetcht ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations.</p>
                              <p>11. As to the quantity of the Water that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth
into the Sea, there are very great diſputes about it, and
I have been preſent at ſome of them. But let your Honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, that as this is not continual, but only during a few
dayes, ſo it will never be of any great prejudice to theſe Fields;
and if your Lordſhip would be aſcertained thereof, you may
pleaſe to go to <hi>Fiume morto</hi> at about a mile's diſtance from the
Sea, in the time of theſe ſtrong Windes, and obſerve the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from thence upwards, for you ſhall finde it extream ſlow,
and conſequently will know that the quantity of the Water that
is repuls'd is very ſmall. And this ſeems to be contradicted by the
rule of Riſings proceeding from cauſes below, which occaſion no
conſiderable alteration far from the Sea.</p>
                              <p>I am neceſſitated to go to morrow out of <hi>Rome</hi> with his Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
Cardinal <hi>Gaetano</hi> about certain affairs touching Waters,
therefore I ſhall not farther inlarge, but for a cloſe to this tedious
Diſcourſe, I conclude in few words, that <hi>Fiume morto</hi> is by no
means to be let into <hi>Serchio,</hi> nor are there any means intermedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
courſes to be taken, for they will alwayes be prejudicial; but
<hi>Fiume morto</hi> is to be diſcharged immediately into the Sea. When
it is ſtopt up by the fury of the Sea-waves, I affirm that it is a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:60312:51"/>
ſign that there is no need of opening it; and if there be any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to open it, it is eaſily done. As for the reſt your Lordſhip
may pleaſe to keep account of all the particulars that occur, for
the memory of things paſt is our Tutreſſe in thoſe that are to

for that I think that whatſoever may be done well and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
in this matter hath abſolute dependance on the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of that ſo important Propoſition, by me demonſtrated and
explained in my Treatiſe of the <hi>Menſuration</hi> of <hi>Running Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
namely, That the ſame water of a River doth continually
change Meaſures, according as it altereth and changeth the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of its courſe; ſo that the meaſure of the thickneſſe of a
River in one Site, to the meaſure of the ſame River in another
Site, hath the ſame proportion reciprocally that the velocity in
this ſite hath to the velocity in the firſt ſite. And this is a Truth
ſo conſtant and unchangeable, that it altereth not in the leaſt
point on any occurrences of the Waters that change: and
being well underſtood, it openeth the way to the knowledge of
ſundry advertiſements in theſe matters, which are all reſolved by
this ſole Principle; and from it are derived very conſiderable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits;
and without theſe it is impoſſible to do any thing with
abſolute perfection.</p>

CONSIDERATION

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongſt the enterprizes by me eſteemed, if not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
impoſſible,, at leaſt exceeding difficult,
one was that famous one of Draining the <hi>Pontine
Fenns;</hi> and therefore I was thorowly reſolved
never to apply my minde thereunto, although
by my Patrons I ſhould be commanded to the
ſame: accounting that it was an occaſion rather of loſing repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
by the miſcarriage of the attempt, than of gaining fame by
reducing things to a better paſs then they now are at. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs,
having of late years obſerved the place, and ſailed through
thoſe Chanels, and thoſe Waters; after I had made ſome reflection
thereupon, I thought that the enterprize was not ſo difficult as
I had at firſt conceited it to be; and I am the more confirmed in
this opinion, upon the inducement of that which I have written
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60312:53"/>
Geometrically in my Treatiſe of the Menſuration of Running
Waters; ſo that talking with ſeveral perſons, I adventured to
affirm, in diſcoures, that this improvement might poſſibly be
brought into a good eſtate.</p>
                     <p>Now I have reſolved to ſet down my thoughts in writing, and
to honour this my Paper with the Noble Name of your Lordſhip,
to render it the more credible and conſpicuous at the firſt view,
if it ſhould chance that the Subject I treat of, were not of ſuch
moment, as that it did deſerve to be valued for any other reaſon.
Pardon me, Sir, if I have been too bold, and continue me in the
number of your Servants.</p>
                     <p>The enterprize of Draining a great part of the Territories of
the <hi>Pontine Fenns,</hi> hath been undertaken both in the time of
the antient <hi>Romans,</hi> and laſt of all, in our days; yea in the late
times by <hi>Sixtus</hi> V. I do not doubt in the leaſt, but that it will
be poſſible yet to reduce things to a very good paſs; and if I be not
miſtaken, with a very ſmall charge in compariſon of the profit that
would be received from thoſe rich Grounds. This improvement
was of great expence in the time of <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
the thing was not rightly underſtood, there were made many
Drains; a great part of which were unprofitable and vain: and
amongſt ſo many operations, there hapned ſome to be made that
ſucceeded, as was deſired; but not being underſtood, they were
held in no account; and thus the buſineſs being neglected, the
waters are returned into the ſame ſtate as they were at firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the improvement. Here I have by familiar diſcourſes
with my friends, explained this enterprize undertaken by <hi>Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
V. and haply alſo by ſome more antient, with the example of
the Fable of <hi>Orilo,</hi> in <hi>Arioſto.</hi> This Monſter was made up with
ſuch enchantment, that men fought with him alwayes in vain;
for though in the Combate he were cut in pieces, thoſe divided
Members preſently re-united, and returned to the fight more
fierce then ever. But the <hi>Paladine Aſtolfo</hi> coming to undertake
him, after a long diſpute, at the end he cut his head ſheer off
from the ſhoulders at one blow; and nimbly alighting from his
Horſe, took the Monſtrous head, and mounting again, as he rid
away he fell to ſhave the Pole of that Monſter, and ſo he loſt
the Lock of Hair, in which alone the enchantment lay; and then
the horrible Head in an inſtant manifeſted ſigns of death, and the
trunk which ran, ſeeking to reunite to it anew, gave the laſt gaſp,
and in this manner the enchantment ended. The Book of Fate
ſerved admirably to the <hi>Paladine,</hi> whereby he came to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
that Charm; for by ſhaving his whole head, the enchanted
hairs came to be cut off amongſt the reſt: In the ſame manner, I
ſay, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> hath ſometimes happened in Draining thoſe Fields;
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60312:53"/>
for that amongſt ſo many tryals as have been made, that alſo
was light upon, on which the improvement and remedy to the
diſorder did depend. And to us my fore-named Treatiſe ſhall
ſerve for a Rule, which being well underſtood, ſhall make us to
know wherein conſiſteth, and whereon dependeth this miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and conſequently it will be eaſie to apply thereunto a ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
remedy.</p>
                     <p>And firſt I ſay, That there is no doubt but that the waters
continue ſo high on thoſe Plains becauſe they are ſo high in the
principal River, which ought to receive them, and carry them
into the Sea. Now the Cauſes of the height of the River, may
in my judgement be reduced to one alone; which is that by me
ſo often mentioned for the moſt Potent one, and declared in my
afore-named Tractate; to wit, The tardity of the motion of the
waters, which doth alwayes infallibly, and preciſely cauſe the
ſelf ſame Running Water to change the meaſure of its thickneſs
at ſuch a rate, that the more it encreaſeth in velocity, the more
it decreaſeth in meaſure; and the more it decreaſeth in velocity,
the more it encreaſeth in meaſure: As for example; If a River
run in ſuch a place with the velocity of moving a mile in the
ſpace of an hour, and afterwards the ſame River in another place
doth encreaſe in velocity, ſo as to make three miles an hour;
that ſame River ſhall diminiſh in thickneſs two thirds: And on
the contrary, If it ſhall diminiſh in velocity ſo, as that it runneth
but half a mile in the ſame time, it ſhall encreaſe the double in
thickneſs and meaſure. And in a word, look what proportion
the velocity in the firſt place, hath to the velocity in the ſecond,
and ſuch hath reciprocally the meaſure of the thickneſs in the
ſecond place, to the meaſure in the firſt; as I have clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
in my Treatiſe: Which I repeat ſo frequently, that I
fear the Profeſſors of Polite Learning will charge me with Tua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologie,
and vain Repetition. But I am ſo deſirous in this moſt
important point to be well underſtood, becauſe it will then be
eaſie to comprehend all the reſt; and without this it is impoſſible
(I will not ſay difficult, but abſolutely impoſſible) to underſtand,
or ever to effect any thing to purpoſe. And the better to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the example, let it be ſuppoſed, 
<figure/>
That the water of a River AD,
runneth high at the level of AF,
with ſuch a certain velocity; and let
it, by the ſame water, be velocitated
three times more; I ſay, that it will
abate 1/3, and ſhall ſtand at the level
in BE; and if it ſhall more veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,
it will abate the more at the Sea; But if it ſhould retard
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60312:54"/>
more than it did at the level AF, it would riſe yet more above
the ſaid level AF; although that the ſelf ſame quantity of water
runneth all the while. By the above-named ſolid Principle I
reſolve extravagant Problems in my Treatiſe, and aſſign the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of admirable effects of Running Waters: But as for what
concerneth our purpoſe of the <hi>Pontine Fenns,</hi> we have the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
very plain and clear; for which, by the trampling of Cattle
which paſs thorow the <hi>Draining River,</hi> the waters abate ſo nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
that it is as it were a miracle for thoſe Reeds, Flags, and
Weeds that ſpring up, encreaſe, and ſpread all over the River,
ſtop and impede that velocity of the waters which they would
have by means of their declivity. But that paſſage of thoſe Beaſts,
treading down thoſe Weeds unto the bottom of the River, in ſuch
ſort, as that they no longer hinder the Current of the Water;
and the ſame Waters increaſing in their courſe, they do dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
in meaſure and height; and by this meanes the Ditches of the
Plains empty into the ſame ſucceſsfully, and leave them free
from Waters, and Drained. But theſe Weeds in a ſhort
time ſprouting up anew, and raiſing their ſtalkes thorow the
body of the Waters, they reduce things to the ſame evil
ſtate, as before, retarding the velocity of the Water, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it to increaſe in height, and perhaps do occaſion grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
miſchiefs; ſeeing that thoſe many knots which each plant
ſhoots forth, begets a greater multitude of Stalks, which much
more incumbering the Water of the River, are a greater impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
unto its velocity, and conſequently make the height
of the waters to encreaſe ſo much the more, and do more miſchief
than before.</p>
                     <p>Another head to which theſe harms may be reduced, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the ſame Root, which hath a great part in this
diſorder, is the impediment of thoſe Wears in the River which
are made by heightning the bed of the ſame, for placing of fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-nets;
of which <hi>Piſcaries</hi> I reckoned above ten, when I made
a voyage thorow thoſe waters to <hi>Sandolo.</hi> And theſe Fiſhing-Wears
are ſuch impediments, that ſome one of them makes the
water of the River in the upper part to riſe half a Palm, and
ſometimes a whole Palm, and more; ſo that when they are all
gathered together, theſe impediments amount to more than ſeven,
or poſſibly than eight Palms.</p>
                     <p>There concurreth for a third moſt Potent Cauſe of the waters
continuing high in the evacuating, or Draining Chanel, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
on the Plains; The great abundance of water that iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from <hi>Fiume Siſto,</hi> the waters of which do not keep within its
Banks when they are abundant; but encreaſing above its Chanel,
they unite with thoſe of the Evacuator, and diſperſing thorow
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60312:54"/>
the Fens are raiſed with great prejudice, and much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than is conceived, according to what hath been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
in the Second Conſideration upon the <hi>Lake of Venice.</hi>
Nor is it to any purpoſe to ſay, that if we ſhould meaſure
all the Waters that disimbogue from <hi>Fiume Siſto,</hi> and gather
them into one ſumme, we ſhould not finde them to be ſuch,
as that they ſhall be able to make the Waters of the Fens
to increaſe, by reaſon of the great expanſion of them, over
which that body of water is to diſtend: for to this inſtance we
anſwer with that which we have given notice of in the Firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
touching the <hi>Lake of Venice,</hi> treating of the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that is cauſed by the <hi>Brent</hi> let into the Lake. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
if I ſhall adde thereto that which I write in the Second
Conſideration, it will be very apparent how greatly harmfull
and prejudicial theſe excurſions of Waters from <hi>Fiume Siſto</hi>
may be, which are not kept under, and confined within the
River: Therefore, proceeding to the proviſions, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
that are to be accounted Principall, I reduce them to
three Heads.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place it is neceſſary to throw down thoſe Weares,
and to take the Piſciaries quite away, obſerving a Maxime, in
my judgment, infallible, that Fiſhing and Sowing are two things
that can never conſiſt together; Fiſhing being on the Water, and
Sowing on land.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it will be neceſſary to cut under Water in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
of the River thoſe Weeds and Plants that grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
in the River, and leave them to be carried into the Sea by
the Stream; for by this means theſe Reeds ſhall not ſpring up
and diſtend along the bottome of the River, by means of the
Beaſts treading upon them; And the ſame ought to be done
often, and with care, and muſt not be delaied till the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
increaſe, and the Champain Grounds be drowned, but
one ought to order matters ſo, as that they may not drown.
And I will affirm, that otherwiſe this principal point would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a moſt conſiderable inconvenience.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is neceſſary to make good the Banks of <hi>Fiume Siſto</hi>
on the left hand, and to procure that thoſe Waters may run in
the Chanel, and not break forth. And it is to be noted, that
it is not enough to do one or two of thoſe things, but we are to
put them all in execution; for omitting any thing, the whole
machine will be out of tune, and ſpoiled. But proceeding with
due care, you ſhall not only Drain the <hi>Pontine Fens,</hi> but by
means of this laſt particular the Current of <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi> ſhall
ſcowr its own Chanel of its ſelf, even to the carrying part of it
away: and haply with this abundance of water that it ſhall
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60312:55"/>
bear, the Mouth <hi>della Torre</hi> may be opened, and kept open
into the Sea. And it would, laſt of all, be of admirable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
to cleanſe <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi> from many Trees and Buſhes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
it is overgrown.</p>
                     <p>And with this I conclude, that the Improvement or Drain
poſſible to be made conſiſteth in theſe three particulars. Firſt,
in taking away the Fiſhing Weares, leaving the Courſe
of the Waters free. Secondly, in keeping the Principal
Rivers clear from Weeds and Plants. Thirdly, in keeping
the water of <hi>Fiume Sisto</hi> in its own Chanel. All which are
things that may be done with very little charge, and to the
manifeſt benefit of the whole Country, and to the rendering
the Air wholſomer in all thoſe Places adjoyning to the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Fens.</hi>

and Noble <hi>Monſignore Corſini,</hi>
who was heretofore Deputed Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
General, and Viſitor of thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
I am not able to make ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Diſcourſe upon the ſame Subject, but will only ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
for farther confirmation of that which I have ſaid in this
Book upon the <hi>Lake of Venice,</hi> upon the <hi>Pontine Fens,</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Draining of thoſe Plains of <hi>Piſa,</hi> lying between the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Arno</hi> and <hi>Serchio;</hi> whereby it is manifeſt, that in all the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60312:56"/>
aforementioned Caſes, and in the preſent one that we are in hand
with, there have, in times paſt, very groſſe Errours been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
through the not having ever well underſtood the true
meaſure of Running waters; and here it is to be noted, that the
buſineſſe is, that in <hi>Venice,</hi> the diverſion of the waters of the
Lake, by diverting the <hi>Brent</hi> was debated, and in part executed,
without conſideration had how great abatement of water might
follow in the Lake, if the <hi>Brent</hi> were diverted, as I have ſhewn
in the firſt Conſideration upon this particular, from which act
there hath inſued very bad conſequences, not only the difficulty
of Navigation, but it hath infected the wholſomneſſe of the Air,
and cauſed the ſtoppage of the Ports of <hi>Venice.</hi> And on the
contrary, the ſame inadvertency of not conſidering what riſing of
the Water the <hi>Reno,</hi> and other Rivers being opened into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys
of <hi>Bologna</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> might cauſe in the ſaid Valleys, is
the certain cauſe that ſo many rich and fertile Fields are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under water, converting the happy habitations and dwellings
of men into miſerable receptacles for Fiſhes: Things which
doubtleſſe would never have happened, if thoſe Rivers had been
kept at their height, and <hi>Reno</hi> had been turn'd into <hi>Main-Po,</hi>
and the other Rivers into that of <hi>Argenta,</hi> and of <hi>Volano.</hi> Now
there having ſufficient been ſpoken by the above-named <hi>Monſig.
Corſini</hi> in his Relation, I will only adde one conceit of my own,
which after the Rivers ſhould be regulated, as hath been ſaid, I
verily believe would be of extraordinary profit, I much doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
that I ſhall finde it a hard matter to perſwade men to be of
my mind, but yet nevertheleſs I will not queſtion, but that thoſe,
at leaſt, who ſhall have underſtood what I have ſaid and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
concerning the manners and proportions, according to
which the abatements and riſings of Running waters proceed,
that are made by the Diverſions and Introductions of VVaters,
will apprehend that my conjecture is grounded upon Reaſon,
And although I deſcend not to the exactneſſe of particulars, I
will open the way to others, who having obſerved the requiſite
Rules of conſidering the quantity of the waters that are intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
or that happen to be diverted, ſhall be able with punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
to examine the whole buſineſſe, and then reſolve on that
which ſhall be expedient to be done.</p>
                     <p>Reflecting therefore upon the firſt Propoſition, that the
Riſings of a Running Water made by the acceſſion of new water
into the River, are to one another, as the Square-Roots of the
quantity of the water that runneth; and conſequently, that the
ſame cometh to paſs in the Diverſions: Inſomuch, that a River
running in height one ſuch a certain meaſure, to make it encreaſe
double in height, the water is to be encreaſed to three times as
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60312:56"/>
much as it ran before; ſo that when the water ſhall be quadru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the height ſhall be double; and if the water were centuple,
the height would be decuple onely, and ſo from one quantity
to another: And on the contrary, in the Diverſions; If of the
100. parts of water that run thorow a River, there ſhall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
19/100, the height of the River diminiſheth onely 1/10, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing
to divert 17/100, the height of the River abateth likewiſe 1/10,
and ſo proceeding to divert 15/100 and then 13/100, and then 11/100, and
then 9/100, and then 7/100, and then 5/100, and then 3/100, alwaies by
each of theſe diverſions, the height of the Running Water di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheth
the tenth part: although that the diverſions be ſo une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual.
Reflecting I ſay upon this infallible Truth, I have had a
conceit, that though the <hi>Reno</hi> and other Rivers were diverted
from the Valleyes, and there was onely left the <hi>Chanel of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,</hi>
which was onely the 1/20 part of the whole water that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
into the Valleys; yet nevertheleſs, the water in thoſe ſame
Valleyes would retain a tenth part of that height that became
conjoyned by the concourſe of all the Rivers: And therefore I
ſhould think that it were the beſt reſolution to maintain the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of Navigation</hi> (if it were poſſible) continuate unto the <hi>Po</hi> of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> and from thence to carry it into the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Volano,</hi> for
beſides that it would be of very great eaſe in the Navigation of
<hi>Bologna,</hi> and <hi>Ferrara,</hi> the ſaid water would render the <hi>Po</hi> of
<hi>Volano</hi> navigable as far as to the very Walls of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
the Navigation would be continuate from <hi>Bologna</hi> to
the Sea-ſide.</p>
                     <p>But to manage this enterprize well, it is neceſſary to meaſure
the quantity of the Water that the Rivers diſcharge into the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
and that which the <hi>Chanel of Navigation</hi> carryeth, in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
as I have demonſtrated at the beginning of this Book; for this
once known, we ſhall alſo come to know, how profitable this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of the <hi>Chanel of Navigation</hi> from the Valleys is like to
prove; which yet would ſtill be unprofitable, if ſo be that all
the Rivers that diſcharge their waters into the Valleys, ſhould
not firſt be Drained, according to what hath been above ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed.</p>

by reaſon of the impediments that their Draines received, finding

not only by the riſing of the water, but by the raiſing of the
bottome, by reaſon of the matter ſunk thither after Land-floods,
and dilateth ſo, that it covereth all the Meadows there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
nor doth it receive with the wonted facility the Drains of
the upper Grounds, of which the next unto it lying under the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that return upwards by the Conveyances, and the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote,
not finding a paſſage for Rain-waters that ſettle, become
either altogether unprofitable or little better.</p>
                     <p>From this Valley, by the Trench or Ditch of <hi>Marzara,</hi> or of
<hi>la Duca</hi> by <hi>la Buova,</hi> or mouth of <hi>Caſtaldo de Roſſi,</hi> and by the

it clear, that ſo it may ſink farther therein, and receiving

ariſe a very contrary effect.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore the ſuperficies of the water keeping high, until

the <hi>Idice, Quaderna, Sellero</hi> fall in, from ſwallowing and taking
in their Waters by their uſual In-lets, yet many times, as I my
ſelf have ſeen in the <hi>Viſitation,</hi> they drink them up plentifully,
whereupon, being conjoyned with the muddineſſe of thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that fall into the ſame, they ſwell, and dilate, and overflow
ſome grounds, and deprive others of their Drains in like manner

as hath been ſaid of that of <hi>Marrara,</hi> inſomuch that from the
Point of S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> as far as S. <hi>Alberto</hi> all thoſe that are between

ſome conſiderable ſpace above not a little damnified.</p>
                     <p>In fine, by raiſing the bottom or ſand of the Valleys, and the
bed of <hi>Reno,</hi> and the too great repletion of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro</hi>

to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtick State.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which particulars all appear to be atteſted under the hand of
a Notary in the <hi>Viſitation</hi> which I made upon the command of
His Holineſſe, and are withall known to be true by the<note n="*" place="margin">People of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Ferrareſi</hi>

aſwell for the miſchiefs paſt, as alſo for thoſe in time to
come, from which I hold it a duty of Conſcience, and of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to deliver them.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Clement</hi> judged, that the ſufficient means, to effect this
was the ſaid Introduction of the <hi>Main Po</hi> into the Chanel of

than benefit to that City, of which I ſpeak not at preſent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I think that there is need of a readier and more acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate
remedy.</p>
                     <p>So that I ſee not how any other thing can be ſo much conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
as the removal of <hi>Reno,</hi> omitting for this time to ſpeak of
<note n="*" place="margin">In Chanels made by hand.</note>incloſing it from Valley to Valley untill it come to the Sea, as
the Dukes of <hi>Ferrara</hi> did deſign, foraſmuch as all thoſe <hi>Ferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſi</hi>
that have intereſt in the <hi>Poleſine di</hi> S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and on the
right hand of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta</hi> do not deſire it, and do, but too
openly, proteſt againſt it; and becauſe that before the Chanel
were made as far as the Sea, many hundreds of years would be
ſpent, and yet would not remedy the dammages of thoſe who
now are agrieved, but would much increaſe them, in regard the
Valleys would continue ſubmerged, the Drains ſtopped, and the
other Brooks obſtructed, which would of neceſſity drown not a
few Lands that lie between Valley and Valley; and in fine, in
regard it hath not from <hi>San Martina</hi> to the Sea for a ſpace of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
miles a greater fall then 19, 8, 6, feet, it would want that force
which they themſelves who propound this project do require it to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:60312:58"/>
have, that ſo it may not depoſe the matter of the muddineſs when
it is intended to be let into <hi>Volana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that making the Line of the bottome neer to <hi>Vigarano,</hi> it
would riſe to thoſe prodigious termes that they do make bigger,
and they may thence expect thoſe miſchiefs, for which they
will not admit of introducing it into the ſaid <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Volana.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Amongſt the wayes therefore that I have thought of for effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that ſame remotion, and which I have cauſed to be viewed by
skilful men that have taken a level thereof, (with the aſſiſtance of
the venerable Father, <hi>D. Benedetto Caſtelli</hi> of <hi>Caſina,</hi> a man of
much fidelity and honeſty, and no leſs expert in ſuch like affairs
touching waters, than perfect in the <hi>Mathematick</hi> Diſciplines) two
onely, the reſt being either too tedious, or too dangerous to the
City, have ſeemed to me worthy, and one of them alſo more than
the other, to offer to your Lordſhip.</p>
                     <p>The one is to remit it into the Chanel of <hi>Volana,</hi> thorow which
it goeth of its own accord to the Sea.</p>
                     <p>The other is to turn it into <hi>Main-Po</hi> at <hi>Stellata,</hi> for, as at other
times it hath done, it will carry it to the Sea happily.</p>
                     <p>As to what concerns the making choice of the firſt way, that
which ſeemeth to perſwade us to it is, that we therein do nothing
that is new, in that it is but reſtored to the place whence it was
removed in the year 1522. in the time of Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> by an
agreement made in way of contract, between <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Ferrara,</hi> and the <hi>Bologneſi;</hi> and that it was diverted for reaſons,
that are either out of date, or elſe have been too long time
deferred.</p>
                     <p>In like manner the facility wherewith it may be effected, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it run into the divided <hi>Po,</hi> whereby it will be turned to <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara,</hi>
or elſe carrying it by <hi>Torre del Fondo,</hi> to the mouth of <hi>Maſi,</hi>
and from thence thorow the Trench made by the <hi>Ferrareſi,</hi>
along by <hi>Panaro,</hi> where alſo finding an ample Bed, and high and
thick Banks, that will ſerve at other times for it, and for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Po,</hi> there may a great expence be ſpared.</p>
                     <p>That what ever its Fall be, it would maintain the ſame, not
having other Rivers, which with their Floods can hinder it; and
that running confined between good Banks, without doubt it
would not leave <hi>la Motto</hi> by the way; but eſpecially, that it
would be ſufficient if it came to <hi>Codigoro,</hi> where being aſſiſted by
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea, it would run no hazard of
having its Chanel filled up from thence downwards.</p>
                     <p>That there might thence many benefits be derived to the City,
by means of the Running Waters, and alſo no mean Navigation
might be expected.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary it is objected, That it is not convenient to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60312:59"/>
think of returning this Torrent into the divided <hi>Po,</hi> by reaſon of
the peril that would thence redound to this City.</p>
                     <p>And that going by <hi>Torre del Fondo,</hi> through <hi>Sanmartina</hi> to
the Mouth <hi>de Maſi</hi> by the Chappel of <hi>Vigarano</hi> unto the Sea, it is
by this way 70. miles; nor is the Fall greater than 26. 5. 6. Feet, ſo
that it would come to fall but 4. inches &amp; an half, or thereabouts
in a mile; whereas the common opinion of the skilfull (to the
end that the Torrents may not depoſe their ſand that they bring
with them in Land-Floods) requireth the twenty fourth part of
the hundredth part of their whole length, which in our caſe,
accounting according to the meaſure of theſe places, is 16. inches
a<note n="*" place="margin">The inch of theſe places is ſomewhat bigger than ours.</note> mile; whereupon the ſinking of the Mud and Sand would
moſt certainly follow, and ſo an immenſe heightning of the Line
of the Bottom, and conſequently a neceſſity of raiſing the Banks,
the impoſſibility of maintaining them, the danger of breaches
and decayes, things very prejudicial to the <hi>Iſlets</hi> of this City, and
of <hi>San Giorgio,</hi> the obſtruction of the Drains, which from the
Tower of <hi>Tienne</hi> downwards, fall into the ſaid Chanel; to wit,
thoſe of the Sluices of <hi>Goro,</hi> and the Drains, of the Meadows of
<hi>Ferrara:</hi> And moreover, the damages that would ariſe unto the
ſaid <hi>Iſlet</hi> of S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and the Valleys of <hi>Comachio,</hi> by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
that ſhould enter into the <hi>Goro</hi> or Dam of the Mills of <hi>Belri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guardo,</hi>
thorow the Trenches of <hi>Quadrea,</hi> which cannot be ſtopt,
becauſe they belong to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> who hath right of
diverting the waters of that place at his pleaſure to the work of
turning Mills.</p>
                     <p>The greater part of which Objections, others pretend to prove
frivolous, by ſaying, that its running there till at the laſt it was
turned another way, is a ſign that it had made ſuch an elevation
of the Line, of its Bed as it required; denying that it needeth
ſo great a declivity as is mentioned above; and that for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
it would riſe no more.</p>
                     <p>That the ſaid Dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ns and Ditches did empty into the ſame,
whilſt <hi>Po</hi> was there; ſo that they muſt needs be more able to do
ſo when onely <hi>Reno</hi> runs that way.</p>
                     <p>That there would no Breaches follow, or if they did, they
would be onely of the water of <hi>Reno,</hi> which in few hours might
be taken away (in thoſe parts they call damming up of Breaches,
and mending the Bank, <hi>taking away the Breaches</hi>) and its a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether they would procure more inconvenience than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
for that its Mud and Sand might in many places, by filling
them up, occaſion a ſeaſonable improvement.</p>
                     <p>Now omitting to diſcourſe of the ſolidity of the reaſons on the
oneſide, or on the other, I will produce thoſe that move me to
ſuſpend my allowance of this deſign.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:60312:59"/>
The firſt is, that although I dare not ſubſcribe to the opinion
of thoſe that require 16. inches Declivity in a mile to <hi>Reno,</hi> to
prevent its depoſing of Mud; yet would I not be the Author that
ſhould make a trial of it with ſo much hazard, for having to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
my ſelf in ſome particulars cauſed a Level to be taken of
the Rivers <hi>L'amone, Senio,</hi> and <hi>Santerno,</hi> by <hi>Bernardino Aleotti,</hi>
we found that they have more Declivity by much than Artiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
as alſo the <hi>Reno</hi> hath from <hi>la Botta de Ghiſlieri</hi> to the
Chappel of <hi>Vigarano,</hi> for in the ſpace of four miles its Bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Line
falleth five feet and five inches. So that I hold it greater
prudence to depend upon that example, than to go contrary to a
common opinion, eſpecially ſince, that the effects cauſed by <hi>Reno</hi>
it ſelf do confirm me in the ſame, for when it was forſaken by
the <hi>Po,</hi> after a few years, either becauſe it had choaked up its
Chanel with Sand, or becauſe its too long journey did increaſe
it, it alſo naturally turned aſide, and took the way of the ſaid
<hi>Po</hi> towards <hi>Stellata.</hi> Nay, in thoſe very years that it did run that
way, it only began (as relations ſay) to make Breaches, an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
ſign that it doth depoſe Sand, and raiſe its Bed; which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth
with the teſtimony of ſome that were examined in the
<hi>Viſitation</hi> of the Publique Notary, who found great benefit by
having Running Water, and ſome kind of paſſage for Boats,
and yet nevertheleſs affirm that it for want of Running Water
had made too high Stoppages and Shelfes of Sand; ſo that if
it ſhould be reſtored to the Courſe that it forſook, I much fear
that after a ſhort time, if not ſuddenly, it would leave it a-again.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond I take from the obſervation of what happened to
<hi>Panaro,</hi> when with ſo great applauſe of the <hi>Ferareſi,</hi> it was
brought by Cardinal <hi>Serra</hi> into the ſaid Chanel of <hi>Volana;</hi> for
that notwithſtanding that it had Running Waters in much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
abundance than <hi>Reno;</hi> yet in the time that it continued in
that Chanel it raiſed its Bed well neer five feet, as is to be ſeen
below the Sluice made by Cardinal <hi>Capponi</hi> to his new Chanel;
yea, the ſaid Cardinal <hi>Serra</hi> who deſired that this his undertaking
ſhould appear to have been of no danger nor damage, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
at its Overflowings, to give it Vent into <hi>Sanmartina,</hi> that
it might not break in upon, and prejudice the City; which dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
I ſhould more fear from <hi>Reno,</hi> in regard it carrieth a greater
abundance of Water and Sand.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, I am much troubled (in the uncertainty of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of the affair) at the great expence thereto required; For in
regard I do not approve of letting it in, neer to the Fortreſſe,
for many reſpects, and carrying it by <hi>la Torre del Fondo</hi> to the
Mouth <hi>de Maſi,</hi> it will take up eight miles of double Banks, a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60312:60"/>
thing not eaſie to be procured, by reaſon that the Grounds lie
under Water; but from the Mouth <hi>de Maſi</hi> unto <hi>Codigoro,</hi> it
would alſo be neceſſary to make new Scowrings of the Chanel;
to the end, that the Water approaching (by wearing and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
away the Earth on both ſhores, might make a Bed ſufficient
for its Body, the depth made for <hi>Panaro</hi> not ſerving the turn, as
I conceive; and if it ſhould ſuffice, when could the people of
<hi>Ferrara</hi> hope to be re-imburſed and ſatisfied for the charge
thereof?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it ſerves as an Argument with me, to ſee that the
very individual perſons concerned in the Remotion or Diverſion
of the ſaid Torrent, namely, the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> do not incline unto it,
and that the whole City of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> even thoſe very perſons who
at preſent receive damage by it, cannot indure to hear thereof.
The reaſon that induceth theſe laſt named to be ſo averſe thereto,
is, either becauſe that this undertaking will render the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Water of <hi>Main-Po</hi> more difficult; or becauſe they fear
the danger thereof; The others decline the Project, either for
that they know that <hi>Reno</hi> cannot long continue in that Courſe,
or becauſe they fear that it is too much expoſed to thoſe mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful
Cutting of it who do not deſire it ſhould; and if a
man have any other wayes, he ought, in my opinion, to forbear
that, which to ſuch as ſtand in need of its Removal, is leſſe ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory,
and to ſuch as oppoſe it, more prejudicial.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, I exceedingly honour the judgment of Cardinal
<hi>Capponi,</hi> who having to his Natural Ability and Prudence added
a particular Study, Obſervation, and Experience of theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for the ſpace of three years together, doth not think that
<hi>Reno</hi> can go by <hi>Volana;</hi> to which agreeth the opinion of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
S. <hi>Marcello,</hi> Legate of this City, of whom, for his exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
underſtanding, we ought to make great account. But if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this ſhould be reſolved on, it would be materially neceſſary
to unite the Quick and Running Waters of the little Chanel of
<hi>Cento,</hi> of the Chanel <hi>Navilio,</hi> of <hi>Guazzaloca,</hi> and at its very
beginning thoſe of <hi>Dardagna,</hi> which at preſent, is one of the
Springs or Heads of <hi>Panaro,</hi> that ſo they might aſſiſt it in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its Sand, and the matter of its Muddineſs into the Sea; and
then there would not fail to be a greater evacuation and ſcowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
but withall the Proprietors in the Iſlet of <hi>San Giorgio</hi> and
of <hi>Ferrara</hi> muſt prepare themſelves to indure the inconveniences
of Purlings or Sewings of the Water from the River thorow
the Boggy Ground thereabouts.</p>
                     <p>I ſhould more eaſily incline therefore to carry it into <hi>Main-Po</hi>
at <hi>Stellata,</hi> for the Reaſons that Cardinal <hi>Capponi</hi> moſt ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
enumerates in a ſhort, but well-grounded Tract of his: not
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60312:60"/>
becauſe that indeed it would not both by Purlings and by Brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
occaſion ſome inconvenience; eſpecially, in the beginning:
but becauſe I hold this for the incomodities of it, to be a far leſs
evil than any of the reſt; and becauſe that by this means there is
no occaſion given to them of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> to explain that they are
deprived of the hope of ever ſeeing the <hi>Po</hi> again under the Walls
of their City: To whom, where it may be done, it is but reaſon
that ſatisfaction ſhould be given.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that <hi>Po</hi> was placed by Nature in the midſt of this
great Valley made by the <hi>Appennine</hi> Hills, and by the Alps, to
carry, as the Maſter-Drain to the Sea, that is the grand receptacle
of all Waters; thoſe particular ſtreams which deſcend from
them.</p>
                     <p>That the <hi>Reno</hi> by all Geographers, <hi>Strabo, Pliny, Solimas,
Mella,</hi> and others is enumerated among the Rivers that fall into
the ſaid <hi>Po.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That although <hi>Po</hi> ſhould of it ſelf change its courſe, yet would
<hi>Reno</hi> go to look it out, if the works erected by humane induſtry
did not obſtruct its paſſage; ſo that it neither is, nor ought to
ſeem ſtrange, if one for the greater common good ſhould turn it
into the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Now at <hi>Stellata</hi> it may go ſeveral waies into <hi>Po,</hi> as appeareth
by the levels that were taken by my Order; of all which I ſhould
beſt like the turning of it to <hi>la Botta de' Ghiſlieri,</hi> carrying it
above <hi>Bondeno</hi> to the Church of <hi>Gambarone,</hi> or a little higher or
lower, as ſhall be judged leaſt prejudicial, when it cometh to the
execution, and this for two principal reaſons: The one becauſe
that then it will run along by the confines of the Church P tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
without ſeparating <hi>Ferrara</hi> from the reſt of it; The other
is, Becauſe the Line is ſhorter, and conſequently the fall greater;
for that in a ſpace of ten miles and one third, it falleth twenty ſix
feet, more by much than is required by Artiſts; and would go
by places where it could do but little hurt, notwithſtanding that
the perſons interreſſed ſtudy to amplifie it incredibly.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary, there are but onely two objections that are
worthy to be examined; One, That the Drains and Ditches of
S. <hi>Bianca,</hi> of the Chanel of <hi>Cento,</hi> and of <hi>Burana,</hi> and all thoſe
others that enter into <hi>Po,</hi> do hinder this diverſion of <hi>Reno,</hi> by the
encreaſing of the waters in the <hi>Po.</hi> The other is that <hi>Po</hi> riſing
about the Tranſom of the <hi>Pilaſter</hi>-Sluice, very near 20 feet, the
<hi>Reno</hi> would have no fall into the ſame; whereupon it would riſe
to a terrible height, at which it would not be poſſible to make, or
keep the Banks made, ſo that it would break out and drown
the Meadowes, and cauſe miſchiefs, and damages unſpeakable
and irreparable; as is evident by the experiment made upon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:60312:61"/>
                        <hi>Panaro,</hi> which being confined between Banks, that it might go
into <hi>Po,</hi> this not being neither in its greateſt excreſcenſe, it broke
out into the territories of <hi>Final,</hi> and of <hi>Ferrara.</hi> And though
that might be done, it would thereupon enſue, that there being
let into the Chanel of <hi>Po,</hi> 2800. ſquare feet of water (for ſo much
we account thoſe of <hi>Reno</hi> and <hi>Panaro,</hi> taken together in their
greateſt heights) the ſuperficies of it would riſe at leaſt four feet,
inſomuch that either it would be requiſite to raiſe its Banks all the
way unto the Sea, to the ſame height, which the treaſures of the
<hi>Indies</hi> would not ſuffice to effect; or elſe there would be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of enduring exceſſive Breaches. To theſe two Heads are the
Arguments reduced, which are largely amplified againſt our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and I ſhall anſwer firſt to the laſt, as moſt material.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, that there are three caſes to be conſidered:
Firſt, <hi>Po</hi> high, and <hi>Reno</hi> low. Secondly, <hi>Reno</hi> high, and <hi>Po</hi>
low. Thirdly, <hi>Reno</hi> and <hi>Po</hi> both high together.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt and ſecond, there is no difficulty in them; for if
<hi>Po</hi> ſhall not be at its greateſt height, <hi>Reno</hi> ſhall ever have a fall
into it, and there ſhall need no humane Artifice about the Banks:
And if <hi>Reno</hi> ſhall be low, <hi>Po</hi> ſhall regurgitate and flow up into
the Chanel of it; and alſo from thence no inconvenience ſhall
follow. The third remains, from which there are expected ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
miſchiefs; but it is a moſt undoubted truth, that the excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of <hi>Reno,</hi> as coming from the adjacent <hi>Appennines</hi> and Rains,
are to continue but ſeven, or eight hours at moſt, and ſo would
never, or very rarely happen to be at the ſame time with thoſe of
<hi>Po,</hi> cauſed by the melting of the ſnowes of the Alps, at leaſt 400.
miles diſtance from thence. But becauſe it ſometimes may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
I reply, that when it cometh to paſs, <hi>Reno</hi> ſhall not go into
<hi>Po,</hi> but it ſhall have allowed it one or two Vents; namely, into
the Chanel of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> as it hath ever had; and into <hi>Sanmartina,</hi>
where it runneth at preſent, and wherewith there is no doubt, but
that the perſons concerned will be well pleaſed, it being a great
benefit to them, to have the water over-flow their grounds once
every four or five years, inſtead of ſeeing it anoy them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.
Yea, the Vent may be regulated, reſerving for it the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
in which <hi>Reno</hi> at preſent runneth; and inſtead of turning it
by a Dam at <hi>la Betta de Ghiſlieri,</hi> perhaps, to turn it by help of
ſtrong Sluices, that may upon all occaſions be opened and ſhut.
And for my part, I do not queſtion but that the Proprietors
themſelves in <hi>Sanmartina</hi> would make a Chanel for it; which
receiving, and confining it in the time of the Vents, might carry
the Sand into the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Primaro:</hi> Nor need there thence be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any ſtoppage by Mud and Sand, ſince that it is ſuppoſed that
there will but very ſeldom be any neceſſity of uſing it; ſo that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60312:61"/>
time would be allowed, upon occaſion, to ſcowr and cleanſe
it.</p>
                     <p>And in this manner all thoſe Prodigies vaniſh that are raiſed
with ſo much fear from the enterance of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi>
ſwelled into <hi>Po,</hi> when it is high, to which there needeth no other
anſwer; yet nevertheleſſe we do not take that quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is carried by <hi>Reno,</hi> and by <hi>Panaro,</hi> to be ſo great as is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:
For that P. D. <hi>Benedetto Caſtelli</hi> hath no leſſe accutely
than accurately obſerved the meaſures of this kind, noting that
the breadth and depth of a River is not enough to reſolve the
queſtion truly, but that there is reſpect to be had to the velocity
of the Waters, and the term of time, things hitherto not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Skilful in theſe affairs; and therefore they are not
able to ſay what quantity of Waters the ſaid Rivers carry, nor
to conclude of the riſings that will follow thereupon. Nay, it
is moſt certain, that if all the Rivers that fall into <hi>Po,</hi> which are
above thirty, ſhould riſe at the rate that theſe compute <hi>Reno</hi> to
do, an hundred feet of Banks would not ſuffice, and yet they
have far fewer: So that this confirmes the Rule of R. P. D. <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>detto,</hi>
namely, that the proportion of the height of the Water
of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Reno</hi> to the height of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Po,</hi> is
compounded of the proportion of the breadth of the Chanel of
<hi>Po</hi> to that of <hi>Reno,</hi> and of the velocity of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi>
in <hi>Po</hi> to the velccity of the Water of <hi>Reno</hi> in <hi>Reno;</hi> a manifeſt
argument that there cannot in it, by this new augmentation of
Waters follow any alteration that neceſſitates the raiſing of its
Banks, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Panaro,</hi> which hath been
ſo far from ſwelling <hi>Po,</hi> that it hath rather aſſwaged it, for it hath
carried away many Shelfs and many Iſlets that had grown in its
Bed, for want of Waters ſufficient to bear away the matter of
Land-floods in ſo broad a Chanel; and as is learnt by the trial
made by us in <hi>Panaro</hi> with the Water of <hi>Burana;</hi> for erecting
in the River ſtanding marks, and ſhutting the ſaid Sluice, we could
ſee no ſenſible abatement, nor much leſs after we had opened it
ſenſible increaſment; by which we judge that the ſame is to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to <hi>Po,</hi> by letting in of <hi>Reno, Burana</hi> having greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to <hi>Panaro</hi> than <hi>Reno</hi> to <hi>Po,</hi> conſidering the ſtate of thoſe
Rivers in which the Obſervation was made. So that there is no
longer any occaſion for thoſe great raiſings of Banks, and the
danger of the ruptures as well of <hi>Reno</hi> as of <hi>Po</hi> do vaniſh, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the fear leſt that the Sluices which empty into <hi>Po</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
obſtruction: which if they ſhould, yet it would be over in
a few hours. And as to the Breaches of <hi>Panaro</hi> which happened
in 1623. I know not why, ſeeing that it is confeſſed that the <hi>Po</hi>
was not, at that time, at its height, one ſhould rather charge it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60312:62"/>
with the crime, than quit it thereof. The truth is, that the
Bank was not made of proof, ſince that the ſame now continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
whole and good, and <hi>Panaro</hi> doth not break out; nay, there
was, when it brake more than a foot and half of its Banks above
the Water, and to ſpare; but it broke thorow by a Moles wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king;
or by the hole of a Water-Rat, or ſome ſuch vermine;
and by occaſion of the badneſs of the ſaid Banks, as I finde by
the teſtimony of ſome witneſſes examined by my command, that
I might know the truth thereof. Nor can I here forbear to ſay,
that it would be better, if in ſuch matters men were more candid
and ſincere. But to ſecure our ſelves nevertheleſſe, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
of our power, from ſuch like Breaches which may happen
at the firſt, by reaſon of the newneſſe of the Banks, I preſuppoſe
that from <hi>Po</hi> unto the place whence <hi>Reno</hi> is cut, there ought to
be a high and thick Fence made with its Banks, ſo that there
would be no cauſe to fear any whatſoever acceſſions of Water,
although that concurrence of three Rivers, which was by ſome
more ingeniouſly aggravated than faithfully ſtated by that which
was ſaid above were true; to whom I think not my ſelf bound
to make any farther reply, neither to thoſe who ſay that <hi>Po</hi> will
aſcend upwards into <hi>Reno,</hi> ſince that theſe are the ſame perſons
who would introduce a ſmall branch of the ſaid <hi>Po</hi> into the
Chanel of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that ſo it may conveigh to the Sea, not <hi>Reno</hi>
onely, but alſo all the other Brooks of which we complained;
and becauſe that withal it is impoſſible, that a River ſo capacious
as <hi>Po</hi> ſhould be incommoded by a Torrent, that, as I may ſay,
hath no proportion to it.</p>
                     <p>I come now to the buſineſſe of the Ditches and Draines; and
as to the Conveyance of <hi>Burana,</hi> it hath heretofore been deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to turn it into <hi>Main-Po,</hi> ſo that in this caſe it will receive no
harm, and though it were not removed, yet would it by a Trench
under ground purſue the courſe that it now holdeth, and alſo
would be able to diſ-imbogue again into the ſaid new Chanel of
<hi>Reno,</hi> which conforming to the ſuperficies of the Water of <hi>Po,</hi>
would continue at a lower level than that which <hi>Panara</hi> had
when it came to <hi>Ferrara,</hi> into which <hi>Burana</hi> did nevertheleſſe
empty it ſelf for ſome time.</p>
                     <p>The Conveyance or Drain of <hi>Santa Bianca,</hi> and the little
Chanel of <hi>Cento</hi> may alſo empty themſelves by two ſubterranean
Trenches, without any prejudice where they run at preſent, or
without any more works of that nature, they may be turned into
the ſaid new Chanel, although with ſomewhat more of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience;
and withall, the Chanel of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> left dry, would
be a ſufficient receptacle for any other Sewer or Drain whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that ſhould remain there.</p>

All which Operations might be brought to perfection with
150. thouſand Crowns, well and faithfully laid out; which ſumm
the <hi>Bologneſi</hi> will not be unwilling to provide; beſides that thoſe
<hi>Ferrareſi</hi> ought to contribute to it, who ſhall partake of the
benefit.</p>
                     <p>Let me be permitted in this place to propoſe a thing which I
have thought of, and which peradventure might occaſion two
benefits at once, although it be not wholly new. It was in the
time of <hi>Pope Paul</hi> V. propounded by one <hi>Creſcenzio</hi> an Ingi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer,
to cut the <hi>Main-Po,</hi> above <hi>le Papozze;</hi> and having made a
ſufficient evacuation to derive the water thereof into the <hi>Po</hi> of
<hi>Adriano,</hi> and ſo to procure it to be Navigable, which was not at
that time effected, either by reaſon of the oppoſitions of thoſe,
whoſe poſſeſſions were to be cut thorow, or by reaſon of the
great ſum of money that was neceſſary for the effecting of it: But
in viewing thoſe Rivers, we have obſerved, that the ſedge cutting
might eaſily be made below <hi>le Papozze,</hi> in digging thorow the
Bank called <hi>Santa Maria,</hi> &amp; drawing a Trench of the bigneſs that
skilful Artiſts ſhall judge meet unto the <hi>Po</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>Of</hi> Adriano.</note> of <hi>Ariano,</hi> below the
<hi>Secche</hi> of the ſaid S. <hi>Maria;</hi> which as being a work of not
above 160. Perches in length, would be finiſhed with onely
12000. Crowns.</p>
                     <p>Firſt; it is to be believed, that the waters running that way,
would not fail to open that Mouth into the Sea, which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
is almoſt choakt up by the Shelf of Sand, which the new
Mouth of <hi>Ponto Virro</hi> hath brought thither; and that it would
again bring into uſe the Port <hi>Goro,</hi> and its Navigation.</p>
                     <p>And haply experience might teach us, that the ſuperficies of
<hi>Po</hi> might come to fall by this aſſwagement of Water, ſo that the
acceſſion of <hi>Reno</hi> would queſtionleſs make no riſing in it:
Whereupon, if it ſhould ſo fall out, thoſe Princes would have
no reaſon to complain; who ſeem to queſtion, leſt by this new
acceſſion of water into <hi>Po,</hi> the Sluices might be endangered.
Which I thought not fit to omit to repreſent to your Lordſhip;
not, that I propoſe it to you as a thing abſolutely certain, but that
you might, if you ſo pleaſed, lay it before perſons whoſe judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are approved in theſe affairs.</p>
                     <p>I return now from where I degreſt, and affirm it as indubita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that <hi>Reno</hi> neither can, nor ought to continue longer where
it at this day is; and that it cannot go into any other place but
that, whither <hi>Cardinal Capponi</hi> deſigned to carry it, and which
at preſent pleaſeth me better than any other; or into <hi>Volana,</hi>
whence it was taken away; the vigilance of Men being able to
obviate part of thoſe miſchiefs, which it may do there.</p>
                     <p>But from its Removal, beſides the alleviation of the harm
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60312:63"/>
which by it ſelf is cauſed, there would alſo reſult the diminution
of that which is occaſioned by the other Brooks, to the right hand
of the <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta;</hi> foraſmuch as the ſaid <hi>Po</hi> wanting all the
water of <hi>Reno,</hi> it would of neceſſity come to ebb in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that the Valleys would have a greater Fall into the ſame,
and conſequently it would take in, and ſwallow greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of water; and by this means the Ditches and Draines
of the Up-Lands would likewiſe more eaſily Fall into them; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
if the ſcouring of <hi>Zenzalino</hi> were brought to perfection,
by which the waters of <hi>Marrara</hi> would fall into <hi>Marmorta:</hi> And
if alſo that of <hi>Baſtia</hi> were enlarged, and finiſhed, by which there
might enter as much water into the ſaid <hi>Po</hi> of <hi>Argenta,</hi> as is taken
from it by the removal of <hi>Reno;</hi> although that by that meanes
the water of the Valleys would aſſwage double: Nor would the
people of <hi>Argenta,</hi> the Iſles of S. <hi>Giorgio,</hi> and <hi>Comacchio</hi> have any
cauſe to complain; for that there would not be given to them
more water than was taken away: Nay ſometimes whereas they
had Muddy waters, they would have clear; nor need they to fear
any riſing: And furthermore, by this means a very great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of ground would be reſtored to culture; For the effecting of
all which, the ſumm of 50. thouſand Crowns would go very far,
and would ſerve the turn at preſent touching thoſe Brooks, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
them a little farther in the mean time, to fill up the greater
cavities of the Valleys, that we might not enter upon a vaſter
and harder work, that would bring with it the difficulties of other
operations, and ſo would hinder the benefit which theſe people
expect from the paternal charity of His Holineſs.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y Treatiſe of the MENSURATION of RUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING
WATERS, Right Honourable, and
moſt Noble Sir, hath not a greater Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
than its having been the production of the

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> VIII. when His Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs

applying my whole Study to my ſervice and duty, I publiſhed in

moſt important, and of extraordinary conſequence. Yet
I muſt render thanks to Your Lordſhip for the honour you have
done to that my Tract; but wiſh withal, that your Eſteem of it
may not prejudice the univerſal Eſteem that the World hath of
Your Honours moſt refined judgement.</p>
            <p>As to that Point which I touch upon in the Concluſion, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
That the conſideration of the Velocity of Running Water ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth
the conſideration of the<note n="*" place="margin">Larghezza, but miſprinted.</note> Length omitted in the common
way of meaſuring Running Waters; Your Lordſhip having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me that in favour of <hi>Practiſe,</hi> and for the perfect diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of the diſorder that commonly happeneth now adayes in
the diſtribution of the Waters of Fountains, I ſhould demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that the knowledge of the Velocity ſerveth for the finding
of the Length: I have thought fit to ſatisfie your Command by
relating a Fable; which, if I do not deceive my ſelf, will make
out to us the truth thereof; inſomuch that the reſt of my Treatiſe
ſhall thereby alſo become more manifeſt and intelligible, even to
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:60312:64"/>
thoſe who finde therein ſome kinde of obſcurity.</p>
            <p>In the dayes of yore, before that the admirable Art of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
was in uſe, there was found in <hi>Perſia</hi> a vaſt and unvaluable
Treaſure, which conſiſted in an huge multitude of pieces of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſin,
or Damask, I know not whether; which, as I take it,
amounted to near two thouſand pieces; which were of ſuch a
nature, that though their Breadth and Thickneſs were finite and
determinate, as they uſe to be at this day; yet nevertheleſs, their
Length was in a certain ſenſe infinite, for that thoſe two thouſand
pieces, day and night without ceaſing, iſſued out with their ends
at ſuch a rate, that of each piece there iſſued 100. Ells a day, from
a deep and dark Cave, conſecrated by the Superſtition of thoſe
people, to the fabulous <hi>Arachne.</hi> In thoſe innocent and early
times (I take it to have been, in that ſo much applauded and
deſired Golden age) it was left to the liberty of any one, to cut
off of thoſe pieces what quantity they pleaſed without any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty:
But that felicity decaying and degenerating, which was
altogether ignorant of <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum;</hi> terms certainly moſt
pernicious, the Original of all evils, and cauſe of all diſcords;
there were by thoſe people ſtrong and vigilant Guards placed
upon the Cave, who reſolved to make merchandize of the Stuffes;
and in this manner they began to ſet a price upon that ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treaſure, ſelling the propriety in thoſe pieces to divers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
to ſome they ſold a right in one, to ſome in two, and to
ſome in more. But that which was the worſt of all, There was
found out by the inſatiable avarice of theſe men crafty inventions
to deceive the Merchants alſo; who came to buy the aforeſaid
commodity, and to make themſelves Maſters, ſome of one
ſome of two, and ſome of more ends of thoſe pieces of ſtuff;
and in particular, there were cetain ingenuous Machines placed
in the more ſecret places of the Cave, with which at the pleaſure
of the Guards, they did retard the velocity of thoſe Stuffs, in
their iſſuing out of the Cave; inſomuch, that he who ought to have
had 100. Ells of Stuff in a day, had not above 50, and he who
ſhould have had 400, enjoyed the benefit of 50. onely; and ſo all
the reſt were defrauded of their Rights, the ſurpluſage being ſold,
appropriated, and ſhared at the will of the corrupt Officers: So
that the buſineſs was without all order or juſtice, inſomuch that
the Goddeſs <hi>Arachne</hi> being diſpleaſed at thoſe people, deprived
every one of their benefit, and with a dreadful Earthquake for
ever cloſing the mouth of the Cave, in puniſhment of ſo much
impiety and malice: Nor did it avail them to excuſe themſelves,
by ſaying that they allowed the Buyer the Breadth and Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
bargained for; and that of the Length, which was infinite,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60312:64"/>
there could no account be kept: For the wiſe and prudent
Prieſt of the Sacred <hi>Grotto</hi> anſwered, That the deceit lay in the
length, which they were defrauded of, in that the velocity of the
ſtuffe was retarded, as it iſſued out of the Cave: and although
the total length of the Piece was infinite, for that it never cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
coming forth, and ſo was not to be computed; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
its length conſidered, part by part, as it came out of the
Cave, and was bargained for, continued ſtill finite, and might
be one while greater, and another while leſſer, according as the
Piece was conſtituted in greater or leſſer velocity; and he added
withall, that exact Juſtice required, that when they ſold a piece
of ſtuff, and the propriety or dominion therein, they ought not
only to have aſcertained the breadth and thickneſſe of the Piece,
but alſo to have determined the length, determining its ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity.</p>
            <p>The ſame diſorder and confuſion, that was repreſented in the
Fable, doth come to paſſe in the Hiſtory of the Diſtribution of
the Waters of Conduits and Fountains, ſeeing that they are ſold
and bought, having regard only to the two Dimenſions, I mean
of Breadth and Height of the Mouth that diſchargeth the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and to remedy ſuch an inconvenience, it is neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the length in the velocity; for never ſhall we be able to
make a gueſſe at the quantity of the Body of Running VVater,
with the two Dimenſions only of Breadth and Height, without
Length.</p>
            <p>And to the end, that the whole buſineſs may be reduced
to a moſt eaſie practice, by which the waters of Aqueducts
may be bought and ſold juſtly, and with meaſures alwayes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
and conſtant.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the quantity of the Water ought diligently to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
which the whole principal * Pipe diſchargeth in a time
certain, as for inſtance, in an hour, in half an hour, or in a leſſe
interval of time, (for knowing which I have a moſt exact and
eaſie Rule) and finding that the whole principal pipe diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<hi>v. g.</hi> a thouſand Tuns of Water in the ſpace of one or
more hours, in ſelling of this water, it ought not to be uttered by
the ordinary and falſe meaſure, but the diſtribution is to be
made with agreement to give and maintain to the buyer ten or
twenty, or a greater number of Tuns, as the bargain ſhall be
made, in the ſpace of an hour, or of ſome other ſet and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
time. And here I adde, that if I were to undertake to
make ſuch an adjuſtment, I would make uſe of a way to divide
and meaſure the time with ſuch accurateneſſe, that the ſpace of
an hour ſhould be divided into four, ſix, or eight thouſand parts
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60312:65"/>
without the leaſt errour; which Rule was taught me by my
Maſter <hi>Sign. Galilaeo Galilaei,</hi> Chief Philoſopher to the moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
<hi>Grand Duke</hi> of <hi>Tuſcany.</hi> And this way will ſerve eaſily and
admirably to our purpoſe and occaſion; ſo that we ſhall
thereby be able to know how many Quarts of Water an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queduct
will diſcharge in a given time of hours, moneths, or
years. And in this manner we may conſtitute a Cock that ſhall
diſcharge a certain and determinate quantity of water in a time
given.</p>
            <p>And becauſe daily experience ſhews us, that the Springs of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queducts
do not maintain them alwayes equally high, and full
of Water, but that ſometimes they increaſe, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
which accident might poſſibly procure ſome difficulty in
our diſtribution: Therefore, to the end that all manner of ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
may be removed, I conceive that it would be convenient to
provide a Ciſtern, according to the occaſion, into which there
might alwayes fall one certain quantity of water, which ſhould
not be greater than that which the principal pipe diſchargeth in
times of drought, when the Springs are bare of water, that ſo in
this Ciſtern the water might alwayes keep at one conſtant height.
Then to the Ciſtern ſo prepared we are to faſten the Cocks of
particular perſons to whom the Water is ſold by the Reverend
Apoſtolique Chamber, according to what hath been obſerved
before; and that quantity of Water which remaineth over and
above, is to be diſcharged into another Ciſtern, in which the
Cocks of the Waters for publick ſervices, and of thoſe which
people buy upon particular occaſions are to be placed. And
when the buſineſſe ſhall have been brought to this paſſe, there
will likewiſe a remedy be found to the ſo many diſorders that
continually happen; of which, for brevity ſake, I will inſtance
in but four only, which concern both publique and private bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
as being, in my judgment, the moſt enormous and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>The firſt inconvenience it, that in the common way of meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
diſpenſing, and ſelling the Waters of Aqueducts, it is not
underſtood, neither by the Buyer nor Seller, what the quantity
truly is that is bought and ſold; nor could I ever meet with any
either Engineer or Architect, or Artiſt, or other that was able to
decypher to me, what one, or two, or ten inches of water was.
But by our above declared Rule, for diſpenſing the Waters of
Aqueducts we may very eaſily know the true quantity of Water
that is bought or ſold, as that it is ſo many Tuns an hour, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a day, ſo many in a year, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The ſecond diſorder that happeneth, at preſent, in the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60312:65"/>
of Aqueducts is, that as the buſineſſe is now governed, it
lieth in the power of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ordid Maſon to take unjuſtly from one,
and give undeſervedly to another more or leſſe Water than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to them of right: And I have ſeen it done, of my
own experience. But in our way of meaſuring and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting
Waters, there can no fraud be committed; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the caſe that they ſhould be committed, its an eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to know it, and amend it, by repairing to the Tribunal
appointed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it happens very often, (and we have examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
both antient and modern) that in diſpenſing the Water after
the common and vulgar way; there is ſometimes more Water diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
than there is in the Regiſter, in which there will be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred,
as they ſay, two hundred inches (for example) and there
will be diſpenſed two hundred and fifty inches, or more. Which
paſſage happened in the time of <hi>Nerva</hi> the Emperour, as <hi>Giulio
Frontino</hi> writes, in his 2. Book, <hi>De Aquaductibus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis Romae,</hi>
where he obſerveth that they had <hi>in Commentariis</hi> 12755. <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi>
of Water; and found that they diſpenſed 14018. <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries.</hi>
And the like Errour hath continued, and is in uſe alſo
modernly until our times. But if our Rule ſhall be obſerved,
we ſhall incur no ſuch diſorder, nay there will alwayes be given
to every one his ſhare, according to the holy end of exact juſtice,
