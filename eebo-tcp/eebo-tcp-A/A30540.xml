         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What mean you thus to deal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord, in dishonouring his Name in the sight of the enemy, even to the wounding of your own souls, and to the piercing the heart of the faithful, who hath watched over you, and been Messengers of glad tidings unto you from the Lord; every one of you in particular be awakened and stirred up, and fear before the Lord, and come to the light which the Son of God hath lighted you with all, and search your own hearts, and try your selves, that the ground of these things may be seen, and condemned, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and love may yet spring amongst you to the Lord, and one to another: Oh friends consider, it was one Father that begate you into the Truth, which is but one, by one word of Life, which is not divided; and you were begotten to live unto him, and not unto your selves; and Christ Jesus which is but one, the same to day, yesterday, and for ever; who is the foundation of God, and abides for ever, was preached unto you all, to be the Way, the Truth, the Life and Salvation, and there is none besides him; Why then are these divisions among you, and some for one, and some for another, and herein are you carnal, and your minds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and not stayed upon him that gives the encrease, and all this is to be judged with the life of God: Wherefore I beseech you in the fear of the Lord, as you love him and his glory, yea as you love your own souls, come to the light which lets you see all this, and condemne it, and strive not one with another, nor exalt not your selves above another; but let all this be condemned, and all your evil surmisings, and foolish jealousies, and secret whisperings, and back-bitings, be brought to judgement, and let con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation passe upon it all, never more to appear, to hinder the fellowship of the Lord, and know the life of God in you all, which is but one, which is not at strife, nor divided; and let that arise, that all vails may be taken off, and hardnesse of heart judged, and the countenance of the Lord may shine upon you; when that exalted spirit which hath appeared in some, is brought down; of which I charge you all to be aware; lest there be a total departing from the Lord, and his Name be reproached through you among the Heathen, and it had been better for such that they had never been born. Therefore I say unto all, lay it to heart<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till the judgements of the Lord take it away, and purifie your hearts from all these things, which ariseth out of that which is not of the Father; that my joy may be renewed, who have been in travel for you, till Christ be formed; that he alone may rule in you, over all these things which is at enmity against your life, and hinders your growth; and if you yet harden your hearts against reproof, who are stubborn: Well the Lord will ease himself of his Adversaries, and break you as a Potters Vessel, and though you oppresse the life of God for a moment, yet my peace with him shall these things never take away; but over all these things I tread, and am not offended in him, who is my peace for evermore; and though these things cause sadnesse of heart, yet the Lord gives no cause of sorrow to them that are faithful to him; but will arise to confound all deceit, and deceitful workers, who erreth from his way, and counteth the knowledge of his way as a burden; and of you all, though you perish, I am clear, who is not hated of the Lord, though falsly judged by his enemies, over whom I trample as the dust, and the living God gives victory over them all.</p>
