            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE
RIGHT HONOVRABLE
House of LORDS Assembled in
PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F all <hi>Noble-men</hi> were as good and
religious as they are presented to the
World in the <hi>Epistles</hi> prefixed to the
Books that are dedicated to them, we
should not have so much cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of great mens Iniquities, or of
poore mens flatteries. <hi>S. Augustine</hi> in his Booke of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractations,
Retracts it as a great fault, that when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
a Booke to <hi>Mallius Theodorus,</hi> he praised him
more then he deserved, though he confesseth that he was
<hi>doctus vir &amp; Christianus,</hi> a Learned and Christian man:
It is none of the least miseries of great men, that they
<pb facs="tcp:54330:3"/>
want faithfull friends to tell them their vices as well as
their vertues. King <hi>Ahab</hi> had 400. flattering Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
who were the cause of his ruine. Hence is that
old Proverbe, that there are onely two things that never
flatter great men, <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Horses.</hi> For <hi>Death</hi> sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth
upon great as well as small. And a <hi>Horse</hi> will cast
downe a great man as well as any other, if he rides not
well. This Sermon speakes <hi>plaine language,</hi> and this
is the only Reason (for ought I know) that it received
such <hi>kind acceptance,</hi> for otherwise it wants that
neatnesse of phrase, and eloquence of speech which such
<hi>Noble Auditors</hi> are accustomed unto, I have often
heard of <hi>Great men,</hi> that complained upon their <hi>Death
beds,</hi> that none would tell them of their faults, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of any that complained hee was told too much. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius</hi>
the <hi>great Emperour</hi> confesseth of S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi>
notwithstanding his severe carriage towards him,<note place="margin">Theod.</note> 
               <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
novi Ambrosium dignum Episcopi nomine;</hi>
That he knew none worthy of a Bishoprick but <hi>Ambrose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a custome to send Sermons out unto publike view
under the <hi>Patronage</hi> of some <hi>Noble-man</hi> or other.
This Sermon hath this <hi>preheminence,</hi> That it comes
forth under the <hi>Patronage,</hi> and by the commands not
only of one <hi>Lord,</hi> but of a <hi>House of Lords.</hi> The Lord
make it to obtaine that end for which it was preached!
That you (my Lords) may make <hi>Joshua's choise
<pb facs="tcp:54330:3"/>
your choise.</hi> The subject matter of the Sermon is
very common and ordinary. But herein I follow the
example of <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> who when he was made
Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> the first Sermon that
he preached before the Emperour <hi>Arcadius</hi> and the
great Courtiers, was a Sermon of <hi>Repentance.</hi> This
is the message that I have received (saith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>)
from my Master Christ to deliver unto you.
<hi>Repent for the Kingdome of God is at hand. 
Haec autem non dubitabo vobis assiduè revocare
in memoriam. Haec neminem reverentes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
potentes aut divites timentes ad vos loquemur.</hi>
The Lord bestow this great grace of <hi>Repentance</hi> upon
you, and inable you to serve God with all the <hi>ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients</hi>
mentioned in the following Sermon! Two things
I would desire your Lordships alwayes to remember.</p>
            <p>1. That the best way of thankfulnesse for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
received, is to serve the God of those mercies,
and to serve him with the mercies we receive from
him.</p>
            <p>2. That the best way for the House of Lords to
prosper, is to indeavour earnestly and faithfully to
reforme the Lords House, your own houses, and first
your selves.</p>
            <p>Some things I have added which were not preached,
which relate to all men in generall as well as great men,
<pb facs="tcp:54330:4"/>
which I then omitted for brevity sake, but have here
interserted I hope without offence, that so this Sermon
which is printed for a generall good, might have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things
in it tending to the good of all men as well as great
men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Great God <hi>make the</hi> House of Lords <hi>as the</hi>
House of the Lord <hi>wherein service may be done</hi> to
God, and for Gods cause. So prayeth</p>

THANKS-GIVING
SERMON PREACHED
Before the Right Honourable
the House of Lords.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Iosh. 24. 15.</bibl>
               <q>But as for me and my house we will serve the Lord.</q>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are here met this day to keepe a <hi>day of
Thanks-giving,</hi> to keepe a Heaven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth, to doe that for a day, which
is the worke of Angels and arch-An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
to all eternity. We have had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes of <hi>Hosannah's</hi> and now we are
to keepe one day of <hi>Hallelujah's.</hi> It hath
pleased God of his great goodnesse to discover a <hi>dangerous</hi>
and <hi>desperate Plot,</hi> tending to the utter subversion of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
of the famous City of <hi>London,</hi> of the Army, of
the whole Kingdome, and which is above all to the utter
ruine of the true reformed Protestant Religion. We are
here assembled to give God the praise of this Deliverance.
Now that this duty may be performed after a pious and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54330:5"/>
Christian manner to the praise of that God whom we come
to praise, I have chosen this Text. For I am clearely of
this opinion, that as there is no duty more excellent then
this of Thanks-giving.</p>
            <p>For it is the <hi>duty of Heaven,</hi> and not only so, but the
<hi>preferment of Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 50. 23.</note> It is a duty that honoureth God,
and it is the highest honour that God can put upon us, to
give us leave to performe this duty. It is a duty that <hi>Adam</hi>
should have performed, though he had never fallen. It is a
duty that shall last for ever and ever. It is a comely duty. It
is a pleasant duty.<note place="margin">Ps. 33. 1.</note> It is the highest expression of our love to
God:<note place="margin">Ps. 147. 1.</note> It is the surest evidence of our election <hi>(For that
man that loves the worke of Heaven upon earth, shall certainely
goe to Heaven when he leaves the earth.</hi> Now the worke of
Heaven is to praise God.) It is the only rent penny which
God requires for all the blessings hee bestowes upon
us.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithstanding all this, I conceive there is no
one duty wherein God is more dishonoured, or his name
more prophaned then in this duty. The world is full of
<hi>Thanking of God, blessed be God, praised be God.</hi> But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
yetell me. Are we not formall in this duty? Doe
we not content our selves with the bare Carkasse, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
of praises? Doe we not take Gods name in vaine,
while we are blessing his name? Doe we not content our
selves with a <hi>drop</hi> of praises for a <hi>sea</hi> of mercies? Do we not
praise him with our lips, while we dispraise him with our
lives? Are we not like unto Actors upon a stage that now
play one part, and by and by act a quite contrary part?
While we are at Church we seeme to cry <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> and
with the Jewes to sing <hi>Hosannah.</hi> But assoone as ever we
come out of the Church, are there not many that will
with the Jews cry <hi>Crucifige,</hi> acting the quite contrary part,
and curse, and sweare prophanely by that God whom they
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54330:5"/>
blessed at Church? The devill was the first that ever na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Gods name in Scripture, and one of the first that ever
confessed Christ to be the Sonne of God, and yet he was
a devill for all that. It is a <hi>devillish</hi> thing to <hi>praise God with
our lips,</hi> and <hi>serve the devill with our lives.</hi> Now therfore
for the avoiding of this great sin, and for the raising up of
your hearts to praise God, not only with your <hi>lips,</hi> but
with your <hi>lives,</hi> I have pitched upon these words, which
I may very well call, <hi>A rare plat-forme,</hi> and <hi>excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of true and reall thankfullnes.</hi> For this is to thanke God as
we ought to do for his goodnes, to become good our selves.
Then wee praise God aright, when wee dedicate our lives
to his praise, and become a people of his praise. <hi>Iosiah</hi> did
not only offer a thank-offering, <hi>but he commanded</hi> Judah
<hi>to serve the Lord God of</hi> Israel. It is not enough to thanke
God for a <hi>mercy,</hi> unlesse we <hi>serve</hi> him with that <hi>mercy.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 33. 16.</note> It
is not the singing of a <hi>thousand Psalmes</hi> will praise God so
much for this <hi>Deliverance</hi> as the <hi>mortifying of one lust.</hi> Let
the drunkard praise God this day by sacrificing up his drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse
as a Thank-offering. Let the swearer and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
forsake his swearing and his Adultery, as a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of his Thankfullnesse. God hath bin reall in his
mercies to us, let us be reall in our thankes to him. Let us
with this famous and noble <hi>Prince</hi> in my Text enter into a
solemne Covenant, and resolution for the time to
come, in sence of Gods goodnesse towards us for the
time past, to become the true and faithfull servants of
God, and though all the world should serve sinne and
the Devill, <hi>but as for you and your house, you will serve the
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words themselves we have two parts.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>The substance of</hi> Joshuah's choice; and that is, <hi>To
serve Iehovah. Ioshuah</hi> doth not only choose to be <hi>saved by</hi>
Jehovah, but to <hi>serve</hi> Jehovah. There is no man so wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54330:6"/>
but he would be glad to be saved by God, but you
must know that that man shall never have Christ for his
<hi>Saviour,</hi> that will not have Christ for his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master.</hi>
He that will not follow the <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Christs life,</hi> shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be saved by the <hi>merit of his death.</hi> If Christ be not <hi>thy</hi>
Jacobs <hi>staffe to guide thee to Heaven,</hi> he will never become
as a <hi>Iacobs ladder</hi> to carry thee up to Heaven.</p>
            <p>2. We have six rare circumstances in <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> choice.</p>
            <p>First, The person that made this choice, and that is <hi>Ioshua</hi>
the chief Ruler of <hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The latitude and circumference of this choice, <hi>I and
my house,</hi> not <hi>himselfe</hi> without his <hi>Family,</hi> nor his Family
without himselfe. But himselfe and his Family. And first
himselfe, and then his Family.</p>
            <p>3. The firmnesse and stability of <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> choice, Wee
<hi>will</hi> serve the Lord. Not only <hi>we desire</hi> to doe it. But we are
<hi>fully resolved</hi> to do it.</p>
            <p>4. The publicknesse of <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> resolution. <hi>Ioshuah</hi>
doth not only choose in his heart to serve the Lord, but
makes open protestation and profession of it, before all the
<hi>Lords and Commons</hi> of <hi>Israel.</hi> For these words were spoken
in a <hi>Parliamentary Assembly,</hi> when all the Tribes and Heads
of the Tribes of Israel and Judges and Officers were present,
as you may reade <hi>v.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>5. The <hi>speedinesse</hi> of <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> choice. <hi>Ioshua</hi> puts the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
to choose. <hi>Choose you this day whom ye will serve.</hi> But
as for himselfe he was already resolved. <hi>Ioshuah</hi> had not
his Religion to choose as many have, he did not demurre
upon it, his choice was already made: <hi>Choose you; but as for
me and my house we will serve the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. The <hi>singularity</hi> of <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> choice. This <hi>[But]</hi> is put
downe by way of opposition, Choose you whither ye will
serve the true God, or the gods of the <hi>Amorites. But</hi> as for
me I am resolved for my selfe and my Family to serve the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54330:6"/>
Lord, though all the Lords and Commons of Israel should
renounce his service.</p>
            <p>The time will not suffer me to speake distinctly of every
one of these parts. I will therefore summe them up for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
sake into this one doctrinall Conclusion.</p>
            <p>That it is the duty of all men, but especially of such as are
<hi>Joshuah's,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Doctr.</note> such as are Rulers and Nobles, to ingage themselves
and their Families to serve God resolutely, speedily and publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
maugre all opposition to the coutrary.</p>
            <p>This is a Doctrine that needs <hi>Application</hi> rather then <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
A Doctrine that I have chosen, not to <hi>feed your
heads with curious notions,</hi> but to <hi>feast your hearts with solid
nourishment.</hi> For the Explicatory part, I will only propound
3 things.</p>
            <p>First, I will shew what it is to serve God.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, I will shew the necessity that lies upon <hi>all men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
as well as great men</hi> to serve God, and to serve him with the
golden circumstances of the Text.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I will shew the necessity that lyes upon <hi>great <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
men,</hi> as well as others, and rather then others to obey this
Text.</p>
            <p>First, What it is to serve God.<note place="margin">The first part of the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note>
            </p>
            <p>For this you must know that the service of God is not a
naturall action, wherein the doing of the worke is all that
is required. As nothing is required of the fire, but to burn,
because it is a naturall action. But it is an action of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
wherein the manner of doing is the chiefe halfe of the
duty, and that which makes our serving of God to be a
sweet perfume is not the <hi>serving,</hi> but the <hi>right serving</hi> of
God. Now the right serving of God is to serve him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his <hi>owne Direction,</hi> both for the <hi>matter</hi> and the
<hi>manner</hi> of his service. It is a maxime in nature, Every ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
is to be served according as himselfe commands, and
if the servant prescribe to his master, how he will serve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54330:7"/>
him, he becomes his <hi>Masters Master.</hi> In the civill Law a
servant is said to be <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, such a one that sustaines no
person, but is a dependant and adjunct to his Master, to
accommodate his will to the will of his Master. It is a
saying of <hi>Socrates,</hi> If there be a God he must be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and if he be worshipped, he must be worshipped ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his owne will, or else we doe not worship him
at all. <hi>Moses</hi> built the Tabernacle according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne
in the Mount.<note place="margin">1 Chro. 28 12, 19.</note> And <hi>David</hi> when he built the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
received a patterne of it from the Spirit of God in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
The nature of man is prone to worship God by
Crucifixes and Images, and by wayes of our owne devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
But this is not to serve God, but to goe a <hi>whoring
after our owne inventions,</hi> as the phrase is, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 106. 37.<note place="margin">Mat. 15 9.</note>
For indeed it is <hi>spirituall whoredome,</hi> and it is an exalting of
our wisedome above Gods. It is <hi>vaine-service,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot please God.<note place="margin">Col. 2 23.</note> It is <hi>will-worship</hi> and of no <hi>account
with God.</hi> It is a service that is so farre from bringing us to
Heaven, that it will <hi>beguile us of Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 2. 18.</note> This then is to
serve God, to serve him according to his own way, both for
matter and manner.</p>
            <p>Now if you aske me;<note place="margin">Quest.</note> What is that way wherein God
would have us to serve him. I answer briefly.</p>
            <p>He that would serve God so as to please him must min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
10.<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> Ingredients in his service. And indeed this very act
of <hi>Ioshuah</hi> in choosing such a master as <hi>Iehovah,</hi> and in
choosing to stand under such a relation as a servant unto <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah</hi>
doth necessarily imply.</p>
            <p>First, That <hi>Ioshuah</hi> did not onely choose to serve God,
but to serve him <hi>undividedly,</hi> to serve God and none but
God. For in all Elections those whom we do not choose
we refuse. And therefore <hi>Ioshua's</hi> choosing to serve the
Lord doth imply, that he did refuse all other Lords and
masters. This is plaine in the beginning of this verse. <hi>And
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54330:7"/>
if it seeme evill to you to serve the Lord, choose ye this day whom
ye will serve, whether the gods,</hi> &amp;c. As if he should have
said. Ye cannot serve the God of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and the
god of the <hi>Amorites</hi> together. Ye cannot serve God and
Idols. <hi>No man saith Christ can serve two Masters,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Ioshua</hi> did not only choose to serve God undividedly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
but also <hi>Everlustingly.</hi> This appeares because he chose an
<hi>everlasting Master.</hi> And for this purpose he tells the <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
verses 19. 20. <hi>You cannot serve the Lord for he is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
God and a jealous God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If ye forsake him he will consume
you,</hi> &amp;c. As if he should have said, If you intend to serve
God, you must never reuolt, but keep your selves constant
for ever to his service, for else he will <hi>turne and doe you hurt
and consume you after he hath done you good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Ioshua</hi> did not only choose to serve God undividedly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
and Everlastingly, but also <hi>Faithfully and sincerely.</hi> And
this appeares, because he chose such a Master, that is <hi>the
heart maker</hi> and <hi>the heart searcher.</hi> This is the difference
betweene the <hi>serving of God,</hi> and the <hi>serving of man;</hi> Man
can but see the outside, and punish the outside, and judgeth
of the inside by the outside. But God is a Spirit, and will
be worshipped in spirit and in truth, and judgeth of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
by the inside.<note place="margin">Ier. 17. 10.</note> And therefore <hi>Ioshua</hi> tells the children
of <hi>Israel,</hi> vers. 14. <hi>Now therefore feare the Lord, and serve
him in sincerity and in truth.</hi> As if he should have said, If
you intend to serve him, you must serve him in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or else ye doe not serve him at all. For God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
good <hi>aimes</hi> as well as good actions, and he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres
that service though never so good, if the aime of
him that serves him be not good. If a Wife should dresse
her selfe in fine apparell to please an Adulterer, this aime of
hers makes her action most abominable; Even so all those
that serve God, though never so exactly in outward shew
if their aime be to please men, or to get their own ends, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54330:8"/>
Lord abhorres them and their services.<note place="margin">Mat. 14. 51.</note> God abhorres an
hypocrite more then a <hi>Sodomite,</hi> and therefore Hell is provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on purpose for hypocrites.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. <hi>Ioshua</hi> chose to serve God <hi>zealously;</hi> And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
because he chose to serve the <hi>living God,</hi> he did not
choose to serve Idols, but <hi>to turne from dead Idols to serve
the living God.</hi> Now the living God expects not only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
but <hi>lively</hi> service, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. A man may be a living
man and yet not lively, but God expects <hi>lively service,</hi> and
such as are active and lively in his service, such as are <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
in spirit as serving the Lord,</hi> Rom. 12. 11. As if he
should say; You are not fit to serve the Lord, unlesse
you be fervent in spirit, <hi>boiling hot in spirit,</hi> as the word
signifies.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. <hi>Ioshua</hi> chose to serve God <hi>Reverently</hi> and <hi>respectfully.</hi>
And this appeares, because he calls himselfe <hi>a servant of
God,</hi> not a <hi>sonne,</hi> not a <hi>friend.</hi> Now you know it is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
ingredient in a servant to keep his distance, and to carry
himselfe respectfull of his Master, to serve him with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and godly feare, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. <hi>Ioshua</hi> chose to serve God <hi>Chearfully</hi> and <hi>freely;</hi> For
this is another property of a good servant, <hi>Psalm. 100. 1.
Serve the Lord with gladnesse,</hi> Deut. 28. 47, 48. We must
make it our meate and drinke, our Heaven upon Earth to
serve God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, To serve him <hi>diligently and laboriously:</hi> This
is another property of a good servant; It is said of the 12.
Tribes, <hi>That they served God instantly day and night.</hi> The
word in the Greeke is,<note place="margin">Act 16 7.</note> They served God with an outstret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
neck.<note place="margin">Deut. 29. 1</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, To serve God <hi>Vniversally in all things, At all
times, and in all places, and with all our faculties.</hi> First, <hi>In
all things,</hi> though never so <hi>irrationall</hi> to flesh and blood,
though never so <hi>dangerous,</hi> though never so <hi>costly.</hi> Such
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54330:8"/>
a servant was <hi>David</hi> that fulfilled all the wills of God.<note place="margin">Act. 13. 22. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
2. As in all things, so <hi>at all times;</hi> In time of prosperity as
well as adversitie, and in time of adversitie as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity.
For the God whom we serve is <hi>the same in all
times,</hi> he alters not, no more must his servants. 3. In all
places, in private as well as publike; For God is a Master
that filles all places. If thou canst find out a place where
God doth not see thee, there it shall be lawfull for thee
to serve the Devill. 4. <hi>With all the faculties</hi> of thy
soule and body. This note of universality though it
be a plaine one, yet is of marvellous consequence, and
it is both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. It is the best <hi>divisive
difference</hi> to divide a Sheepe from a Goate, And <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutive,</hi>
to constitute a faithfull servant of God,
who is one that <hi>in all things, at all times, and in all places,
with all his faculties</hi> gives up himselfe to Gods service.
That can say as that Dutch Minister <hi>Baldazzar</hi> did to
<hi>Oecolampadius, Veniat verbum Domini &amp; submittemus ei sex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa
si nobis essent colla.</hi> Let God speake, and though we
had six hundred necks, yet we will make them all stoope to
the obedience of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ioshua</hi> chose to serve God <hi>Absolutely and Inconditionally.</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/>
For God is a Master that cannot erre in his commands,
and therefore he must be obeyed without examining of
what he commands, with blind obedience. <hi>Sufficit pro
universis rationibus Deus vult.</hi> This is reason sufficient, the
unerring God will have it so. This is the best sighted obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
Man may erre in his commands, and therefore is
to be served with limitations and examinations. <hi>They doe
befoole themselves</hi> (saith <hi>Lactantius) that follow the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their leaders without judgement, which is the propertie
of Sheepe rather then of reasonable men.</hi> It is a good saying
of Sir THOMAS MORE, <hi>I will not pin my salvation upon
any mans sleeve, because I know not whither he will carry it.</hi> But
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54330:9"/>
God must be obeyed without an If: with absolute, in condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall,
unexamined subjection, this is to serve God as God.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Ioshua</hi> chose to serve God transcendently and Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.
To doe his will on earth as it is done in Heaven. For he
is <hi>Iehovah</hi> that gives being to all, the great God of the whol
earth, and therefore is to be served with super superlative
super transcendent service, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>These are the 10. Ingredients of <hi>Ioshuas</hi> choice, these are as
a <hi>ten stringed Instrument</hi> to make our services melodious
harmony in Gods eares. Let us strive to remember them,
because they are the foundation to the building that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.
We live in an age wherein every man will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
that he serves God. But I beseech you remember
that unlesse you adde these 10. <hi>Ingredients,</hi> ye doe not
serve him, but grieve him. Ye dee not serve him, but doe
him <hi>disservice,</hi> unlesse ye serve him undividedly, everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingly,
sincerely, zealously, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I leave this point I must adde one thing, That
there are 2. properties of a servant that must not be in
Gods servant. First, a servant serves his Master with a sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish
feare, but we must serve God with a godly feare,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. Secondly, a servant loves his Master with a
mercenary love, he serves his Master as a hireling for his
wages. But Gods servant must serve God with a filiall
love. He that serves God only for Heaven, <hi>fells his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to God,</hi> as <hi>Parisiensis</hi> saith, <hi>Et est inter illum &amp; Deum ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiatio
quaedam.</hi> Not but that a true servant of God may
have an <hi>eye</hi> to the <hi>recompence of reward,</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> had; but
he must have but one eye upon the reward, not both, and
the left eye too; For our chiefe and last aime must be at
Gods glory. And the reason is, because Gods servants
are also his <hi>sonnes</hi> and heires, and therefore as we must
serve him with the subjection of servants, so we must
serve him with the affection of sonnes. Let us remember
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54330:9"/>
that we are his servants, that we may serve him with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
diligence and exact subjection, but remember also
that we are his sonnes to serve him with filial feare, love,
hope and faith. And this is the right serving of God, to
serve him with a servant-like subjection, and with a sonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affection.</p>
            <p>The second thing propounded in the Explication,<note place="margin">The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</note> is to
shew the <hi>necessity that lies upon all men as well as great men to
serve God,</hi> and to serve him with all these Ingredients. For
though <hi>Ioshua</hi> did freely choose to serve the Lord, yet it
was not free for <hi>Ioshua</hi> to choose whether he would serve
God or no. For we are all bound to doe God homage
and service. This is <hi>primum</hi> and <hi>totum officium hominis,</hi>
This is the chiefe and the <hi>whole of man,</hi> Eccles. 12. last. We
are all bound to this service by a 6. fold bond.</p>
            <p>First, by the <hi>bond of Creation.</hi> It is a fundamentall er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to think that we are borne chiefely and ultimately to
seeke our own happinesse. God made man to serve him,
and to seeke his owne happinesse in Gods happinesse, and
his owne glory in Gods glory. It is God that hath made
us, and not we our selves, we are his <hi>workemanship,</hi> and
therefore it is our duty to improve all our parts and gifts
to the service of that God from whom we have received
all. As all Rivers returne to the Ocean from which they
first came. And as <hi>Aulius Fulvius</hi> said to his sonne when
he found him in the conspiracie of <hi>Catiline, Now ego te Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilinae
genui sed patria.</hi> So doth God say to every man,
I did not give thee a soule and body to serve sinne withall,
but to serve me withall. <hi>Quot membra tot ora,</hi> so many
members of our bodies, so many faculties of our soules;
so many mouthes to call upon us to serve God withall.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is our duty to serve God, not only for our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
own creation, but for the <hi>creation of the whole world.</hi> For
God made all the world to serve man, and man to serve
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54330:10"/>
him with all the world, and for all the world. He made
the Sunne, the Moone, the Fire and the Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be
serviceable to man, and therefore man must serve God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he hath given all these to his use, and he must serve
God with all these, improving them all to his service.
<hi>Quot creaturae, tot ora,</hi> so many creatures as there are in the
world, so many mouthes to call upon us to serve God, and
to serve him with all the Ingredients before named.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, We are bound by the <hi>bond of Redemption. For we
are therefore delivered out of the hands of our enemies by Iesus
Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 74, 75.</note> 
               <hi>that we should serve him in holinesse and righteousnesse
all the dayes of our life. Quot inimici, tot ora.</hi> So many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
as we are freed from by the death of Christ, so many
mouthes to call upon us to serve Jesus Christ. And in this
sence the very Devill himselfe, and Hell it selfe (as we are
redeemed from them) doe call upon us to serve God, and
to serve him faithfully, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, We are bound by the <hi>bond of Sanctification.</hi>
For this is the end of our sanctification, That we might
have grace to serve him so as to please him, <hi>Heb. 12. 28.
Quot gratiae, tot ora,</hi> so many graces as God hath planted in
thee, so many mouthes to call upon thee to serve God.
For <hi>who goes to warfare at his owne charge?</hi> saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 7.</note>
               <hi>Who planteth a Vineyard and eateth not of the fruit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?
Who feedeth a flock and eateth not of the milk of the flock?</hi>
If God hath planted the graces of his Spirit in thy soule,
he lookes to reape the fruit of his own plantation and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry
by thy holy serving of God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, We are bound by the <hi>bond of Gratitude. Quot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficia,
tot ora,</hi> so many mercies as we have received from
God, so many mouthes to call upon us to serve God. For
every mercy is as a <hi>needle,</hi> saith S. <hi>Austin,</hi> to sow God and
Man together. Man and God are seperated by disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
but mercy is as a needle to sow God and Man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54330:10"/>
againe by obedience. And therefore God makes
the deliverance out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to be a forcible motive to the
keeping of the ten Commandements. <hi>I am the God that
brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, Therefore thou shalt
have none other gods but me, Therefore thou shalt keepe
holy the Sabbath day,</hi> &amp;c. So must the deliverance wee
celebrate this day. It must be as a <hi>golden Cord</hi> to tye
us to serve God more devoutly, more resolvedly then
ever. Every Deliverance binds the delivered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the quantity and quality of the Deliverance.
God hath given us Deliverances of all sorts, and of all
sizes for to oblige us to his service. Wee have had
temporall and spirituall Deliverances, old and new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances.
These two last yeares have been <hi>made up
all of Deliverances.</hi> And to sinne willingly against God
after such Deliverances as these, is a sinne that takes
away all excuse, Ezra. 9. 10. <hi>What shall we say after this,
for we have sinned against thee, q. d.</hi> We have nothing
to say. And it is a sinne that will bring universall and
utter destruction, according to that Text, Ezra. 9. 13,
14. <hi>Seeing thou O God hast given us such a Deliverance
as this, should we againe breake thy Commandements, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
thou not be angry with us, till thou haddest consumed
us, so that there should be no remnant nor escaping.</hi> He that

he was delivered.</p>
            <p>6. We are bound by the <hi>bond of Covenant. Quot promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siones,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
tot ora.</hi> So many Vowes and Covenants we have
made with God, so many mouthes to call upon us to serve
him. When we were baptized we entered into a solemne
Covenant to renounce the Devill and all his workes, and
to be Christs faithfull Souldiers unto our lives end. And
every time we receive the Sacrament of the body and bloud
of Christ, we renew our vowes and covenants. And it is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54330:11"/>
not a weeke since <hi>Ye entred into into a sacred and solemne
Promise to amend your lives.</hi> The Vow of God is upon you.
And therefore I may say as Christ doth, <hi>Give unto God the
things which are Gods.</hi> If service be not due doe not give it
him, but if it be due it is injustice to deny it him. We are
all <hi>servinati, servi empti, jurati, faederati, consecrati, conducti.</hi>
We are all the <hi>borne servants of God,</hi> and better we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been borne, if we doe not serve him. We are all the
<hi>bought Servants of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phll. 2. 7.</note> Christ hath bought us with a dear
price, even with his owne precious bloud, he became not
only a <hi>man,</hi> but a <hi>servant,</hi> to buy us to be his servants.
We are the purchace of Jesus Christ, and it is a high act
of <hi>Robberie</hi> to deprive him of his purchase. We are the
<hi>sworne Servants</hi> of God, and we are forsworne if we doe
not serve him, and serve him aright as we ought to doe.
We have taken a <hi>Covenant</hi> to serve him better, and we are
<hi>Covenant-breakers,</hi> if we doe not serve him, which is one of
the black-marks of a Reprobate.<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 31</note> We are <hi>consecrated to the
service of God,</hi> and dedicated to him by our baptisme, and
therefore it is a sin of <hi>sacriledge</hi> not to serve him. We are
all the <hi>hired servants of God.</hi> All the blessings and mercies
we receive daily from God are nothing else, but Gods
<hi>presse-mony</hi> to hire us to serve him, and it is a shame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such great wages and to doe no service for it. And
thus you see what a great necessity lies upon all men, as well
as great men to serve God.</p>
            <p>The third thing propounded for Explication is,<note place="margin">The third part of the Explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Why great men are bound to serve God as well as others.</note> 
               <hi>To
shew the necessitie that lies upon great men in particular to serve
God,</hi> and to serve him with all those Ingredients, and with
all the circumstances of <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> choice. Great men are
bound to serve God as well as others, and to serve God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then others. First as well as others.</p>
            <p>First, Because they are Gods creatures as well as others.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Bound by the six-fold bond before named, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54330:11"/>
they are <hi>servinati, serviempti, &amp;c.</hi> and therfore <hi>unjust,
perjured and sacrilegious,</hi> if they withdraw themselves from
his service.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They must <hi>die as well as others,</hi> and death
makes all equall. <hi>Diogenes</hi> could find no difference in the
grave, betweene the <hi>bones</hi> of King <hi>Philip</hi> and other men, as
he told <hi>Alexander</hi> the great.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They must appeare and stand before God at the day
of Iudgement, to give an account as well as others, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel.</hi>
20. 12. I saw the dead great and small standing before
God.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is no man great in comparison of God.</hi>
Though a man may be said to be great in comparison of his
neighbour;<note place="margin">Isa 40. 15.</note> yet in comparison of God all the world is but
<hi>as the drop of a bucket.</hi> And if all <hi>Asia, Africa, Europe</hi> and
<hi>America</hi> be but as the drop of a Bucket in comparison of
God,<note place="margin">Chrys.</note> what a little drop of this drop is one great man.
There is a greater nearenesse betweene a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>toade</hi>
then between a King and God. For Toades are Gods crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and so are Kings, and both finite; but there is an
infinite distance between the great God, and the greatest
King.</p>
            <p>As great men are to serve God, as well as others. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
rather then others. And that because,</p>
            <p>First, <hi>They have more reason then others.</hi> God hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
them above others in dignity,<note place="margin">Reasons why great men are to serve God rather the others.</note> honour and wealth,
and therefore he expects they should bring more honour to
him then others. A King looks to be acknowledged by
all, but especially by those who are his Creatures. And
therefore <hi>Caesar</hi> cried out to <hi>Brutus, &amp; tufili?</hi> What thou
my sonne? So those whom God hath exalted and made
as it were gods upon Earth, he looks that these gods should
not serve the Devill, which would be a paradox beyond
expression. The higher the Elements are the purer they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54330:12"/>
are. Aire is purer then water, and fire then aire. The high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
you are in office and wealth, the holier and purer you
ought to be. We doe not expect as much light from a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
as from the Sunne. If God have made thee one of the
great lights of the world; he lookes thou shouldest shine
and out-shine others in holinesse and righteousnesse. It is
a wicked opinion that is spread abroad in the world, that
the greater any man is, the lesse service he need doe unto
God. Hence it is that if we observe any little sparke of piety
in great persons, we are ready to behold it as a blazing
Commet, and to cry it up in the superlative degree. But
the truth is, the golden Rule of Christ teacheth us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>To whom much is given,</hi> (faith Christ, Luk. 12. 47.)
<hi>much is required.</hi> And you your selves require most ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of those servants to whom you give most wages. God
did not require <hi>tentallents</hi> of him to whom he gave but <hi>five,</hi>
but he required <hi>ten</hi> of him to whom he gave <hi>ten.</hi> All crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
the nearer to God the more perfect they are, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
more excellent then men, and the essence of men more
excellent then beasts, and beasts then plants, &amp;c. So the
nearer any man is to God in power and greatnesse, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
purer and holier he ought to be. Insomuch that it is
reckoned as a great aggravation, That the <hi>hands of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Rulers were the chiefe in a trespasse,</hi> Ezra 9. 2. Their
being Rulers did not excuse, but increase their fault. And
<hi>Ieremy</hi> tels us, Jer. 5. 5. <hi>That he would goe to the greatmen, to
see if the way of the Lord,</hi> as expecting more goodnesse from
them then others. Of which when he failed, he threatens
greater judgements against them then others.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As great men have greater reason then others.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> So they have <hi>greater abilities and opportunities to serve God
then others.</hi> Now every ability and opportunity is a talent
with which we are betrusted, and for which we must be
accountable. The Wise-man tells us,<note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 11.</note> Ecclesiast. 7. 11.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54330:12"/>
That <hi>wisdome is good with an Inheritance.</hi> Wisdome is good
without an inheritance. But it cannot doe so much good
when it is seated in a poore man, as when it is joyned with
an inheritance. When divine wisdome and honours meet
together, they are like apples of Gold in pictures of silver.
Riches and greatnesse have made many good men bad, but
never any bad man good, and yet they put a price in a good
mans hand to doe much good. As a good <hi>musicall Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
doth not make a <hi>skillfull Musitian,</hi> but a <hi>skilfull Musiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
can play better upon a good instrument then upon a bad
one. If the man be gracious and religious that is great and
rich, he will make sweeter harmony and melody in Gods
eares, then if he were poore and in a low estate. It is not
to be expressed what attractive power there is in the good
examples of great men to make others good. Great men
are like unto looking-glasses, according to which all the
Country dresse themselves, and if they be good looking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses
they doe a world of good. <hi>When Crispus the chiefe
Ruler of the Synagogue beleeved, many of the</hi> Corinthians <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of it, beleeved also,</hi> Act. 18. 8. When <hi>Shechem</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi>
were circumcised, they quickly perswaded their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be circumcised also. <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> example in my Text
made all <hi>Israel</hi> enter into Covenant to serve God. And if
the great-men and the rich-men of the Kingdome would
appeare in more number, and more couragiously and reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
in the great cause of the warre now undertaken by the
Parliament, how quickly would the whole Land arise as
one man to take part with them. What mighty load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stones
were <hi>Nehemiah, Ezra</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabell</hi> to draw thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of people to goe with them from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
to rebuild the Temple. So much for the Explicatory
part.</p>
            <p>Now for the Use and the Application. And here I
will apply my selfe. First, To all men in generall,<note place="margin">Use of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> not
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54330:13"/>
excluding great-men. And secondly, To great-men in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
and yet not excluding other men.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">First to all men not excluding great men.</note> To all in generall.</p>
            <p>This Text speakes a word of Reproofe to all those that
make a quite contrary choise to <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> choice, that
choose to serve other <hi>Masters</hi> and not the <hi>Lord.</hi> And of these
there are 4 sorts.</p>
            <p>1. Such as choose to <hi>serve men and not the Lord.</hi> The
Apostle faith, 1 Cor. 7. 23. <hi>Ye are bought with a price, bee
not ye the servants of men;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 23.</note> which words doe not forbid the
civill relation and subjection of a servant to his Master, but
they reproove two sorts of men.<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</hi>
               </note> 1. Such as subject
their Consciences to the superstitious inventions of men in
Gods worship, that build their Religion upon mans bare
authority. Such servants are all the Papists that build their
Religion upon the Popes infallibility: these are servants of
men. 2. Such as are servants to the lusts of wicked
men,<note place="margin">Thus <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi>
               </note> that serve men when they runne in a crosse line to
Gods will. Such were the Subjects of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi>
that at the command of the King worshipped the golden
Image, and served the King and not the Lord. Such was
<hi>Pilate</hi> that for feare of displeasing <hi>Caesar,</hi> delivered up
Christ to be crucified,<note place="margin">Ioh. 18. 19</note> though he knew him to be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
And would to God we had not many amongst us
that sell their Consciences, their Religion, and their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to be panders to the lustfull, covetous and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
desires of great men! Such were the Nobles of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byses.
Cambyses</hi> had a lust to marry his owne sister, he
sends for all his councell and asketh, If they had any Law
in <hi>Persia</hi> to allow him to marry his sister? They answered,
That there was no such Law. But yet there was another
Law, <hi>That the Kings of Persia might doe what they list.</hi> These
Nobles were slaves to the lust of <hi>Cambyses.</hi> And if we had
not such Nobles and Gentlemen amongst us, these unhappy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54330:13"/>
warrs would quickly be at an end. <hi>Alexander</hi> had two
friends<note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>Hephaestion</hi> and <hi>Craterus.</hi> One loved him as a man,
the other as a King. He that loved him as a man, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to satisfie the Kings lusts, and to please him as a man in
all his desires, whether lawfull or unlawfull. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him as a King, desired to please him in such things
which were just, and which tended to the Kings honour
and the peoples safety. Now I demand which of these two
were <hi>Alexanders</hi> best friend? Our Soveraigne <hi>King</hi> hath
two such kind of friends. Two such kind of friends had
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and by hearkning to his Young-men and refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the councell of his old and grave Councellours, he rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
himself and his posterity, which God forbid our King
should do.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I am to reprove such as chose <hi>to serve the
times and not the Lord,</hi> that change their Religion with the
times; That will be superstitious, if the times be supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and devout or Atheisticall, according to the times,
whose Religion is like a <hi>peece of waxe</hi> to be moulded into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
frame, according as the timesalter and change. Such
were the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that when the Jewes were in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
would professe themselves to be of the Jewish Religion,
but when the Jewes were in adversity, they would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
them and their Religion. Many such <hi>Samaritans</hi>
amongst us, that in King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt's dayes turned
Protestants, in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> turned Papists, and in Queen
<hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes turned Protestants againe. There are
thousands in this age that are <hi>Time-servers</hi> and not <hi>God-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</hi>
Many such Ministers, and many such Magistrates,
many such people; I have much thought of two wicked
speeches, too too much practised in these our dayes. The
one is of a deepe Polititian. <hi>That it was good to follow the
truth, but not too neare at the heeles, least it dash out our braines.</hi>
There are many such that would be glad to seeme to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54330:14"/>
and to owne the cause of Religion, which is now
asserted by the Parliament, but they are afraid to owne
it too publikely or too zealously, for feare it should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their preferment, and dash out the braines of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions.
Another speech is that of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre</hi>
to <hi>Beza, That he would launch no farther into the Sea
of Religion, then he might be sure to returne safe into the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
This is the true <hi>picture</hi> of a <hi>Time-server,</hi> to dive no
farther into the deepes of Religion, to appeare no farther
in this great cause of Religion, then he can be sure to save
his estate, and to save his carcasse. I read of the men of
Issacar, <hi>That they were wise to understand the times, to know
what</hi> Israel <hi>ought to doe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Chron. 12. 31.</note> It is wisedome to <hi>observe times,</hi> so
as to know our duty. But it is damnable wickednesse to
<hi>serve the times</hi> and not the Lord, to ring changes as the
times change.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. To reprove such that choose to <hi>serve themselves and
not the Lord.</hi> That set up themselves as God, and doe
whatsoever is good in their own eyes, and make their <hi>wills
their Scripture.</hi> This is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. This is selfe
worship, and selfe Idolatry, which is the greatest Idolatry
of all. It is the greatest curse under Heaven for God
to give a man over to himselfe to live as he list, <hi>Psalm. 81.
11, 12. Rom.</hi> 1. 26. I have read of one given over to the
Devill for his good,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 5</note> but never of any given over to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

               <hi>Lord

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I am to reprove such that choose to <hi>serve sinne
and not the Lord.</hi> It is one thing to be a <hi>sinner,</hi> another thing
to be a <hi>servant</hi> of sinne. A servant of sinne, is one that
gives himselfe over to the service of sinne, that is bound
apprentise to sinne. Observe the difference betweene <hi>Paul</hi>
and <hi>Ahab. Paul</hi> was sold under sinne,<note place="margin">Rom. 7. 21.</note> but it was against his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54330:14"/>
will. But <hi>Ahab</hi> sold himselfe willingly to worke wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
Many such <hi>Ahabs</hi> that serve sinne as the <hi>Centurion</hi>
servants served him, <hi>If sinne bid goe they goe.</hi> Such a slave
was <hi>Herod</hi> to his <hi>Herodias, Felix</hi> to his <hi>Drusilla.</hi> Such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
are swearers and drunkards, that are at the service of
their Oathes and Cups. There are many men that are
slaves to the Mammon of iniquity. That doe not only <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
money,</hi> but are <hi>possessed of money,</hi> that are had of money,
that with <hi>Iudas</hi> will sell Jesus Christ himselfe for 30. pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of silver. There are many that are slaves to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments,
that say with <hi>Agrippina</hi> concerning <hi>Nero, Peream
ego modo ille imperet.</hi> That sell their part in Heaven to get a
little honour here upon earth. And to speake my mind
plainely, there are two sinnes which are as two mighty
Loadstones to draw hundreds from the Parliaments side.
<hi>Covetousnesse</hi> and <hi>Ambition.</hi> Could the Parliament feed
these sinnes as well as they are fed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
distractions would quickly be at an end. What
made <hi>Baalam</hi> goe to <hi>Balak?</hi> At first he said,<note place="margin">Numb. 22. 18.</note> 
               <hi>If</hi> Balak <hi>would
give me his house full of gold and silver I cannot goe beyond the
word of the Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 15.</note> but yet afterwards being <hi>mad after the
wages of iniquity,</hi> he went and did much hurt to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
but it was to his own ruine at last, and this will be the
end of all those that are the servants of sinne. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
speakes excellently, <hi>For when ye were servants of sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 10, 11.</note>
               <hi>ye were free from righteousnesse. What fruit had ye then in those
things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things
is death.</hi> In which words the Apostle teacheth us, that the
service of sinne is both <hi>shamefull and damnable.</hi> First, it is
<hi>shamefull.</hi> For to serve sinne, is to serve the Devill, <hi>Ioh. 8.
44.</hi> Oh that the world would beleeve this, that when they
serve pride, and covetousnesse, and ambition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they serve
the Devill, And therefore <hi>Cyprian</hi> brings in the Devill
upbraiding Christ, <hi>Ostende mihi tot servos qui tibi,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54330:15"/>
               <hi>Shew me if thou canst so many servants that have served them
so diligently and so willingly as I can shew that have served
me.</hi> If the Devill should appeare in humane shape, you
would think it horrible Idolatry to adore him, and yet
when you obey sinne, you doe this and worser then this,
for sinne is worser then the Devill; The Devill is Gods
creature, but sinne hath nothing of God in it. Sinne is the
<hi>Devils excrement,</hi> as <hi>Barnard</hi> saith; And it must needs be
a loathsome service to be servant to so vile a thing. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It is a cursed and damnable service, <hi>for the wages of
sinne is death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How comes it then to passe that sinne hath so many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?<note place="margin">Object.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Because sinne deales with sinners,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> as the <hi>Philistims</hi> did
with <hi>Sampson.</hi> First, it puts out our eyes, that we should
not see the vilenesse and cursednesse of sinne, and then it
puts us in the mill to grind as sinnes slave. And therefore
Christ sent <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gentiles, <hi>to open their eyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi>
26. 18. This was his first worke. The Lord open our
eyes to see the shamefulnesse and damnablenesse of sinnes
service.</p>
            <p>2. To reproove those that make <hi>Ioshuas</hi> choise but not
with <hi>Ioshuas</hi> ingredients,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. Of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, directed to all sorts.</note> That choose to serve God, but
doe not serve him <hi>undividedly, everlastingly, sincerely, zealous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
reverently,</hi> &amp;c. We live in an age wherin God had never
more <hi>servants,</hi> and yet never <hi>lesse service;</hi> as one saith;
There are many <hi>Divines,</hi> but few that live <hi>like Divines.</hi> So
God hath many servants, but few that doe him service.</p>
            <p>There are some that <hi>divide</hi> betweene the service of God
and the service of sinne, like the false Mother that would
have the child divided. As <hi>Cambden</hi> reports of <hi>Redwald</hi>
King of the <hi>East-saxons,</hi> the first Prince of this Nation that
was baptized, yet in the same Church he had one Altar
for Christian Religion, another Altar for Heathenish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion:
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54330:15"/>
So there are many such false-worshippers of God,
that divide the rooms of their soules betweene God and
the Devill, that sweare <hi>by God, and by</hi> Malcham, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1. 5.
that sometimes pray, and sometimes curse, that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
goe to Gods house, sometimes to a Play-house; that
are of a Mungrill-religion, halting betweene God and
<hi>Baal,</hi> Heteroclites in Religion, but God cannot endure
this division. This is to set <hi>thy threshold by Gods threshold,
Ezek.</hi> 43. 8. This is to set the <hi>Arke and Dagon</hi> together,
which God will never endure, <hi>God cares not for one halfe of

            </p>
            <p>There are others that serve God, but their service is but
<hi>as a morning cloud,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hos. 6. 4.</note> 
               <hi>and as an early dew it quickly vanisheth,</hi>
of whom I may say justly that which <hi>Nabal</hi> did unjustly of
David,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 25. 10.</note> 
               <hi>There are many servants now a dayes that breake away
every man from his Master.</hi> Many now a dayes, and more
in our dayes then in former dayes. We live in an Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing
age, wherein there are many <hi>falling Starres,</hi> but few
<hi>fixed Starres;</hi> Many that were once <hi>whiter then milke, as
Rubies, and polished Saphires in regard of their glorious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
but now they are blacker then acoale,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lam. 4. 8.</note> 
               <hi>they are withered
and become like a stick;</hi> That were yesterday <hi>Gods people,</hi> but

               <note place="margin">Mica. 2. 8.</note> To these I say as S. <hi>Peter</hi> doth,
<hi>Better they had never known the way of righteousnesse,</hi> &amp;c.
2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. This relapse makes thy condition the worse,
as relapses in all kinds are most dangerous. And it is also
a signe thou esteemest the service of sinne better then the
service of God. For he that first served sinne, and then
turned to the service of God, and afterwards falls againe to
the service of sinne, proclaimes to all the world that he
esteemes the service of sinne, better then the service of
God, which is an affront to God of an high nature.</p>
            <p>There are others serve God, but it is <hi>all in hypocr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sie.</hi>
We live in a complement all age, our mouthes are full of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54330:16"/>
service. It is an ordinary phrase, <hi>Your humble servant,
My humble service,</hi> and yet it may be we intend no service
at all, but hate them in our hearts. Even so we deale with
God. Many like the Souldiers that <hi>bowed to Christ and
mocked him;</hi> That give their outsides to God, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
to all uncleannesse; That as <hi>Luther</hi> saith of <hi>Cain,</hi> give
<hi>opus personae Deo,</hi> but not <hi>personam,</hi> their cap and knee to
God, but themselves to sinne and iniquity. And indeed
this is the capitall and crying sinne of this age; Religion
is that which is pretended on all hands: <hi>The defence of the
Protestant Religion,</hi> this newes we heare daily from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi>
And for this purpose there is an <hi>Army of Papists rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to defend the Protestant Religion.</hi> And in this horrid
Conspiracy (for the discovery of which we are here met
to blesse God,) there was a Declaration framed, to assure
the people, that the chiefe cause of their insurrection was
to maintaine the Protestant Religion. Just as the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouder
Traitors, that would have blowne up the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the good of the Catholick Religion, <hi>Tantum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
poterat suadere malorum;</hi> the Lord lay not this great
sinne of hypocrisie to the charge of this Nation. For my
part I am confident that the Popish Army, and the plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
Army, will fight no otherwise for the Protestant
Religion, then a Theefe doth for a true mans Purse, which
is not to preserve it, but to take it away.</p>
            <p>There are a fourth sort that serve God, but it is so <hi>cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
as if God were a <hi>dead Idoll:</hi> Where shall we find a man
<hi>fervent in spirit as serving the Lord?</hi> Where is our ancient
zeale? Oh the cold Prayers, frozen Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It
is possible to find a living Christian, but where shall we
find a Christian lively and active in Gods service? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
God will spue out of his mouth <hi>a lukewarme Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicean,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note>
which is a remarkeable place: For that which we
spue out, we doe it with delight; we choose some dirty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54330:16"/>
corner to ease our stomacks in, and we never reassume what
we once spue out: And all this to signifie; That God
will for ever cast off with delight, and with shame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion,
a cold, dead, lukewarme Christian, especially in these
active times.</p>
            <p>Others serve God, but it is with <hi>such horrible irreverence
and negligence,</hi> such <hi>sleepinesse,</hi> such <hi>lazinesse,</hi> as that we
would account it a great indignity to be so served by any
of our own servants. I read that <hi>Caesar</hi> spake to one that
was afraid to give him too much respect, <hi>Hic homo timet
timere Caesarem,</hi> This man is afraid to be afraid of <hi>Caesar.</hi>
So there are many that are afraid to be too reverent in Gods
service: And indeed a man may be too reverent with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious
reverence, which is irreverence in Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme.
But to be Reverend with Scripture Reverence,
both inward and outward, this is so necessary,<note place="margin">Heb. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. 28.</note> as that God
will not accept of our service without it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustus</hi> spake to one that entertained him with home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
entertainement, <hi>Who made you and I so familiar?</hi> We
must so serve God as to remember our distance; <hi>Cursed is
he that doth the worke of the Lord negligently.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are others that serve God, and enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to serve him, as you have lately done; but it is with
so many <hi>limitations, qualifications, reservations and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,</hi>
that God connot but abhorre it. Some will serve
God with an <hi>If:</hi> If they can keepe their promotions. Some
will serve <hi>God in some things</hi> and <hi>not in others;</hi> such was
<hi>Herod</hi> that did <hi>many things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 6. 20.</note> but still reserved his <hi>Herodias;</hi>
Such was <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> that kept back halfe. Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
say with <hi>Naaman, In this the Lord pardon me.</hi> Some
will serve God at some times and not at others, in some
places and not in others; But the Lord abhominates all
thy services if it be not <hi>universall in all things, at all times, in
all places, with all thy faculties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:54330:17"/>
Others serve God, but it is according to their own <hi>fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
that are more zealous for one superstitious invention,
then for all Gods commandements: You shall know such
by this marke, <hi>They that are so much for superstitious formes
of godlinesse, doe most hate those that have the true power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</hi>
The <hi>Pharisees</hi> were the deadliest enemies Christ had,
And the <hi>Iewes</hi> stirred up the <hi>devout women</hi> to persecute <hi>Paul,
Acts</hi> 13. 50.</p>
            <p>By all this that hath bin said, you may perceive the reason;</p>
            <p>1. Why God hath so many servants, and yet so few
servants that he delights in; because there are so few that
serve him undividedly, everlastingly, inconditionally, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously.
Or,</p>
            <p>2. Why God abhorreth all our fastings, and prayers,
and Sacraments; or why God saith to our services as he
did to the <hi>Iewes; To what purpose is the multitude of your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices?
I am weary of them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 1. 12.</note> &amp;c. Because we serve God with
lip-service onely, and knee service, we serve him negligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and partially, and coldly. Or,</p>
            <p>3. Why so few goe to Heaven? because so few make
<hi>Ioshuas</hi> choice with <hi>Ioshuas</hi> Ingredients; For unlesse we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to serve him here with those fore-named Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients,
we shall never be saved hereafter.</p>
            <p>But now I shall apply my selfe in particular to great men,
and yet not excluding others.</p>
            <p>This Text reproves those that are advanced by God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
great places of Honour and wealth,<note place="margin">Use of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension to great persons in particular.</note> and that thinke
themselves priviledged by their greatnesse, to be greater in
iniquity then in greatnesse, that make no other use of their
greatnesse, but to sinne without controule; That are Great
men, and Great swearers, Great adulterers, Great Atheists,
Great scoffers and mockers at Godlinesse. Let these men
know (if any such here,) That the great God is greater
then the greatest. Gods lawes are not like unto <hi>Cobwebs</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54330:17"/>
(as it is said of mans Lawes) to catch <hi>little flies,</hi> and let the
<hi>great flies</hi> escape; but God will especially punish great
men if they be great transgressours. And therefore <hi>Elijah</hi>
tells <hi>Ahab, The dogs shall lick thy blood, thine even thine;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kin. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>even
with you, sinnes against the Lord your God?</hi> God made great
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to graze like an Oxe. Great <hi>Agag</hi> was hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in peeces. God hath his hand-writing upon the wall,
to make the great <hi>Belshazzars</hi> of the earth to tremble,
whilest they are carousing in their sacrilegious cupps:
Great <hi>Herod</hi> to whom the people cryed, <hi>It is the voice of
God not of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> was eaten up of wormes, repeating these
words in the midst of his torments, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ye me that seemed to you as a god, how miserably I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to depart from you all.</hi> In the Old World there were
Giants and mighty <hi>Anakims,</hi> men great in power, and
greater in sinne; Their sinnes were Giant-like, and God
sent a mighty flood to destroy them. The sinnes of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours,
as they are more visible then the sinnes of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours
(as the Ecclipse of the Sunne is sooner seene then
the Ecclipse of a Starre; and a wart upon the face is soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
seene then upon another part,) so also they doe a great
deale more hurt, and therefore their condemnation shall be
the greater.</p>
            <p>They doe more hurt two wayes, by <hi>imitation,</hi> and by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By <hi>imitation;</hi> Therefore <hi>Ieroboam</hi> is said to make all
<hi>Israel</hi> to sinne, because his Idolatrous example made all
<hi>Israel</hi> to sinne. When <hi>Saul</hi> fell upon his Sword, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourbearer
seeing the King to doe so,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 31. 5.</note> fell also upon his
Sword and killed himselfe. When great men fall into
sinne, they fall as men that fall in a croud, drawing many
others downe with them. The <hi>Persians</hi> thought a crooked
Nose to be a great ornament, because their Emperour
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54330:18"/>
               <hi>Cyrus</hi> had a crooked Nose. And because <hi>Alexander</hi> the
Great had a wry Neck, his Courtiers did all strive to goe
awry with their Necks. The bodies of men are not so sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to be infected by the illnesse of the aire, as the soules of
men by the vices of their Rulers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, By <hi>imputation;</hi> For though it be a certaine
truth, That God never punisheth an innocent Nation,
<hi>The soule that sinneth shall dye:</hi> Yet it is as certaine; That
God doth oftentimes take an occasion to punish a sinnefull
Nation, by imputing the punishment of the Rulers sinne
upon the people, or rather by punishing the people for their
sinnes, and the Ruler in the people. <hi>Quicquid delirant Reges
plectuntur Achivi. David</hi> had sinned in numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and for this sinne 70000. of his people must perish by
the plague. No doubt the <hi>Israelites</hi> were grievous sinners,
and so it is expresly said, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 1. But the most just
God at the same time, punished the people and <hi>David</hi> also
in the losse of his subjects. As it is no wrong in a Judge
to make the <hi>back</hi> of a Theefe pay for the sinne which his
<hi>hand</hi> hath committed, no more is it injustice in God to
punish the members of a politick body when the head is in
fault; So neere is the union betweene Prince and people,
and so prone are the people to follow the sinnes of their
Princes, and so to partake of their punishments. And
therefore if the sinnes of great men bring poore people into
miseries, it is just and equall that great men should be
brought into misery for those sinnes for which they bring
others into misery.</p>
            <p>But besides this; There are two other reasons why God
will be sure to punish great men when they are great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders.</p>
            <p>1. Because the punishing of great men doth a great deale
more good then the punishing of others. For hereby it
appeares, that God is no respecter of persons: Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54330:18"/>
and anguish upon <hi>every</hi> soule that doth evill, and first
upon the Rulers and Nobles, and then upon others. And
hereby also inferiours and poore people are kept under sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to Gods law, when they perceive that their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
cannot escape without Gods severe chastisement. As
in a Schoole, when the Master picks out one of the greatest
youths in the Schoole and whips him for a fault, all the
little boyes sit and tremble, and learne to avoid those faults
for which they see their betters punished. Thus when
<hi>Goliah</hi> the great was slaine, all the <hi>Philistimes</hi> fled away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently.
The beholding of Gods severe punishments upon
great ones, will be a notable Sermon to make inferiours
godly and religious.</p>
            <p>2. Because unles God did punish great men they would
escape altogether unpunished. Great men by mony, by
might and authority, by friends, and through feare for the
most part are free from Civill and Ecclesiasticall censures.
And therefore it behoves the high <hi>Iehovah</hi> to take them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his own hand, and to bring great men into great pressures,
if they sin greatly against him.</p>
            <p>I have read a notable speech in a Popish writer, <hi>That few
Confessours of rich men are saved,</hi> that is in our <hi>English</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<hi>Few Noble-mens Chaplaines are saved.</hi> And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
he gives, is, Because they are subject to flatter their
Lords and Masters for hope of preferment, and so to bring
the guilt of the bloud of the soules of their Lords upon
their owne soules. Now that I may not be guilty of this
fault, let me speake my mind freely to you that are Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Noble-men here assembled this day.</p>
            <p>First, let me tell you that <hi>great places,</hi> as they are <hi>great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
and opportunities</hi> to doe God service and great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
if improved accordingly. So if they be not improo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for that end they are <hi>great curses,</hi> they are <hi>soule-traps,
silken-halters, golden damnations.</hi> And there cannot be a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54330:19"/>
greater signe of a man that hath his Heaven in this life, then
to be great and wicked, rich and wicked. And therefore
<hi>Abraham</hi> tels <hi>Dives,</hi> Luc. 16. 25. <hi>Remember sonne that thou
in thy life time hast had thy good things, but now thou art tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented.
Gregory</hi> the great never read this Text, but it
made him tremble, and it may justly cause all such as are
cloathed in purple and fare deliciously every day to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>Consider further that Text, 1 Cor. 1. 26. <hi>You see your
calling brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not
many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> There are some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men called, but not many. There are but few that are
great and rich here, and great and rich hereafter. A Text
to be trembled at by great men. <hi>The Ostrich is not able to fly
high as the Larke, because her wings are so big. The Moone is
never in the ecclipse, but when it is in the full, and then it is
most distant from the Sunne.</hi> Fullnesse of outward prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and happinesse should indeed be <hi>maximum vinculum obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientiae,</hi>
the greatest bond of obedience; but yet it proves
for the most part, <hi>maximus laqueus Diaboli,</hi> the greatest
snare the Devill hath to entrap our soules. This is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why so few of the Noble-men and Gentlemen of the
Kingdome appeare on the Parliaments side in this great
time of necessity. <hi>Not many mighty, not many noble are
called.</hi> Thus it was in Christs time. The great men and the
great Schollars crucified Christ, and the poore received
the Gospell. The followers of Christ were a company
of poore people and silly women: This made the chiefe
Priests say, Joh. 7. 48, 49. <hi>Have any of the Rulers or of the
Pharisees believed on him? But this people who knoweth not
the Law are accursed.</hi> Thus it was in Christs time, and thus
it is in ours. <hi>Poore Lazarus</hi> goeth to Heaven, when <hi>rich
Dives</hi> is carried to Hell, <hi>Surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt coelum,
&amp; nos cum nostrâ doctrinâ mergimur in profundum.</hi> It was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54330:19"/>
the saying of a Schoole-master to a King that sent to see
how he did when he was dying. The Schoole-master re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
this answer. <hi>Tell the King I am going to a place where
few Kings come,</hi> meaning to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Consider lastly those two places of Scripture, <hi>Re. 6. 15, 16,
17. The Kings and the great men and rich men wish for the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to hide them,</hi> &amp;c. And Isa. 30. 33. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old
even for the King it is prepared.</hi> By King is meant in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
the great King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> as may appeare by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text.</p>
            <p>The Lord give you hearts to consider these things.</p>
            <p>Now I proceed to an Use of Exhortation. And here I
will apply my selfe; first to all men, as well as great men:
Secondly, to great men especially,<note place="margin">Use of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation.</note> and yet not excluding
others.</p>
            <p>First, To all men in generall. To perswade all men to
make <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> choise their choise,<note place="margin">First to all men not excluding great men.</note> to choose to serve the
Lord, and not only so, but also to serve him with all the
Ingredients before mentioned; to serve him <hi>transcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
inconditionally, universally, undividedly, reverently, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlastingly,</hi>
&amp;c. For it is the manner of serving of God,
that is the <hi>distinguishing Character of a true servant. Cain</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
Sacrifice as well as <hi>Abell.</hi> The wicked worship God,
pray and receive Sacraments as well as the godly. But <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi>
offered in faith, so did not <hi>Cain.</hi> The godly serve God
in sincerity, with reverence, diligence and chearfullnes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
in all things to keep a good conscience, so do not
the wicked. That Text which I have so often named, <hi>He. 12.
28.</hi> makes the acceptation of our service to depend not upon
our serving of God, but upon our serving of God with <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and godly fear.</hi> It is the right manner of serving of God,
that makes thy service a sweet perfume. And it is the right
manner of worshipping also, that makes thee a <hi>true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipper,</hi>
and that causeth God to <hi>delight in thy worship,</hi> and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54330:20"/>
to <hi>desire to be worshipped by them,</hi> according to that excellent
place, Joh. 4. 23. <hi>But the houre commeth and now is, when
the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me ingage you all this day for God and his services.
Let us give up our names to God, and enter into a holy
Covenant to serve him with all the Ingredients. For marke
what <hi>Moses</hi> saith, Exod. 19. 5. <hi>If ye will obey me indeed, then
yee shall be a peculiar treasure,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not say simply, If
you will obey me, but if ye will obey me indeed. And so
also, Deut. 28. 1. <hi>If you will hearken diligently to doe all his
Commandements then the Lord will blesse thee,</hi> &amp;c. He doth
not say simply, if you will hearken, but if you will hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<hi>diligently,</hi> and observe to doe <hi>all</hi> my Commandements.
Let us serve God <hi>as God</hi> and <hi>for God.</hi> As a God transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
inconditionally; For Gods sake sincerely, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
            <p>To perswade you to the practise of these things, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what hath bin already said concerning the necessity
of this duty. I adde further the consideration of the <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
profitablenesse, comfortablenesse</hi> and <hi>easinesse</hi> of this
duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The excellency and honourablenesse of</hi> Joshuah's <hi>choice.</hi> For
indeed it is not only a duty,<note place="margin">Motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade us to serve God with all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients.</note> but a <hi>high Prerogative</hi> to be
the servant of the high God, <hi>Deo servire regnare est.</hi> And
therefore whereas <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 17. it is said, <hi>Many Prophets and
Iust men,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. 24. It is said, <hi>Many Prophets and
Kings,</hi> to note unto us, <hi>That Iust men are Kings,</hi> Rev. 1. 6.
This was <hi>Moses</hi> his honour, and it is often repeated, Moses
<hi>my Servant,</hi> &amp;c. This was <hi>Ioshuah's</hi> honour often repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
<hi>My servant</hi> Joshuah, &amp;c. This was <hi>Davids</hi> honour,
<hi>I am thy servant O Lord, I am thy servant.</hi> And it is prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a Title to the 36. Psalme. <hi>A Psalme of</hi> David <hi>the

thinke us worthy to be his servants. And therfore <hi>Paul</hi> stiles
himself, <hi>Paul a servant of Iesus Christ.</hi> It is the certainest signe
of a reprobate to have much wages here, and to want a heart
to do service with it. It is a great happines to be in place to do
service. It is the honour of our honours to be inabled by
them to do God service. <hi>Non est laboriosa sed amabilis &amp; optan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da
haec servitus,</hi> saith <hi>Austin.</hi> It is no painfull and laborious
service, but a service to be loved and longed for.</p>
            <p>As it is honourable to be a servant of God, so also the
services themselves are honourable, <hi>Pretiosa haec servitus
virtutum constat expensis.</hi> This precious and honourable
service stands in the practise of all vertues, in praying unto
God and praising of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O let this perswade us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
this day to serve God more strictly then ever.</p>
            <p>Adde secondly, The <hi>profitablenesse</hi> of this service.<note place="margin">Motive 2.</note> There
is no service any man doth for God but God takes <hi>exact
notice</hi> of it; Thus God tooke notice of <hi>Abrahams</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to offer <hi>Isaac,</hi> Gen. 22. 16. God takes notice of every
<hi>circumstance</hi> of that that we doe for him. Thus Christ took
notice of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> and of every circumstance of her
washing his feet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Luk. 7. 44, 45, 46. And <hi>Mark.</hi> 4. 2, 3.
Christ observes how farre some came to heare him, and
how long they tarried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as God <hi>takes notice</hi> of
these things in his servants, so he commends them upon
all occasions and highly <hi>esteemes</hi> of them and their services.
Thus God boasted to Satan concerning his servant <hi>Iob,</hi> Job
1. 8. <hi>Hast thou considered my servant</hi> Job, <hi>that there is none
like him,</hi> &amp;c. And as none <hi>observes, commends</hi> and <hi>prizeth</hi>
his servants so much as God, so none <hi>rewards</hi> his servants
as God doth. None more able and none more willing.
The service of God is <hi>perfect freedome,</hi> and it will free us
from all other services. As a man that buyeth free-hold
Land, though he pay deare for it, yet it is accounted chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then coppy-hold, because it freeth him from many ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54330:21"/>
vices, which the coppy-hold is obliged unto. If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
a servant of Gods indeed and in truth, this will free thee
from the service of sinne and Satan. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
If we be not true servants to Christ, we shall be
slaves to every thing beside him. <hi>O quam multos habet Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minos,
qui unum non habet.</hi> O how many Lords hath that
man that hath not Christ for his Lord. Either thy belly
will be thy god, or thy mony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The service of sinne,
as it is <hi>shamefull,</hi> so it is <hi>unfruitfull.</hi> And it is called, <hi>The
unfruitfull worke of darknesse.</hi> But the service of God, as it is
<hi>honourable,</hi> so it <hi>ends in everlasting life. No man ever kindled
a fire upon Gods Altar for nought,</hi> Mal. 1. 9. <hi>In keeping of Gods
Commandements there is great reward,</hi> Psal. 10. And indeed
God himselfe is the <hi>exceeding great reward</hi> of his servants,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. This is a service wherein the servant hath all the
profit and the Master none.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If there be so much profit in Gods service, why
are Gods servants so much persecuted and afflicted in this
life?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. This is part of their service to be persecuted,
for we serve God by suffering as well as by doing.</p>
            <p>2. It is a great honour that God will account us worthy
to suffer for him.<note place="margin">Act. 5. 41.</note> And therefore the Apostles <hi>rejoyced that
they were accounted worthy to be whipped for Christ sake.</hi> They
did not rejoyce in whipping as whipping, but <hi>(flagella prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Christum)</hi> to be whipped for Christs sake was matter of
great joy unto them. The Apostle tels us, <hi>That to us it is
given, not only to believe, but also to suffer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> It is a great gift
of God to give us opportunity to suffer for him. This is
that to which we are <hi>predestinated, 1 Thes.</hi> 3. 3. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Christ reckoneth it as <hi>part</hi> of our <hi>reward</hi> in this life, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 30.
And he professeth that it will mightily increase our
reward in Heaven, <hi>Luk. 6. 22, 23. Mat.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> But why are Gods servants so poore if his service be
so profitable?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:54330:21"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. God doth as other masters that keepe their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
till the worke be done. This life is the time of working,
hereafter we shall have wages enough, <hi>Psal. 31. 19. O how
great are the good things which thou hast laid up,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Cor.
4. 17.</p>
            <p>2. I answer that for the present even in this life, no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God is poore, but so long and so much as God se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to be good for him, for if it were good to be rich, he
should be rich, Psa. 84. 10. <hi>No good thing would he with-hold
from him that liveth a godly life.</hi> He that hath given thee
Christ, will with him give thee all things. He that will
give thee a <hi>Crowne</hi> hereafter, will not deny thee a <hi>crum</hi> here,
if good for thee. There are many deare servants of God,
to whom God giveth very little wages in this life, because
he fore-seeth that if they had a great part of their wages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,
they would doe but little worke. As many
work-men that are paid before their worke be done, when
they have their pay, begin to slacke their worke. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we see it too too true in many great rich personages
that have so much of their pay before hand, that they doe
many of them but very little service, and some of them
thinke that they are priviledged from doing much service,
because they have so much wages, whereas indeed it ought
to be an obligation to greater service, as I have already
shewed. O that the profitablenesse of this service might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
us to serve him more faithfully and more diligently
then every yet we have done.</p>
            <p>3. Consider the <hi>comfortablenesse</hi> of this service.<note place="margin">Motive 3.</note> It is a
service full of soule-satisfying and soule-ravishing joy, <hi>Psal.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
63. 2. Psal. 84. 4, 10. One day in thy Courts is better then a
thousand,</hi> &amp;c. How did <hi>Hannah</hi> rejoyce after she had bin
praying? How did the Eunuch rejoyce after he had bin
baptized? O the pure and undefiled comfort that is to be
found in the Word! This made <hi>David</hi> say, <hi>That he had
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54330:22"/>
perished in his affliction had not the Word beene his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ineffable comfort in a Sacrament rightly received,
and after a few teares shed for sin, after a prayer made with
the 10. Ingredients formerly named. And the reason why
the service of God is so brim-full of comfort, is,</p>
            <p>1. Because Gods service is a <hi>type of Heaven,</hi> wherin is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of joy.</p>
            <p>2. Because in the service of God we have <hi>communion
with God,</hi> who is the God of all consolation, and with the
<hi>Spirit of God,</hi> who is called the <hi>Comforter.</hi> And as a man
that walkes amongst perfumes must needs smell of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume.
So they that converse with the God of all joy must
needs be filled with all joy. And therefore <hi>David</hi> cals God
<hi>his exceeding joy,</hi> Ps. 43. 4.</p>
            <p>If there be so much comfort in Gods service,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> what is the
reason that wicked men account it a wearisomnes and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and snuffe at it, as it is, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p>You may as well aske,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> why a Swine finds no delight in
a greene meadow? Even because it is a Swine. Or why a
horse takes no delight in reading? Even because it is above
his capacity. A wicked man is like a fish out of his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when he is in Gods service, he is all fleshly, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and naturall, and the service is spirituall, heavenly and
supernaturall. No wonder therefore he delights not in it.
But this is the wicked mans curse.</p>
            <p>But what is the reason that many of Gods people doe not
find comfort in Gods service?<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>There are none of Gods people but they do sometime or
other find comfort,<note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> either in the ordinances, or from the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
            <p>2. If at any time they misse of comfort it is because they
doe not meet with God, whom they came to converse
withall. As when a man goeth to meet with a friend, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54330:22"/>
meets him not, he comes away sadded in his spirit. So
when a child of God comes to an ordinance, hoping to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
sweet communion with God in it, and then failes of his
expectation, this must needs fill him full of sadnesse. And
therfore <hi>Bernard</hi> hath an excellent speech. <hi>Nunquam abs te
recedo Domine sine te.</hi> That he never went from God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God. Give me leave to adde a clause to <hi>Bernards</hi> speech.
And happy is that Christian that when he goeth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
with God in his ordinances can say. <hi>Nunquam ad te
accedo sine te, nunqum abs te recedo sine te. Oh Lord I never
come to thee, but I meet thee, and I never goe from thee, but I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thee with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is the reason that Gods people doe sometimes
misse of Gods comfortable presence,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> when they come to
serve God?</p>
            <p>Because they doe not bring the Ingredients formerly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.<note place="margin">Answ.</note>
They doe not serve God with reverence, diligence,
zeale, chearfullnesse, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Either they bring <hi>no vessels at all
to hold the consolations of God,</hi> (I meane no hunger after Gods
presence in an ordinance.) Or else they bring <hi>vessels so little
and so narrow mouth'd that will hold but very little water.</hi> (I
meane they bring so little hunger after God, that God will
not vouchsafe to satisfie it.) Or else it is because they bring
their <hi>ordinary hearts, their carnall</hi> and <hi>worldly hearts</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
spirituall and extraordinary duties. Hearts unsuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the duties, and hearts unsensible of the duties. Or els
there is some <hi>Achan</hi> unstoned, some sin unrepented on, that
ecclipseth the light of Gods countenance, some spirituall
obstruction. These and such like are the causes why Gods
people misse sometimes of comfort in Gods service.</p>
            <p>But the fault is never in the service, which is so brim-full
of such rare and ravishing comforts, that <hi>Bernard</hi> relates
this Story of himselfe, That someties when he went to his
prayers he found himselfe dull and heavy, but after he had
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54330:23"/>
strugled a little with his dullnesse, all on a suddaine, <hi>he was
visited with the visitation of the Almighty, Beatum me praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>
&amp;c. I should account my selfe happy (saith he) if
these visitations would alwayes last, <hi>Sed rara hora, brevis
mora, oh si duraret!</hi> But, ô but it continueth but for a while!
And St. <hi>Austin</hi> relates this Story of himselfe, That upon a
time when he and his Mother <hi>Monica</hi> were discoursing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
about the joyes of Heaven, and the comforts of
Gods Spirit, they were so filled with joy that <hi>Austin</hi> useth
these words, Lord thou knowest in that day, <hi>Quam mundus
eviluit cum omnibus suis delectationibus,</hi> &amp;c. How vildly we
did esteeme of the world with all his delights. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the world are not worthy to be named that day that
we speake of these comforts. Oh let the comfortablenesse
of this service oblige you from hence-forth to serve God
better then ever yet you have done.</p>
            <p>Adde fourthly and lastly,<note place="margin">Motive</note> The <hi>easinesse</hi> of this service,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Matth. 11. 29, 30. <hi>My yoake is easie and my burden is
light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How can the service of God be said to be easie?<note place="margin">Ob.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To a fleshly carnall heart it is a burden intolerable.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> But it
may be said to be easie.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>In regard of the service God required under the Covenant
of works.</hi> For there God required perfect obedience in our
owne persons, not admitting of Repentance. But in the
service required under the covenant of grace, we have a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour
to fly unto, and admittance unto favour upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
            <p>2. It may be said to be <hi>easie, in regard of the service of sinne
and of the Devill.</hi> There are many that take more paines to
<hi>serve sinne and money,</hi> then those that goe to Heaven doe <hi>to
serve God.</hi> Many take more pains to goe <hi>to hell,</hi> then others
doe to goe to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. It may be said to be <hi>easie, in regard of the many services
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54330:23"/>
it frees us from,</hi> as you heard even now. As <hi>Diogenes</hi> told
<hi>Alexander,</hi> when he boasted that he was Lord of the whole
world. <hi>Tu servus servorum meorum es. Illis enim cupiditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
quibus ego impero tu mancipiumes.</hi> Thou art a servant to
my servants, a slave to those lusts over which I am
Lord.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Easie to the new nature,</hi> Rom. 7. 22. As the light of the
Sunne is delightsome to those that have good eyes, so the
service of God to those that are new creatures. It is as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
to the new creature to pray, as it is to the old-creature
to be drunke.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Easie to those that have the aid of Gods Spirit.</hi> As it is easie
for a child to goe up stairs when his father leads him up.
So when led by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Easie to those that are in Christ.</hi> And therefore Christ
saith, <hi>Take up my yoake.</hi> Christ cals it <hi>his yoake.</hi> Because he
drawes it with us, and he drawes all. As it is easie for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
child to life up a great weight, when a Giant holds his
hand, and lifts with him and for him.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Easie to those that love God,</hi> 1 John 5. 3. <hi>Iacob</hi> for the
love of <hi>Rachell</hi> accounted lightly of his service. Love adds
wings to make our service easie.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Easie to those that have the right art of serving of God.</hi>
As in all trades almost there is an Art, which when we have
once got the trade is easie. So there is an art of praying and
preaching, and hearing and receiving the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
An art taught us by the God of Heaven, which whosoever
hath, accounts it not a burden, but a heaven, to be serving
of God.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Easie to those that have the consolations of Gods Spirit in
the service of God.</hi> As Merchants doe ordinarily give a tast
of their wines to those to whom they sell them, that so they
may be invited to buy them. So God doth give a taste of
Heaven to his servants in his service, a <hi>praelibamen</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54330:24"/>
to invite them to serve him more cheerfully. A Hound
is never weary as long as he hath the sent of the Hare. No
more is a servant of God, as long as he enjoyeth God in his
service.</p>
            <p>10. <hi>Easie in regard of what it might have been.</hi> Thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
have bin in hell at this instant, past worshipping God,
suffering everlasting torments.</p>
            <p>11. <hi>Easie to doe what God for Christ sake in the Covenant of
grace well accept, though not to doe what God requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. <hi>Easie in regard of the great reward, the exceeding great
reward that God will give to his servant. Finis dat amabilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,
&amp; facilitatem medijs.</hi> The end proposed to a worke
makes the worke amiable and easie. Where the reward is
fullnesse and perpetuity of happinesse, no service can be said
to be hard, to purchase such a reward.</p>
            <p>All this is spoken that none might be deterred from the
service of God upon a false supposall of the difficulty and
impossibility of it. And it is my earnest prayer that these
motives might perswade us, not only to serve God, but to
serve him with all the Ingredients.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> observes, God was never called <hi>Lord,</hi> till man
was made. He is the <hi>peculiar Lord of man.</hi> O let man be his
chiefe servant. All creatures in their course serve God.
None but <hi>man</hi> and <hi>Devils</hi> deny it. And <hi>how just is it for God
to joyne him with the Devils in punishment, that joynes with the
Devill in dishonouring of God.</hi> Remember when we come to
judgement this will be the great Question Christ will put to
us, not to aske us, <hi>what money we have got, what honours
we have purchased?</hi> But what service have you done to me
and for me? This is the end for which thou wert created.
Christ will aske whether this be done? And if not done,
thou art undone. When Christ came to die he said, <hi>Iohn</hi>
17. 3, 4. <hi>Father glorifie me for I have glorified thee.</hi> Happy is
that man that when he comes to die can make this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54330:24"/>
Father I have fought a good fight, I have made it
my worke to doe thee service, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are many that
can plead, <hi>Father I have dishonoured thy Name, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
glorifie me!</hi> But this is a false argument. Let us labour
to make Christs prayer in sincerity and faithfulnes.<note place="margin">Use of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in particular.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But now I come to apply my self to great men, and noble
men in particular. Let me speak unto you in <hi>Davids</hi> words,
Psal. 29. 1, 2. <hi>Give unto the Lord O ye mighty, give unto the
Lord glory and strength, give unto the Lord the glory due to his
Name.</hi> And let me use <hi>Davids</hi> reason, <hi>Psa. 29. 5. The voice
of the Lord breaketh the Cedars, yea the Lord breaketh the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars
of</hi> Lebanon. As the higher the Tree is, the more it is
exposed to the thunder of Heaven. So the greater any
man is, the sooner God will punish him if he be a Giant in
iniquity. <hi>For he bindeth Kings in chaines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 149 8.</note> 
               <hi>and Nobles in linkes
of Iron. He toucheth the Mountaines and they smoake.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ps. 104. 32</note> If thou
beest as a <hi>Mountaine</hi> in greatnesse, and thy sinnes as <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi>
in greatnesse, God will make thee smoake, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Great
men must labour to be like the great God, who is as great
in goodnesse, as in greatnesse. <hi>Deus optimus maximus,</hi> like
unto <hi>Iob,</hi> who was the <hi>greatest man in the East, and the best
man in the East.</hi> O that I could engage great men this day in
sense of Gods goodnesse, expressed in this wonderfull De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
(for which weare come to blesse God) to serve
God with all the Ingredients for the time to come, better
then ever they have done for the time past. Oh that you
would enter into a solemne Covenant to sweare no more,
to commit adultery no more, to be irreverent, negligent,
cold, hypocriticall in Gods service no more, to mock and
scoffe at Gods servants no more. <hi>Greatnes</hi> without <hi>goodnesse</hi>
is like the <hi>greatnesse of a dropsie man,</hi> it is <hi>thy disease,</hi> not <hi>thy
ornament. Riches</hi> without <hi>righteousnesse</hi> is like a <hi>golden ring
in a Swines snout,</hi> like a <hi>Sword</hi> in a mad mans hand, like an <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corns
horne,</hi> which while it is upon the head of the Unicorne
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54330:25"/>
is hurtfull and deadly, but when it is taken off, it is very use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and medicinall. Honours and riches when in a wicked
mans custody, they do much hurt, but when bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
good men, they doe much good. It is a most blessed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction,
when <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> meet together.
It is like a <hi>precious Diamond in a gold-ring.</hi> Indeed <hi>Religion</hi>
is good wheresoever it is. As a pearle is good though it be
in the dirt, it is a pearle, but it is obscured by the dirt in
which it is. When <hi>goodnesse</hi> is seated in a poore man, it is
like a <hi>jewell in a leaden ring,</hi> like a candle under a bushell.
But when <hi>goodnesse</hi> meets with <hi>greatnesse,</hi> it is like a <hi>Candle</hi>
upon a <hi>hill</hi> that gives <hi>light, heat and influence to all the Country
round about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let no great man thinke it a</hi> disparagement <hi>to serve God,
to weare his livery, and to appeare on his side. For it is
Gods service onely that can make you truly honourable.</hi>
Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast bin honourable,
<hi>saith the Prophet</hi> Isaiah 43. 4. The men of <hi>Beraea</hi> were more
noble then the men of <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> because they received the
word with all readinesse of mind, and searched into the Scriptures
daily, whether those things were so, <hi>Act. 17. 11. This is the
greatest Nobility to be a true servant of the great God. A</hi>
King <hi>may give</hi> great Titles <hi>to a</hi> great man, <hi>but he cannot</hi>
make a great man. <hi>A</hi> King <hi>may cause a man to be called</hi>
noble, <hi>but he cannot make a man</hi> truly noble. <hi>A</hi> King <hi>may
command us to call a</hi> Lion <hi>a</hi> Lambe; <hi>but a</hi> King <hi>cannot make
a</hi> Lion <hi>a</hi> Lambe. <hi>It is the</hi> noble mind <hi>that makes a man</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
noble. <hi>This God onely can give.</hi> To contemne the world
and all worldly things, to mind the things of eternity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
our lusts, to have communion with the great God, to stand
for God when all the world opposeth him, this is true nobility. This
will make thee noble in this world, and in the world that is to
come.</p>
            <p>I say againe, Let no great man account it a <hi>disparagement</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:54330:25"/>
to be Gods servant. Let him not only consider the example
of <hi>Ioshua</hi> a Prince and Ruler, and of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> before
named, but also of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, who was so atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to the word when it was preached and so reverent, as
that he would sometimes stand up (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> saith) all
the while. And when his Courtiers rebuked him, saying,
It would tend to his disparagement; He answered: <hi>That it
was in the service of the great God, who is no respecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
Take the example of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> who is reported to
have written out the New-Testament with his owne hand,
accounting it as a speciall Jewell, and out of it, he read e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day praying with his Empresse, and with his sister sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Psalmes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Suffer me to adde the third time, Let not great men
thinke it a <hi>disparagement</hi> to become Gods servants, and to
serve him strictly and precisely.<note place="margin">Revel. 19. 20.</note> If these examples will
not move you, consider the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven, who are our
<hi>Fellow-servants,</hi> and are said by a kind of excellency,<note place="margin">Psal. 103. 20.</note> 
               <hi>To
doe his Commandements, hearkning to the voice of his word.</hi>
The <hi>Angels</hi> serve God with a great deale of <hi>alacrity and
chearefullnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 15. 2.</note> and therefore they are said to have <hi>harpes,</hi> as
a signe of their chearefull mind. The Angels serve God
with a great deale of <hi>diligence and sedulity.</hi> And therefore
they are said to have <hi>wings</hi> and <hi>to fly.</hi> They serve God with
a great deale of zeale and ardency, and therefore they are
said to be a <hi>flaming fire.</hi> And therefore also the title of a <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphim</hi>
is given unto them. The Angels serve <hi>God univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally.
They follow the Lambe wheresoever he goeth;</hi> They
serve him <hi>constantly, sincerely.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 14. 4.</note> 
               <hi>The Angels alwaies behold his
face,</hi> Mat. 18. 10. They <hi>serve him day and night,</hi> Revel. 7.
15. Oh that the Lord would make you more and more An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall
in his service, to doe his will upon earth, as it is done
in Heaven!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let me adde an example beyond all examples, even the</hi>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:54330:26"/>
example of Iesus Christ <hi>himselfe, who is called</hi> Gods servant,
<hi>Esa. 42. 1. And he was a</hi> worshipper of God, <hi>Joh. 4. 22. A</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
keeper of Gods Sabbath, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 16. He used Praier in his
familie, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 18. He was wont to pray secretly by himselfe
<hi>Luk.</hi> 5. 16. And he used this custome of Prayer morning and
evening. In the morning, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 35. rising up a great while
before daie. And for evening, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 23. And this was his
custome to doe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 39. He went as he was wont to the
Mount of Olives. And sometimes he would pray all night long,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 12. And this worship Christ did with as much submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and devotion as ever any servant did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 41. <hi>Mat.</hi>
26. 39.</p>
            <p>If Christ did all this, surely it is no dishonour for the
greatest Emperour to doe that which Christ hath done. As
you are called Christians, so you must imitate that Lord
and Master, by whose name you are called.</p>
            <p>Let no man wonder that I spend so much time to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
great men to be <hi>exemplary</hi> in Gods service, and to be
diligent and zealous. For if I could convert but one great
man this day,<note place="margin">Florus.</note> I should doe a great deale of service by way
of eminency. For as he said, <hi>In uno Caesare multi insunt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rij,</hi>
in one great man there are many inferiours contained.
As it is in <hi>Printing,</hi> the great difficulty is in printing the <hi>first
Sheetes,</hi> and when one is printed, it is easie to print hundreds
by that. So the great worke of our Ministery is to convert
great-men, if they were once converted, hundreds would
follow their example; <hi>When the great wheele of a Clocke
is set a moving all the inferiour wheeles will move of their own
accord.</hi> This was the reason why St. <hi>Paul</hi> was so zealous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the conversion of <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> who was <hi>Deputy</hi> of
the Country, and a <hi>prudent man,</hi> that when <hi>Elymas</hi> the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerer
offered to withstand him, he burst out into such spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with such eagernesse, as he never did at any time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for ought we can reade, <hi>Oh thou child of the Devill,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54330:26"/>
thou enemy of all righteousnesse,</hi> &amp;c. And some are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that <hi>Paul</hi> had his name changed from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 13. 10</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he converted <hi>Sergius Paulus.</hi> For indeed it is a matter
of great consequence to convert one <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> one
<hi>Eunuch.</hi> To take one such <hi>great fish</hi> is more then to take ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
little ones, though the least of all is not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
            <p>There is one argument yet behind, the last, but not the
least, and that is from the <hi>holy and solemn Covenant</hi> you late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have taken to amend <hi>your lives.</hi> The excellency of a
Christian is not so much in <hi>taking a Covenant as in keeping
of it when taken.</hi> And therefore we reade of <hi>Iosiah,</hi> 2 Chro.
34. 31, 32. that he did not onely <hi>make a Covenant to walke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Lord, and to keepe his Commandements with all his heart,</hi>
&amp;c. but he <hi>caused all that were present in</hi> Jerusalem <hi>and</hi> Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
<hi>to stand to it.</hi> For if that man shall never goe to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
that will not <hi>keepe his promises though made to his hurt,</hi>
how much more shall they be barr'd from Heaven that <hi>break
those promises that they have made tending to their eternall good.</hi>
To breake <hi>Covenant</hi> is not only a <hi>brand</hi> of a <hi>Reprobate,</hi> (as
you have heard) but it is also a sinne that God hath a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
against, and a sinne for which he will be avenged, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to that Text, Levit. 26. 25. <hi>And I will bring a Sword
upon you, that shall avenge the quarrell of my Covenant.</hi> And
this is one great reason why the Sword is now drawne in
<hi>England,</hi> and hath sucked so much bloud, even to avenge
the great breach of <hi>Oaths and Covenants,</hi> which this Nation
is deepely guilty of. Let me make bold further to remind
you, that in this Covenant you have also vowed, <hi>in order
to the preservation of them, to assist the forces raised by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
according to your power and vocation, and not to assist
the forces raised by the King, neither directly nor indirectly.</hi> And
I doubt not but you will make conscience to satisfie these
two clauses, and herein you shall expresse the reality of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54330:27"/>
your thanks for this great deliverance this day celebrated.
Now because the <hi>speedy, faithfull and couragious appearance
in this great Cause of defensive Armes,</hi> is one of the highest
<hi>expressions</hi> that you can yeeld to the world of your <hi>love to
God and his Gospell, and to his service;</hi> Give me leave to
speake something about it, not only by way of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but first by way of <hi>Commendation,</hi> then <hi>Exhortation,</hi>
then by way of <hi>Incouragement,</hi> and then I shall conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, By way of <hi>Commendation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Suffer me to speake that which is due to you,<note place="margin">Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</note> and not in
mine own words, but to speake the sense of all the well-affected
in the Kingdome; We blesse God, that though
there are many <hi>fallen Starres,</hi> many <hi>Lords</hi> that have deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that yet you <hi>(Right Honourable)</hi> stand
firme like <hi>fixed Starres</hi> in your <hi>Orbes,</hi> and have taken <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied
paines</hi> for the good of the Church and State, and
have <hi>ventured all</hi> for your Religion and Liberties, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of you lost a great part of your revenewes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and have passed many <hi>Ordinances</hi> very advantageous
to the Kingdome.<note place="margin">Kingdom.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord be blessed for all the good you
have done! The Lord recompence it to you and yours! The Lord
grant you may find mercy from the Lord at that great day!</hi> It
is not the designe of the well-affected party to take away
<hi>Temporall Lordships,</hi> or the distinction between <hi>Lords</hi> and
<hi>Commons,</hi> and to bring all to a popular equality. This is
an <hi>Anabaptisticall fury.</hi> I protest against it in the Name of
all the Well-affected Ministers. Indeed we would be glad
to be rid of <hi>Spirituall Lords over our consciences.</hi> But as for
Temporall Lords, we pray with <hi>David, The Lord give
you good successe, Ride on and prosper.</hi>
               <note place="margin">A sixe-fold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in particular.</note> Thus much for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
            <p>Now for Exhortation,</p>
            <p>Let me exhort you not only to choose to serve God, and
to serve his Church and his Cause in this most just <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54330:27"/>
Warre,</hi> but to doe it with those rare and remarkeable
circumstances formerly mentioned in <hi>Ioshuas</hi> choise.</p>
            <p>First, Let me perswade you to appeare more and more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
               <hi>publikely</hi> in this Cause. There are many that thinke it fit
onely for poore men that have nothing to loose, to appeare
openly in a good Cause, but as for those that have great
Estates, it becomes them to be wary and circumspect, and
to seeke rather to save their Estates then to hazard all.
Such a one was <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that came to Christ by night,
though afterwards he repented and amended, as you may
reade, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 50, Such were those chiefe Rulers, <hi>Ioh.</hi>
12. 42, <hi>That beleeved in Christ, but durst not confesse
him so feare of the Pharisees, least they should be put out
of the Synagogue.</hi> And many such there are in our dayes.
But a true <hi>Christian</hi> is so far from being hindred by his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and greatnesse from appearing for <hi>God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 10. 37.</note> that he is glad
that he hath riches and Honours to loose for God, <hi>he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
joyfully the spoiling of his goods.</hi> He willingly parts
with all for Christs Cause. And if you aske him why he
doth so, he will answer with <hi>Paulinus Nolanus, Vt levius
ascenderet scalam Iacobi,</hi> That he might goe the lighter to
Heaven. He saith as that famous Noble-man <hi>Hormisdas</hi>
did, who when he was deposed from all his Honours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would not forsake his Religion, and afterwards
restored to his Honours again, and then commanded by the
King of <hi>Persia</hi> to renounce his profession. Answered, <hi>Si prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ista me denegaturum Christum put as, ist a denuo acoipe.</hi> If you
thinke I will deny Christ for to keepe my Honours,<note place="margin">Lib. 8. Consess.</note> take
them all back againe. S. <hi>Austin</hi> in his Confessions relates
an excellent Story of one <hi>Victorinus</hi> a great man at <hi>Rome</hi>
that had many great friends that were Heathen, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to convert him to the Christian Religion, and he
comes to one <hi>Simplicianus,</hi> and tells him secretly that he
was a <hi>Christian. Simplicianus</hi> answers, <hi>Non credam, nec de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putabo
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54330:28"/>
te inter Christianos, nisi in Ecclesiâ Christi te videro.</hi>
I will not beleeve thee to be a <hi>Christian,</hi> till I see you open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
professe it in the Church. At first <hi>Victorinus</hi> derided
his answer, and said, <hi>Ergone parietes faciunt Christianum?</hi>
Doe the walls make a Christian? But afterwards remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
and often pondering that Text of our Saviour, <hi>He
that is ashamed of me before men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark. 8. 38.</note> 
               <hi>I will be ashamed of him before
my Father,</hi> &amp;c. he returnes to <hi>Simplicianus,</hi> and professeth
himselfe openly in the Church to be a Christian. Let this
Text of Christ alwayes sound in our eares, <hi>He that is asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of me,</hi> &amp;c. And that Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 8. where the <hi>feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>
are put in the fore-front of those that shall goe to Hell,
before <hi>murderers, whoremongers and Idolaters,</hi> &amp;c. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
also the publikenesse of <hi>Ioshuas</hi> choice.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Let me exhort you to goe on more and more
<hi>resolutely</hi> in this great Cause. <hi>Therefore my beloved bretheren
be ye stedfast, unmoveable, alwayes abounding in the worke
of the Lord, forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in
vaine in the Lord.</hi> It is not enough to doe the worke of the
Lord, and to abound in it, but we must doe it <hi>stedfastly and
unmoveably, stedfastly</hi> as a Tree fastned in the ground, that
is not removed though the winds blow never so much;
<hi>unmoveable</hi> as a Rock in the Sea, that stands fast though
the Sea rageth and roareth round about it. For there are
so many, and so mighty <hi>Anakims</hi> and <hi>Zanzummims</hi> that are
your enemies, so many <hi>temptations</hi> both of the right hand
and of the left, both <hi>flattering and frowning, fiery tryalls,
and golden Apples.</hi> So many mountaines of opposition
lying in your way, that unlesse you be indued with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
grace of spirituall resolution, you will never be able
to doe God any service in thesetimes. But this admirable
grace of divine fortitude and Christian resolution, will
make you like <hi>a wall of brasse,</hi> to beate backe all the arrowes
of strong perswasion, that are shot against you. This is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54330:28"/>
of proofe,</hi> against all kind of temptations. This is as
the <hi>ballast of a Ship,</hi> to keepe you steddy in this great Cause,
without which you will be <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>men of double-minds

that rouled away the stone from before the doore of the

Excellent is the Story of S. <hi>Basill.</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> sent to
him to subscribe to the <hi>Arrian Heresie.</hi> The Messenger at
first gave him good language, and promised him great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment
if he would turne <hi>Arrian.</hi> To which <hi>Basill</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.
<hi>Alas, these speeches are fit to catch little children
withall that looke after such things; but we that are nourished and

deaths, then to suffer one syllable or title of the Scripture to be
altered.</hi> The Messenger offended with his boldnesse, told
him he was mad. He answered. <hi>Opto me in aeternum sic de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirare,</hi>
I wish I were for ever thus mad! Here was a <hi>stout
Cedar.</hi> Such another was <hi>Luther, Vnus homo solus totius
orbis impetum sustinuit, Luther</hi> alone opposed all the world.
Such another was <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> who met with so much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that had he not bin steeled by a strong and obstinate
resolution, he could never have rebuilded the Temple, but
would have sunke in the midst of it. Such a one was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
that would not be hindered from fighting with <hi>Goliah</hi>
though he met with many discouragements. The Lord
make you such. It is <hi>resolution</hi> that will make you <hi>valiant</hi>
for the truth,<note place="margin">Ier. 9. 2.</note> that will make <hi>Martyrdome</hi> as pleasing as a
<hi>bed of Roses,</hi> that will make you like <hi>men of fire,</hi> and all that
oppose you as <hi>stubble,</hi> that will make you say with that
<hi>good Martyr, Though we had as many lives as haires on our
head, we would loose them all rather then loose our Religion.</hi> The
Lord fill your hearts with this grace!</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I am to beseech you that you would indeavour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:54330:29"/>
to approve your selves more and more <hi>faithfull to this
Cause.</hi> It is with us as it was with <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
the great worke of rebuilding the Temple, he
was opposed by great men especially. The <hi>Nobles of</hi> Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koah
<hi>refused to put their necks to the yoake of the Lord.</hi> This is
an eternall brand upon them, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3. 5. Many of the
<hi>Nobles of Iudah,</hi> did seeme to helpe <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> but they
kept secret <hi>correspondency with Tobiah,</hi> and tarried with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah</hi>
only to give private intelligence to the enemy, and
to weaken his hands from going on in the worke, <hi>Neh. 6.
17.</hi> Thus it was in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> dayes. And this is one of
the miseries of Civill Warre above all other kinds of
Warre: For there are alwayes some false brethren, some
<hi>Iudasses</hi> in civill Warre. But I beleeve better things of you.
The Lord make you more and more faithfull to his Cause!
Remember what became of <hi>Iudas</hi> for his treachery.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Suffer me to put you in mind of the <hi>speedinesse
of</hi> Joshuas <hi>choice. Ioshua</hi> had not his Religion to choose, and
therefore he did not demurre upon his choice. Me thinks
I heare the whole Kingdome beseeching you greatly and
saying as the Ruler did to Christ in another case,<note place="margin">Mark. 5. 23.</note> 
               <hi>The
Kingdome lieth at the point of death, make haste, oh make haste
to heale us. The whole Kingdome is on fire, make haste to quench
the flames that our sinnes have kindled.</hi> Nothing will destroy
<hi>England</hi> more then delay.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Let me perswade you to doe <hi>some extraordinary
service for the Kingdome that is now in extraordinary danger.
Ioshuas</hi> choice was extraordinary. Though all <hi>Israel</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke
God, <hi>Ioshua</hi> was resolved to serve God alone. God
hath done <hi>extraordinary things</hi> for you, he hath advanced
you above thousands in outward mercies, hee hath
done extraordinary things for this Cause which you stand
up for, he hath given us an <hi>extraordinary deliverance this
day,</hi> and therefore he expects extraordinary service from

your hearts, and reade it againe and againe. <hi>Thinke not with
your selves that you shall escape in the Kings house, more then all
the</hi> Jewes, <hi>for if you altogether hold your peace, enlargement and
deliverance shall arise to the</hi> Jewes <hi>from another place, but you
and your fathers houses shall be destroyed, and who knoweth whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are come to the Kingdome for such a time as this?</hi>
He lookes you should venture your selves as <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimathea</hi>
did,<note place="margin">Mat. 27. 57. 58.</note> of whom it is related, that he was a <hi>rich man</hi>
and yet was not afraid to owne the cause of <hi>Christ,</hi> when
<hi>Christ</hi> was dead upon the Crosse, <hi>He went to</hi> Pilate <hi>and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the body of Iesus.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier 38. 7. Gen. 6.</note> He expects you should be like <hi>Ebed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech</hi>

like to <hi>Noah</hi> who <hi>walked with God</hi> when all the world <hi>wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

and yet continued his heate.</hi> Like to <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 22.</note> who when
<hi>Michal</hi> mocked him for dancing before the Arke, answered,
<hi>It is before the Lord, and I will yet be more vile then thus,</hi> &amp;c.
When you are derided for hazarding lives and estates in
this cause, you must reply. <hi>It is for God and his Religion, I
will yet be more vile then thus.</hi> Oh that the Lord would give
you a heart to study to doe some singular thing for him!</p>
            <p>Sixthly, You must doe all this, not onely <hi>in your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/>
but <hi>you and your houses, you and your Tenants, you and all

accountable to God for his family as well as for himselfe;
For these publike <hi>relations, and subordinations of Master and

and are parts of our <hi>Stewardship,</hi> for which we must give a
severe account. And it is a certaine rule, <hi>That man is not
a good man, that is not good in all his relations.</hi> For there are
<hi>duties</hi> required of us by God in every relation (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
as Fathers, as Magistrates, as Parliament-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:54330:30"/>
The same <hi>God</hi> that requires us to serve him as <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
requires us to serve him in our <hi>relations,</hi> and though
thou beest never so carefull of thy duty as a private person,
yet thou mayest goe to Hell for neglecting thy duty as a
<hi>Master,</hi> as a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as a <hi>Parliament-man.</hi> And although
thou shouldest be good in one relation, yet if thou doest not
indeavour to be good in <hi>every relation,</hi> thou shalt never goe
to Heaven. For the same God that commands thee to serve
him as a <hi>Master,</hi> commands thee to serve him as a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-man,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>And he that keepes the whole Law, and offends
in one point is guilty of all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iam. 2. 10.</note> Here is a <hi>Sea</hi> of matter offers it
selfe, and matter of great concernement for the regulating
of <hi>Noble-mens families,</hi> which are in many places rather
<hi>Beth-avens</hi> then <hi>Bethels;</hi> houses of iniquity rather then
houses of God. But I must not launch into this Ocean;
Onely remember that in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> when the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Family was converted,</hi> all the family was baptized,
and what God saith of <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. 19. and what
<hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 181. 2, 3, 6, 7. and what is said, <hi>Exod. 20.
11. Thou and thy servant.</hi> Thus much for the Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
            <p>Now for <hi>Incouragement;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is great need to incourage <hi>Noble-men</hi> that set
their faces to looke after Christ, and to serve him after a
strict and holy manner, and that venture all in this Cause,
to goe on maugre all opposition. For we live in times
wherein we may take up that complaint of <hi>Salvian, Si quis
ex nobilitate converti ceperit ad Deum, statim honorem Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
amittit: Oh quantus est in populo Christiano honor Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti,
ubi Religio ignobilem facit! &amp; mali coguntur esse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles
ne viles habeantur.</hi> If any of the Nobility begin to
be converted to God, presently they begin to loose (in
the eye of the wicked) all the honour of their Nobility.
How little is the Name of Christ esteemed amongst those
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:54330:30"/>
Christians where Religion makes a man ignoble, and men
are compelled to be wicked, that they may be accounted
Noble. A true picture of our wicked times. Suffer me
therefore to offer unto you these following incouragements,
as helpes against all the discouragements you meet withall
in the zealous and resolute prosecution of this great cause
now in hand.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>The cause you manage is an</hi> incouraging cause. <hi>It is the</hi>
cause of God. <hi>And let me say to you as</hi> Luther <hi>to</hi> Melancthon.
If the cause be not Gods, why doe ye not wholly desert it, but if
it be Gods cause, why doe you not goe through with it. <hi>This is a</hi>
Dilemma <hi>that cannot be evaded. The glory of God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
in the same Ship in which this cause is in. And you
may lawfully plead with God, as</hi> Ioshua <hi>doth,</hi> Iosh. 7. 9. <hi>and
as</hi> Moses <hi>doth,</hi> Numb. 14. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>You have an</hi> incouraging God, <hi>me thinkes I heare
God say to you as he doth to</hi> Ioshuah 1. 6. Be strong and of a
good courage, <hi>&amp;c. and verse</hi> 7. Onely be thou strong and very
couragious, <hi>&amp;c. And verse</hi> 9. Have not I commanded thee,
Be strong and of a good courage, be not afraid, neither be thou
dismaied, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whithersoever thou
goest. <hi>And as</hi> Ioshuah <hi>said to the people of</hi> Israel, <hi>Numb.
14. 7. So doth God to you.</hi> Feare not the people of the Land,
for they are bread for us, their defence is departed from them and
the Lord is with us, feare them not. <hi>And as</hi> Moses <hi>said, Exo.
14. 13, 14. So saith God, though your enemies be as tall as
the</hi> Anakims: <hi>though the</hi> red Sea <hi>be before you, and the</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians
<hi>behind you, feare them not, for</hi> the Lord fights
for you. <hi>The God whose cause you manage is infinite in</hi>
power, wisdom <hi>and</hi> goodnesse, <hi>he hath brought us into deeps,
not to drowne us, but to wash away our spirituall filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
not to destroy us, but to manifest his power in our
deliverance; he will deliver us by</hi> weake meanes, <hi>and by</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
meanes, <hi>and he will make use of the treachery of your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:54330:31"/>
enemies to be a meanes to deliver you, as he hath done</hi> this
day. He will kill Goliah with his owne Sword, and hang <hi>Haman</hi>
upon his owne gallows. He will strike strait stroakes with crooked
sticks; <hi>as he made the treachery of</hi> Iosephs <hi>brethren to be a
meanes to advance</hi> Ioseph, <hi>and the</hi> falsenesse of <hi>Judas to be a
way to save all his elect children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. You have <hi>incouraging Promises,</hi> Exod. 23. 22, 23. Levit.
26. 6, 7, 8. Deut. 28. 7. 1 Sam. 25. 28. Isa. 41. 10, 11, 12, 13,
14, 15, 16, 17. Isa. 54. 17. A Text common to all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
because it is said to be <hi>the heritage of the servants of the
Lord.</hi> Here are six Texts like six pillars to undershore our
spirits from falling into discouragements. Cast your selves
into the bosome of these Promises.</p>
            <p>4. You have <hi>incouraging examples.</hi> For we cannot be in
a lower condition then <hi>Ionah</hi> was, when he was in the
Whales belly, <hi>tanquam vivus in sepulchro,</hi> and yet God
commanded the Whale to deliver him safe upon the shoare.
We cannot be in a worser estate then <hi>Ieremy</hi> was when he
was in the dungeon, and sanke in the mire so deepe, as that
30. men could hardly lift him up; or then <hi>Peter</hi> was when
he was ready to sinke: or then <hi>Moses</hi> when put in an <hi>Arke
of bull-rushes,</hi> &amp;c. Or then the children of <hi>Israel</hi> were in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi>
who were like dry bones in the grave, insomuch as
<hi>Ezekiell</hi> himselfe could not tell whether they could live, or
as <hi>Peter</hi> when put in prison by <hi>Herod.</hi> And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
God sent a <hi>blackmore</hi> to deliver <hi>Ieremy. Iesus Christ</hi>
reached out his hand to keepe <hi>Peter</hi> from sinking. God sent
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter to preserve <hi>Moses:</hi> And <hi>Cyrus</hi> to deliver
<hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Babylon.</hi> And he sent his Angell to deliver <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
out of prison. Indeed <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe did not believe it,
no more did the Church that was praying for him. God
sent them a returne of prayers, while they were praying,
but they beleeved it not. And thus God hath often done
for us. Comfort one another with these examples, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:54330:31"/>
carry this home for your everlasting consolation. <hi>God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
suffers his children to meet with a huge unremoveable diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
like the stone before the doore of the Sepulcher, but he sends
some Angell or other to remove it away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. You have an <hi>incouraging Captaine,</hi> even the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
who is the great <hi>Peace-maker, Who is our peace when the
Assyrian is in the Land,</hi> Micah 7. 9. He hath taken downe
the partition wall, he hath made our peace with God. Let
the <hi>deepes of our civill warre</hi> call upon the <hi>deepes of peace that
are in Christ.</hi> Let us beseech the great <hi>Peace-maker</hi> to take
downe the <hi>great partition wall betweene King and Parliament,</hi>
to make Father and Sonne of one mind. If Christ makes
the peace, it must needs be good. Jesus Christ came into
the world, when the Jewes were in the saddest conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the depth of slavery (for the Scepter was departed
from <hi>Iudah</hi>) and in the <hi>depth of divisions,</hi> for they had so
many severall Sects, as they could hardly tell what Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they were off. In this sad condition <hi>Shiloh</hi> came. Let
us beseech Jesus Christ to come into <hi>England</hi> in this low e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and to bring peace with him, even that Christ who
<hi>descended into the lowest parts of the Earth for our sakes, and
whose love is a depth that cannot be fathomed,</hi> Ephes. 3. 17, 18.
The <hi>deepes</hi> of our misery call upon the <hi>depth</hi> of his <hi>love and
mercy,</hi> that God for Christ sake would pardon our abysse
of sinnes both <hi>personall and nationall,</hi> and bring us out of our
<hi>abysse</hi> of miseries, both <hi>personall and nationall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. You have <hi>incouraging company,</hi> you have the <hi>Lord of
Hosts</hi> to accompany you, and I may say without the least
degree of uncharitablenes, you have the major part of Gods
people on your side.</p>
            <p>7. You have <hi>incouraging weapons,</hi> prayers and teares, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
and humiliation. As <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake to <hi>Austins</hi> mother
by way of incouragement. <hi>That a Sonne of so many teares
could not miscarry.</hi> So may I say and I hope proove a true
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:54330:32"/>
Prophet, <hi>That a Nation of so many prayers and teares shall not
be destroyed,</hi> God never yet destroyed a Nation, wherein
there were so many of his <hi>children praying, fasting, humbling
themselves,</hi> and especially at such a time, when they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring
into a <hi>solemne Covenant</hi> of reforming their lives (as now
we are) if they indeavour to doe these things with all their
<hi>heart and soule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8. You have <hi>incouraging threatnings</hi> against the enemies
of Gods Church. God hath threatned, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 2, 3, 6. to
make Jerusalem <hi>a cup of poyson,</hi> and all that offer to swallow
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall be poysoned with it, to <hi>make</hi> Jerusalem <hi>a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome
stone,</hi> and all that thinke to crush <hi>Ierusalem</hi> shall be
crushed by Jerusalem; <hi>to make him like a fire, and all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
like wood to be devoured by him.</hi> God hath threatned
concerning the plots of your enemies, <hi>Psalm. 64. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10. This Scripture is this day fulfilled in your eares. The Lord
give us grace to declare his works, and wisely to consider of his
doings.</hi> God hath likewise accomplished those two rare
Scriptures, <hi>Psal. 7. 14, 15, 16, 17. Psal.</hi> 9. 15, 16. Let us
adde our part, <hi>Let us praise the Lord according to his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
let us sing praise to the name of the Lord most high, Hig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaion,</hi>
Selah.</p>
            <p>9. You have the <hi>incouraging providence of God.</hi> The great
and wise God, who is our <hi>Father,</hi> hath from all eternity
decreed what shall be the issue of these warrs. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
done in the <hi>lower House of Parliament</hi> upon earth, but
what is decreed in the <hi>higher House of Parliament in Heaven.</hi>
All the <hi>lesser wheeles</hi> are ordered and over-ruled by the <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
wheeles.</hi> An excellent Story of a <hi>Young-man</hi> that was at
Sea in a mighty tempest, and when all the passengers were
at their wits end for feare, he onely was merry, and when
he was ask'd the reason of his mirth; he answered, <hi>That
the Pilot of the Ship was his Father, and he knew his Father
would have a care of him. Our heavenly Father</hi> is our <hi>Pilot,</hi> he
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:54330:32"/>
sits at the sterne, and though the Ship of the Kingdome be
ready to finke, yet be of good comfort,<note place="margin">Luk. 12. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Our Pilot will have
a care of us. Are not five sparrowes</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>sold for two
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God.</hi> One
sparrow is not worth halfe a farthing: You shall not have
halfe a farthings worth of harme, more then God hath
from all eternity decreed. God hath all ourenemies in a
<hi>chaine.</hi> And if a child saw a Lion or a Beare in his deare Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
hand chained, so as he might be secure his Father
could keepe the chaine from being burst, he would not be
afraid. And this we are sure God can doe. A 1000000.
<hi>Cyphars stand for nothing, unlesse a figure be joyned to them. All
men and devils are but cyphars without God. An hoast of men is
nothing without the Lord of hoast.</hi> The devill cannot goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
his tedder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi>
               <note place="margin">This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection &amp; answer was added to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to comfort us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the death of M. Ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, the newes of whose death came just to me, as I was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing the incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements from Gods provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> But God permits the enemy to exercise great cruelty
upon his own people, and to take away the lives of his choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
servants, witnes the <hi>Noble Lord Brooke,</hi> and now lately
that worthy Gentleman M. <hi>Hampden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Let us not be troubled that <hi>God permits</hi> our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to doe us so much hurt, but rather be comforted that
they can doe nothing, but what our <hi>wise and most loving
God permits, and fore-decrees for the good of his children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I answer with our blessed Saviour. <hi>Feare not them that
can but kill the body, and after that can do no more.</hi> It is no great
matter (in Christs opinion) to have the body killed. The
body is but the <hi>Cabinet,</hi> the <hi>Iewell</hi> is the soule. And if the
<hi>Iewell</hi> be safe in Heaven, no great matter to have the <hi>Cabinet</hi>
broken. It is said of King <hi>Iosiah,</hi> that he should goe to his
<hi>grave</hi> in <hi>peace,</hi> and yet he died in a <hi>battell. He that dyeth
with the peace of a good conscience, dieth in peace, though he be
killed in a battell. Blessed is the man that breaths out his last
breath in doing God service.</hi> He that dies <hi>fighting</hi> the <hi>Lords
battels</hi> dies a <hi>Martyr.</hi> An excellent thing for a <hi>Minister to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:54330:33"/>
die preaching, and a souldier die fighting.</hi> It is but <hi>winking
with our eyes</hi> (as the Martyr said) <hi>and we are presently in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi>
Blessed and twice blessed are those that die in the Lord,
and for the Lord.</p>
            <p>3. God many times takes away his choisest servants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we <hi>idolize</hi> them too much, as he did the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</hi>
And also because he would teach us <hi>to trust only to his
helpe, who will deliver us by weake instruments, when he takes
away strong and able Instruments, that he may have all the
glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, You have <hi>incouraging experiments.</hi> And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if any Nation under Heaven may reason from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and rely upon experiences this Nation may. God
hath delivered us from the <hi>Beare and the Lion,</hi> from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
navy</hi> in Eighty eight, and since from the <hi>Gun-pouder
Treason,</hi> from <hi>Civill warres</hi> betweene <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And when there was a designe to bring the Army
up against <hi>London,</hi> God did then deliver us. And when
we were in the <hi>valley of the red horse</hi> (as it is called) neare
<hi>Edge-hill,</hi> where the Enemy thought to have cast us downe
the Hill, as the <hi>Iewes</hi> would have served Christ, then God
did also deliverus. And for this cause we are here this
Day, to praise God for a wonderfull and miraculous
Deliverance. And therefore wee may confidently say
with the Apostle, 2 Corinth. 1. 10. <hi>Who delivered us this
day from so great a death and doth deliver, in whom wee
trust that he will yet deliver us.</hi> It is observable that
when <hi>Moses</hi> went up to the Mount to pray, hee tooke
the <hi>Rod</hi> of God in his hand. The reason is given, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
by that <hi>Rod</hi> God had formerly done wonderfull
things for his people; and the very sight of that <hi>Rod</hi>
did incourage <hi>Moses</hi> to trust in God from the experience
of his former goodnesse. Let us never goe to our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but let us carry the <hi>Rod</hi> of God in our hand and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54330:33"/>
heart. I meane the solemne and serious contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this dayes Deliverance, and of Gods former
wonderfull goodnesse, and let us say with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
2 Tim. 4. 17, 18. <hi>Notwithstanding the Lord
stood with me and strengthned me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and I was
delivered out of the mouth of the Lion. And the
Lord shall deliver me from every evill
worke, and will preserve me unto his
heavenly Kingdome; to whom
be glory for ever and ever.</hi>
Amen. Amen.</p>
