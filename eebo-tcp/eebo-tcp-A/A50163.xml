            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To my Much Honoured FRIENDS; The Pious and Valiant COMMANDERS, Of the FORCES now engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our <hi>Indian Enemies.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>A Request</hi> from One of <hi>you,</hi> was that which <hi>I</hi> esteemed a <hi>Command,</hi> for my <hi>Preaching</hi> of a Sermon fill'd with <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sils</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> to part of the Forces now under your auspicious Conduct. I was too dull to apprehend it either an <hi>Impudent</hi> or an <hi>Improper</hi> thing for me to do <hi>That,</hi> While I found a Minister (and Him none of the <hi>oldest</hi> neither) charged with a very great Solemnity, <hi>Preach the Word, Be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in season, out of season, WATCH thou in all things, fulfil the Ministry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49073:3"/>That which most wants an excuse is the <hi>Printing</hi> of it; which is a Service that I have not been so much a <hi>Voluntier</hi> unto. But the Reasons that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd my <hi>Labour</hi> in <hi>Preaching,</hi> which were, my <hi>Desire</hi> to save the <hi>Souls,</hi> and mend the <hi>Lives,</hi> and promote the Edification of those, for whom <hi>my Hearts Desire and Prayer to God,</hi> is, <hi>That they may be Happy;</hi> and my <hi>Ambition</hi> to Encounter and Abolish what I can, the <hi>Unchristian Temper</hi> of those who take advantage from the other Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Entanglements of the Country, to refuse do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their part in carrying on the <hi>Indian War;</hi> the <hi>same</hi> Reasons have procur'd my <hi>Consent</hi> to <hi>Printing</hi> of this Little Sermon.</p>
            <p>As I never can endure that mischievous Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, of making the first or chief Exercise after our Hearing, to be upon that Question, <hi>How did you like the Sermon to day</hi>? So <hi>I</hi> am not much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned about the Reception and Entertainment which may be given to <hi>this</hi> poor <hi>Sermon</hi> by the Readers of it. My not having more than half a day to prepare it in, made it incapable of being thus <hi>written,</hi> till since the Delivery of it; and it is now <hi>written,</hi> as near as well could be to what it was when <hi>Spoken</hi>: without many more <hi>Additions, I</hi> suppose, than may somewhat <hi>Ballance</hi> the <hi>Omissions made</hi> in the Transcription. The <hi>Substaneous</hi> and so much <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaneous</hi> uttering of a Sermon, indeed I am so far from accounting a matter of <hi>Applause,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> do esteem it <hi>Evil</hi> and <hi>Sinful,</hi> and never free from Blame, unless Gods <hi>Providence,</hi> and not our <hi>Election</hi> have made it <hi>Unavoidable</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor is any thing in the world
<pb facs="tcp:49073:3"/>
more fulsome and nauseous, than for a Preacher to value himself upon such a <hi>Crime,</hi> as <hi>his not spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much time in Study. I</hi> do therefore beg par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, that <hi>I</hi> offer you what is no <hi>better Studied;</hi> not without expectations, that whether <hi>you</hi> pardon me, or no, there are those that will make me run the <hi>Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets</hi> of their <hi>Censures</hi> for it; and yet had I never so much leisure for <hi>study,</hi> I would not, <hi>I</hi> could not offer you a more <hi>Needful Thing</hi> than the <hi>Matter,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I might offer you a more <hi>Curious</hi> thing than the <hi>Method</hi> of this Discourse. Accept the Sermon as a Little Messenger now sent into the <hi>Camp,</hi> after my <hi>Brethren,</hi> with a little <hi>parched Corn,</hi> to refresh them, against their Facing of the <hi>Philistines;</hi> and I beseech you, let none of them have their <hi>Anger</hi> so kindled, as to tell me, <hi>Why camest thou down hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? I know thy Pride;</hi> for give me leave to say it, <hi>What have I now done? is there not a Cause</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> It is the <hi>War of the Lord</hi> which you are now Engaged in: and it is the <hi>Help of the Lord,</hi> that we are at Home affectionately imploring for you. We have made a fair and just purchase of our Country from the Natives here; not encroaching on them after the <hi>Spanish Fashion,</hi> in any of their <hi>Properties</hi> and <hi>Possessions.</hi> Yet they are now mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesting of us in the Enjoyment of what <hi>our God</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>our Right</hi>) hath made <hi>our own;</hi> which my Pen cannot mention without <hi>Jehoshaphats</hi> Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>We destroy'd them not, but behold how
<pb facs="tcp:49073:4"/>
they Reward us, to come to cast us out of thy Possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. O our God, Wilt thou not Judge them? I</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>I</hi> am perswaded, and Confident, <hi>He will.</hi> But <hi>your</hi> Wisdom and Courage is now to be Employ'd in order thereunto; and we all wish you such large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>Both,</hi> as the <hi>matter does require.</hi> Yow are some of you, such as in the <hi>former War,</hi> ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as far as any men Alive; and the <hi>God of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> then blessed you, not only with <hi>safety,</hi> but with a <hi>success</hi> also, which we should be very <hi>unworthy</hi> if we should be <hi>unthankful</hi> for. As you have thereby learn'd what a Treacherous. Barbarous, Dangerous Enemy you have to deal withal; so you are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a gracious <hi>Invitation</hi> to Trust in God for your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>preservation</hi>; You may animate your selves with such an Hope as that, <hi>The Lord that delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me out of the paw of the Lion, and out of the paw of the Bear, He will also deliver me out of the Hands of the Philistine.</hi> Your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Deliverances whereof the <hi>Honourable Wounds</hi> upon some of you are perpetual Monitors and Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, are a Dish of <hi>Leviathans Heads</hi> well drest, for your Faith to feed upon. <hi>Feed</hi> and <hi>Fight</hi> now with a <hi>strong Faith;</hi> By <hi>That</hi> you may <hi>wax Valiant in fight,</hi> and <hi>turn to flight the Armies of the Aliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen!</hi> Your <hi>Forces</hi> are Happy in <hi>you;</hi> none of you being that Debauched sort of <hi>Captains,</hi> which will <hi>Drink</hi> and <hi>Swear</hi> and <hi>Curse</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> the Sabbath and at the same time give out that
<pb facs="tcp:49073:4"/>
Perilous Word of Command, <hi>Follow your Leader;</hi> alas, <hi>whither</hi> do they <hi>Lead</hi> them! But I assure my self that you are such as have long since Listed your selves under the <hi>Banner</hi> of the Lord Iesus Christ; [Let <hi>His Banner</hi> over you be <hi>Love</hi>!] and are concerned that all your <hi>men</hi> may under that Banner oppose the <hi>Lusts which war against their Souls</hi> 'Tis the design of this Publication that <hi>you</hi> may be as Happy, in your <hi>Forces</hi>; and that those <hi>For</hi> whom and <hi>With</hi> whom you are every day pouring out your Prayers to the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> may not want En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements to any of those Combates, in which you would see them all Victorious. You are in the Head of <hi>Companies,</hi> whom you are generously willing not only to <hi>Live,</hi> but also to Dy withal; and the chief thing that I am pursuing is, That whether Death <hi>join</hi> you to them, or <hi>part</hi> you from them, <hi>You may meet them all e're long at the Right-hand of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> I have had many Fears upon my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, lest the wonderful <hi>Deafness</hi> to, and <hi>Contempt</hi> of the Everlasting Gospel found in the <hi>Rising Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> here, may not cause the Lord Iesus to say, <hi>That He will not have pleasure in our young men;</hi> but that he will take them <hi>off,</hi> and lay them <hi>waste</hi> by the plagues of a destructive <hi>War.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent such <hi>Omens,</hi> may be motive enough unto <hi>many</hi> such endeavours as you are here treated with. May <hi>These</hi> Warnings reach some of them that had slighted too many others heretofore! I have done when I have told you, That I hope you have not all your <hi>Forces</hi> with you; all the <hi>praying people</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:49073:5"/>
have Embarked themselves with you, and assist your present Expedition. It was not at all Displeasing unto His Majesty, our most Gracious and Illustrious King <hi>WILLIAM,</hi> to hear those words in a Speech made unto Him by one concerned for us, <hi>It may be Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly spoken to Your Majesty, The very Prayers of your poor Subjects in</hi> New-England, <hi>may do Your Majesty as much Service as an Army of Forty Thousand Men.</hi> 'Twill surely be a satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction unto <hi>you,</hi> to think what an <hi>Army</hi> of Prayers (<hi>quasi manu facta,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expresses it) is every day besieging and beseeching of Heaven for your Prosperity. We are no ways tainted with a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Fancy, of I know not what, <hi>Protection</hi> to arise from the <hi>Bodies</hi> of the <hi>Dead Saints</hi> that are inhum'd among us; though a very <hi>Rich Crop</hi> of them will be afforded by this little Spot of Ground, at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the Just.</hi> 'Tis foretold of Antichrist, <hi>He shall honour the God of</hi> Mahuzim, <hi>besides,</hi> (for <hi>so</hi> I read it) <hi>the God which his Fathers knew not,: Besides,</hi> the Lord Iesus Christ whom they despise, our Neighbours, the <hi>French,</hi> like other Papists, have their <hi>Mahuzim,</hi> that is, their <hi>Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> or <hi>Guardians;</hi> and those are the <hi>Saints De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</hi> Hence even some of the <hi>Ancients</hi> (or shall I call them by a <hi>contrary</hi> Name? for, <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas seculi est Juventus mundi</hi>) themselves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times became so vain, as to count the Reliques of the <hi>Dead Saints,</hi> the <hi>Towers</hi> and <hi>Ramparts</hi> of the places that Enjoy'd them; and the <hi>Dead Bodies</hi> of two Apostles in the City made the Poet cry out,

            <p>WHEN there was made unto the famous and faithful <hi>Iohn</hi> of old, that Application whereof we have that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in Luc. 3.14. <hi>The Souldiers demanded of Him, saying, What shall we do?</hi> We find that He left them not without those Divine <hi>Words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>

Assembly, that they might hear a short Sermon adapted unto <hi>Their</hi> peculiar Circumstances. We are informed in the Sacred Pages, that in the Expedition of the <hi>Israelites</hi> against the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> There came down <hi>those that Handled the Pen of the Writer.</hi> 'Tis the unhappiness of the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which <hi>we</hi> are at this day concerned in, that our present and pressing Dangers involve every person some way in it. Even <hi>Scholars</hi> must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accompany or Encourage <hi>Souldiers</hi>; and they that have handled none but <hi>Pens,</hi> must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carry or sharpen <hi>Swords.</hi> We are in the <hi>Briars of</hi> a Perplexity, wherein, <hi>Omnis Home Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les est,</hi> Every man is in his way to <hi>bear Arms</hi>; and <hi>Those</hi> that I have to assist you with, I must fetch out of that <hi>Christian Panoply</hi> the Holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

            <p>The Text now offered unto your Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in the <hi>longest,</hi> and yet the <hi>sweetest</hi> of all the Psalms. 'Tis in a <hi>Psalm,</hi> which (as one saith) consisteth of words, <hi>Non tam Legenda quam Vivenda,</hi> to be <hi>Lived</hi> rather than <hi>Read</hi> or <hi>Heard</hi>;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49073:7"/>
a Psalm, which (as another says) is, <hi>Quanto rolixior eo prestantior,</hi> having an <hi>Excellency</hi> tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendent like its <hi>Prolixity</hi>; a Psalm which the wittiest of the Ancients in a Dream or Vision had presented unto him, as <hi>The Tree of Life in the midst of the Paradise of God</hi>; What shall I say more? a Psalm which well deserves to be set as the <hi>Preface</hi> of the Scripture, being the <hi>Encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Epitome</hi> of it all.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Coherence,</hi> and so an <hi>Analysis,</hi> of the several Paragraphs in the Psalm, is not sollicitously to be sought: the Regard had unto the Order and Number of the <hi>Hebrew Letters,</hi> throughout the whole, giving us cause to look for a Cohaerence of <hi>Letters</hi> rather than of <hi>Matters</hi> in it; however in our Context there seems to be some Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. We have here the Lovely <hi>David,</hi> that Eminent <hi>Servant</hi> and <hi>Souldier</hi> of the Lord, asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his own Integrity, against the Temptations of a <hi>Various Assault</hi>; an Assault both from <hi>Snares</hi> and <hi>Swords.</hi> He was Assaulted one while by <hi>Fraud</hi>; and as to the Temptations thereof he says, <hi>The Wicked have laid a Snare for me, yet I have not erred from thy Precepts.</hi> He was Assailied another while by <hi>Force</hi>; &amp; as to the Temptations thereof, he says, <hi>My soul is continually in my Hands; yet I do not forget thy Law.</hi> Suppose this incomparable General, now skulking and scow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring about the <hi>Woods,</hi> in the Wilderness of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine</hi>; pursued like a <hi>Patridge,</hi> by that bloody Fowler <hi>Saul,</hi> with all his cruel <hi>setting Dogs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

him. Suppose him, now in <hi>Arms,</hi> and <hi>thus Expressing</hi> of himself. Behold in our Text:</p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Affliction</hi> of a great <hi>Souldier.</hi> 'Tis, <hi>my soul is continually in my Hand.</hi> By the <hi>Soul</hi> may be meant the <hi>Life,</hi> which does consist in a Vital Union between the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body.</hi> But how may this be said to be, <hi>In the Hand?</hi> remember <hi>Austin</hi> upon this place, confesses, he could not conceive what the Psalmist meant. But <hi>Ierom</hi> hits the Nail, by noting that it is an <hi>Hebraism, Quo significatur vitam habere periculo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positam</hi>; signifying <hi>to go in Danger of ones Life.</hi> The <hi>Graecians</hi> have a Proverb, as well as the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> to the same purpose; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He hath his <hi>Soul</hi> in his <hi>Hand.</hi> To put it out of Doubt, that this is the Intent of the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist here, we find it elsewhere, that when the <hi>Life</hi> of this very person had been obnoxious to an extraordinary Danger, 'tis thus deciphered in 1 Sam. 19.5. <hi>He did put his Life in his Hand.</hi> And hence the never enough Regarded and Commended <hi>French</hi> Translation, so renders the passage, we are now upon, <hi>Ma Vie a este conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuellement en Hazard</hi>; my <hi>Life</hi> has been conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in <hi>Hazard.</hi> A Souldier must continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look to be <hi>Hazarding</hi> of his <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly the <hi>Affection</hi> of a good <hi>Souldier.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Yet I do not forget thy Law.</hi> A Souldier must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>Forget</hi> all things, but <hi>Gods Law,</hi> and his <hi>own Sword.</hi> For the <hi>Object</hi> which he is to be Affected with, 'tis <hi>Gods Law.</hi> That is one of the <hi>Ten
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49073:8"/>
Words,</hi> one of which is used in almost every verse of this glorious Hymn, to denote, <hi>The ways and means by which the blessed God reveals His Will unto the Children of Men; and the Will it self revealed in those ways and means.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then for the <hi>Respect</hi> which he is to place upon this <hi>Object,</hi> it is, <hi>Not Forgetting.</hi> But we are to bear in mind, That according to the Received Rule of Expounding <hi>Scripture Phrases</hi> to <hi>Remember,</hi> denotes also, to <hi>Know,</hi> to <hi>Love,</hi> to <hi>Do.</hi> All <hi>That</hi> is intended here.</p>
            <p>And hence the <hi>Doctrine</hi> here provided for you is,
That the Remembrance of Gods Law, is a Thing of no small Importance to them that have their <hi>Lives</hi> continually in their <hi>Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the little <hi>time</hi> given me for Preparation, will not allow me to be very <hi>Accurate</hi> and <hi>Perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> in improving my present opportunity, which until too late yesterday I knew nothing of: so the little <hi>strength</hi> left me by the excessive. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> of this morning supervening upon the <hi>Languors</hi> of a late Illness, will not permit me to be <hi>long,</hi> in this Discourse; I have only two <hi>Propositions</hi> to entertain you with.</p>
            <div n="1" type="proposition">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:49073:9"/>
               <head>Proposition I. To have their <hi>Lives</hi> in their <hi>Hands,</hi> is a <hi>Condition</hi> which the Children of Men are liable unto.</head>
               <p>There is indeed a Threefold <hi>Condition</hi> which brings the <hi>Lives</hi> of Men into the <hi>Hands</hi> of Men; with a <hi>Gradual Descent</hi> from <hi>Generals</hi> to <hi>Specials,</hi> it may be set before you.</p>
               <p>The first Condition of this kind, is, that of <hi>All Men:</hi> Accordingly our Observation is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Men have their <hi>Lives</hi> brought into their their <hi>Hands,</hi> in point of <hi>Mortality.</hi> Our <hi>Lives</hi> are come out from our <hi>Hearts</hi> unto our <hi>Hands</hi>; and they are in a sort ready to <hi>shake Hands</hi> with us. Our <hi>Lives</hi> do as it were take us by our <hi>Hands,</hi> and say, <hi>Well, I am going, Fare you well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Lives</hi> are come into our <hi>Hands</hi> for the <hi>Brevity</hi> of them. Once indeed there was a <hi>Longevity</hi> in Fallen Man that seem'd almos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49073:9"/>
by our <hi>Vice,</hi> and Gods <hi>Curse,</hi> now terribly Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated. Our own <hi>Corruption</hi> has Enfeebled the principles of Life in our Successive Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Gods just <hi>Malediction</hi> has confirm'd that <hi>Feebleness,</hi> whereby we <hi>Dy before our Time, for being wicked overmuch.</hi> The <hi>Sacred Law</hi> of God has now Abridged our Lives into <hi>Seventy Years,</hi> and the <hi>Common Law</hi> of Man, into <hi>Seven.</hi> Our <hi>Lives</hi> are now IN our <hi>Hands,</hi> and we have not an <hi>Handful</hi> thereof. The psalmist could say, in Psal. 39.5. <hi>Behold, Thou hast made my Days as an Hands Breadth.</hi> In an <hi>Hands Breadth</hi> may be grasped the whole of the <hi>Lives</hi> which we have in our <hi>Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our <hi>Lives</hi> are likewise come into our <hi>Hands</hi> for the <hi>Uncertainty</hi> of them. What is in our <hi>Hands</hi> is <hi>Extra nos,</hi> 'tis uncertain whether we shall keep it or no. Our <hi>Lives</hi> are so in our <hi>Hands,</hi> that we know not whether they will stay with us They may be wrested out of our <hi>Hands</hi>: and in a Turn of an <hi>Hand</hi> they are gone, before we are aware. 'Tis said in James 4.14. <hi>What is your Life? It is even a vapour.</hi> It is as a <hi>Vapour,</hi> or a Candle, that we bear (not in <hi>Horns,</hi> but) in <hi>Hands.</hi> 'Tis liable to be Extinguished by every <hi>puss</hi> of Wind.</p>
               <p>The Second Condition of this kind, is, that of <hi>Old Men.</hi> And so our Observation is,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men have their <hi>Lives</hi> brought into their <hi>Hands</hi> in point of <hi>Infirmity.</hi> Aged persons Lean with their <hi>Hands</hi>; and on their <hi>Staves</hi> they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49073:10"/>
their <hi>Lives.</hi> The <hi>Life</hi> may be put for the <hi>whole Man</hi>; with the <hi>Old Man</hi> 'tis come into the <hi>Hands</hi>; his <hi>Feet</hi> cannot now support him. 'Tis said of him in Eccles 12.3. <hi>The strong men,</hi> (i. e. his Legs) <hi>bow themselves</hi>; and so the <hi>Trembling</hi> Hands must be the <hi>Keepers of the House.</hi> All the strength left him, and all his <hi>Life</hi> is in his <hi>Hands.</hi> He does all things with a <hi>Staff in Hand,</hi> and so with a <hi>Life in Hand</hi>; as 'tis noted of the Gray-headed and Decrepit <hi>Iacob,</hi> in Heb. 11.21. <hi>He Worshipped, leaning on the Top of his Staff:</hi> When he rose off his Couch to worship God, he could not rise without a <hi>Staff</hi>; his <hi>Life</hi> was relieved and exerted mostly by his Aged palsey <hi>Hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Condition of this kind, is that of <hi>Confessors,</hi> and that of <hi>Souldiers.</hi> And our Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation upon it is,</p>
               <p n="3">3 Men have their <hi>Lives</hi> brought into their <hi>Hands</hi> in point of Danger to <hi>Loose their Lives.</hi> 'Tis the Chaldee Paraphrase upon this place, <hi>Anima mea periclitatur ac si esset <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in super ficie manus meae.</hi> Our Lives are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by <hi>Dangers</hi> placed, as t'were on the <hi>Back</hi> of our <hi>Hands.</hi> We have no hold of them, but they will take wing, and be gone, in the Twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an Eye. We are sometimes to venture our <hi>Lives</hi>; and when we do so, We may say, as in 1 Sam. 28.21. <hi>Behold I have put my Life in my Hand.</hi> That which is in our <hi>Hands,</hi> is easy to be <hi>Taken</hi> away; yea, What is ready to be <hi>Given</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49073:10"/>
away, we take in our <hi>Hands.</hi> In both respects, our God often calls us to have our <hi>Lives</hi> in our <hi>Hands.</hi> We are sometimes to engage in those things, wherein 'tis but a <hi>Peradventure,</hi> whether we shall ever come off <hi>Alive.</hi> Yea, we are sometimes not only to <hi>Expose</hi> our <hi>Lives,</hi> but also to <hi>Resign</hi> them, and let them go out of our <hi>Hands,</hi> and pour them forth as a <hi>Drink-offering</hi> before the Lord.</p>
               <p>This is the case of <hi>Confessors.</hi> They Dy <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi>; they are as 'tis said in 2 Cor. 11.23. <hi>In Deaths often.</hi> Yea, they Dy <hi>Daily</hi>; they can say as in 1 Cor. 15.31. I <hi>Dy Daily.</hi> That is, They are <hi>Often,</hi> they are <hi>Daily</hi> in Danger in Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and so they have their <hi>Lives</hi> in their <hi>Hands.</hi> There is a Number of people in the World, who profess the Truths and Ways of God, and serve Him according to His Word. This people are a sort of <hi>Army,</hi> under the Colours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Lord Jesus Christ; but the <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Legend</hi> (pardon me that I call it <hi>so</hi>) of the <hi>Thebaean Legion</hi> is verifyed in the usage that they meet withal. They have so many <hi>Hands</hi> against them, that their <hi>Lives</hi> are in their <hi>Hands</hi>; and from that <hi>Flock of Slaughter,</hi> now one, and then another is made a prey to <hi>Wolvish</hi> Persecutors; before whole Rabid Violence, they say, <hi>Lord, For thy sake We are killed all the Day Long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the case of <hi>Souldiers</hi> too. It was remarked by a notable man of that Character, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> 2 Sam. 11.25. <hi>The Sword Devoureth One as
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49073:11"/>
Well as another.</hi> The Hebrews call <hi>War,</hi> by a Name that signifies, <hi>A Devourer.</hi> And Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers carry in their <hi>Hands,</hi> what the Monster feeds upon; the <hi>Leviathan</hi> devours the <hi>Lives</hi> of them who do Encounter him. The <hi>Lives</hi> of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are where their <hi>Arms</hi> are, even in their <hi>Hands</hi>; for they know not whether they shall return <hi>Alive,</hi> out of the Battels which they are push'd upon.</p>
               <p>And it is for a double Reason that our God carves out such a condition for us.</p>
               <p>First, It is to check our <hi>Worldly-mindedness</hi>: It was said unto that good man, in Jer. 45.5. <hi>Seekest thou great things for thy self, seek them not; for— thy Life will I give unto thee for a prey.</hi> When our Life is for a <hi>prey,</hi> our Life is then in our <hi>Hand</hi>; we have it by a meer <hi>snatch</hi> as it were. This now prohibits our <hi>seeking of great things for our selves,</hi> in as much as we cannot secure to our selves the Enjoyment of <hi>That,</hi> which alone makes us capable of Enjoying all other Sublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Things. By bringing our <hi>Lives</hi> into our <hi>Hands,</hi> our Hands are knock'd away from too fast a gripe or grasp after Secular Objects. When our <hi>Life</hi> is in our <hi>Hand,</hi> God has a voice in His <hi>Mouth</hi> to this purpose, <hi>Dream not of mighty Things, no, nor of any Things in this Transitory World, until thou hast better Assurance of thy continuance here.</hi> The blessed God thus inviteth us, and obligeth us, to look after the glorious <hi>Crowns</hi> and <hi>Ioyes</hi> in another VVorld. He Inviteth us, and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49073:11"/>
us, <hi>To set our Affections upon the Things which are above</hi>; and, <hi>To Look at the Things which are not seen and are Eternal</hi>; and to make sure of an <hi>Hope in Christ,</hi> without which we see (when we have <hi>Life in Hand</hi>) <hi>our selves to be of all men most miserable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly; It is to cure our <hi>Creature-Confidence.</hi> It was said by the Apostle in 2 Cor. 1.9. <hi>We had a Sentence of Death in our selves, that we should not trust in our selves, but in God, which raises the Dead.</hi> A Condemned Malefactor carries his <hi>Life</hi> in his <hi>Hand,</hi> from the Bar. VVe are sometimes in as perilous a Likelihood of <hi>Dying,</hi> as a condemned Malefactor; and we are hereby called upon to <hi>Trust</hi> in God alone for the Reversing and Repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Sentence.</hi> By having our <hi>Lives</hi> in our <hi>Hands,</hi> we are under a Necessity of Reliance upon God alone to keep them there. VVhen we have our <hi>Life</hi> in our <hi>Hand,</hi> we have also that <hi>call</hi> in our <hi>Ear, Do not Lean upon any Temporal Visible, Interest for the preservation of thy Life; let all thy Expectations be, as all thy Salvations are, from God alone.</hi> The Lord breaks down the Hedge on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very side of us, and we Ly open to Death every way: 'tis that we may reserve our <hi>Dependance</hi> for all support, and all succour, to be placed upon God alone; 'tis that we may learn the Song of him that returned with his <hi>Life</hi> in his <hi>Hand</hi> from the maw of the great <hi>Shark; Salvation is of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p>Some people that have their <hi>Lives</hi> in their <hi>Hands,</hi> are more prone to <hi>Forget the Law of God,</hi> then others that undergo less Dangers are.

                  <p>We see it in <hi>Sailors</hi> and in <hi>Souldiers.</hi> As for them that follow the <hi>Sea,</hi> 'tis said of them, in Psal. 107.22. <hi>They Reel to and fro, and Stagger like a Drunken Man; and are at their Wits Ends</hi>

Thus 'tis with them in regard of <hi>Storm</hi>; and when that is over, 'tis <hi>thus</hi> again with them in regard of <hi>Sin</hi> too; even after they come a Shore, still (and upon a sadder Account) they will many of them <hi>Reel to and fro, and Stagger,</hi> not <hi>like a Drunken man</hi>; but thro' <hi>being</hi> really so.

Wherefore as 'tis said, in James 4.8. <hi>Cleanse your Hands, ye Sinners:</hi> Let me call upon you, <hi>Cleanse your Hands, ye Souldiers.</hi> Let there be no Uncleanness, no Disorder found in your <hi>Hands.</hi> Endeavour to have a <hi>pure Camp</hi>; and be <hi>Like the Host of God.</hi> We read sometimes of a <hi>Church</hi> in an <hi>House</hi>; Why should you not as well study a <hi>Church</hi> in a <hi>Camp</hi>? Keep your <hi>Camp</hi> as free from Swearing, Drinking, Gaming, Riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Sabbath-keeping, as any <hi>Church</hi> in the World; and let God be worshipped in your <hi>Camp</hi> as frequently, as Devoutly as in a <hi>Church.</hi> This, <hi>this</hi> will render you <hi>Terrible as an Army

                  <p>Thirdly. While you have your <hi>Lives</hi> in your <hi>Hands,</hi> Let your <hi>Ends</hi> in your <hi>Eyes</hi> be such as they ought to be.

for his Possession.</hi> Hence 'tis, that their <hi>Vassals,</hi> who have more than once been disquieting of us in our <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> and <hi>Possessions</hi>; now have also taken Arms again to make us miserable. But as these Attempts and Attacques of Hell upon us, have been all Abortive heretofore, so we may Apprehend that they will still miscarry. The Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians may (as 'tis by Escaped Captives reported that they <hi>have</hi>) by their Diabolical <hi>Charms,</hi> keep our <hi>Dogs</hi> from Hurting of them, but they shall not so keep our <hi>Swords</hi> from coming at them. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> among us, hath wonderfully made the <hi>Divels</hi> themselves to fly before it; so shall <hi>These</hi> too find unto their Cost. Tho' the <hi>Papists</hi> may likewise contribute what Help they can unto these Miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and say <hi>Mass</hi> with them (as of Late) after their Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Victories, yet we need not be disanimated; but <hi>the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> from thence prognosticate their Approaching Ruine. For we too much Distrust our own Observation, if we do not now think, that the whole <hi>Papal Empire,</hi> (which was of late replanting a <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in the <hi>Glorious Holy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain between the Seas</hi>) is very near its <hi>End,</hi> when <hi>none shall help it</hi>; and that the <hi>twelve Hundred and sixty Years,</hi> during which the people of God, were to be harrassed by it, are not far from their Expiration. In a word, you may go forth with such a Triumph as that in Psal. 20.7, 8: <hi>Some Trust in Chariots, and some in Horses</hi> (some in <hi>Satan,</hi> and some in <hi>Antichrist</hi>) <hi>But wee will Remember the Name of the Lord our God. They are brought down and fallen; but wee are Risen and stand Vpright.</hi>
