            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Consider, that ye
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45471:2"/>
have not yet found him who is <hi>the desire of all Nations,</hi> to whom all the Nations of the Earth must be gathered that have been scattered in <hi>the dark and cloudy day,</hi> and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their Maker. Oh ye <hi>Protestants, Papists, Turks, Jews, Indians</hi> and <hi>Moors,</hi> consider why you have not found <hi>him</hi> that must gather you into <hi>one</hi> again? why are you not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied concerning your God? Why do you set up so many gods? so many likenesses of him, and have killed and are killing one another about a <hi>likenesse,</hi> which the true God commanded you not, but with that of him in your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are condemned for these things, and calls you into Love and Peace. Oh <hi>come</hi> and return unto <hi>him,</hi> to the true and living God, a measure of him have ye all received, with which he striveth with you to draw you to <hi>him,</hi> and he hath sown his seed <hi>in you,</hi> a just, holy, and righteous Law hath he placed <hi>in your hearts,</hi> which is sufficient to bring you all to the knowledge of him, who is the Saviour of all men, who is not willing that you should perish in your sins, but that you should return unto <hi>him.</hi> Of his grace hath he given you, his <hi>light</hi> hath lighted every one of you, which doth make manifest to you which have not the <hi>Law,</hi> when you transgresse the <hi>Law</hi> in your hearts, that sheweth you when you do evil, and though the vail hath been spread over all Nations, who from the <hi>light</hi> is gone in many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, yet so much is left in you all as shall leave you without excuse, though darknesse have covered you, yet you can feel after him who is near <hi>in your hearts,</hi> you do feel something pricking of you when you do any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his just and righteous Law <hi>in you,</hi> you do feel some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>in you</hi> bring guilt, shame, and condemnation over you, when you do things that are unseemly, though never so secretly, and sheweth you it is evil to be <hi>angry,</hi> to be <hi>filthy,</hi> to be <hi>envious,</hi> and it is good to be <hi>patient,</hi> to be <hi>pure,</hi> to be <hi>meek, gentle</hi> and <hi>loving;</hi> now this ye know by that of God which is manifested <hi>in you,</hi> both ye that boast of the <hi>Law,</hi> and ye that have not the <hi>Law,</hi> and therefore all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the righteous Law of God <hi>in your hearts,</hi> (take heed to it) that with it you may come to see how you came de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, and lost the <hi>pure righteous holy image of love and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45471:2"/>
life</hi> wherein you were created, for as you return to it, and believe in it (the least measure, the smallest seed, least in you, which moves to <hi>holinesse</hi> and <hi>justesse</hi>) you will come to see what it was that departed from the Living God, and the <hi>Light</hi> will guide you to him again, the same that lets you see what <hi>departed,</hi> will shew you what must <hi>return,</hi> and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient is that of God <hi>in you</hi> (his grace) whereof ye have all received to save your souls, not any thing of your selves, nor of mans wisedom, or invention. Therefore oh ye People and Nations, behold <hi>the day is come, the light of life appeareth, the Saviour of your souls is revealed, the treasure in the earthen vessel is found,</hi> that which hath been hid in ages and generations, the great mystery, <hi>Christ in you the hope of glory,</hi> the light of the Gentiles, <hi>Gods Salvation to the ends of the Earth.</hi> Oh ye People and Nations, remember and return unto God, for behold the time is come, wherein <hi>the vail must be rent,</hi> and the covering taken away, and the <hi>light of life revealed,</hi> who will rent the vail that is spread over all Nations, and he will now arise and gather his seed out of the desolate heaps, for long hath his oppressed seed mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him, and though it be grosse darknesse among the Nations, yet the <hi>light of life</hi> shall break forth, and in all Nations of the Earth there is shall take hold of it, and come to know the true and living God, and him worship <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> for the Lord hath held forth, and is holding forth his <hi>scepter</hi> of Righteousnesse, his Mercy and his Truth, his <hi>light and life</hi> to all the inhabitants of the Earth, he will lift up his <hi>Ensign</hi> afar off to gather them to him to Righteousnesse and Peace, his Call is gone forth to them that have been far from Righteousnesse, from Truth and Peace; Hearken diligently to his voice that calleth after you to do justly one to another, to do as you would be done unto in all your dealings one with another. Oh give diligent heed unto that which in your Consciences cries to put away the evil of your doings, the deceit, the corruption of your trades, your hard-heartednesse, and cruelty one towards another, for <hi>the light is come</hi> that shews you these things ought not so to be; and therefore oh ye People and Nations against it shut not your eyes, for who
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45471:3"/>
turns not to it shall be condemned with it; Therefore to it turn your minds, that <hi>the holy just one</hi> your <hi>Saviour</hi> you may come to see, whom ye have <hi>pierced,</hi> before whom the <hi>tribes of the earth must mourn;</hi> Yea verily a day of mourning and bitter lamentation must ye witnesse when ye come to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him whom you have <hi>pierced</hi> by your sins and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, that you may be comforted of him who comes to comfort those that mourn, and it's them that feareth him and doth Righteousnesse are accepted in all Nations of him.</p>
