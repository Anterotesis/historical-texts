            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
CONFERENCE
BETWIXT
Mr. CHILLINGWORTH
AND
Mr. LEWGAR.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Thesis.</hi> THE Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (taken diffusively for
all Christians communicating with the
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>) was the Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies
at that time, when the Church of
<hi>England</hi> made an alteration in her Tenents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> She was the Judge of Controversies at that time,
which had an Authority of deciding them. But the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> at that time had the Authority of deciding them.
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A limited Authority to decide Controversies ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Rule of Scripture and Universal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and to oblige her own Members (so long as she evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
contradicted not that Rule) to obedience I grant
she had: but an unlimited, an infallible Authority, or
such as could not but proceed according to that Rule,
and such as should bind all the Churches in the World
to Obedience (as the <hi>Greek</hi> Church) I say she had not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> When your Church hath decided a Controversie,
I desire to know whether any particular Church or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
hath Authority to reexamine her decision, whether
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60827:4"/>
she hath observed her Rule or no; and free h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mself from
the obedience of it, by his or her particular judgment?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> If you understand by your Church, the Church
Catholick, probably I should answer no: but if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
by your Church, that only which is in Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> of if you understand a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
of this Church, I answer, yea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> That was the Catholick Church, which did abide
in the Root of Apostolick Unity: But the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> at that time was the only Church that did abide in
the Root of Apostolick Unity. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> What mean you by Apostolick Unity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I mean the Unity of that Fellowship wherein
the Apostles Lived and Died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Wherein was this Unity?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Herein it consisted, that they all professed one
Faith, obeyed one Supream Tribunal, and communicated
together in the same Prayers and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sclut.</hi> Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> continued not in
this Apostolick Unity; for it continued not in the same
Faith, wherein the Apostles Lived and Died: for though
it retained so much (in my judgment) as was essential to
the being of a Church, yet it degenerated from the Church
of the Apostles times, in many things which were very
profitable; as in Latin Service, and Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nion in one
kind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> Some Church did continue in the same Faith
wherein the Apostles lived and died: But t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere was no
Church at that time which did continue in the Apostles
Faith besides the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> That some Church did continue in the Apostles
Faith in all things necessary, I grant it: that any did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
in the Integrity of it, and in a perfect: conformity
with it in all things expedient and profitable, I deny it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is it not necessary to a Churches continuing in
the Apostles Faith, that she continue in a perfect confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y
with it in all things expedient and prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>table?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> A perfect conformity in all things is necessary
to a perfect continuance in the Apostles Faith: but to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60827:4"/>
an imperfect continuance, an imperfect conformity is
sufficient; and such I grant the <hi>Roman</hi> Church had.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Is not a perfect continuance in the Apostles Faith
necessary to a Churches continuance in Apostolick Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asw.</hi> It is necessary to a perfect continuance in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
Unity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> There was some one company of Christians at
the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> rising, which was the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi>
But there was no other company at that time besides the
<hi>Roman: Ergo,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> at that time was the <hi>Catholick
Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> There was not one company of Christians, whch
in opposition to and Exclusion of all other companies of
Christians was the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Argu.</hi> If the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> be some one company of
Christians in opposition to and exclusion of all other
companies, then if there was some one company, she
was one in opposition to and exclusion of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies:
But the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> is one company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in opposition to and exclusion of, <hi>&amp;c. Ergo,</hi> There
was then some one company which was the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> in opposition to and exclusion of all other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> proved by the Testimonies of the Fathers,
both Greek and Latin, testifying that they understood
the Church to be <hi>one</hi> in the sense alledged.</p>
            <p>1. If this Unity which cannot be separated at all or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
is also among Hereticks, what contend we farther?
Why call we them <hi>Hereticks, S. Cypr. Epist.</hi> 75.</p>
            <p>2. But if there be but one Flock, how can he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
of the Flock, which is not within the number
of it? <hi>Id: Ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. When <hi>Parmenian</hi> commends one Church, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
all the rest; for besides one, which is the true
<hi>Catholick,</hi> other Churches are esteemed to be among He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
but are not. <hi>S. Optat. lib.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>4. The Church therefore is but one, this cannot be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
all Hereticks and Schismaticks. <hi>Ibid.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:60827:5"/>
5. You say you offer for the Church, which is one;

            <p>And these Testimonies I think are sufficient to shew the
judgment of the Ancient Church, that this Title of the
Church <hi>one,</hi> is directly and properly exclusive to all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
besides one; to wit, that where there are diverse
professions of Faith, or diverse communions, there is but
one of these, which can be the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> Upon
this ground I desire some company of Chr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stians to be
named, professing a diverse Faith, and holding a diverse
Communion from the <hi>Roman,</hi> which was the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> rising: and if no other in
this sense can be named, than was she the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
at that time, and therefore her judgment to be rested in,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60827:5"/>
and her Communion to be embraced upon peril of Schism
and Heresie.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> Answer.</p>
            <p>Upon the same ground, if you pleased, you might
desire a Protestant to name some Company of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
professing a diverse Faith, and holding a diverse
Communion from the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which was the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> rising; and seeing
he could name no other in this sense<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> concludes that the
<hi>Greek</hi> Church was the Catholick Church at that time.
Upon the very same ground you might have concluded for
the Church of the <hi>Abyssines,</hi> or <hi>Armenians,</hi> or any other
society of Christians extant before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. And see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this is so, thus I argue against your ground.</p>
            <p>1. That ground which concludes indifferently for both
parts of a contradiction, must needs be false and deceitful,
and conclude for neither part: But this ground concludes
indi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ferently both parts of a contradiction; <hi>viz.</hi> That
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church is the Catholick Church, and not the
<hi>Roman,</hi> as well as, That the <hi>Roman</hi> is the Catholick Church,
and not the <hi>Greek:</hi> Therefore the ground is false and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful,
seem it never so plausible.</p>
            <p>2. I answer Secondly, that you should have taken notice
of my Answer, which I then gave you; which was, that
your <hi>major,</hi> as you then framed your Argument, but as
now, your <hi>minor</hi> is not always true, if by <hi>one</hi> you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<hi>one</hi> in external Communion; seeing nothing hindred
in my Judgment, but that one Church excommunicated
by another upon an insufficient cause, might yet remain
a true member of the Catholick Church; and that Church,
which upon the overvaluing this cause doth excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the other, though in fault, may yet remain a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Catholick Church: which is evident from the
difference about <hi>Easter-day</hi> between the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
and the Churches of <hi>Asia;</hi> for which vain matter <hi>Victor</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> excommunicated the Churches of <hi>Asia.</hi>
And yet I believe you will not say, that either the Church
excommunicating, or the Church excommunicated, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60827:6"/>
to be a true member of the Church Catholick. The
case is the same between the <hi>Greek</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church;
for though the difference between them be greater, yet it
is not so great, as to be a sufficient ground of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication:
and therefore the excommunication was cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and consequently <hi>Brutum fulmen,</hi> and not ratified or
confirmed by God in Heaven; and therefore the Church
of <hi>Greece</hi> at <hi>Luthers</hi> rising might be, and was a true member
of the Catholick Church.</p>
            <p>As concerning the places of Fathers, which you alledge;
I demand, 1. If I can produce you an equal, or greater
number of Fathers, or more ancient than these, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
by any that lived with them or before them, for
some doctrin condemned by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whether
you will subscribe it? If not, with what face or conscience
can you make use of, and build your whole Faith upon the
Authority of Fathers in some things, and reject the same
authority in others?</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, because you urge S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> Authority, I
desire you to tell me, whether this Argument in his time
would have concluded a necessity of resting in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, or no? If not, how should it
come to pass, that it should serve now, and not then, fit
this time and not that? as if it were like an Almanack,
that would not serve for all Meridians? If it would, why
was it not urged by others upon <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> or represented
by <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> to himself for his direction, when he differed
from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and all other that herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
unto her, touching the point of Re-baptizing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
which the <hi>Roman</hi> Church held unlawful and
damnable, <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> not only lawful, but necessary; so
well did he rest in the Judgment of that Church: <hi>Quid
verba audiam, cùm facta videam,</hi> says he in the Comedy?
And Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> tells you in his Epistle to <hi>Casaubon,</hi>
that nothing is more unreasonable, than to draw conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from the words of Fathers, against their lively
and actual practice.</p>
            <p>The same may be said in refutation of the places out of
<hi>S. Austin;</hi> who was so far from concluding, from them or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60827:6"/>
any other, a necessity of resting in the Judgment of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, that he himself, as your Authors testifie,
lived and died in opposition of it; even in that main fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
point, upon which Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> hath built the
necessity of his departure from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
embracing the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that
is, The Supream Authority of that Church over other
Churches, and the power of receiving Appeals from them.
Mr. <hi>Lewgar,</hi> I know, cannot be ignorant of these things;
and therefore I wonder, with what conscience he can
produce their words against us, whose Actions are for
us.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> were Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
for doing so; it seems then Schismaticks may not
only be members of the Church, against Mr. <hi>Lewgars</hi>
main conclusion, but Canoniz'd Saints of it; or else
S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> should be rased out of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Kalendar.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that the point of Re-baptization was not
defined in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time; I say that in the Judgment of
the Bishop and Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and their adherents, it
was: For they urged it as an Original and Apostolick Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and consequently at least of as great force as any
Church definition. They excommunicated <hi>Firmilianus</hi>
and condemned S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as a false Christ, and a false
Apostle, for holding the contrary; and urged him <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico
terrore</hi> to conform his judgment to theirs, as he himself
clearly intimates.</p>
            <p>If it be said, they differed only from the particular Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and not from the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, taking it for
the universal society of Christians in Communion with
that Church: I Answer,</p>
            <p>1. They know no such sense of the word, I am sure
never used it in any such; which whether it had been
possible, if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had been in their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to other Churches in spiritual matters, as the City was
to other Cities and Countries in temporals, I leave it to
indifferent men to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:60827:7"/>
2. Secondly, that they differed not only from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, but also from all other Churches, that
agreed with it in those doctrins.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, I desire you would answer me directly,
whether the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, taking it for that particular
Church, be of necessity to be held Infallible in Faith by
every <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick, or not. To this Question I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
desire a direct answer without tergiversation, that
we may at length get out of the cloud, and you may say,
<hi>Coram, quem quaeritis, ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>um.</hi> If you say, they are not
bound to believe so; then it is no Article of Faith, nor no
certain truth upon which men may safely rest without
fluctuation or fear of error: And if so; I demand</p>
            <p>1. Why are all your Clergy bound to swear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
your Laity (if they have Communion of Faith
with them) by your own grounds, bound to believe, That
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is the Mistris of all other Churches?
where it is evident from the relation and opposition of the
<hi>Roman</hi> to other Churches, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is there
taken for that particular Church.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, why then do you so often urge that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
saying of <hi>Iraeneus, Ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s evident for
the aforesaid reason, that the <hi>Roman</hi> is here taken for that
particular Church.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, if that particular Church be not certainly
infallible, but subject to error in points of f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ith; I would
know, if any division of your Church should happen, in
which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> either alone, or with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
should take one way; the Churches of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and many other Churches another, what direction
should an ignorant Catholick have then from the pretended
Guide of Faith? How shall he know of which of these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
is the Church? seeing all other Churches distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
from the <hi>Roman</hi> may err, and seeing the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church is now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bject to error, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60827:7"/>
not certain to guard those men, or those Churches that
adhere unto it from erring.</p>
            <p>4. Fourthly, if that particular Church be not infallible
in Faith, let us then suppose that <hi>de facto</hi> it does err in
faith; shall we not then have an Heretical head upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
body? A head of the Church, which were no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Church? which sure were a very strange and
heterogeneous Monster! If to avoid these inconveniences
you will say, that <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks must of necessity hold
that particular Church infallible in faith; I suppose it will
evidently follow, that S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
those sentences you pretend out of them) were no
<hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; seeing they lived and died in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
belief and profession. Let me see these absurdities
fairly and clearly avoided, and I will dispute no more,
but follow you whithersoever you shall lead me.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, I answer, that the places alledged are utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
impertinent to the conclusion you should have proved;
which was, That it was impossible, that two Societies of
Christians divided upon what cause soever in external
Communion, may be in truth and in Gods account, both
of them parts of the Catholick Church: whereas your te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies,
if we grant them all, say no more but this;
That the Societies of Hereticks, which are such as over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
any doctrin necessary to salvation; and of Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
which are such as separate from the Churches
Communion without any pretence of error in the Church
or unlawfulness in the conditions of her Communion; I
say, they prove only this, that such Societies as these, are
no parts of the Church: which I willingly grant of all
such, as are properly and formally Hereticks, and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
from which number I think (with S. <hi>Austin</hi>) they
are to be exempted, <hi>Qui quaerunt causa sollicitudine veritatem,
corrigi parati, cum invenerint.</hi> Whereas I put the case of
such two Societies, which not differing indeed in any thing
necessary to salvation, do yet e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oncously believe that the
errors wherewith they charge one another, are damnable,
and so by this opinion of mutual error, are kept on both
sides from being Hereticks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60827:8"/>
Because I desire to bring you and others to the truth, or
to be brought to it by you, I thought good for your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in your intended Reply, to acquaint you with these
things:</p>
            <p>1. That I conceive the—in your discourse is this.
That whensoever any two Societies of Christians differ in

Heretical or Schismatical. I conceive there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>2. Another thing, which I thought fit to acquaint you

conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iving verily you were to leave the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
to avoid trouble you took the next Boat, and went
to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because that bespake you first.</p>
            <p>You impute to me (as I hear) that the way I take is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
only, and that I build nothing; which first, is not
a fault; for Christian Religion is not now to be built; but
only I desire to have the rubbish and impertinent Lumber
taken off, which you have laid upon it, which hides the
glorious simplicity of it from them which otherwise would
embrace it. Remember, I pray, <hi>Averroes</hi> his saying;
<hi>Quandoquidem Christiant adorant quod comedunt, sit anima mea
cum Philosophis;</hi> and consider the swarms of Atheists in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and then tell me, whether your unreasonable and
contradictious Doctrines, your forged Miracles and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
Legends have not in all probability produced this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Secondly, if it be a fault, it is certainly your own;
for your discourse intended for the proof of a positive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion—<hi>That
we must be Papists</hi> proves <hi>in deed and
in truth</hi> nothing; but even <hi>in shew and appearance</hi> no more
but this Negative, that we must not be Protestant; but
what we must be, if we must not be Protestants, God
knows; you in this Discourse (I am sure) do not shew it.</p>

Church: But he hath the <hi>Roman</hi> to name, and so my
ground cannot conclude, either so, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap> or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60827:9"/>
any other, besides the <hi>Roman,</hi> but for that it does, except
he can name some other.</p>
            <p>§. 2. His second answer is weak likewise; for my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
is always true; at least they thought it to be so, whose
Authorities I produce in confirmation of it, as will appear
to any one that considers them well; how their force lies in
<hi>Thesi,</hi> not in <hi>Hypothesi;</hi> not that the Church was not then
divided into more Societies than one, but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be.</p>
            <p>§. 3. As for his Instance to the contrary, wherein he
believes I will not say the Churches excommunicated by
<hi>Victor</hi> ceased to be a true member of the Catholick: If I
say so, I say no more than the Ancient Fathers said before
me. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> when he desired <hi>Victor</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not to cut

                  </gap>, reprehendit
cam, quod non benè fecisset abscindere ab unitate corporis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>§. 4. But howsoever the case of Excommunication may
be, the division of external Communion which I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the Fathers spake of in the alledged Au<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>horities, was
that which was made by voluntary separation.</p>
            <p>§. 5. Whereby the Church (before one Society) is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into several distinct Societies, both claiming to be
the Church; of which Societies so divided, but one can
be the Catholick; and this is proved by the Authorities al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged;
which Authorities must not be answered by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
them, as he does (for that is to change his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
and confute the Fathers sayings, instead of mine) but
by shewing their true sense or judgment to be otherwise
than I alledged it.</p>
            <p>§. 6. To his demand upon the places alledged I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that I do not build my whole faith of this conclusion
upon the Authority of those Fathers; for I produce them,
not for the Authority of the thing, but of the Exposition.
The thing it self is an Article of the Creed, <hi>Unam Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam;</hi>
grounded in express Scripture, <hi>Columba mea unica:</hi>
but because there is difference in understanding this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie,
I produce these Authorities, to shew the Judgment
of the Ancient Church how they understood it; and the
proper answer to this is either to shew, that these words
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60827:9"/>
were not there, or at least, not this meaning; and so to
shew their meaning out of other places more pregnant.</p>
            <p>§. 7. And I promise, that whensoever an equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of Fathers can be shewed for any thing, as I can
shew for this, I will believe it as firmly as I do this.</p>
            <p>§. 8. But this is not the Answerers part, to propound
doubts and difficulties, but to satisfie the proof objected.</p>
            <p>§. 9. And if this course be any more taken, I will save
my self all farther labour in a business so likely to be
endless.</p>
            <p>§. 10. His second Answer to the places is wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent;
for therein would he disprove them from
watching a necessity of resting in the judgment of the
<hi>Roman Church;</hi> whereas I produced them only to shew,
that among several Societies of Christians, only <hi>one</hi> can
be the <hi>Catholick;</hi> and against this his second Answer saith
nothing.</p>
            <p>§. 11. In his third Answer he makes some shew of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to the Authorities themselves; but he commits a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Error: One, that he imposes upon me a wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
to be proved, as will appear by comparing my
conclusion in my Paper, with the conclusion he would
appoint me.</p>
            <p>§. 12. Another, that he imposes upon the Authorities
a wrong Interpretation, no way grounded in the words
themselves, nor in the places whence they were taken,
nor in any other places of the same Fathers, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forged out of his own Brain. For first, the places
do not only say, that the Societies of Hereticks and
Schismaticks are no part of the Church; but that the
Church cannot be divided into more Societies than <hi>one;</hi>
and they account Societies divided, which are either of
a diverse Faith or a diverse Communion. Neither do they
define <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schismaticks</hi> in that manner as he does.</p>
            <p>§. 13. For an <hi>Heretick</hi> in their Language is he, that
opposes partinaciously the Common Faith of the
Church: and a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> he that separates from the
<hi>Catholick</hi> Communion; never making any mention at all
of the cause.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60827:10"/>
§. 14. And if his definition of a <hi>Schismatick</hi> may stand,
then certainly there was no <hi>Schismatick</hi> ever in the
World, nor none are at this day: for none did, none
does separate without some pretence of Error, or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
in the Conditions of the Churches Communion.</p>
            <p>§. 15. And so I expect both a fuller and directer answer
to my Argument, without excursions, or diversions into
any other matter, till the judgment of Antiquity be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in this point.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> Answer.</p>
            <p>Ad §, 1. The <hi>Minor</hi> of my Argument, you say, is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weak, being grounded upon a false Suppos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion, That
a Protestant could name no other Church professing a
diverse Faith from the <hi>Greek,</hi> which was the <hi>Catholick</hi>
Church: And your reason is, because he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight name
the <hi>Roman.</hi> But in earnest, Mr. <hi>Lewgar,</hi> do you think
that a Protestant remaining a Protestant, can esteem
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church to be the Catholick Church? or do
you think to put tricks upon us, with taking your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
one while <hi>in s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nsu composito,</hi> another while <hi>in sensu
drviso?</hi> For if your meaning was, that a Pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>testant not
remaining, but ceasing to be a Protestant, might name
the <hi>Roman</hi> for the <hi>Catholick;</hi> so I say also to your discourse,
that a Protestant ceasing to be a Protestant, might name
a <hi>Greek</hi> to be the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church; and if there were any
necessity to find out one Church of one denomination, as
the <hi>Greek,</hi> the <hi>Roman,</hi> the Abyssine, which <hi>one</hi> must be
the <hi>Catholick?</hi> I see no reason, but he might pitch upon
the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, as well as the <hi>Roman;</hi> I am sure your
discourse proves nothing to the contrary. In short, thus
I say, if a <hi>Grecian</hi> should go about to prove to a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Church is the <hi>Catholick,</hi> by say<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng (as you
do for the <hi>Roman</hi>) some one was so before <hi>Luther,</hi> and you
can name no other, therefore ours is so: Whatsoever may
be answered to him, may be answered to you. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as
you say, a Protestant, ceasing to be a Prote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tant, may
name to him the <hi>Roman;</hi> so I say, a Protestant, ceasing
to be a Protestant, may name to you the <hi>Grecian.</hi> If
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60827:10"/>
you say, a Protestant, remaining a Protestant, can name
no other but the <hi>Roman,</hi> for the <hi>Catholick;</hi> I may (very
ridiculously I confess, but yet as truly) say, he can name
no other but the <hi>Grecian.</hi> If you say, he cannot name
the <hi>Greek Church</hi> neither, remaining a Protestant; I say
likewise, neither remaining a Protestant, can he name the
<hi>Roman</hi> for the <hi>Catholick.</hi> So the Argument is equal in
all respects on both sides; and therefore either concludes
for both parts (which is impossible, for then contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should be both true) or else (which is certain) it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
for neither. And therefore I say, your ground
you build on, That before <hi>Luther</hi> some Church of one deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
was the <hi>Catholick</hi> (if it were true, as it is most
false) would not prove your intent. It would destroy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
our Church, but it would not build yours. It would
prove peradventure, that we must not be Protestants, but
it will be far from proving that we must be <hi>Papists.</hi> For
after we have l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ft being Protestants (I tell you again that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou may not mistake) there is yet no necessity of being
<hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> than if I go out of <hi>England,</hi> there is a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essity of going to <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus much to shew the

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of your ground, if it were true. Now in the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> place, I say it is false, neither have you proved any
thing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. You say, the Authorities you have produced,
shew to any that consider them well, That the Church
could never be divided into more Societies than <hi>one;</hi> and
you mean (I hope) <hi>one</hi> in external Communion, or else
you daily in ambiguities; and then I say, I have well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
the alledged authorities, and they appear to me to
say no such thing; but only, that the Societies of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
and Schismaticks are no true members of the Church:
Whereas I put the case of two such Societies, which were
divided in external Communion by reason of some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued
difference between them, and yet were neither
of them Heretical or Schismatical. To this I know you
could not answer, but only by saying, That this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
was impossible; <hi>viz.</hi> That of two Societies divided
in external Communion, neither should be Heretical nor
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60827:11"/>
Schismatical; and therefore I desired you to prove by one
convincing Argument, that this is impossible. This you
have not done, nor I believe can do; and therefore all
your places fall short of your intended conclusion; and
if you would put them into Syllogistical form, you should
presently see you conclude from them Sophistically in
that fallacy, which is called <hi>A dicto secundura quid, ad di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum
Simpliciter.</hi> Thus,—No two diviced Societies,
whereof one is Heretical or Schisinatical, can be both
members of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> therefore simply no
two divided Societies can be so: the Antecedent I grant,
which is all that your places say, as you shall see anon;
but the consequence is Sophistical, and therefore that I
deny: It is no better nor worse than if you should argue
thus; No true divided Societies, whereof one is Out-law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and in Rebellion, are both members of the same Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth;
therefore simply no two divided Societies.</p>
            <p>But against this you pretend, That the a ledged places
say not only, that the Societies of Hereticks and Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
are no parts of the Church; but that the Church
cannot be divided into more Societies than <hi>one:</hi> And they
account Societies divided, which are either of a diverse
Faith, or of a diverse Communion: This is that which I
would have proved, but as yet I cannot see it done. There
be Eleven Quotations in all; seven of them speak expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and formally of division made by Hereticks and Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. 3, 4. 7. 9, 10, 11. Three other of them,
(<hi>viz.</hi> 5, 6. 8.) though they use not the word, yet Mr.
<hi>Lewgar</hi> knows they speak of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> which were
Schismaticks; and that by the relative particles <hi>you</hi> and
<hi>them</hi> are meant the <hi>Donatists.</hi> And lastly, the second,
Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> know, says nothing but this, That an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
cannot be accounted of that one Flock, which is the
Church.</p>
            <p>But to make the most of them that can be: The first
saith, the Unity of the Church cannot be separated at all,
nor divided. This I grant, but then I say, every differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
does not in the sight of God divide this Unity; for
then diversity of Opinions should do it; and so the <hi>Iesuits</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60827:11"/>
and <hi>Dominicans</hi> should be no longer members of the same
Church. Or if every difference will not do it, why must
it of necessity be always done by difference in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
upon an insufficient ground, yet mistaken for suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient?
(for such only I speak of.) Sure I am, this place
says no such matter. The next place saies, the Flock is
but one; and all the rest, that the Church is but <hi>one,</hi>
and that Hereticks and Schismaticks are not of it; which
certainly was not the thing to be proved, but that of this
one Flock, of this one Church, two Societies divided
without just cause in Communion, might not be true
and lively members; both in one Body Mystical in the
sight of God, though divided in Unity in the sight of
men: It is true indeed, whosoever is shut out from the
Chruch on Earth, is likewise cut off from it before God
in Heaven: but you know it must be <hi>Clave non errante;</hi>
when the cause of abscission is true and sufficient.</p>
            <p>Ad. § 3. If you say so, <hi>you say no more than the Fathers:</hi>
but what evasions and tergiversations are these? Why do
you put us off with <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>ands?</hi> I beseech you tell me,
or at least him that desires to reap some benefit by our
Conference, directly and Categorically,—Do you say
so, or do you say, it is not so? Were the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Churches of <hi>Asia</hi> still members of the <hi>Catholick
Church</hi> (I mean in Gods account) or were they not? but
all damned for that horrible Heresie of celebrating the
Feast of <hi>Easter</hi> upon a diverse day from the Western
Churches? If you mean honestly and fairly, answer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to this Question, and then you shall see what will
come of it. Assure your self, you have a Wolf by the
Ears: If you say they were, you overthrow your own
conclusions, and say that Churches divided in Communion
may both be members of the <hi>Catholick.</hi> If they were not;
then shall we have Saints and Martyrs in Heaven, which
were no members of the <hi>CathOlick Roman Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Russinus</hi> his—<hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scindere

the most; That <hi>Victor (quantum in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from the <hi>External</hi> Communion of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60827:12"/>
supposing, that for their Obstinacy in their Tradition,
they had cut themselves off from the <hi>internal</hi> Communion
of it: but that this sentence of <hi>Victors</hi> was ratified in
Heaven, and that they were indeed cut off from the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Body of Christ, so far was <hi>Irenaeus</hi> from thinking,
that he, and in a manner all the other Bishops reprehended
<hi>Victor</hi> for pronouncing this Sentence on them, upon a
cause so insufficient: which how they could say, or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
think of a Sentence ratified by God in Heaven, and
not reprehend God himself, I desire you to inform me:
and if they did not intend to reprehend the Sentence of
God himself, together with <hi>Victors,</hi> then I believe it will
follow unavoidably, that they did not conceive, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<hi>Victors</hi> Sentence to be rati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

did not believe, that these excommunicated
Churches were not in Gods account true members of the
Body of Christ.</p>
            <p>Ad. § 4. And here again, we have another subterfuge,
by a Verbal distinction between Excommunication, and
voluntary separation: As if the separation, which the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> made in <hi>Victors</hi> time from the <hi>Asian
Churches,</hi> were not a voluntary separation; or as if the
Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> did not voluntarily do that which was
the cause of their separation; or as if (though they sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not themselves indeed, conceiving the cause to be
insufficient) they did not yet remain voluntarily separated,
rather than conform themselves to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi>
Or lastly, as if the <hi>Grecians</hi> of Old, or the Protestants of
Late, might not pretend as justly as the <hi>Asi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n</hi> Churches,
that their Separation too was not voluntarily, but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
for that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> required of them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Excommunication such conditions of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
as were neither necessary nor lawful to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 5. And here again the matter is st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eightned by
another limitation. Both sides (say you) must claim to
be the Church: but what then, if one of them only
claim (though vainly) to be the Church, and the other
content it self with being a part of it? These then it seems
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60827:12"/>
(for any thing you have said to the contrary) may be both
members of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> And certainly this is
the case now, between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and the
Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and for ought I know, was between
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Church of <hi>Greece:</hi> For I
believe, it will hardly be proved, that the Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
between them was mutual; nor that the Church
of <hi>Greece</hi> esteems it self the whole Church, and the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> no Church but it self a sound member
of the Church, and that a corrupted one.</p>
            <p>Again, whereas you say, the Fathers speak of a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
separation; certainly they speak of any Separation
by Hereticks; and such were (in <hi>Victors</hi> judgment) the
Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> for holding an opinion contrary to
the Faith, as he esteemed: Or if he did not, why did he
cut them from the Communion of the Church? But
the true difference is, The Fathers speak of those, which
by your Church are esteemed Hereticks, and are so;
whereas the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches were by <hi>Victor</hi> esteemed
Hereticks, but were not so.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 6. But their Authorities produced shew no more,
than what I have shewed; that the Church is but one in
4exclusion of Hereticks and Schismaticks; and not that
two particular Churches divided by mistake upon some
overvalued difference, may not be both parts of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ad §. 7. But I desire you to tell me, whether you will
do this, if the Doctrines produced and confirmed by such
a consent of Fathers, happen to be in the judgment of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> either not <hi>Catholick,</hi> or absolutely
Heretical. If you will undertake this, you shall hear
farther form me: But if, when their places are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
you will pretend (as some of your side do) that sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they are corrupted, having neither reason nor shew of
reason for it; unless this may pass for one (as perhaps it
may, where reasons are scarce) that they are against your
Doctrine; or if you will say, they are to be interpreted
according to the pleasure of your Church, whether their
words will bear it or no; then I shall but lose my Labour;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60827:13"/>
for this is not to try your Church by the Fathers, but the
Fathers by your Church.</p>
            <p>The Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ines which I undertake to justifie, by a
greater consent of Fathers than here you produce, for
instance shall be these.</p>
            <p>1. That Gods Election supposeth prescience of mans
Faith and perseverance.</p>
            <p>2. That God doth not predetermine men to all their
Actions.</p>
            <p>3. That the <hi>Pope</hi> hath no power in temporalties over
Kings either directly or indirectly.</p>
            <p>4. That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> may Err in his publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of matters of Faith.</p>
            <p>5. That the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> was guilty of Original sin.</p>
            <p>6. That the B. <hi>Virgin</hi> was guilty of actual sin.</p>
            <p>7. That the Communion was to be administred to the
Laity in both kinds.</p>
            <p>8. That the reading of the Scripture was to be denied
to no man.</p>
            <p>9. That the Opinion of the Millenaries is true.</p>
            <p>10. That the Eucharist is to be administred to Infants.</p>
            <p>11. That the substance of Bread and Wine remains in
the Eucharist of her Consecration.</p>
            <p>12. That the Souls of the Saints departed enjoy not
the Vision of God before the Last day.</p>
            <p>13. That at the day of judgment, all the Saints shall
pass through a purging fire.</p>
            <p>All these propositions are held by your Church either
Heretical, or at least not <hi>Catholical;</hi> and yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
of yours you have undertaken to believe them as
firmly, as you now do this, That two diviced Societies
cannot be both members of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ad §. 8. It is not then the Answerers part to shew,
that the proofs pretended are indeed no proofs? and
doth not he prove no proofs (at least in your mouth) who
undertakes to shew, that an equal or greater number of
the very same witnesses is rejected by your selves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other things? Either the consent of the Fathers, in
any Age or Ages, is infallible, and then you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60827:13"/>
it in nothing; or it is not so, and then you are not
to urge it in any thing: As if the Fathers Testimonies
against us were Swords and Spears, and against you bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 9. In effect as if you should say. If you answer
not as I please, I will dispute no longer. But you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the proverb,—will think of it.—<hi>Occasionem
quaerit, qui cupit discedere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ad §. 10. I pray tell me, Is not <hi>Therefore</hi> a note of an
Illation, or a conclusion? And is not your last <hi>therefore
this, Therefore her judgment is to be rested in?</hi> which though
it be not your first conclusion, yet yours it is, and you may
not declaim it: and it is so near of kin to the former
(in your judgment I am sure) that they must stand or fall
together: therefore he that speaks pertinently for the
disproving of the one, cannot speak impertinently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the disproving the other: and therefore you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so shift it off, but of necessity you must answer the
Argument there urged, or confess it ingenuously to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable.</p>
            <p>Or if you will not answer any thing, where the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
of your first conclusion is not in terms infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
then take it thus: If S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and S. <hi>Austin</hi> did not
think it necessary in matter of Faith to rest in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and the adherents of it; Then
either they thought not the <hi>Catholick Churches</hi> judgment
necessary to be rested on, or they thought not <hi>that</hi> the
<hi>Catholick Church.</hi> But the Antecedent is true, and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably
proved so by their Actions, and the consequence
Evident: Therefore the consequent must be true in one
or other part: But you will not say the former is true; it
remains therefore, the latter must be, and that is—That
S. <hi>Austin</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did not think the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> and the adherents of it to be the Catholick
Church.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 11. But I tell you now, and have already told
you, that in our discourse before Mr. <hi>Skin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Sheldon</hi> I answered your Major, as then you framed your
Argument, as now your Minor thus—If you understand
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60827:14"/>
by <hi>one company</hi> of Christians, <hi>one</hi> in External Communion,
I deny your Major. For I say, that two several Societies
of Christians, which do not externally communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
may be both parts of the same Catholick Church:
and what difference there is between this, and the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
I told you, you should have proved, I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 12. And is it possible you should say so, when
every one of the places carry this sense in their forehead,
and 7 of the 11 in terms express it—That they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
only to exclude Hereticks and Schismaticks from
being parts of the Church: For if they did not, against
whom did they intend them? <hi>Pagans</hi> lay no claim to the
Church, therefore not against them: <hi>Catholick.</hi> they did
not intend to exclude: I know not who remains besides,
but Hereticks and Schismaticks. Besides the frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
in them between—<hi>One Church</hi> on the one side,
and Hereticks and Schismaticks; who sees not, that in
these places they intended to exclude only these pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
out of the Churches Unity?</p>
            <p>Lastly, whereas you say, that the places say—That
the Church cannot be divided; and that they account
those divided who are of a diverse Faith, or a diverse Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion:
I tell you, that I have read them over and over,
and unless my Eyes deceive, they say not one word of a
<hi>diverse Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ad §. 13. Whereas a <hi>Heretick</hi> in your Language, is he
that opposeth pertinaciously the common Faith of the
Church;—In mine—He is such a one, as holds
an Error against Faith with Obstinacy: Verily a monstrous
difference between these definitions. To oppose and
hold against (I hope) are all one: <hi>Faith</hi> and the <hi>common
Faith of the Church,</hi> sure are not very different: <hi>pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi>
and <hi>with Obstinacy,</hi> methinks might pass for Synoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
and seeing the parts agree so well, methinks the
Total should not be at great hostility. And for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of a <hi>Schismatick,</hi> if you like not mine (which yet
I give you out of a Father) I pray take your own; and
then shew me, (If you mean to do any thing) that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60827:14"/>
there are two Societies of Christians, differing in
external Communion, one of them most be of necessity
either Heretical, or Schismatical in your own sense of
these words. To the contrary, I have said already, (and
say it now again, that you may not forget it) the <hi>Roman</hi>
and the <hi>Asian</hi> Churches in <hi>Victors</hi> time, the <hi>Roman</hi> and the
<hi>African</hi> in S. <hi>Stephens</hi> time differed in external Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and yet neither of them was <hi>Heretical;</hi> For they did
not oppose pertinaciously the common Faith of the Church:
Neither of them was <hi>Schismatical;</hi> for they did not sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
(never making mention of the cause at all) but were
separated by the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and that upon some cause,
though it were not sufficient.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 14. The <hi>Donatist</hi> did so (as <hi>Facundus Hermianensis</hi>
testifies:) but you are abused, I believe, with not distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
between these two—They did pretend, that the
Church required of them some unlawful thing among the
conditions of her Communion: and they did pretend,
that it was unlawful for them to communicate with the
Church. This I confess they did pretend; but it was in
regard of some Persons in the Church, with whom they
thought it unlawful to communicate: But the former they
did not pretend, (I mean while they continued meer
Schismaticks,) <hi>viz.</hi> That there was any Error in the
Church, or impiety in her publick service of God: And
this was my meaning in saying,—A Schismatick is he,
which separates from the Church without pretence of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
or unlawfulness in the conditions of her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Yet if I had left out the term <hi>unlawfulness,</hi> the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
had been better, and not obnoxious to this Cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and so I did in the second Paper which I sent you
for your direction; which if you had dealt candidly, you
should have taken notice of.</p>
            <p>Ad §. 15. I have replied (as I think) fully to every part
and particle of your Argument. Neither was the History
of S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> and S. <hi>Austins</hi> opposition to the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> an excursion or diversion; but a cleer demonstation
of the contradictory of your conclusion: (<hi>viz. That the</hi>
Roman <hi>Church,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and therefore her judgment not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60827:15"/>
upon</hi>) For an answer hereto I shall be very importunate
with you; and therefore, if you desire to avoid trouble,
I pray come out of my debt as soon as may be.</p>
            <p>If it be said, that my Argument is not contradictory
to your conclusion; because it shews only, that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church with her adherents was not in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> or S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
time the Catholick Chruch, but was at the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Luther;</hi> I say, to conclude the one is to conclude the
other. For certainly, if it were then at <hi>Luthers</hi> time so,
it was always so; if it was not always, it was not then:
for if it be of the essence, or necessary to the Church (as
is pretended) to be a Society of Christians joyned in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church and Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> then did
it always agree to the Church; and therefore in S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
and S. <hi>Austins</hi> time, as well as at <hi>Luhers</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ising: if it
were not always, particularly not in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, of
the Essence or necessary to the Church to be so;
then it was impossible the Church should acquire this
Essence, or this property afterwards, and therefore impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it should have it at the time of <hi>Luthers</hi> rising. <hi>Necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium

Post. Analyt.</p>
            <p>Again, every Sophister knows, that of Particulars no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be concluded; and therefore he that will shew,
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the adherents of it was the
Catholick Church at <hi>Luthers</hi> rising; He must argue thus;—It
was always so, therefore then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t was so:
Now this Antecedent is overthrown by any Instance to
the contrary; and so the first Antecedent being proved
false, the first consequent cannot but be false; for what
Reason can be imagined, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and the
Adherents of it, was not the whole Catholick Church at
S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> time, and was at <hi>Luthers</hi> rising? If you grant
(as I think you cannot deny) that a Church divided from
the Communion of the <hi>Roman,</hi> may be still in truth and in
Gods account a part of the Catholick (which is the thing
we speak of:) then I hope Mr. <hi>Lewgars</hi> Arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Unity of Communion is fallen to the ground; and it will
be no good Plea to say,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:60827:15"/>
Some one Church, not consisting of divers Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
was the Catholick Church at <hi>Luthers</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ising:</p>
            <p>No one Church can be named to be the Catholick
Church, but the <hi>Roman:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore the <hi>Roman</hi> Church was the Catholick at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
rising.</p>
            <p>For Mr. <hi>Lewgar</hi> hath not nor cannot prove the Major
of this syllogism certainly true; but to the contrary I have
proved, that it cannot be certainly true, by shewing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
instances, wherein divers divided Communions have
made up the Catholick Church: and therefore not the
dividing of the Communions, but the cause and ground of
it, is to be regarded, whether it be just and sufficient, or
unjust and insufficient.</p>
            <p>Neither is the Bishop or Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the
Adherents of it, an infallible Judge thereof; for it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
both he and it have erred herein divers times;
which I have evinced already by divers examples, which
I will not repeat; but add to them one confessed by

            <head>II. A Discourse against the Infallibility of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church, with an Answer to all those Texts
of Scripture that are alledged to prove it.</head>
            <p>THE Condition of Communion with the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> without the performance whereof no man can
be received into it, is this, That he believe firmly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubting, whatsoever that Church requires him to
believe.</p>
            <p>It is impossible that any man should certainly believe
any thing, unless that thing be either evident of it self (as
that twice two are four; that every whole is greater than a
part of it self) or unless he have some certain reason (at
least some supposed certain reason) and infallible guide
for his belief thereof.</p>
            <p>The Doctrins which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> requireth to
be believed are not <hi>evident of themselves;</hi> for then every
one would grant them at first hearing without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof. He therefore that will believe them, must
have some certain and infallible ground whereupon to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ld his belief of them.</p>
            <p>There is no other ground for a mans belief of them,
especially in many points, but only an assurance of the
Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this point of that Churches Infallibility, is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
of it self; for then no man could chuse but in his
heart believe it without farther proof. Secondly, it were
in vain to bring any proof of it, as vain as to light a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
to shew men the Sun. Thirdly, it were impossible
to bring any proof of it, seeing nothing can be more
evident, than that which of it self is evident: and
nothing can be brought in proof of any thing which is not
more evident than that matter to be proved: But now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
teacheth that millions there are, which have heard
talk of the Infallibitliy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and yet do
not believe that the defenders of it do not think it either
vain or impossible to go about to prove it; and from hence
it follows plainly, that this point is not evident of it self.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:60827:16"/>
Neither is there any other certain ground for any mans
belief of it: or if there be, I desire it may be produced, as
who am ready and most willing to submit my judgment to
it, fully perswaded that none can be produced, that will
endure a severe and impartial examination.</p>
            <p>If it be said, The <hi>Roman</hi> Church is to be believed infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
because the Scripture says it is so.</p>
            <p>1. I demand how shall I be assured of the Texts that be
alledged, that they are indeed Scripture, that is, the Word
of God? And the answer to this must be either because the
Church tells me so, or some other: if any other be given, then
all is not finally resolved into, and built upon that Churches
Authority; and this answer then I hope a Protestant may
have leave to make use of, when he is put to that perillous
Question; <hi>How know you the Scripture to be the Scripture?</hi>
If the answer be, because the Church tells me so: my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
is ready; that to believe that Church is infallible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Scriptures say so: and that the Scripture is the
word of God, because the same Church says so, is nothing
else but to believe the Church is infallible, because the
Church says so, which is infallible.</p>
            <p>2. I could never yet from the beginning of <hi>Genesis,</hi> to
the end of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> find it written so much as once
in express terms, or equvalently, that the Church in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination
to the Sea of <hi>Rome</hi> shall be always infallible.</p>
            <p>3. If it be said, that this is drawn from good consequence
from Scripture truly interpreted; I demand, what certain
ground have I to warrant me, that this consequence is
good and this interpretation true: and if answer be made,
that reason will tell me so: I reply, 1. That this is to build
all upon my own reason and private interpretation. 2. I
have great reason to fear, that reason assures no man, that
the infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be deduced
from Scripture, by good and firm consequence.</p>
            <p>4. If it be said, that a Consent of Fathers do so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
the Scripture. I answer, 1. That this is most false
and cannot without impudence be pretended, as I am ready
to justifie to any indifferent Hearer. 2. I demand, who
shall be judge whether the Fathers mean as is pretended.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60827:17"/>
If it be said, reason will tell me so: I say, 1. this is false.
2. This is again to do that which is objected to Protestants
for such a horrid crime, that is, to build all finally upon
reason.</p>
            <p>If it be said, they are so interpreted by the Catholick
Church; I demand, whether by the Catholick Church be
meant that onely that is in subordination to the Bishop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or any other with that, or besides that. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any other,
it is false and impudent to pretend that they so understand
the Fathers or Scriptures: If that only, then this is to say,
that that Church is infallible, because it may be deduced
from Scripture, that it is so; and to prove that it may be
deduced from Scripture, because the Fathers say so; and
to prove the Fathers do say and mean so, because the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> says they do so. And then what a stir
and trouble was here to no purpose; why was it not rather
said plainly at the beginning; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
certainly infallible, because she her self says so; and she
must say true because she is infallible: and that is as much
to say as unless you grant me the Question, I neither can
nor will dispute with you.</p>
            <p>If it is said, indeed the Fathers do not draw this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin
from Scripture, but yet they affirm it with a full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
as a matter of Tradition. I reply. 1. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
also is false, and that upon tryal it will not appear to
have any colour of probability to any who remembers,
that it is the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and not the Catholick
Church whose infallibility is here disputed. 2. I demand,
who shall be judge, whether the Fathers do indeed affirm
this or no: If reason, then again we are falle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon that
dangerous Rock, that all must be resolved into private
reason: If the Church I ask again, what Church is meant?
If the Church of the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Abyss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nes</hi> or Protestants, or
any other but the <hi>Roman,</hi> it is evident they deny it. If the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then we are again very near the head of
the Circle. For I ask, how shall I be assured this Church
will not err and deceive me in interpreting the Fathers;
and the Answer must be eithe none, or this, that the
Church is infallible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:60827:17"/>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it be said, that the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Church would yield the Church so many commodities, and
that the want of an infallible Church to guide men in the
way to Heaven, would bring so many mischiefs upon the
world, that it cannot be thought but that God out of his
love to men, hath appointed this Church as an infallible
guide to all other Churches; seeing it is so necessary there
should be some such guide, and so evident there is no
other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, that this argument would serve the
Church of <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> to prove it self
infallible, and the guide of all other Churches, would they
but take upon them to be so. For every one might say for
it self; It is necessary there should be some Guide; it is
evident there is no other; <hi>Ergo</hi> I am appointed by God to
be that Guide. The same argument any man might use, to
make himself Monarch of any popular State: for first he
might represent unto them the commodities of a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and the mischiefs of a Democracy: then he might say,
That God surely out of his Love to them hath appointed
some remedy for their inconveniences: And lastly, that
he hath ordained no other to redress them but himself, and
then conclude, that he alone must of necessity be the man
appointed to rule over them.</p>
            <p>I answer Secondly, that here also we must resolve all
into Reason and the private Spirit, or that we are still in
the Circle. For I demand, how do you know that these
pretended commodities are to be compassed, and these
pretended mischiefs are to be avoided, only by the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> or some other Church, and
not by any other means which God hath provided. If
you say, reason tells you so; I say 1. This is to make
reason your last and lowest foundation. 2. I assure you
Reason tells me no such matter, and yet I know that I am
as willing to hear it as you are. If you say, the Church
tells you so, and she is infallible; this, I say, is to prove the
Church infallible because she is so.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I demand, How it is possible you should know,
that these pretended commodities might not be gained,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60827:18"/>
and these mischiefs which you fear avoided, without any
assistance of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s infallibility, if all men
in the world did believe the Scripture, and live according
to it, and would require no more of others, but to do so?
If you say, that notwithstanding this, there would be no
unity in Doctrin: I answer 1. It is impossible you should
know this; considering that there are many places in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
which do more than problably import, that the
want of piety in living, is the cause of want of unity in
believing. 2. That there would be unity of Opinion in
all things necessary: and that in things not necessary unity
of Opinion is not necessary. But lastly, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
differences in these things of lesser importance,
there might and would be unity of Communion, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of charity and affection, which is one of the greatest
blessings which the world is capable of; absolute unity
of opinion being a matter rather to be desired than hoped
for.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> Against this it has been objected, that the Scripture
cannot be the guide, because many men have used their
best endeavors to follow it, and yet have fallen, some into
<hi>Arianism,</hi> others into <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> others into other damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Heresies, and how can I secure any man, but he may
do the like?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I answer, by distinguishing the persons
which are pretended to have made use of this Guide, and
yet to have fallen into Heresie, that they were either
such as did love the truth sincerely and above all things, as
did seek it diligently and with all their power, to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
that they might conform their belief and life unto it;
such as following S. <hi>Pauls</hi> direction, did first try all things
deliberately, and then chose what in their conscience they
thought was best: or they were such as for want of the
love of the truth, God suffered to fall into strong delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to fall to a false Religion, because they brought not
forth the fruits of the true; to make shipwreck of their
faith, because they had cast away a good conscience; to
have their Eyes blinded, and their light taken away, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they made not the right use of it, but were idle and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60827:18"/>
unprofitable, and set their hearts upon vanity, and had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a form of Religion, but denied the effect of it in their
lives and conversation; in a word, such as were betrayed
to their Error, and kept for ever in it, either by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in seeking the Truth, or unwillingness to find it, or
by some other voluntary sin: And for these I dare not
flatter them with hope of pardon; but let me tell you, it
is not the error of the understanding, but the sin of their
will that truly and properly damns them: But for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
I am confident, that nothing is more contumelious
to the goodness of God, than to think that he will damn
any such; for he should damn men that truly love him,
and desire to serve him, for doing that which all things
considered, was impossible for them not to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> If it is said, that pride of their own understanding
made them not submit to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to her
guidance, and that for this, being a voluntary sin, they
may be justly damned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> I answer, that whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> be the
guide of all men is the Question, and therefore not to be
begged but proved: that the man we speak of is very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to follow this Guide, could he find any good ground
to believe it is his Guide; and therefore the reason he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
her not, is not pride but ignorance: that as it is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
to obey those whom God hath set over us, so it is
credulity to follow every one that will take upon him to
lead us: that if the <hi>blind lead the blind,</hi> not only the <hi>leader</hi>
but the <hi>follower</hi> shall perish: Lastly, that the present
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> pretends very little and indeed nothing
of moment, to get the office of being Head and Guide
of the Church, which Antichrist when he cometh, may
not and will not make use of, for the very same end and
purpose; and therefore he had reason, not to be too sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and precipitate, in committing himself to the conduct
of the Pope, for fear of mistaking Antichrist for the Vi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>car
of Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But in all Commonwealths, it is necessary there
should be not only a Law for men to live by, but also a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and speaking Judge to decide their differences arising
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60827:19"/>
about the various Interpretations of the Law, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Controversies would be endless: therefore if such a
judge be so necessary in civil affairs, for the procuring and
preserving our temporal peace and happiness; how much
more necessary is he, for the deciding of those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
that concern the saving and damning of our souls
for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> Hereunto I answer, 1. That if it were as evident
and certain that God hath appointed the Pope or Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the Guide of Faith, and Judge of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
as that the King hath appointed such a one to
be Lord Chief Justice, the having of such a Guide would
be very available, for to preserve the Church in Unity,
and to conduct mens souls to Heaven: but a Judge that has
no better title or evidence to his place, than the Pope has
to that which he pretends to, a Judge that is doubtful and
justly questionable whether he be the Judge or no, is in all
probability likely to produce clean contrary effects, and to
be himself one of the Apples of strife, one of the greatest
subjects of Controversie, and occasion of di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sentions.</p>
            <p>And to avoid this great inconvenience, if God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for this great Office,
certainly he would have said so very plainly and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;
if not frequently, certainly sometimes, once at
least he would have said so in express terms: but he does
not say so, no not so much as once, nor any thing from
whence it may be collected, with any sure or firm conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence:
therefore if it be not certain, certainly it is very
probab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>le he never meant so.</p>
            <p>Again, in Civil Controversies the case can hardly be so
put, that there should be any necessity that the same man
should be Judge and Party: but in matters of Religion,
wherein all have equal interest, every man is a party, and
engaged to judge for temporal respects, this way or that
way, and therefore not fit to be a Judge. But what then
if he which was with so much clamor and so little reason
vouched, for the Infallibility of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do tell
you plainly, there is no living Judge on Earth appointed
by God, to decide the Controversies arising amongst
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60827:19"/>
Christians; nor no way to determine them but Scripture.
His words are express and formal, and need no other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
but a true interpretation.</p>

<hi>Impeccable;</hi> which yet <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> I believe do
not pretend to.</p>
            <p>The Second place is liable to the same exceptions; the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not spoken of in it: but <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem;</hi>
and it will <hi>serve as well nay</hi> better to prove <hi>Impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cability</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The third place is the <hi>Achilles</hi> for this opinion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
every writer Triumphs; but I wonder they should do
so; considering the Covenant here spoken of is made, not
with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but with <hi>Zion</hi> and them that
turn from transgression in <hi>Iacob,</hi> the words are: <hi>And
the Rede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

from transgression in</hi> Jacob <hi>saith the Lord. As for me, this
is my Covenant with them saith the Lord; My Spirit that
is in thee and my Words,</hi> &amp;c. Now if the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
be <hi>Zion</hi> and they that turn from iniquity in <hi>Iacob,</hi> they
may have Title to this Covenant; if not they must for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear,
and leave it to the <hi>Iews</hi> after their Conversion; to
whom it is appropriated by a more Infallible Interpreter
than the <hi>Pope;</hi> I mean S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. 26. And it

shall never cease importuning God, for the sending of the

               <hi>The 5th place had they set down entirely, for very
shame they could not have urged it for the Infallibility
of the</hi> Roman Church. <hi>The words are,</hi> Behold the days
come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant with
the House of <hi>Israel,</hi> and with the House of <hi>Judah;</hi> not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Covenant which I made with their Fathers—But
this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the House
of <hi>Israel</hi>—After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my
Law in their inward parts and write it in their Hearts, and I
will be their God and they shall be my People; and they shall
teach no more every man his Neighbour and every man his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
saying, know the Lord; for they shall all know me from
the least of them to the greatest of them, saith the Lord. <hi>And
now I have transcribed the place, I think it superfluous to
make any other answer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The same Answer and no other will I make also to
the 6th place. The words are.</hi> Therefore say unto the
House of <hi>Israel;</hi> thus saith the Lord God, I do not this for your
sakes O House of <hi>Israel,</hi> but for my holy names sake, <hi>ver.</hi> 22.
I will take you from among the Heathen, and gather you out
of all Countries, and will bring you into your own Land, <hi>v.</hi> 24.
Then will I sprinkle clean Water upon you, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. A new
heart also will I give you, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. And I will put my Spirit
in you and cause you to walk in my Statutes, and ye shall keep
my judgments and do them, <hi>ver.</hi> 27. And ye shall dwell in
the Land that I gave to your Fathers: I will also save you from
all your uncleannesses, and I will call for the Corn and will
encrease it, and lay no Famine upon you. And the desolate Land
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60827:22"/>
shall be tilled, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. And they shall say, this Land that
was desolate, is become like the Garden of <hi>Eden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 7th place also carries its answer in its forehead: <hi>Thus
saith the Lord God, behold I will take the Children of</hi> Israel
<hi>from among the</hi> Heathen <hi>whether they be gone; and I will
make them one Nation in the Land upon the mountains of</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:
<hi>and one King shall be King to them all,</hi> &amp;c. to the end
of the Chapter. In all which place, he that can find a
Syllable of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> he must have better eyes
than I have.</p>
            <p>The next (8th) place would be very pregnant for the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if of courtesie we would grant, that
whatsoever is promised to <hi>Israel,</hi> is intended to them. As
you may see in the place at large, from <hi>ver.</hi> 17. to the end
of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>The 9th and last place out of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> had it been
urged by a Protestant; it would have been thought a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
Answer to have said, That Mystical Texts are not
fit to argue upon; but if this will not serve, then we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
1. That there is no mention nor intimation of the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 2. That it proves either too much or
nothing at all: that is, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is impec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,

with them, not only to keep them from all damnable

might be done. But certainly these are <gap reason="foreign">

a part of their Faith who are members of the

               <hi>Reply.</hi> That which is the last Reason, why you believe
the Scripture to be the written Word of God and unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Traditions his unwritten word; and this or that to be
the true sense of Scripture, that is to you the foundation of
your Faith, and such unto you is the Infallible Authority
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Therefore unto you it is not only
a part of your faith, but also such a part as is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all other parts. Therefore you are deceived if you
think, there is any more opposition between being a part
of the faith and the foundation of other parts of it; than
there is between being a part of a house and the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of it. But whether you will have it the foundation of your
faith, or only a part of it, for the present purpose it is all one.</p>

Church be not absolutely overthrown, by proving the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is, if the Error be in those things wherein she

               <hi>Reply.</hi> And this here spoken of, whether it be lawful to
offer Tapers and Incense to the honour of the Blessed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
is I hope a Question concerning a point of Faith.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether offering a Cake to the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
be not as lawful, as to offer Incense and Tapers and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
other oblations to the same Virgin?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is as lawful to offer a Cake to her honour as
Wax-Tapers, but neither the one, nor the other may be
offered to her, or her honour, as the term or object of the
Action. For to speak properly, nothing is offered to her
or to her honour, but to God in the honour of the Blessed
Virgin. For Incense, it is a foul slander that it is offered
any way to the Blessed Virgin; for that incensing which
is used in the time of Mass, is ever understoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by all sorts
of people to be directed to God only.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> If any thing he offered to her, she is the Object
of that oblation; as if I see water, and through water
something else, the water is the object of my sight, though
not the last object. If I honour the Kings Deputy, and
by him the King, the Deputy is the object of my action,
though not the final object: And to say these things may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:60827:24"/>
be offered to her, but not as to the object of the action, is to
say they may be offered to her, but not to her. For what
else is meant by the object of an action, but that thing on
which the action is imployed, and to which it is directed?</p>
            <p>If you say, that by the object of the action, you mean
the final object only wherewith the action is termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
you should then have spoken more properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly,
and not have denied her simply to be the object
of this action, when you mean only she is not such a kind
of object: no more than you may deny a man to be a living
creature, meaning only that he is not a horse.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I say, it is not required of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks
when they offer Tapers to the Saints, that by an actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
they direct their action actually to God; but it is
held sufficient, that they know and believe that the Saints
are in Subordination and near Relation to God, and that
they give this honour to the Saints because of this relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
And to God himself rather habitually and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
than actually, expresly and formally. As many men
honour the Kings Deputy, without having any present
thought of the King, and yet their action may be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
an honour to the King, being given to his Deputy, only
because he is his Deputy, and for his relation to the King.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I say, there is no reason or ground in the
world, for any man to think, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> did not
chuse the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for the object of their worship, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than any other Woman or any other Creature, meerly
for her relation to Christ; and by consequence there is no
ground to imagine, but that at least habitually and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretative,
they directed their action unto Christ, if not
actually and formally. And <hi>Ergo,</hi> if that be a sufficient
defence for the Papists, that they make not the Blessed
Virgin the final object of their worship, but worship her
not for her own sake, but for her relation unto Christ:
<hi>Epiphanius</hi> surely did ill to charge the <hi>Collyridians</hi> with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
having nothing to impute to them, but only that he
was informed, that they offered a Cake to the honour of
the Blessed Virgin, which honour yet they might, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
question did give unto her for her relation unto Christ,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60827:25"/>
and so made her not the last object and term of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship:
and from hence it is evident, that he conceived the
very action it self, substantially and intrinsically malitious,
<hi>i. e.</hi> he believed it a sin that they offered to her at all: and
so by their action put her in the place of God by giving
unto her this worship proper to God; and not that they
terminated their action finally in her, or did i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> very deed
think her to be a God, and not a Creature.</p>
            <p>But to speak properly, <hi>you say,</hi> nothing is offered to her or to
her honour, but to God in honour of the Blessed Virgin.</p>
            <p>Belike then if through <hi>Henly</hi> I go from hence to <hi>London,</hi>
I may not be said properly to go to <hi>Henly,</hi> but only to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>

with such shifting Sophistry; either leave your practice of
offering to Saints if it be naught, or colour it not over with
such empty distinctions if it be good: Christ saith to his

who doubts, but they that heard the Apostles did properly
hear them, and they that despised them did properly despise
them, though their action staid not in them, but reached
up to Heaven and to Christ himself. You pray to Saints
and Angels, though you do not terminate your prayers
in them; and yet I doubt not but your prayers to Saints,
may be as properly called prayers, as those you make to
God himself. For though these be of a more excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
than they, yet do they agree in the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that they are both prayers. As though a Man be
a more excellent living creature than a ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se, yet he
agrees with him in this, that both are living creatures. But
if nothing be properly offered to her or to her honor, why
do you in your sixth Answer say, you may offer any thing
to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by way of presents and gif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Certainly he that offers by

               </gap>ly as he that offers

               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:60827:25"/>
But if it were so as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ou say (which is most false) that
you did not properly offer to the Blessed Virgin, but to God
in honour of her; yet in my judgment, this would not
qualifie or mend the matter but make it worse. For first,
who taught you, that in the time of the Gospel (after the
accomplishment of the prediction, <hi>sacrifice and offering thou
wouldest not but a body hast thou prepared me:</hi> after this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of it in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews, He ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
away the first that he may establish the second</hi>) that it is
still lawful to offer Tapers or Incense to God. Secondly,
in my understanding, to offer to God in honour of the
Virgin, is more derogatory from Gods honour, than to
offer to her in the honour of God. For this is in my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
to subordinate God to her, to make her
the terminating and final object of the action; to make
God the way and her the end, and by and through God to
conveigh the worship unto her.</p>
            <p>But for incense, <hi>you say,</hi> it is a soul slander, that it is offered
any way to the Blessed Virgin.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, that your imputing slander to me, is
it self a slander: For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. In your 5th Answer, you have given
a clear intimation that you have never been out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
so that you cannot certainly know, what is the
practice of your Church in this point beyond Sea. And
he that lives amongst you, and has but half an Eye open
and free from prejudice, cannot but see, that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Religion is much more exorbitant in the general practice
of it, than it is in the Doctrine published in Books of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
where it is delivered with much caution and
moderation, nay cunning and dissimulation that it may
be the fitter to win and engage Proselytes; who being
once ensnared, though they be afterwards startled with
strange and unlookt-for practices, yet a hundred to one,
but they will rather stif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s
Infallibility, and blindly follow those guides, to whose
Conduct they have unadvisedly committed themselves,
than come off again with the shame of being reputed
weak and inconstant: so terrible an Idol is this vain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

But to return again to you, I say your ignorance of
the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church beyond the Seas, does
plainly convince that you have rashly and therefore slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derously
charged me with the Crime of slander. As for
your reason you add, consider it again, and you will see
it is worth nothing. For what if incensing in time of
Mass, be understood by all sorts of People to be directed
to God alone (which yet you cannot possibly know) yet
this I hope hinders not, but that in Processions, you may
Incense the Images of the Saints, and consequently (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your Doctrine) do this Honour to the Saints
themselves represented by the Images. I my self (unless
I am very much mistaken) was present when this very
thing was done to the Picture of Saint <hi>Benet</hi> or Saint
<hi>Gregory</hi> in the Cloyster of Saint <hi>Vedastus</hi> in the Monastery
in <hi>Doway.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed what a ridiculous inconsequence is it, to
think that Wax Tapers may lawfully be offered to the
Saints and incense may not: or if Incense may not, which
you seem to disclaim as impious, that Wax Tapers may.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> It seems then these Women might offer this
Cake to the honour and name of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> if
they had done it as a <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Present</hi> and not as a <hi>Sacrifice.
Epiphanius</hi> then surely was too hasty to condemn them,
being informed of nothing, but that they offered a Cake
unto her. Methinks before he had put them in his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue,
he should have enquired whether they offered
this Cake as a <hi>Gift</hi> only, or as a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> Certainly had
the practice of offering to Saints by way of gifts, been
the practice of the Church in his time, he would not
have been so uncharitable, as to condemn that action as
impious and Heretical, which might have received so
lawful and pious a construction. But he, good man, it
seems could not conceive a difference between a Sacrifice,
and the offering a Creature by way of Consumption
to the Honour of that to which it is offered. The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Wits of our times I hope have found out another de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
for it, and I shall understand by you what it is.
But if you can find no other, then certainly, though
setting up a Picture or hanging up a Leg or Eye or Ear
in memory of some miraculous cure, obtained by a Saints
intercession, would be a <hi>Gift</hi> or <hi>Present</hi> only; yet offering
of Incense, or burning a Taper in the honour of a Saint,
daub the matter how you will, will be without Question
a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> If you say, that there may be such an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and yet no Sacrifice; I would know then, how you
would prove that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offering was indeed a
Sacrifice? All that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> says of them is but this—<hi>Panem
proponunt &amp; in Mariae nomen offerunt.</hi> And though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60827:27"/>
this offering of theirs was indeed a Sacrifice in the notion
of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> word which I have given it, yet doth he not any

using (as good fortune would have it) any word which

therefore you are fain to help the Dice, and alter every

               </gap>eir offering,
confessed to be an offering, were in propriety of speech
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60827:27"/>
a Sacrifice, to do it for Ends, to shift off a convincing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
to palliate over a foul matter, by putting a verbal
difference where there is none indeed, and all that you
may, <hi>Imperitos rerum in fraudem illicere;</hi> that is—But
I forbear you.</p>
            <p>But Secondly it is pretended, [<hi>they offered this Sacrifice
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the name of the Blessed Virgin:</hi> i. e. <hi>unto her, her
self, directly and terminately as an act of Divine Worship and
adoration due unto her, as unto a Sovereign Power and Deity.</hi>]
And to colour and countenance this strange gloss, many
places are quoted out of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which I will examine
in order as they lie.</p>
            <p>The first place is, <hi>mortuis cultum Divinum praestantes,</hi>
where your meaning is, I believe, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> says the
<hi>Collyridians</hi> did so: but the truth is he says only, <hi>mortuos
colentes;</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> translates it: and therefore here once
again you help the Dice; yet if he had said so, why
should you rather from <hi>cultum divinum</hi> collect that, that
they thought her <hi>God,</hi> than from <hi>mortuis,</hi> that they thought
her <hi>Dead,</hi> and therefore certainly not a God? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this can be no warrant to you, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> charges
them with so thinking: For <hi>Protestants</hi> you know impute
to <hi>Papists</hi> that they give to Saints <hi>cultum divinum,</hi> and yet
they do not impute to them the Heresie of thinking, that
the Saints are Sovereign Powers and Deities: But as
S. <hi>Paul</hi> accuseth the Gentiles, for that knowing God to
be God, <hi>they did not worship him as God,</hi> so on the other
side, <hi>Protestants</hi> condemn <hi>Papists,</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> for ought
we can see hitherto, might condemn the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> for
that knowing the Blessed Virgin not to be God, they yet
worship'd her as God. That is, gave her that worship
which is Gods own peculiar, which yet they might do,
not because they thought her God, but because this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which was indeed proper to God, they might think
not proper, but communicable to such Creatures as were
high in his favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The next place is</hi>—Revera virgo erat honorata, sed
non ad adorationem nobis data, sed ipsa adorans Deum, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:60827:28"/>
I answer that the &amp;c. perhaps conceals something
more pertinent to your purpose, but in the Words set
down there appears to me just nothing; for I can frame
out of them no other Syllogism but this.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in this place says is not to be
adored, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> thought to be God.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Epiphan.</hi> here says the Virgin is not to be adored.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ergo.</hi> The <hi>Collyridians</hi> thought her God.</p>
            <p>Of this Syllogism I deny the Major proposition, and
I believe shall stay as long for a proof of it, as I have
done for an answer to some other discourses, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
written in a few days, have waited now with a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expectation for a promised answer many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>onths. If
you say, you would conclude from these Words, that they
did adore her and therefore thought her God, I have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
already, that they might do this, not because they
thought her God, but because they thought Creatures high
in Gods favour capable of adoration.</p>
            <p>The next place—<hi>Non ut adoretur Virgo, nec ut deum
hanc efficeret</hi>—tells us that Christ took Flesh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
not that she should be adored, nor to make her God:
And this you think imports, that they conceive her God.
Yet if I should, condemning your Practice of offering Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
to her, use the same Words and say,—<hi>Christ took
Flesh of the Virgin, not that she should be adored, or to make
her God:</hi> You would not yet conceive that I charged you
with the Heresie of believing her God, but only of the
impiety of giving to her that worship which was peculiar
to God: and why then might not <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> having like
occasion, use the same words to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> upon the
same, and no other ground.</p>
            <p>The next place—<hi>Mariam nemo adoret Deo debetur
hoc mysterium,</hi>—is so far from proving your imagination,
that it strongly confirms my assertion, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did
not impute to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the opinion, <hi>that the Virgin</hi>
Mary <hi>was God.</hi> If I should say to a <hi>Papist,</hi> the Blessed
Virgin is not to be worshiped with the worship of <hi>Hyperdau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi>
because such worship is due only to the Mother of
God, would they not say I were mad and argued against
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60827:28"/>
my self, for that they believed she was the Mother of God.
By like reason, if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> knew, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi>
believed the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> to be God, he reasoned as wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against himself in saying—<hi>Mariam nemo adoret, Deo
debetur hoc mysterium</hi>—For it is very true (might they
have said) this service is due to God alone, but you know
our Belief and Profession that she is God, and therefore
by your own rule capable of this worship.</p>
            <p>The next place is—<hi>Pro Deo hanc introducere studue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi>
And may not this be justly said to any man, who
to any thing besides God, gives that worship which is
proper and peculiar unto God? What if to man that
should teach—<hi>The</hi> Pope <hi>had power to dispense with men
for the keeping of Gods Laws</hi>—I should say, <hi>pro Deo Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam
introducis.</hi> Must I of necessity mean that that man
did verily believe the <hi>Pope</hi> not a man but a Sovereign
Power and Deity? S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us that <hi>Covetousness is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;</hi>
he tells us of some, <hi>whose God is their Belly;</hi> is it
therefore consequent, that every covetous man doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
believe his <hi>Gold,</hi> and every Glutton his <hi>Belly,</hi> to be
indeed a Sovereign Power and Deity? Away with such
fopperies. Whosoever loves, or fears, or trusts in any thing
more than God, may yet be justly said to make that his
God, and whosoever should worship any Creature with
that external worship which God has appropriated to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
might justly be said to bring in that Creature for
God. S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us of some, who <hi>in words professed God,</hi>
yet <hi>fact is negabant, in their deeds deny him:</hi> so these on the
contrary, may in their words deny this Creature to be
God, and in their Hearts not think it so, yet seeing their
actions to it are as if it were God, they may be justly
charged, that with their deeds they make this Creature
God.</p>

omniscience and almost omnipotence to her, as I can
easily make good they do, partly out of the Offices of
their Church, partly out of private mens Works, but set
out with Licence and approbation) what I say, if upon
this consideration I should affirm, <hi>pro Deo ipsam introducere
conantur.</hi> Would it therefore be consequent, that I must
impute this Blasphemy to them, that they believed and
taught her to be a Sovereign Power and Deity? I trow
not. And therefore <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might say the same of the

God.)</hi> As much to the purpose as—<hi>Tityre tu patulae</hi>—for
what if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> say, she is not God, and therefore
not to be adored, does it therefore follow that the <hi>Collyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
believed she was a God? He that knows Logick or
sense, cannot but know, that he that will confute an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
conclusion, must choose such principles to do it,
to which his Adversary consents, and out of that which
he grants prove that which he denies; or if his first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
be not agreed to by his Adversary, he must prove
them in the end by such as are agreed to; or else he does
nothing. And therefore seeing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> thinks it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
for the convincing of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfulness
of the practice, to say, she was not God: it
is evident, that so far was he from imputing to them the
belief that she was God, that he seems rather to take
the contrary for a principle agreed upon between them,
which it was sufficient to say and superfluous to prove.
This answer I thought good to make, while I conceived
that here <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had denied the Person of the Virgin
<hi>Mary</hi> to be God; but after upon better consideration I
sound that <hi>Petavius</hi> had abused me with adding to <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60827:29"/>
of his own—<hi>Illa fuit</hi>—and that <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
says not here, <hi>non tamen Deus (she was not God)</hi> of her
<hi>Person,</hi> but of her <hi>Body;</hi> and as yet I do not understand
that you impute to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the belief, that her
Body was God.</p>
            <p>The next place—<hi>Mulierem eam appellavit,</hi> &amp;c.—says
no more but this; that our Saviour calls the Blessed
Virgin <hi>Woman,</hi> that no man might think her any thing
more than a Woman, as it were prophetically refuting the
Schisms and Heresies which would be in the World: lest
some out of excess of admiration of her, might fall into
the Dotage of this Heresie. Thus far <hi>Epiphanius:</hi> but
then the Question will be, what was this Heresie. You
say the belief that she was God. I say, not that she was
God, but that they might lawfully offer to her. And as I
deny not but it follows, <hi>she is a Woman, therefore not a God;</hi>
so I think you will grant it follows as justly, <hi>she is a Woman,
therefore not to be adored with offerings.</hi> And therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the words lie indifferently between us, and are not
expressly and especially here applied, for the refutation of
that Heresie which you pretend they were guilty of, I see
no reason why <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might not as well intend them
for that purpose which I conceive, as for that which you
conceive.</p>
            <p>The last place alledged tells us, <hi>that she was begotten and
Born as other Men and Women are.</hi> Which if the <hi>Collyridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
had thought her God, Eternal and absolutely without
beginning, should not have been barely said but proved,
as being in effect the very point in question; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
seeing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> contents himself with saying so
without proof, it is evident he never thought they would
make difficulty to grant it, and consequently that they
did not believe her to be God Eternal.</p>
            <p>But then again, if the Rule be good which part of your
proofs depend upon, That whatever <hi>Epiphanius</hi> denies in
this discourse, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> held (for upon that
ground from—<hi>Non &amp; Deum hanc efficeret: &amp; non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Deus,</hi> you conclude they believed her God) If I
say this Rule be good, then you should be constant to it,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60827:30"/>
and now that he says,—<hi>Non tamen aliter genita est prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hominum naturam, (she was not begotten in a different way
from other men)</hi> you should infer, that they believed not
that she was God, but that she was otherwise Born and
Begotten than the ordinary sort of Men. And so where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
he says before—<hi>Non tamen corpus de caelo tulit—(her
Body was not from Heaven)</hi> you should infer, that
they believed her Body came from Heaven. And again
from those—<hi>Sanctum erat Mariae corpus non tamen
Deus</hi>—you should collect that they though not only
her person, but her Body to be God: or if these be wild
and weak deductions, then you must acknowledge that
I have done yours some favour in vouchsafing them a
particular answer.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether in the Church of <hi>Roman,</hi> it be not
an approved and perpetually practised worship of the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Virgin, that Incense (which was never anciently
offered unto any, either by <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but to the
true, or to a supposed true God) and Tapers and divers
other oblations, should be offered to her honour?</p>

it be a practice of the Church and approved by her.
What her practice is abroad I know not; here at home
I see no such practice; nor do I know any approbation of
it, in any of her publick declarations: But this I know,
that there is nothing in it unlawful or savouring of the
<hi>Collyridian Superstition,</hi> to offer Wax, Tapers or any other
thing at the Memories of the Blessed Virgin or any other
Canonized Saint, either as means to procure their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,

            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I do not deny, but a practice may be <hi>tolerated</hi>
in a Church, and not <hi>approved.</hi> As the <hi>Publick Stews</hi> are
in <hi>Italy,</hi> and <hi>Usury</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> But it is one thing to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
with condemnation, another to Tolerate without
condemnation, nay with condemnation of those that
should oppose or condemn it. And such I doubt not upon
examination, you may find is this practice, general in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> offering Tapers to the Saints and
for their honour. I say, not only to God, at the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Saints, as you would mince the matter, which
yet were a groundless superstition, (God having appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no such Sacrifice to be offered to him under the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel)
but to the Saints themselves and to their honour, prove
this lawful for either of those purposes you mention,
either to procure their intercession or as Monuments of
thankfulness for benefits obtained by it, and then you shall
do something. Otherwise you will but trifle as now you
have done: For instead of telling us what may be done
<hi>de jure,</hi> you tell us what of Old has been done <hi>de facto.</hi>
As if <hi>ab antiquo,</hi> and <hi>a principio</hi> were all one; or as if the
Church (as we pretend) being subject to corruption, part
of this corruption might not possibly have come in S. <hi>Austins</hi>
or <hi>Theodorets</hi> time; yet this I say not, as if I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
the Tryal of this cause by S. <hi>Austin</hi> or <hi>Theodoret;</hi> but
because I am sure you will not be Tryed by the Fathers,
no not the consent of Fathers in all things: and therefore
there is no reason nor equity in the World, that you should
serve your selves with their Authority in any thing.</p>
            <p>But now what is it, which was done in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time,
that may justifie the Practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? was
there then any approved offering of Wax, Tapers and
Incense, to the Queen of Heaven or any other Saint?
<hi>nil horum:</hi> you neither do nor can produce any thing out
of S. <hi>Austin</hi> to this purpose. But what then is it? Why
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:60827:31"/>
forsooth, they were used to adorn their Tombs: <hi>Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam
verò laudem &amp; spolia ampla;</hi> of Old in S. <hi>Austins</hi>
time they were used to adorn their Tombs with Flowers,
therefore we may offer Tapers to them. Truly an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<hi>Enthymeme,</hi> but I fear the concealed proposition
which shold make it a <hi>Syllogism,</hi> hides its head for shame
and dares not appear: yet we will for once make bold
to draw it forth into light, that you may look upon it
and tell us how you like it. This therefore it is.</p>
            <p>Whose soever Tombs we adorn, to them and to their honour
we may offer Wax Tapers.</p>
            <p>Consider it I pray you, and if you approve it, then
approve also of offering Tapers not only to Canonize
Saints, but to all Christians that may have Monuments
in Churches. For all their Tombs may be adorned, with
more pretious and lasting Ornaments that Flowers; yet
if you had proved but this only, that in S. <hi>Austins</hi> time,
they adorned the Saints Tombs with Flowers by these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
signs to procure their Intercession; this, though
not much to the purpose, had been not absolutely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
us. But your quoted places prove not so much as
this; and yet I believe you quoted the best you could find.
Nay they prove not they did adorn their Tombs with
Flowers at all, much less that they did it for your pretended
purpose; such fools you think to deal with, that will
take any thing for any thing. Your first place, I say,
proves it not, unless out of meer courtesie we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
by <hi>ferebat, she brought to adorn</hi> S. Stephens <hi>Tomb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second proves it not, unless we give you leave after
<hi>Altari</hi> (without warrant from S. <hi>Austin)</hi> to put in, S. <hi>Stephani,</hi>
whereas I am yet to seek for any place in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> where
he calls any Altar, the Altar of such or such a Saint,
which yet I think they forbore not for the unlawfulness,
but for fear of misconstruction.</p>
            <p>Then for <hi>Theodoret,</hi> he tells us indeed of Vows made,
of monuments of thankfulness dedicated, for benefits ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the intercession of the Martyrs. But here also
I fear your Conscience tells you, that you abuse us and
hide your self in ambiguities. For to whom does <hi>Theodoret</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:60827:31"/>
say these Vows were made? to whom were these monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of thankfulness dedicated? What, to the Author?
or Procures of the received favours? To God, or to the
Martyrs? If to the Martyrs, that had been something to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
though not home to your purpose: For there is a
a wide difference between offering of a Creature by way
of Consumption (as was never lawfully done but to God
alone, as a profession that he is the Lord of the Creature)
and erecting a permanent Monument to a Saints honour;
which I doubt not but it may lawfully be done to a living
Saint, much more to the memory of a Martyr. But
<hi>Theodoret</hi> in the place, hath not so much as this: Nay it
is evident that these gifts he speaks of, were both Vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and payed to God himself. His words are—<hi>Piè
precatos ea consequi,</hi> &amp;c.—that they which pray piously,
obtain the things which they desire, they paying of their
Vowed presents in the sign of their recovered health, doth
abundantly testifie. For their Lord accepts most gratiously
these presents how mean so ever.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether according to the Doctrine of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, this may not be done lawfully by Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Children, and men that are not Priests?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> They may offer any thing by way of <hi>gifts</hi> and
<hi>presents,</hi> by the Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; But it
is contrary to the <hi>Roman</hi> Doctrine, for any other than
Priests, to offer any thing by way of <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> as the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyridians</hi>
did.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply. Aristotle</hi> says most truly, that true Definitions
(he means I think of the terms of the conclusion to be
demonstrated) are the best principles of Science: and
therefore want of them, must needs be a cause of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and confusion in any discourse. Let me therefore
here request you to set down what is a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and how
distinguished from an oblation by way of <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>present,</hi>
and you will quickly see, that if the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offering
a Cake to the Blessed Virgin were indeed a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> your
offering a Taper to her, must likewise be so. For a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi>
is nothing else (for ought I know) but the oblation
of any Creature by way of <hi>Consumption,</hi> to the honour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60827:32"/>
of that, whatsoever it is, to which it is offered. For if
you include in the definition, that this offering must be
intended to the highest Lord of all: So is, as you pretend,
your offering of Tapers to the Blessed Virgin, intended
to God finally, though not immediately. If you say it must
be directed immediatly to him; and is, not only <hi>no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sacrifice,</hi> but simply <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> unless it be so: I say
you may as well require to the essence of a Sacrifice, that
it be offered by a Priest, and from thence conclude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the <hi>Collyridians</hi> were, you say, no Priests, their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
was no Sacrifice. For the object of the Action
is as extrinsecal to the essence of it, as the efficient; And
therefore if the defect of a due and legitimate Offerer,
cannot hinder but that an offering may be a true Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
neither will the want of a due and lawful object be
any hindrance but still it may be so. Secondly, I say,
this is to confound the essence of things with the lawful
use of them; in effect as if you should say, that a Knife,
if misimployed, were a Knife no longer. Thirdly, it is
to make it not unlawful, to offer Incense (which yet you
seem somewhat scrupulous of) or Burnt-offerings to the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> or the Saints, or even to living Men,
provided you know and believe and profess them to be
Men and not Gods. For this once supposed, these offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
will be no longer Sacrifices, and to offer to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
offerings that are not Sacrifices, you say, by the
Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is lawful: It is lastly,
to deny (which is most ridiculous) that the <hi>Pagans</hi> did
indeed Sacrifice to any of their inferiour Gods.</p>
            <p>7. <hi>Demand.</hi> If it be said, that this worship which they
give to the Blessed Virgin is not that of <hi>Latria,</hi> but that
of <hi>Dulia</hi> or <hi>Hyperdulia,</hi> for that they do not esteem her
God: or if it be said, that their worship to her is not
finally terminated neither, but given her for her relation
to Christ. I demand, whether as it is, in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
a great crime for him that knows God, not to
worship him as God, so it be not as great a crime, for
him that knows her not to be God, yet to worship her
(as if she were God) with the worship which is proper
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60827:32"/>
and hath been alwaies appropriated to God alone, such
is the <hi>worship of oblations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>worship of oblations,</hi> as <hi>worship</hi> is taken larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>oblations</hi> for a <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>present,</hi> was never
appropriate to God alone; take <hi>worship</hi> and <hi>oblations</hi> in any
higher sense, and so it is not allowed in the Church of
<hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The <hi>oblation</hi> of things by way of <hi>Consumption,</hi> is the
worship I spoke of; this is a higher matter, than that of

<hi>Rome,</hi> to be imployed on, and directed into, (though
not terminated in) the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other Saints.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether any thing can be said for the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Doctrine and practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church in
this matter, which might not also have been as justly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
for the justification of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> in their
opinion and practice; seeing it was never imputed to
them, that they accounted the Blessed Virgin God, or
that they believed in more Gods than one. And seeing
their choosing her out, rather than any other Woman
or any other Creature for the object of their Devotion,
shews plainly, that they gave it her for her Relation to
Christ?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The <hi>Collyridians</hi> could not say this, as appears
by what has been said before: As it is a most shameless
slander upon Gods Church, and such as (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
will lie heavy upon his Soul that uttered it, that
the <hi>Collyridians</hi> might as justly and truly have said all
this for themselves as <hi>Papists</hi> for themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> To this I reply four things. 1. That to my last
and most convincing reason, you have answered (as much
as you could I believe, but yet you have answered) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and I am well content you should do so; for
where nothing is to be had, the King himself must lose
his right. 2. That if I had thought or spoke better of the
<hi>Collyridians</hi> than they deserved, yet I cannot see how this
had been to slander the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> 3. That I did
not positively affirm, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> might do so,
but desired only it might be inquired into and examined,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60827:33"/>
whether for the reasons alledged they might not do so.
4. And lastly, upon a thorow examination of the matter,
I do now affirm, what before I did not, that the <hi>Collyridians</hi>
for ought appears to the contrary, might justly and truly
have said for the justification of their practice, as much,
nay the very same things that the <hi>Papists</hi> do for theirs. For
they might have said, we are Christians and believe the
Scripture, and believe there is but one God. We offer
not to the Blessed Virgin, as believing she is God, but
the Mother of God: our worship of her is not absolute
but relative, not terminated in her, but given to her for
her Sons sake: And if our practice may be allowed, we
are content to call our Oblation, not a Sacrifice, but a
present: neither is there any reason, why it should be
called a Sacrifice, more than the Offering and Burning
a Taper to the honour of the same Virgin. All this the
<hi>Collyridians</hi> might have said for themselves: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I believe, you will have more cause to repent you
for daubing over impiety with untempered Morter, than
I shall have for slandering the <hi>Roman</hi> Church with a
matter of truth.</p>
            <p>9. <hi>Demand.</hi> Whether therefore, one of the two must
not of necessity follow: that either the Ancient Church
Erred in condemning the Opinion and Practice of the
<hi>Collyridians</hi> as Heretical, or else that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
Errs, in approving the same opinion, and the same pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
in effect, which in them was condemned. That
is, whether the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must not be Heretical
with the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> or else the <hi>Collyridians</hi> Catholicks
with the Church of <hi>Rome?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> It appears by the former answers, that neither
did the Ancient Church Err, in condemning the opinion
and practice of the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> as Heretical, nor doth
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> approve the same opinion or the same
practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> The Substance of the former answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is but this.
That the <hi>Papists</hi> offer to the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and other
Saints Wax Tapers by way of <hi>gift</hi> or <hi>present,</hi> not of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice;
and to her not as to a God, but as the Mother of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60827:33"/>
God: but that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> offered to her by way of
Sacrifice, as to a Sovereign Power and Deity. To this I
have replied and proved, that it no way appears, that the
<hi>Collyridians</hi> did believe the Blessed Virgin to be a Sovereign
Power and Deity, or that she was not subordinate to God.
Then that their offering might be called a <hi>gift,</hi> as well as
the <hi>Papists,</hi> and the <hi>Papists a Sacrifice</hi> as well as theirs;
both of them being a <hi>Consumption</hi> of a Creature in hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of the Blessed Virgin, and neither of them more than
so: and therefore either the <hi>Collyridians</hi> must stand with
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fall with the
<hi>Collyridians.</hi> It had been perhaps sufficient for me, thus to
have vindicated my Assertion from contrary objections,
without taking on my self the burden of proving a Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:
yet to free from all doubt the conformity of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church with the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> in this point, I think
it will be necessary to shew, and that by many very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Arguments, that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did not impute to them
the pretended Heresie of <hi>believing</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary God:</hi>
for then that other Evasion, that their oblation is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
and the <hi>Papists</hi> is not, together with this pretence
will of it self fall to the ground.</p>
            <p>Now an opinion may be imputed to a man two ways:
either because he holds and maintains it expresly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
and in terms: or because it may by a rational de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
be collected from some other opinion which
he does hold: In this latter sense I deny not but <hi>Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
might impute this opinion we speak of to the <hi>Colly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians,</hi>
as a consequence upon their practice, which pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
they esteemed lawful. But that they held it and
owned it formally and in terms, this I say <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
does not impute to them, which I think for these seven
reasons.</p>
            <p>My first Reason is, because he could not justly do so,
and therefore without evident proof we may not say he
did so: for this were to be uncharitable to him, in making
him uncharitable to others. Now I say he could not just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
charge them with this opinion, because he was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of nay such opinion that they held, but only of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60827:34"/>
their practice, and this practice was no sufficient proof
that they held this opinion. That his information reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no further than their Practice, appears out of his own
Words. <hi>I have heard</hi> (saith he. Haeres. 78.) <hi>another thing
with great astonishment: that some being madly affected to the
Blessed Virgin, endeavour to bring her in in Gods place, being
mad and besides themselves: For they report that certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in</hi> Arabia <hi>have devised this Vanity, to have meetings,
and offer a Cake to the Blessed Virgin:</hi> The same practice
he sets down <hi>Haeres.</hi> 79. But that he was informed of any
such opinion that they held, he has not a Word or Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to any such purpose; and yet if he had been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of any, here had been the place to set it down: which
certainly writing his Book rather of Heretical opinions
than practices, he would not have omitted to do; if there
had been occasion: his silence therefore is a sufficient
Argument, that he was not informed of any such opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that they held.</p>
            <p>Now that their practice was no assurance that they
held this opinion, it is manifest; because they might
ground it not upon this opinion <hi>that she was God,</hi> but
upon another as false, though not altogether so impious,
<hi>That the Worship of Oblations was not proper to God alone.</hi>
And therefore, though <hi>Epiphanius</hi> might think o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Fear that
possibly they might ground their practice upon that other
impious opinion, and therefore out of abundan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> caution
confute that also, as he doth obliquely and in a word, and
once only in all his long discourse, by telling them that
our Saviour called her <hi>Woman;</hi> yet he had no ground
from their practice to assure himself, that certainly they
did hold so. Nay Justice and Reason and Charity would,
that he should incline himself to believe, that they ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their practice upon that other opinion, which had less
impiety in it, that is, that this worship of Oblations, was
not proper to God, but communicable to Creatures high
in his favour.</p>
            <p>My second is, Because if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had known, that
these <hi>Collyridians</hi> held the Blessed Virgin to be a Supream
Power and Deity; this being a far greater mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er than
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60827:34"/>
offering a Cake to her, should in all probability rather
have given them their denomination: at least when he
sets down what their Heresie was, he would have made
this part of it, that they did believe so: But to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in his <hi>Anacaephaleosis,</hi> p. 130. he thus describes them.
<hi>They that offer to the name of the Blessed Virgin Cakes, who
are called</hi> Collyridians. And again, p. 150. <hi>They that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the Blessed Virgin Cakes who are called</hi> Collyridians:
So to the 79th. Heresie he gives this Title, <hi>Against the</hi>
Collyridians <hi>who offer to</hi> Mary: So <hi>Haeres.</hi> 78, and 79.
He sets down what he heard of them; but no where that
they held this opinion of her: I conclude therefore, that
he never conceived this opinion to be a part of their He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie,
and they were no further chargeable with it, than
as a probable consequent upon their practice.</p>
            <p>My third is, Because had the <hi>Collyridians</hi> held her God,
they would have worshiped her all the year long, and
not only once a year at a Solemn time, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> says
they did.</p>
            <p>My fourth is, Because if <hi>Epiphanius</hi> had known that
they held her God, he would questionless have urged them
with those Attributes that are given to God in Scripture,
as Eternity, Immortallity, Impossibility, Omnipotence,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And shewed them, that if they believed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
they could not think of her any of those things;
if they did not, they had no reason to think of her any
thing more than of an ordinary Woman.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My fifth is, because had their opinion been, that the
Blessed Virgin was God; a great part of</hi> Epiphanius'<hi>s dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
were plainly ridiculous; both where he says only
without proof, she was not a God but a Mortal Creature,
which to them that held the contrary should not have
been said, but proved: But especially where he speaks
to this purpose (as he does very frequently) that the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of Oblations was not to be given to Angels or Men,
much less to Women, but only to God: for what had
that been to the</hi> Collyridians, <hi>if they thought her (as is
pretended) a Sovereign Power and Deity? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
was it for</hi> Epiphanius <hi>to ask,</hi> Quis prophetam; What
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:60827:35"/>
prophet ever permitted, that a Man, much less a Woman
should be adored, though he be yet alive. Nor <hi>John</hi> nor
<hi>Tecla,</hi> nor any other Saint. For neither shall the Old Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
have dominion over us, that leaving the Living God,
we should Adore his Creatures. <hi>To what end I say was
all this, if they thought her not a Saint no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Creature,
but God himself and the Lord of all? How did this
Argument touch them?</hi> Ne Angelos quidem—He suffers
not the very Angels to be adored, how much less the Daughter
of <hi>Anna? if they thought her not the Daughter of</hi> Anna,
<hi>but God Eternal; In vain had it been to say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o them—</hi>Not
to a Woman, no nor to a Man, but to God alone, is this
mistery <hi>(of Oblation)</hi> due. <hi>So that the Angels themselves
are not fit Subjects for such an honour. Or again,</hi> Let
the Creature be turned to the Creator: Let shame at length
compel you to worship God alone: <hi>Or lastly, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> so often
repeated—</hi> Let <hi>Mary</hi> be honoured, but the Lord only
adored. <hi>For they might have answered all this in a word,
saying, All this discourse sits besides the Cushion, and
concerns us and our offering nothing at all. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>or we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Blessed Virgin to whom we offer ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther Man
nor Woman, nor Angel, nor Creature, but a Deity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Sixth Reason let it be this, If <hi>Epiphanius</hi> did indeed
say of the <hi>Collyridians</hi> as is pretended, That they held the
Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> God, and so difference their practice from
the <hi>Papists:</hi> Then the Author of this Answer and <hi>Petavius</hi>
in his Translation, needed not to have dictated to him
what he should say, nor make him say so whether he
will or no: But it is evident they do so, as of the
Author of this Answer I have already shewn: and for
<hi>Petavius</hi> his part, I will so present it to your view, that if
you will not shut your Eyes, you shall not choose but
see <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>First then, <hi>Haeres.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. <hi>prope fin.</hi> he <hi>(Petavius)</hi> sets in his
Margent, <hi>quidam Deum Mariam esse, crediderum;</hi> and to
countenance this with a <hi>loquuntur</hi> of his own putting in,
makes them <hi>speak</hi> of her like mad Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> they said she
was God: whereas in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s Greek they say just
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>othing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:60827:35"/>
Secondly, To fasten the pretended Opinion on them,
he translates <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Novum dogma:</hi> presuming it seem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> would easily be mistaken for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and
therefore meanes nothing by it, but a vanity or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He translates <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Illud;</hi> and so makes it look
backward to that pretended <hi>Novum dogma</hi> of the <hi>Collyridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
whereas it signifies there [And] and looks forward
to their practice.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, With the help of a <hi>Colon,</hi> he stops the sense
at <hi>Commentas fuisse,</hi> whereas in <hi>Epiphanius</hi> there is but
a <hi>Comma,</hi> and the sense goes on without suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, With an</hi> adeo ut, <hi>he brings in their action, as
an effect of their former opinion; whereas</hi> Epiphanius <hi>lays
nothing to their charge but their Action only: So that
whereas</hi> Epiphanius <hi>his words truly translated run thus:</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
thing I have received with great astonishment, that others
being mad concerning the Blessed Virgin, have and do go about
to bring her in, in the place of God, being mad, I say, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
themselves: For they report that certain Women in <hi>Arabia</hi>
have brought this vanity of offering a Cake to her name. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavius
<hi>makes them thus—</hi> Not without admiration we have
heard another thing, that some in these things that concern the
most holy Virgin have proceeded to that degree of madness, that
they would obtrude her upon us for a God, and speak of her as
madmen: For they report that certain Women in <hi>Arabia,</hi> have
invented that new Opinion: so that to the Virgins name and
honour, they offer by way of sacrifice a Cake or wreath of
Bread.</p>
            <p>Again in the same <hi>Haeres.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, he translates
advantageously—<hi>per mulieres sacrificia facere.</hi> Whereas
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is more general than <hi>sacrificia facere,</hi> and signifies
<hi>sacris operari,</hi> or <hi>sacros ritus peragere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, in the same place, whereas <hi>Epiphanius</hi> says sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
and absolutely—<hi>Let no man offer to her name,</hi> he makes
it, <hi>Let no man offer sacrifice to her name;</hi> as if you might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
offer any thing provided you do not call it a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:60827:36"/>
So again <hi>Haeres.</hi> 79. besides his putting cunningly—<hi>ipsa
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uit</hi>—which before we took notice of; he makes no scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to put in <hi>Dogma</hi> and <hi>Sacrificium,</hi> wheresoever it may be

the <hi>Collyridians,</hi> he might seem to have involved the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> in the same Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>My Seventh and last Reason is this. Had <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
known that the <hi>Collyridians</hi> held the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> to be a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign
power and Deity, then he could not have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
whether this their offering was to her or to God for
her: whereof yet he seems doubtful and not fully resolved,
as his own words intimate, <hi>Haeres. 79. ad fin. Quam multa</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>How many things may be objected against this Heresie?
for idle Women either worshipping the Blessed Virgin, offer unto
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>r a Cake, or else they take upon them to offer for her this fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
ridiculous oblation. Now both are foolish and from the
Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Arguments I suppose do abundantly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
to any man not viel'd with prejudice, that <hi>Epiphani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
imputed not to the <hi>Collyridians</hi> the Heresie of believing
the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> God: and if they did not think her God,
there is then no reason imaginable why their oblation of
a <hi>Cake,</hi> should not be thought a <hi>Present,</hi> as well as the

            <head>IV. An Argument drawn from the admitting Infants
to the Eucharist, as without which they could not
be saved, against the Churches Infallibility.</head>
            <p>THE Condition without the performance whereof no
man can be admitted to the Communion of the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> is this; that he believe firmly and without doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whatsoever the Church requires him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o believe:
More distinctly and particularly thus:</p>
            <p>He must believe all that to be divine Revelation which
that Church teaches to be such; as the Doctrin of the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Hypostatical union of two natures in the person
of Christ. The procession of the Holy Ghost from the
Father and the Son: the Doctrin of Transubstantiation,
and such like.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever that Church teaches to be necessary, he
must believe to be necessary. As Baptism for Infants;
Faith in Christ, for those that are Capable of Faith; Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
for those that have committed mortal sin after
Baptism, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever that Church declares expedient and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he must believe to be expedient and profitable: as
Monastical Life: Prayer to Saints: Prayer for the Dead:
going on Pilgrimages: The use of Pardons: Veneration
of holy Images and Reliques: Latin Service where the
people understand it not: Communicating the Laity in
one kind and such like.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever that Church holdeth lawful, he must believe
lawful: As to Marry: to make distinction of Meats, as if
some were clean and others unclean: to flie in time of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution:
for them that serve at the Altar, to live by the
Altar: to testifie a truth by Oath, when a lawful Magistrate
shall require it: to possess Riches, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now is it impossible that any man should certainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any thing; unless either it be evident of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

reason) and infallible ground for his belief. Now the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60827:37"/>
Doctrins which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth, it is evident
and undeniable that they are not evident of themselves,
neither evidently true nor evidently credible. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that will believe them, must of necessity have some
certain and infallible ground whereon to build his belief
of them.</p>
            <p>There is no other ground for a Mans belief of them,
especially in many points, but only an assurance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> No man can be assured
that that Church is infallible and cannot err, whereof he
may be assured that she hath erred, unless she had some new
promise of divine assistance, which might for the future
secure her from danger of erring; but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
pretends to none such.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more certain, than that that Church hath
erred, which hath believed and taught irreconcileable
Contradictions, one whereof must of necessity be an
Error.</p>
            <p>That the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ceiving the Sacrament of the Eucharist is
necessary for Infants, and that the receiving thereof is not
necessary for them: That it is the will of God, that the
Church should administer the Sacrament to them; and
that it is not the will of God that the Church should do so;
are manifest and irreconcileable Contradictions: Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
only, (that which is most evident) that the Eucharist
is the same thing, of the same vertue and efficacy now, as
it was in the primitive Church: That Infants are the
same things they were, have as much need, are capable of
as much benefit by the Eucharist, now as then: As sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to irreverent carriages, then as now. And lastly,
that the present Church is as much bound to provide for
the spiritual good of Infants, as the Ancient Church was:
I say these things supposed, the propositions before set
down are plain and irreconcileable Contradictions: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the present <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth hold the Negative,
and the Ancient Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did hold the Affirmative;
and therefore it is evident, that either the present Church
doth err, in holding something not necessary, which is so;
or that the Ancient Church did err, in holding something
necessary, which was not so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:60827:38"/>
For the Negative Proposition, <hi>viz. That the Eucharist is
not necessary for Infants;</hi> that it is the Doctrin of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it is most manifest. 1. From the
disuse and abolition and prohibition of the contrary Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
practice. For if the Church did conceive it necessary
for them, either simply for their salvation, or else for their
increase or confirmation in grace, and advancement to a
higher degree of glory (unless she could supply some other
way their damage in this thing, which evidently she can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
what an uncharitable sacriledge is it, to debar and
defraud them of the necessary means of their so great spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
benefit? especially seeing the administration of it
might be so ordered, that irreverent casualties might easily
be prevented: which yet should they fall out against the
Churches and Pastors intention, certainly could not offend
God, and in reason should not offend man. Or if the
Church do believe, that upon such a vain fear of irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
(which we see moved not the Ancient Church at all)
she may lawfully forbid such a general, perpetual and
necessary charity, certainly herein she commits a far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
error than the former. Secondly, from the Council
of <hi>Trents</hi> Anathema, denounced on all that hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
in these words. <hi>If any man say that the receiving of
the Eucharist, is necessary for little children, before they come
to years of discretion, let him be Anathema.</hi> Concil. Trid.
Sess. 21. <hi>de communione parvulorum,</hi> Can. 4.</p>
            <p>Now for the Affirmative part of the Contradiction, to
make it evident that that was the Doctrin of the Ancient
Church; I will prove it, First, from the general practice
of the Ancient Church for several Ages. Secondly, by the
direct and formal Testimonies of the Fathers of those
times. Thirdly, by the confession of the most learned
Antiquaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. My First Argument
I form thus. If to communicate Infants was the general
practice of the Ancient Church for many Ages; then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the Church then believed, that the Eucharist was
necessary for them, and very available for their Spiritual
benefit: But it is certain, that the Communicating of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants
was the general practice of the Church for many
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60827:38"/>
Ages: Therefore the Church of those times thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for them. To deny the consequence of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
is to cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

Church in general, that she gave Infants the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
as soon as they were baptized: and that the custome
of giving this Sacrament to little Infants the Church then
observed: and before p. 21. That in those Ages it was
always given to Infants together with Baptism. The same
is likewise acknowledged by <hi>Contzen</hi> in <hi>Iohn 6. ver.</hi> 54. and
by <hi>Thomas a Iesu de proc. salute omnium gentium.</hi> So that
this matter of the practice of the Ancient Church is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
cleared. Seeing therefore the Ancient Church did
use this Custom, and could have no other ground for it,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60827:39"/>
but their belief that this Sacrament was necessary for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
it follows necessarily, that the Church then did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it necessary.</p>
            <p>But deductions, though never so evident, are superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and may be set aside, where there is such abundance
of direct and formal Authentical Testimonies; whereof
some speak in <hi>Thesi,</hi> of the necessity of the Eucharist for all
men, others in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> of the necessity of it for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>My Second Argument, from the Testimonies of the
Fathers of those times I form thus. That Doctrin, in the
affirmative whereof the most eminent Fathers of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church agree, and which none of their contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
have opposed or condemned, ought to be taken for the
Catholick Doctrin of the Church of those times.</p>
            <p>But the most eminent Fathers of the Ancient Church
agree in the Affirmation of this Doctrin, that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
is necessary for Infants; and none of their contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries
have opposed or condemned it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it ought to be
taken for the Catholick Doctrin of the Church of their
times. The Major of this Syllogism is delivered and fully
proved by <hi>Card. Perron,</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Casaubon</hi> 5. obs. and
is indeed so reasonable a postulate, that none but a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
spirit can reject it.</p>
            <p>For confirmation of the Minor, I will alledge, first, their
sentences, which in Thesi affirm the Eucharist to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
necessary for all, and therefore for Infants: and then
their Suffrages, who in Hypothesi avouch the necessity of it
for Infants.</p>
            <p>The most pregnant Testimonies of the first rank are
these: Of <hi>Iraene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

our Union to Christ by the Eucharist, the foundation of
the hope of our resurrection, in these words. <hi>As the bread

and it is a thing confessed by learned Catholicks.</p>
            <p>Cyprian de coena Domini, <hi>and</hi> Tertullian de resur. carnis,
<hi>speak to the same purpose: But I have not their Books by

               </gap>isi manducave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis,
<hi>has many pregnant and plain speeches to our purpose.</hi>
As, the words here spoken are very terrible: verily, saith he,
if a man eat not my flesh, and drink not my blood, he hath no
life in him; for whereas they said before, this could not be done,
he shews it not only not impossible, but also very necessary. <hi>And
a little after;</hi> he often iterates his speech concerning the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
shewing the necessity of the thing, and that by all means
it must be done. <hi>And again,</hi> what means that which he says,
my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; either
that this is the true meat that saves the soul; or to confirm them
in the faith of what he had spoken, that they should not think he
spoke Enigmatically, or parabolically, but knew that by all means
they must eat his body.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But most clear and unanswerable is that place</hi> lib. 3. de
Sacerdotio, <hi>where he saith,</hi> If a man cannot enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven unless he be born again of water and the
holy spirit; and if he which eats not the flesh of our Lord and
drinks not his blood, is cast out of eternal life: And all these
things cannot be done by any other, but only by those holy hands,
the hands, I say of the Priest, how then without their help can
any man, either avoid the fire of hell, or obtain the Crowns
laid up for us.</p>

for the <hi>Thesis, That the Eucharist was held generally necessary
for all.</hi> Now for the <hi>Hypothesis; That the Eucharist was
held necessary for Infants in particular.</hi> Witnesses hereof are
S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> I. and <hi>Eusebius Emissenus,</hi> with
S. <hi>Austin</hi> together with the Author of the Book intituled
<hi>Hypognostica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed does not in terms affirm it, but we have
a very clear intimation of it in his Epistle to <hi>Fidus.</hi> For
whereas he and a Council of Bishops together with him,
had ordered, that Infants might be <hi>baptiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d</hi> and <hi>sacrificed,</hi>
that is, <hi>communicated</hi> before the eighth day, though that
were the day appointed for Circumcision by the old Law.
There he sets down this as the reason of their Decree,
<hi>that the mercy and grace of God, was to be denied to no
man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pope</hi> Innocent <hi>the first, (in</hi> Ep. ad Epis. Cone. Milev. quae
est inter August. 93.) <hi>concludes against the</hi> Pelagians; <hi>that
Infants could not attain eternal life without Baptism; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
without Baptism they were uncapable of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
and without the Eucharist could not have eternal life.
His words are,</hi> but that which your Fraternity affirms them
to Preach, that Infants without the grace of Baptism may have
the rewards of eternal life, is certainly most foolish; for unless
they eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood; they
shall have no life in them.</p>
            <p>Now that this sense which I have given his words, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the true sense of them, and that his judgment upon the
point was as I have said; it is acknowledged by <hi>Maldonate</hi>
in <hi>Ioan. 6. v.</hi> 54. by <hi>Binius</hi> upon the Councils <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. p. 6. 24.
by <hi>Sanctesius, Repet.</hi> 6. c. 7. and it is affirmed by S. <hi>Austin</hi>
who was his Contemporary, held correspondence by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
with him, and therefore in all probability could not
be ignorant of his meaning. I say he affirms it, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
out of Question, Epist. 106. and <hi>Cont. Iulian.</hi> lib. 1. c. 4.
where he tells that <hi>Pelagius</hi> in denying this, did dispute <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra
sedis Apostolicae authoritatem;</hi> against the authority of the
Sea Apostolick; and after, <hi>but if they yield to the Sea Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick,
or rather to the Master himself and Lord of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
who says, that they shall not have life in them, unless they
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60827:41"/>
eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, which
none may do but those that are baptized; then at length they
will confess, that Infants not baptized cannot have life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I suppose no man will doubt, but the belief of the
Apostolick Sea; was then (as S. <hi>Austin</hi> assures us <hi>l. 1. cont.
Iul. c.</hi> 4.) the belief of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> taking it for
a particular Church: and then it will presently follow, that

night have furnished their Index with many more referren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to this point; as <hi>de Pec. Mer. &amp; Rem.</hi> l. 1. c. 24. where
of Baptism and the Eucharist he tells us, that <hi>Salus &amp; vita
eterna sine his frustra promittitur parvulis.</hi> The same he has
<hi>Cont. 2. Epist. Pelag, ad Bonifacium</hi> l. 1. c. 22. which yet by

Sanctorum ad Prosp. &amp; Hilar. l. 1. cap.</hi> 14. Neither doth
he retract or contradict this opinion any where, nor miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
any one of his sentences touching this matter, in his
Book of <hi>Retractations. Sanctesius</hi> indeed tells us, that he
seems to have departed from his Opinion, in his works
against the <hi>Donatists.</hi> But I would he had shewed some
probable reason to make it seem so to others; which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he does not, we have reason to take time to believe
him. For as touching the place mentioned by <hi>Beda</hi> in
1. <hi>ad Corinth.</hi> 10. as taken out of a Sermon of S. <hi>Austins,
ad infantes ad Altare.</hi> Besides that it is very strange S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
should make a Sermon to Infants; and that there is
no such Sermon extant in his works; nor any memory of
any such in <hi>Possidius,</hi> S. <hi>Austins</hi> Scholars Catalogue of his
works, nor in his Book of <hi>Retractaitons:</hi> setting aside all
this, I say First, That it is no way certain that he speaks
there of Infants, seeing in propriety of speech (as S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi>
himself teacheth us <hi>Ep.</hi> 23) Infants were not <hi>Fideles,</hi>
of whom S. <hi>Austin</hi> in that supposed Sermon speaks. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
Admit he does speak of Infants, where he assures
us, that in Baptism every faithful man is made partaker
of Christs body and blood, and that he shall not be ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated
from the benefit of the Bread and Cup, although
he depart this life, before he eat of that Bread and drink
of that Cup. All this concludes no more, but that the
actual participation of the Eucharist, is not a means simply
necessary to attain salvation, so that no impossibility shall
exeuse the failing of it: Whereas all that I aim at is but
this, that in the judgment of the Ancient Church, it was
believed necessary, in case of possibility; necessary, not
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:60827:42"/>
               <hi>in actu,</hi> but in <hi>voto Ecclesiae:</hi> not necessary to salvation sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
but necessary for the increase of grace and glory:
And therefore, Lastly, though not necessary by <hi>necessity of
means,</hi> for Infants to receive it; yet necessary by <hi>necessity
of precepts</hi> for the Church to give it.</p>
            <p>The last witness I promised, was the Author of the
work against the <hi>Pelagians</hi> called <hi>Hypognostica,</hi> who (<hi>l. 5.
c.</hi> 5.) ask the <hi>Pelagians, Seeing he himself hath said, unless
you eat the flesh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>How dare you promise eternal life to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Children, not regenerate of water and the Holy Ghost; not
having eaten his flesh, nor drank his blood.</hi> And a little after,
<hi>Behold then, he that is not Baptized, and he that is destitute
of the Bread and Cup of life, is separated from the Kingdom of
Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the same purpose he speaks <hi>l. 6. c.</hi> 6. But it is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
to recite his words, for either this is enough or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>The third kind of proof, whereby I undertook to shew
the belief of the ancient Church in this point, was the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the learnedest Writers and best verst in the Church of</hi>
Rome. Who, what the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> forbids under
Anathema, that any man should say of any ancie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t Father,
are not yet afraid, nor make no scruple, to say it in plain
terms of the whole Church for many Ages together, <hi>viz.</hi>
That she believed the Eucharist necessary for Infants. So
doth <hi>Maldonate</hi> in <hi>Ioan. 6. Mitto Augustini &amp; Innocentii
sententiam (quae etiam viguit in Ecclesia per sexcentes annos)
Eucharistiam etiam Infantibus necessariam.</hi> I <hi>say nothing</hi> says
he, of <hi>Austins</hi> and <hi>Innocentius</hi> his opinion, <hi>that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist
was necessary even for Infants, which doctrin flourished in
the</hi> Church for 600. years.</p>
            <p>The same almost in terms hath <hi>Binius,</hi> in his Notes on
the Councils, pag. 624. <hi>Hinc constat Innocentii sententia
(quae sexcentos circiter annos viguit in Ecclesiâ, quam Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
sectatus est) Eucharistiam etiam infantibus necessariam
fuisse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, That treasury of Antiquity Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi>
though he speaks not so home as the rest do, yet he says
enough for my purpose: <hi>des passages de S. August.</hi> c. 10.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60827:42"/>
p. 101. <hi>The Custom of giving the Eucharist to Infants the
Church then observed as profitable.</hi> This I say is enough
for my purpose. For what more contradictious, than the
Eucharist being the same without alteration to Infants
being the same without alteration, should then be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
and now unprofitable: then all things considered
expedient to be used, if not necessary, and therefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded:
And now, though there be no variety in the
case, all things considered not necessary, nor expedient,
and therefore forbidden.</p>
            <p>The Issue of all this Discourse, for ought I can see,
must be this: That either both parts of a Contradiction
must be true, and consequently nothing can be false, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that which contradicteth truth is not so: or else, that
the Ancient Church did err in believing something ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
which was not so; (and if so, why may not the
present Church err, in thinking <hi>Latin</hi> Service, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
in one kind expedient:) or that the present
Church doth err, in thinking something not expedient,
which is so. And if so, why may she not err, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Communicating the Laity in both kinds, and Service
in vulgar Languages, not expedient.</p>

            <head>V. An Argument drawn from the Doctrin of the
Millenaries, against Infallibility.</head>
            <p>THE Doctrin of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> was, <hi>That before the
worlds end, Christ should reign upon earth for a thousand
years, and that the Saints should live under him in all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and happiness.</hi> That this Doctrin is by the present <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church held false and Heretical, I think no man will
deny.</p>
            <p>That the same Doctrin, was by the Church of the next
Age after the Apostles held true and Catholick I prove by
these two Reasons.</p>
            <p>The first Reason, Whatsoever doctrin is believed and
taught by the most eminent Fathers of any Age of the
Church, and by none of their contemporaries opposed or
condemned, that is to be esteemed the Catholick Doctrin
of the Church of those times.</p>
            <p>But the Doctrin of the <hi>Millenaries</hi> was believed and taught
by the eminent Fathers of the Age next after the Apostles,
and by none of that Age opposed or condemned.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was the Catholick Doctrin of the Church
of those times. The Proposition of this Syllogism is Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Perrons</hi> rule, (in his Epistle to <hi>Casaubon,</hi> 5. observ.)
And is indeed one of the main pillars, upon which the great
Fabrick of his Answer to King <hi>Iames</hi> doth s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>and, and
with which it cannot but fall; and therefore I will spend
no time in the proof of it.</p>
            <p>But the Assumption thus I prove.</p>
            <p>That Doctrin which was believed and taught by <hi>Papias</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Hierap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lis,</hi> the disciple of the Apostles disciples
(according to <hi>Eusebius</hi>) who lived in the times of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
saith he, by <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> Doctor of the Church
and Martyr: by <hi>Melito</hi> Bishop of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had the gift
of Prophesie, witness <hi>Tert.</hi> and whom <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth

and was not opposed and condemned by any one
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60827:43"/>
Doctor of the Church of those times: That Doctrine was
believed and taught by the most Eminent Fathers of that
Age, next to the Apostles, and opposed by none.</p>
            <p>But the former part of the Proposition is true, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
the Latter is also true.</p>
            <p>The Major of this Syllogism and the latter part of the
Minor, I suppose will need no proof, with them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
that these here mentioned were equal in number
to all the other Ecclesiastical Writers of that Age, of
whom there is any memory remaining; and in weight
and worth infinitely beyond them: they were <hi>Athenago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras,
Theophilus Antiochenus, Egesippus</hi> and <hi>Hippolitus:</hi> of
whose contradiction to this Doctrine there is not extant,
neither in their works, nor in story, any Print or Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>step:
which if they or any of them had opposed, it had
been impossible, considering the Ecclesiastical Story of
their time is Written by the professed Enemies of
the Millinaries Doctrine; who could they have found
any thing in the monuments of Antiquity to have put
in the Ballance against <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> no
doubt would not have buried it in silence: which yet
they do, neither vouching for their opinion any one of
more Antiquity than <hi>Dionysius Alexandrinus,</hi> who lived, saith
<hi>Eusebius, nostra aetate,</hi> [in our Age] but certainly in the
latter part of the third Century. For <hi>Tatianus</hi> because
an Heretick I reckon not in this number. And if any
man say that before his fall he wrote many Books; I say,
it is true; but withal would have it remembred, that he
was <hi>Iustin Martyrs</hi> Scholar, and therefore, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of his Masters Faith, rather than against it, all that
is extant of him one way or other is but this in S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,

            </p>
            <p>Now for the other part of the Minor, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Fathers did believe and teach this Doctrine.

            </p>
            <p>The same is testified by <hi>Irenaeus (lib. 5. cont. Her. c.</hi> 33.)
where having at large set forth this Doctrine, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
it by the Authority of <hi>Papias</hi> in these words. Papias

many of our own have followed: Especially</hi> Tertullian <hi>in
his Book</hi> de spe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>idelium; <hi>and</hi> Lactantius <hi>in his seventh
Book of Institutions, and the frequent expositions of</hi> Victorinus
Pictavionensis: <hi>and of late</hi> Severus <hi>in his Dialogue which
he calls</hi> Gallus: <hi>and to name the</hi> Greeks <hi>and to joyn together
the first and last,</hi> Irenaeus <hi>and</hi> Apollinarius. Where we
see he acknowledges <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to be of this opinion; but
that he was the first that held it, I believe that that is
more a Christian untruth than <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his opinion a Judai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Fable. For he himself acknowledges in the place
above cited, that <hi>Irenaeus</hi> followed <hi>Papias;</hi> and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and confessed that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> believed it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him: and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> himself derives it from—<hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri
qui</hi> Johannem <hi>discipulum Domini viderunt;</hi> from
Priests which saw <hi>Iohn</hi> the Disciple of the Lord. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by <hi>Pamelius, Sixtus Senensis,</hi> and <hi>Faverdentius</hi> in the
places above quoted.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore it is certain, even to the confession of
the Adversaries, that <hi>Papias, Iustin Martyr, Meleto</hi> and
<hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the most considerable and eminent men of their
Age, did believe and teach this Doctrine; and seeing it
has been proved as evidently as a thing of this nature
can be, that none of their contemporaries opposed or
condemned it; It remains according to Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi>
first rule; that this is to be esteemed the Doctrine of the
Church of that Age.</p>
            <p>My second Reason I form thus. Whatsoever Doctrine
is taught by the Fathers of any Age, not as Doctors
but as witnesses of the Tradition of the Church, (that is,
not as their own opinion, but as the Doctrine of the
Church of their times) that is undoubtedly to be so esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
especially if none contradicted them in it. But the
Fathers above cited teach this Doctrine, not as their own
private opinion, but as the Christian Tradition, and as
the Doctrine of the Church, neither did any contradict
them in it. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is undoubtedly to be so esteemed.</p>
            <p>The Major of this Syllogism, is Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi> second
Rule and way of finding out the Doctrine of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Church in any Age: and if it be not a sure Rule, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel
the use of all Antiquity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:60827:45"/>
And for the <hi>Minor,</hi> there will be little doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of it, to
him that considers, that <hi>Papias</hi> professes himself to have
received this Doctrine by unwritten Tradition, though not
from the Apostles themselves immediately, yet from their
Scholars, as appears by <hi>Eusebius</hi> in the forecited third Book
33. Chapter.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> grounding it upon evident Scripture, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
that he learnt it, (whether mediately or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I cannot tell) from <hi>(a) Presbyteri qui</hi> Johannem <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulum
Domini viderunt.</hi> Priests or Elders who saw <hi>Iohn</hi>
the Lords Disciple, and heard of him what our Lord taught
of those times (of the thousand years) and also, as he
says after, from <hi>Papias</hi> the Auditor of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellow
of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> an Ancient man who recorded it in
writing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(a) Faverdentius</hi> his Note upon this place is very Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<hi>Hinc apparet</hi> (saith he) from hence it appears that
<hi>Irenaeus</hi> neither first invented this opinion, nor held it as
proper to himself, but got this blot and blemish from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Fathers. <hi>Papias</hi> I suppose and some other inglorious
fellows, the familiar Friends of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> are here intended.</p>
            <p>I hope then if the Fathers which lived with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
had their blots and blemishes; it is no such horrid
Crime for <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Century writers</hi> to impute the
same to their great Grandchildren. <hi>Aetas parent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Disciples of the Apostles, though perhaps not so learned
as <hi>Faverdentius,</hi> were yet certainly so honest, as not to
invent lies and deliver them as Apostolick Tradition; or
if they were not, what confidence can we place in any
other unwritten Tradition.</p>
            <p>Lastly, that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> grounds it upon plan Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies
of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and express words of the
<hi>New:</hi> he professeth, <hi>That he, and all other Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it not, with them who deny the Resurrection; or else

but in deed and Truth were none.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:60827:45"/>
Whosoever, I say, considers these things will easily grant,
that they held it not as their own opinion, but as the
Doctrine of the Church and the Faith of Christians.</p>
            <p>Hereupon I conclude, whatsoever they held, not as their
private opinion, but as the Faith of the Church, that was
the Faith of the Church of their time: But this Doctrine
they held, not as <hi>their</hi> private opinion, but as the Faith
of the Church. <hi>Ergo,</hi> it was and is to be esteemed the
Faith of the Church.</p>

               <hi>Iustin Martyr.</hi> 
               <q>I have confessed to you before, that
both I and many others do believe, as you well know,
that this shall be; but that many again, who are (not)
of the pure and holy opinion of Christians, do not
acknowledge this, I have also signified unto you:
For I have declared unto you, that some called Christians,
but being indeed <hi>Atheists</hi> and impious <hi>Hereticks,</hi> do gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
teach blasphemous and Atheistical and foolish things:
but that you might know that I speak not this to you on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I will make a Book as near as I can of these our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
where I will profess in writing that which I
say before you; for I resolve to follow not men, and the
Doctrines of men, but God and the Doctrine of God.
For although you chance to meet with some that are
called Christians, which do not confess this, but dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
to Blaspheme the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and
the God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which also say there is no Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Dead, but that as soon as they die their Souls
are received into Heaven, do not ye yet think them
Christians: as neither if a man consider rightly will he
account the Sadducees and other Sectaries and Hereticks,
as the <hi>Genistae</hi> and the <hi>Meristae</hi> and <hi>Galileans,</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi>
and <hi>Hellenians</hi> and <hi>Baptists</hi> and other such to be <hi>Iews;</hi> but
only that they are called <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi>
and such as with their lips confess God (as God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60827:46"/>
himself cries out) but have their Hearts far from him.
But I and all Christians that in all things believe aright,
both know that there shall be a Resurrection of the
Flesh, and a thousand years in <hi>Hierusalem</hi> restored and
adorned and inlarged; according as the Prophets, <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
and <hi>Esay</hi> and others do testifie: for thus saith <hi>Isaiah</hi> of

            </p>
            <p>I have presumed in the beginning of <hi>Iustin Martyrs</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to substitute (not) instead of (also) because I am
confident, that either by chance, or the fraud of some
ill-willers to the Millinaries opinion; the place has been
corrupted, and (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) turned into (<gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o.) For
if we retain the usual reading—<hi>But that many who are
also of the pure and holy opinion of Christians do not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
this, I have also signified unto you;</hi> then must we
conclude, that <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> himself did believe the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of them which denied the thousand years, to be the
pure and holy opinion of Christians: and if so, why did
he not himself believe it? nay how could he but believe
it to be true, professing it (as he does if the place be right)
to be the pure and holy opinion of Christians: for how
a false Doctrine can be the pure and holy opinion of
Christians, what Christian can conceive? or if it may be
so, how can the contrary avoid the being untrue, unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and not the opinion of Christians?</p>
            <p>Again, if we read the place thus—<hi>That many who
are also of the pure and holy opinion of Christians, do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this, I have also signified:</hi> certainly there will be
neither sense nor reason, neither coherence nor conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in the words following—<hi>For I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>old you
of many called Christians, but being indeed Atheists and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60827:46"/>
that they altogether teach blasphemous and impious and
foolish things:</hi> for how is this a confirmation or reason
of, or any way pertinent unto what went before? if there
he speak of none but such as were, <hi>purae piaeque Christianorum
sententiae,</hi> of the pure and holy opinion of Christians.
And therefore to disguise this inconsequence, the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slator
has thought fit to make use of a false Translation,
and instead of—<hi>for I have told you,</hi> to make it,—<hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
I have told you of many,</hi> &amp;c. Again, if <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>
had thought this <hi>the pure and holy opinion of Christians,</hi> or
them good and holy Christians that held it; why does
he rank them with them that denyed the Resurrection?
Why does he say afterward—<hi>Although you chance to meet
with some that are called Christians which do not confess this,
do not ye think them Christians.</hi> Lastly, what sense is there in
saying as he does—<hi>I and all Christians that are of a right
belief in all things, believe the Doctrine of the thousand years,</hi>
and that the Scriptures both of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi>
teach it, and yet say—<hi>That many of the pure and holy
opinion of Christians do not believe it?</hi> Upon these reasons
I suppose it is evident, that the place has been corrupted,
and it is to be corrected according as I have corrected it,
by substituting <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the place of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (not) instead of (also.)
Neither need any man think strange that this misfortune
of the change of a Syllable should befal this place, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders
that in this place <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> tells us that he had
said the same things before, whereas nothing to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
appears now in him. And that in <hi>Victorinus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the <hi>Revelation,</hi> wherein, (by S. <hi>Hieroms</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment)
this Doctrine was strongly maintained, there
now appears nothing at all for it, but rather against it. And
now from the place thus restored, these Observations
offer themselves unto us.</p>
            <p>1. That <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> speaks not as a Doctor, but as
a witness of the Doctrine of the Church of his time. I
(saith he) and all Christians that are of a right belief in all
things hold this: And therefore from hence according to
Cardinal <hi>Perrons</hi> Rule, we are to conclude, not probably
but demonstratively, that this was the Doctrine of the
Church of that time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60827:47"/>
2. That they held it as a necessary matter, so far as to
hold them no Christians that held the Contrary: <hi>though
you chance to meet with some called Christians that do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
this, but dare to Blaspheme the God of</hi> Abraham, Isaac
<hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>&amp;c. Yet do not ye think them Christians:</hi> Now
if <hi>Bellarmines</hi> Rule be true, that Councils then determine
any thing as matters of Faith, when they pronounce them
Hereticks that hold the Contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y; then sure <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>
held this Doctrine as a matter of Faith, se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> it.</p>
            <p>3. That the Doctrine is grounded upon t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Scripture
of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament</hi> and the <hi>Revelation</hi> of S.
<hi>Iohn,</hi> and that by a Doctor and Martyr, of the Church,
and such a one as was converted to Christianity within 30
years after the Death of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> when in all probability
there were many alive, that had heard him expound his
own words and teach this Doctrine: and if probabilities
will not be admitted, this is certain out of the most authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
records of the Church, that <hi>Papias</hi> the Disciple of
the Apostles Disciples taught it the Church, professing
that he had received it from them that learned it from
the Apostles: and if after all this, the Church of those
Times might Err in a Doctrine so clearly derived and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentically
delivered, how without extream impudence
can any Church in after times, pretend to Infallibility.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Millinaries</hi> Doctrine was over-born, by imputing
to them that which they held not: by abrogating the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of S. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Revelation, as some did: or by derogat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from it, as others; ascribing it not to S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
but to some other <hi>Iohn,</hi> they know not who: which—<hi>Dionysius</hi>

            <p>I Pray remember, that if a consent of Fathers either
constitute or declare a Truth to be necessary, or shew
the opinion of the Church of their Time; then that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the Jesuits, concerning Predestination upon presci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
(which had no opposer before S. <hi>Austin</hi>) must be so,
and the contrary Heretical of the Dominicans; and the

theirs may deceive them: unless the same thing may
be a wall when you lean upon it, and a bulrus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when we
do.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Remember that they cannot say, they trust not
their Interpretation in this, but a consent of Fathers; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Fathers are not said to be infallible, but as they
tell the Opinion of the Church of their time, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible:
therefore they must first prove out of Scripture
that she is infallible, or else she (who is her self the subject
of the Question) cannot be allowed till then to give a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
for her self.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, Remember the <hi>Roman</hi> Church claim; no Notes
of the Church, but what agree with the <hi>Grecian</hi> too (as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
Succession, Miracles. &amp;c.) but onely Communion
with the Pope and Splendor: both which made for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi>
in <hi>Liberius</hi> his time; and it were a hard Case, that
because the <hi>Greeks</hi> are poor upon Earth, they should be shut
out of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, Remember that if we have an Infallible way,
we have no use (at least no necessity) of an Infallible Guide;
for if we may be saved by following the Scripture as near
as we can (though we err) it is as good as any Interpreter
to keep unity in charity (which is only needful) though
not in opinion: and this cannot be ridiculous, because they
say, if any man misinterpret the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it shall
not damn him; and why (without more ado) may not the
same be said of Scripture?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chilling.</speaker>
               <p>I prove it, according to the several parts of it:
And first, for the first part. He must have the Figure of
a mans body in the Eucharist, who is there wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>out any
real alteration or difference from the natural body of a man:
But our Saviour, according to the <hi>Romish</hi> Doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
is in the Sacrament without any real altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or difference from the natural body of a man: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
according to this Doctrin he must there have the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a mans body. To the second part, that he must
not have the figure of a mans body in the Sacrament, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this Doctrin, thus I prove it. He must not
have the figure of a mans body in the Eucharist, which
must not have extension there: But our Saviours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ody, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Doctrin of Transubstantiation, must not
have extension there; Therefore, according to this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin,
he must not have the figure of a mans body there.
The Major of this Syllogism I proved, because the figure
of a mans body could not be without extension. The
Minor I proved thus; That must not have extension in the
Eucharist, whose every part is together in one and the
same point: But according to this Doctrin, every part of
our Saviours body must be here in one and the same point:
therefore here it must not have extension.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dan.</speaker>
               <p>Answered, by distinguishing the Major of the
first Syllogism, and said; that he must not have the true
figure of a mans body, according to the reason of a figure
taken in its essential consideration, which is to have <hi>positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
partium sic &amp; sic extra partes;</hi> but not the accidental
consideration, which is in <hi>ordine ad locum.</hi> And this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
he applied for the solution of the Minor, saying thus,
Our Saviour is there without any real alteration intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,
but not extrinsecal; for ho is not changed in order to
himself, but in order to place: Or otherwise, he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in his continual existence, which is only <hi>modus essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae</hi>
and inseparable even by divine power, though altered
<hi>in modo existendi,</hi> which is situation and required to figure
taken in order to place.</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:60827:49"/>
               <speaker>Chill.</speaker>
               <p>Against this it was replied by <hi>Chillingworth:</hi> That
the distinction of a mans body as considered in it self, and
as considered in reference to place, is vain, and no solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Argument: And thus he proved it; If it be
impossible, that any thing should have several parts one
out of another in order, and reference of each to other,
without having these parts in several places; then the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
is vain: But it is impossible, that any thing should
have several parts one out of another, without having these
parts in several places; Therefore the distinction is vain.</p>
               <p>The Major of this Syllogism he took for granted.</p>
               <p>The Minor he proved thus: Whatsoever body is in the
proper place of another body, must of necessity be in that
very body, by possessing the demensions of it: therefore,
whatsoever hath several parts one out of the other, must of
necessity have them one out of the place of the other; and
consequently in several places.</p>
               <p>For illustration of this Argument he said; If my head
and belly and thighs and legs be all in the very same place;
of necessity my head must be in my belly, and my belly
in my thighs, and my thighs in my legs, and all of them
in my feet, and my feet in all of them; and therefore if
my head be out of my belly, it must be out of the place
where my belly is; and if it be not out of the place where
my belly is, it is not out of my belly but in it.</p>
               <p>Again, to shew that according to the Doctrin of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,
our Saviours body in the Eucharist hath
not the several parts of it out of one another, he disputed
thus: Wheresoever there is a body having several parts
one out of the other, there must be some middle parts
severing the extreme parts: But here, according to this
Doctrin, the extreme parts are not severed, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the same point; Therefore here our Saviours Body
cannot have parts one out of other.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dan.</speaker>
               <p>To all this (for want of a better Answer)
gave only this. <hi>Let all Scholars peruse these.</hi> After, upon
better consideration, he wrote by the side of the last Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logism
this: <hi>Quoad entitatem verum est, non quoad locum,</hi>
that is, according to entity it is true, but not according to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60827:50"/>
place. And to (<hi>Let all Scholars peruse these)</hi> he caused this
to be added; <hi>And weigh whether there is any new matter,</hi>
worth a new Answer.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Chillingworth.</speaker>
               <p>Replyed, That to say the extreme parts of
a body are severed by the middle parts according to their
entity, but not according to place, is ridiculous. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are first, Because severing of things is nothing else,
but putting or keeping them in several places, as every sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
woman knows; and therefore to say, they are severed
but not according to place, is as if you should say, They
are heated, but not according to heat; they are cooled, but
not according to cold: Indeed is it to say, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <head>VIII. An account of what moved the Author to turn
a Papist, with his own Confutation of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that perswaded him thereto.</head>
            <p>I Reconciled myself to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> because I
thought my self to have sufficient reason to believe, that
there was and must be always in the World some Church,
that could not err: and consequently seeing all other
Churches disclaimed this priviledge of not being subject to
error; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> must be that Church which
cannot err.</p>
            <p>I was put into doubt of this way which I had chosen,
by D. <hi>Stapleton</hi> and others; who limit the Churches freedom
from Error to things necessary only, and such as without
which the Church can be a Church no longer, but grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it subject to error in things that were not necessary:
Hereupon considering that most of the differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks; were not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
things necessary, but only profitable or lawful; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
that I had not sufficient ground to believe the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Church either could not or did not err in any thing,
and therefore no ground to be a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:60827:50"/>
Against this again I was perswaded, that it was not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to believe the Church to be an <hi>infallible believer</hi> of
all doctrins necessary; but it must also be granted an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
teacher</hi> of what is necessary; that is, that we must
believe not only that the Church teacheth all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
but that all is necessary to be believed, which the
Church teacheth to be so: in effect, that the Church is our
Guide in the way to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now to believe that the Church was an infallible Guide,
and to be believed in all things which she requires us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
I was induced: First, because there was nothing
that could reasonably contest with the Church about this
Office, but the Scripture: and that the Scripture was this
Guide, I was willing to believe, but that I saw not how it
could be made good, without depending upon the Churches
authority.</p>
            <p>1. That Scripture is the Word of God.</p>
            <p>2. That the Scripture is a perfect rule of our duty.</p>
            <p>3. That the Scripture is so plain in those things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
our duty, that whosoever desires and endeavors to find
the will of God, there shall either find it, or at least not
dangerously mistake it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I was drawn to this belief, because I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that it was evident, out of the Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi>
that there must be unto the worlds end a Succession of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,
by adhering to whom, men might be kept from
wavering in matters of faith, and from being carried up
and down with every wind of false doctrin.</p>
            <p>That no Succession of Pastors could guard their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
from danger of error, if themselves were subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
error, either in teaching that to be necessary which is
not so, or denying that to be necessary which is so: and
therefore,</p>
            <p>That there was and must be some Succession of Pastors,
which was an infallible guide in the way to Heaven; and
which should not possibly teach any thing to be necessary
which was not so; nor any thing not necessary which was
so: upon this ground I concluded, that seeing there must
be such a Succession of Pastors, as was an infallible guide;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60827:51"/>
and there was no other (but that of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>)
even by the confession of all other Societies of Pastors in
the world; that therefore that Succession of Pastors is that
infallible Guide of Faith which all men must follow.</p>
            <p>Upon these grounds I thought it necessary for my salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to believe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in all that she thought
to be, and proposed as necessary.</p>
            <p>Against these Arguments it hath been demonstrated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me; and First against the first. That the reason why
we are to believe the Scripture to be the word of God,
neither is nor can be the Authority of the present Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which cannot make good her Authority any
other way, but by pretence of Scripture: and therefore
stands not unto Scripture (no not in respect of us) in the
relation of a Foundation to a building, but of a b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilding to
a Foundation, doth not support Scripture, but is s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pported
by it. But the general consent of Christians of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Ages, a far greater company than that of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and delivering universally the Scripture
for the word of God, is the ordinary external reason why
we believe it: whereunto the Testimonies of the Jews,
enemies of Christ, add no small moment for the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of some part of it.</p>
            <p>That whatsoever stood upon the same ground of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Tradition with Scripture, might justly challenge
belief, as well as Scripture: but that no Doctrin not
written in Scripture, could justly pretend to as fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as the Scripture, and therefore we had no reason to
believe it with that degree of faith, wherewith we believe
the Scripture.</p>
            <p>That it is unreasonable to think, that he that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eads the
Scripture, and uses all means appointed for this purpose,
with an earnest desire and with no other end, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to find
the will of God and obey it, if he mistake the meaning of
some doubtful places, and fall unwillingly into some errors,
unto which no vice or passion betrays him, and is willing to
hear reason from any man that will undertake to shew him
his error: I say, that it is unreasonable to think, that a
God of goodness will impute such an error to such a man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:60827:51"/>
Against the second it was demonstrated unto me, that
the place I built on so confidently, was no Argument
at all for the Infallibility of the Succession of Pastors in
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, but a very strong Argument against it.</p>
            <p>First, no Argument for it; because it is not certain, nor
can ever be proved, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks there of any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13. For let that be granted
which is desired, that in the 13. ver. by [<hi>until we all meet</hi>]
is meant, until all the Children of God meet in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Faith; that is, unto the Worlds end: yet it is not
said there, <hi>that he gave Apostles and Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which
should continue,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>until we all meet,</hi> by connecting the
13. <hi>ver.</hi> to the 11. But he gave (then upon his Ascension
and miraculously endowed) Apostles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
for the work of the ministry, for the Consummation of the
Saints, for the Edification of the Body of Christ, until we all
meet, that is, if you will, unto the Worlds end. Neither
is there any incongruity, but that the Apostles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which lived then, may in good sense be said,
now at this time and ever hereafter to do those things
which they are said to do: For who can deny but S. <hi>Paul</hi>
the Apostle and Doctor of the Gentiles, and S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the
Evangelist and Prophet, do at this very time (by their
writings, though not by their persons) do the work of
the ministry, consummate the Saints, and Edifie the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Christ.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it cannot be shewn or proved from hence,
that there is or was to be any such succession: because
S. <hi>Paul</hi> here tells us only, that he gave such in the time
past, not that he promised such in the time to come.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it is evident, that God promised no such
succession, because it is not certain that he hath made
good any such promise; for who is so impudent as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that there are now, and have been in all Ages since
Christ, some Apostles and some Prophets and some Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists
and some Pastors and Teachers: Especially such
as he here speaks of, that is, endowed with such gifts as
Christ gave upon his Ascension; of which he speaks in
the 8 <hi>ver.</hi> saying; <hi>He led Captivity Captive, and gave gifts
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60827:52"/>
unto men.</hi> And that those gifts were—Men endowed
with extraordinary Power and Supernatural gifts—it
is apparent, because these Words, <hi>and he gave some Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
some Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. are added by way of explication
and illustration of that which was said before—<hi>and he
gave gifts unto Men:</hi> And if any man except hereunto,
that though the Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists were
extraordinary and for the Plantation of the Gospel, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
were ordinary and for continuance: I answer, it is true,
some Pastors are ordinary and for continuance, but not
such as are here spoken of: not such as are endowed with
the strange and heavenly gifts, which Christ gave not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut to
the inferior Pastors and Doctors of his Church, at the
first Plantation of it: And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1st.
to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 28. (to which place we are referred by
the Margent of the Vulgar Translation, for the explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this,) places this gift of teaching amongs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and
prefers it before many other miraculous gifts of the Holy
Ghost: Pastors there are still in the Church, but not such
as <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Apollos</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> not such
as can justly pretend to immediate inspiration and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Holy Ghost: And therefore seeing there
neither are nor have been for many Ages in the Church,
such Apostles and Prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as here are spoken of,
it is certain he promised none; or otherwise we must blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemously
charge him with breach of his promise.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answer, that if by <hi>dedit he gave,</hi> be meant
<hi>promisit,</hi> he <hi>promised</hi> for ever; then all were promised and
all should have continued. If by <hi>dedit</hi> be not meant <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,</hi>
then he promised none such, nor may we expect any
such by vertue of, or warrant from this Text that is here
alledged: And thus much for the first Assumpt which

            <p>The Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists and Pastors,
which our Saviour gave upon his Ascension, were given

by him that they might Consummate the Saints, do the
work of the Ministry, Edifie the Body of Christ, until
we all come into the Unity of Faith, that we be not
like Children wavering and carried up and down with
every wind of Doctrine. The Apostles and Prophets,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> that then were, do not now in their own persons
and by oral instruction do the work of the Ministry,
to the intent we may be kept from wavering and being
carried up and down with every wind of Doctrine: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they do this some other way: Now there is no other
way by which they can do it, but by their writings; and
therefore by their writings they do it: therefore by their
writings and believing of them we are to be kept from
wavering in matters of Faith: therefore the Scriptures
of the Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists are our
Guides. Therefore not the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
