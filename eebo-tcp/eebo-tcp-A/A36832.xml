            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>'TIS above fifty years, ſince ſome learned and judicious Perſons, as well of the Gown, as others, have now brought to light an important and neceſſary truth, which the ſtrength of prejudice, and a General and Opiniona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive blindneſs, that hath laſted for more than this thouſand years, hath kept under a Buſhel: 'Tis that of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> which the eminent Authority of <hi>Cyril,</hi> has made to paſs, during all that time, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from the third Oecumenical Councel, for an abſolute lie, and

            </p>
            <p>Or we muſt conſider the National Church, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are in an equality of rank and dignity, but with ſubordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Provincial or National Aſſemblies, Conſiſtories, Colloquies, and Synods. Now in either manner of eſtabliſhment, where there is obſerved in all things an uniformity of Doctrine and of Diſcipline, and which is preſſed by the ſame rigorous ſeverities in the State Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical, as the Laws are in the Civil, in either manner, I ſay, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when the Magiſtrate favours the true Worſhippers of Jeſus Chriſt, there happens Errours and diſorders innumerable, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would be found in the eſtabliſhment of the Congregational way: as when the Biſhop or a ſmall number of Paſtors has the whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and ſuperviſion of affairs; and where it is impoſſible but that Hereſie, Ambition, Envy, Politick regards, temporal intereſt, the Spirit of Pride and Grandeur, and Factions ſhould reign among them; and that theſe Errours and diſorders ſhould ſo eaſily be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and taken notice of, as in a particular compoſed of one or two Paſtors, and of a ſmall number of People, This is what has been obſerved by the Hiſtorians <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi> and by the Fathers. <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> ſayes, that he had never ſeen Synods to produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good effects, but that they had rather increaſed Hereſie, then

ſtifled and ſuppreſs'd it. <hi>Martyn,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Tours,</hi> had no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opinion of them. All the Synods, eſpecially, the Oecumenical, had been Shire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>halls, houſes of confuſion, or even <hi>Aceldama</hi>'s, if the Emperours, or their Commiſſaries had not thrown water upon the fire which they had kindled: Yet they could not always ſo hinder, but that theſe two great evils of Synods and Biſhops, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, and the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, did tranſport them to the very extremities of tyranny and cruelty: inſomuch that <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> who was Preſident in the ſecond Council of <hi>Epheſus</hi> over four hundred perſons, was ſo moved with rage and paſſion againſt <hi>Flavian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that he roſe up from his ſeat, and killed him with blows and kicks, and alſo tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled upon his body after he was dead. 'Tis remarkable that the Canons full of piety and pure Doctrine, were never made in Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and Oecumenical Synods, but in thoſe that were private, and compoſed of a few perſons, ſuch as was that of <hi>Orenge,</hi> where we read theſe words that deſerve to be writ in Gold. <hi>Tales nos amat Deus, quales futuri ſumus ipſius dono, non quales ſumus noſtro me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito:</hi> having in it only the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council which hath produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced us this moſt Nervous confeſſion concerning the bleſſed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>I add that in the Eſtabliſhment of a National Church, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in a large extent of Dominion the ſame uniformity of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as of Polity, it is neither goodneſs nor truth, neither ſincerity, nor a well-form'd deſign that acts, but it is hazard, worldly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, power, and the greateſt number, which is oftentimes the moſt erroncous, and the will of one ſingle Perſon inveſted with an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power, which is moſt commonly taken up by Flatterers, and Counſellors, who are animated with other motives than thoſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, or who, how good ſoever, and ſincere otherwiſe, are not il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated, nor learned enough to give a right judgement about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion. <hi>Carneades</hi> ſaid, that the State of <hi>Athens</hi> was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, in which wiſe men made fair Overtures, and gave good Counſels, but Fools judged of them, and ordered all things according to their idle and extravagant fancies. And indeed Wiſe men may conſult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is the greateſt number, or the longeſt and beſt ſword that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines, which is too often in the hands of thoſe, who have more ſtrength of power, than force of judgement, ſo that by this eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a National Eccleſiaſtical Government, thouſands of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and faithful Souls are as much obliged to ſubmit themſelves to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41651:7"/>
the Religion of a whole Empire, according to the eſtabliſhment which ſhall be made of it by an Idolatrous <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> by an <hi>Arrian Conſtantius,</hi> by an Apoſtate <hi>Julian,</hi> by a Popiſh <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as to that which ſhall be ſet up by a <hi>David,</hi> by a <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the the Great, and by a Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of ever bleſſed memory; which Inconveniencies neither can nor ever will be able to happen in a place, where the Congregational way ſhall be eſtabliſhed. It may be one Soveraign, who ſhall be as Heretick, as <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> will iſſue forth his commands for the eſtabliſhment of his hereſie in all the places of his dominion, as <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond made another for that of the Orthodox Faith, when he commanded, that all the Subjects of his Empire ſhould receive the faith from <hi>Damaſeus</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and from <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But it may likewiſe fall out, that that ſame Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, to wit, <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the ſecond, might make two Ordinances, which may mutually deſtroy one another; for he convoked the firſt Synod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which condemned the Opinion of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> and ſome years after he convoked the ſecond Synod of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> which contradicted it, and allowed the opinion of <hi>Neſtorius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS ſame inconvenience is verified by the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the beſt reformed Churches in the World, I mean that of <hi>Luther,</hi> and of <hi>Calvin:</hi> For as the Reformation was that of a National Church of the ſame extent with that of the Territory of the Soveraign where it was eſtabliſhed; ſo likewiſe did it carry the Obligation into <hi>Germany, Sweedland,</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> that they ſhould ſubmit to Conſubſtantiation, without any bodies having the liberty to form aſſemblies to themſelves which may reject it; which Churches might do if they were Independant. The ſame inconvenience is happened, and muſt happen from the National eſtabliſhment of the Reformation which <hi>Calvin</hi> hath made in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> ſome parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> and elſewhere: and how pure ſoever the Reformation was as for the Doctrine of that holy man, it is extremely defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive as to the Diſcipline, the power Eccleſiaſtick, and that Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal which he Erected in <hi>Geneva,</hi> diſtinct and Independant on the Magiſtrate, by vertue of a pretended Divine right and power, which hath been the cauſe of all thoſe infinite diſorders, confuſions, and even Schiſms in <hi>England, Scotland, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> even in the time of <hi>Calvin,</hi> as we read in his Epiſtles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ONE great convenience which is found in the Eſtabliſhment of a National Government, is, that it is always grounded upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41651:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
principles, cruel, and barbarous, as to conſtrain, to perſecute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even to burn thoſe who in matter of Religion do not embrace that of the Eccleſiaſtical State, or of the Magiſtrate that eſtabliſhes it, and do not conform to all the practices that he appoints and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THEY ſay that this National eſtabliſhment of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Government, deprives Man of his Reaſon, and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Religious liberty, in the choice he ought to make of his God, and of the worſhip he ought to render him, and to which he ſhould not be conſtrained, but perſwaded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither to be brought to it by cuſtome nor by birth, nor likewiſe by the Law of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, unleſs he be convinced that his Ordinances and commands in matters of Religion are conformable to the word of God; for they preſs mightily upon this conſideration, that this eſtabliſhment di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts Man of the ſame liberty in his religious life, as he hath in the Civil, where he is not reſtrained by any Law of the Magiſtrate to chooſe his houſe, his Wife, his Maſter, his Servant, his Lawyer, his Phyſitian, his Calling, nor any one particular manner how to govern his Family, provided it may be done without breaking the publick peace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THEY ſay, that how unjuſt or how extravagant ſoever the Laws of the Magiſtrate might be for the regulating of Politie, yet there is nothing unreaſonable, neither in the Magiſtrate generally to command the practice of them, nor in all Subjects ſubmitting to them, without reſerve or exception<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long as the importance of thoſe Laws do not extend beyond the preſent life; but if it reaches further, and Conſcience and Eternal Salvation be concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they believe, that an uniformity of Faith and of Religion, which ſhould be impoſed upon us, how good ſo ever the thing might be in its ſelf, it would be wicked and unreaſonable, becauſe it would do violence to the Conſcience, of which the Magiſtrate is not the Maſter, nor the Arbiter, as he is of the Bodies and eſtates of Men.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. That upon the ground of this Hypotheſis, That every Supream Authority, either in the Popiſh or the Presbyterian Church, is ſubject to Error; Monſieur <hi>de Condom</hi> hath reaſon to approve of the Congregational way, and the Independency of particular Churches on any other Authority than that of Jeſus Chriſt in his VVord.</head>
            <p>BUT there is nothing, which does more reaſonably eſtabliſh the Independancy of particular Churches, nor which more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſtroyes this Authority in the Church, by a divine right, and the neceſſity there is, that a perſon, or a particular Church ſhould depend upon its Ordinances, (unleſs that Supream Authority is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible; for if it be ſubject to Error, it muſt of neceſſity do violence to the Chriſtian liberty of the faithful, and ſo degenerate into a Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Authority) there is nothing, I ſay, which eſtabliſhes more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably the Independency of particular Churches, nor which more powerfully deſtroyes their dependency, than the account which the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> gives of the judgements of the Independants, and of the Sentence that the Synod of <hi>Charenton</hi> pronounced againſt them.</p>
            <p>THEY believe, <hi>ſayes he,</hi> that every faithful Member ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the illuminations of his own Conſcience, without ſubmitting his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Authority of any Body, nor any Eccleſiaſtical Aſſembly, and they do not refuſe to ſubmit to the word of God, nor to embrace the deciſions of Synods, when after a due and through Examination of them, they find them reaſonable. That which they refuſe to do, is to ſubmit their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that of any Aſſembly, becauſe it is a Society of Men that are ſubject to Errour.</p>
            <p>THE Goſpel it ſelf is not more true than this perſwaſion of Independants, and that Biſhop could not approve of one more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, to wit, that a particular perſon, or Church, ought not to ſubmit their Faith, their Religion, nor the guidance of their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to an Authority which is ſubject to errour, but only to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41651:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Word of God, which is an infallible Authority. Upon this ground the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath reaſon to condemn the Synod of <hi>Charenton,</hi> for having taxed the Judgement of the Independants with Errour, <hi>which conſiſts,</hi> as ſayes the Synod, <hi>in what they teach, that every Church ought to be governed by its own laws, without any dependance upon any in matters Eccleſiaſtical, and without any obligation to acknowledge the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Synods for its governance and conduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THEN a little after, this ſame Synod decides, that</hi> this Sect is as prejudicial to the State as to the Church: that it opens a door to all ſorts of Irregularities and extravagancies: that it takes away all the means of bringing any remedy to them; and that if it had field-room enough it would form to it ſelf as many Religions, as Pariſhes or particular Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>THESE laſt words, ſayes the Biſhop, diſcover, that it is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in matters of Faith, that the Synod would eſtabliſh depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy, ſince the greateſt inconvenience that he takes notice of, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which the faithful people of God would fall by independancy, is, that they would frame as many Religions as Pariſhes; then, ſays he, of neceſſity, according to the Doctrine of that Synod, each Church, and by a ſtronger reaſon each particular, muſt depend, as to what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects faith, upon a ſupreme Authority, which reſides in ſome Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, or in ſome body, to which Authority all the faithful people of God ought to ſubmit their Judgement.</p>
            <p>THIS Biſhop could take notice of nothing more unreaſonable, and more extravagant in our Synods, than to oblige a private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſubmit himſelf in matters of Faith to the Judgment of an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe deciſions are not the Word of God, that is to ſay, not infallible.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, that pre-ſuppoſing all Supreme Authority in the Church, whether in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>Romiſh,</hi> is ſubject to errour, the Government of the Adverſaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> of Independants, or other Proteſtants, is equally juſtifiable, when they refuſe to pay ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Authority of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince that it is incomparably more defective than that which the Proteſtants ſet up in their Churches.</p>
            <p>BUT on the other ſide, if it be true, that, upon this ground, the Government of the Independants is more juſtifiable and more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable than that of other Proteſtants who blindly ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Tribunal ſubject to errour, and whoſe conduct and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is beyond all compariſon further off from Reaſon, than is that of the Papiſts; for pre-ſuppoſing that the Authority of <hi>Rome</hi> is infallible, the ſubmiſſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the people pay to that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41651:9"/>
Authority, is ſo much the more reaſonable as that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants is the leſs, when they ſubmit to a ſupreme Authority which they themſelves believe is ſubject to errour.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> hath great reaſon to be ſure, that the Proteſtants are mightily beſide the Cuſhion, and to blame, for condemning the Infallibility of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo long as the Inconteſtability, and indiſputableneſs which they inveſt their ſupreme Authority with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, carries the ſame Obligation along with it to obedience and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.

            </p>
            <p>IS not that to tell us, that a man excommunicated unjuſtly, is as much obliged to ſubmit himſelf to the excommunication pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him by an Authority which hath erred, as when it is given by an Authority which hath not erred? And is not that to tell us, that in every way, whither juſtly or unjuſtly, a perſon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to Satan (as is the general opinion of all Proteſtants <hi>(excepting</hi> my Father) that to deliver to Satan and to excommunicate are one and the ſame thing) ought not to diſpute o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

            <p>THE Biſhop likewiſe hath no leſs good Reaſon to be ſure, that the conjunction of all the parts of Romiſh Church in one body would be unreaſonable, if they were not cimented by infallibility; and to diveſt it of its Infallibility, is to break it in pieces, is to caſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of its leaſt parts into Independancy, and to give liberty to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of them to govern themſelves according to their own mode and way, and to do their buſineſs by themſelves.</p>
            <p>BUT here we ſhould obſerve, as we go along, that of two depths of Satan, the Eccleſiaſtical Power, and Infallibility, the firſt is a Lie, an
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41651:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Impoſture, and a cheat; but that preſuppoſing that it is not a cheat, but a thing that is good, and true, and the uſe of which is neceſſary in the Church, Infallibility is naturally and reaſonably a conſequence of it. And in truth, our Reformers have placed Inconteſtability in the room of Infallibility. But it is true alſo, that if Infallibility be a pure cheat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other is a pure and abſolute tyranny, and it is leſs reaſonable, in not being a natural conſequence of Eccleſiaſtical power: inconteſtability is a thouſand times worſe than Infallibity except it be in one thing, and that is, that it hath not been of ſo long a Duration.</p>
            <p>'TIS here no doubt wherein the illuminations of humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon were not ſo great to our firſt Reformers, as to the generation of men in this Age: For as thoſe ſoreſaw in it, that a ſubmiſſion of ſo many Princes and people, who differed in Cuſtomes, Laws, and Languages, to an Authority ſubject to errour, was not only unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but alſo impoſſible, to prevent the revolt both of Kings and people, they with a great deal of Juſtice inveſted it with Infallibility.</p>
            <p>AND 'tis here too that the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> triumphs over us, and has great reaſon for it on his ſide, when he reproaches us that we have been deficient in our Politicks, in not erecting among us an infallible Tribunal, and that we are much to blame, for obliging the faithful people of God with ſo much rigour and ſeverity to ſubmit to a tribunal ſubject to errour; but thoſe of <hi>Rome</hi> are not ſo, for they oblige their people to ſubmit to one that is infallible.</p>
            <p>BUT the Independants, as they are led by the illumination of grace, and reaſon, ſo likewiſe are they moſt reationally, and with great Juſtice and Piety diſengaged not only from a pretended Infallible Tribunal, but alſo from the Tyranny of ſuch dependance, or ſubmiſſion to an Authority ſubject to errour.</p>
            <p>AS to the Aſſertion of the Synod of <hi>Charenton,</hi> that the Sect of the Independants opens the door to all manner of Irregularities and Extravagances, that Aſſertion, I ſay, ſeems plauſible at the firſt, as in truth it is not only plauſible, but moſt reaſonable in matters pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Civil, in which, if there were not a laſt Reſort and Refuge, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from Court to Court in the Territories of a Soveraign, there would be as many Courts erected Independant one on the other, not only as there are Families, but as there are private perſons. Which incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience is not one in matters of Religion, Faith, Doctrine and Divine Worſhip, in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which the Conſcience of every one is the laſt reſort where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the buſineſs is to be judged without any further Appeal, and where

none ought to be conſtrained, but exhorted and perſwaded: A Synod is to perſwade a particular Church to embrace ſuch a Faith; but it hath neither right nor power to force it.

This is what the Congregational party have done with great care and circumſpection in the making of their Confeſſion: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that they do but a very little differ from that of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and that they do not at all divide from them, but in matter of Diſcipline, they have alſo indeavoured to have their Faith con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and as to their Diſcipline, it is very ſimple and naked: they have no other than that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives in three words, to wit, <hi>That every thing in the Church ſhould be done Decently and in Order.</hi> They have eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had an eye to the practice of the Churches under the good <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, under <hi>Conſtantine, Theodoſius, Martianus,</hi> and <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom they kept a ſtrict uniformity in Faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was maintained by letters which they called <hi>Literae Teſtimonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, Circulares, Eccleſiaſticae, Formatae;</hi> tho otherwiſe they took the liberty to differ one from another, even under one and the ſame Emperour, in Diſcipline, in Cuſtomes, and in Ceremonies. <hi>Saint Auſtin, Epiſt. ad Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuarium,</hi> 119. &amp; <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 86. <hi>ad Caſulanum Presbyterum,</hi> permits any Church to differ from others in Ceremonies, and in manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, provided that they agree with them in Unity of Faith.

            <head>CHAP. V. That the Congregational Churches do moſt rationally Eſtabliſh the Authority of Synods and Paſtors, and the nature of the Church.</head>
            <p>'TIS a great wrong and injury done to the Independants, to affirm that they condemn Synods, ſince on the contrary, they Eſtabliſh the true uſe of them, as the Biſhop of <hi>Condom,</hi> who hath more charity for them than other Synods, and our Divines acknowledge. <hi>The Independants,</hi> ſays he, <hi>do not refuſe to embrace and comply with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of Synods, when, after they have duely examined them, they find them not unreaſonable: that which they refuſe to do, is to ſubmit their Judgement to that of any Aſſembly or Society ſubject to errour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Independants argue as Mr.</hi> Pajon <hi>does:</hi> Though Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, <hi>ſays he,</hi> ſhould come down from Heaven to dwell on the earth again with all the rayes of Glory that are roand about him, to teach us, and to guide and direct us; yet it would be impoſſible for us to obey him reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, without making uſe of our iwn illumination to know it, and to judge whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be juſt and reaſonable to obey him in all things.</p>
            <p>If he would not have a humane Judgement ſubmit to that which diſcovers it's Infallibility with ſo much dazling and luſtre, unleſs rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lead one to it; by an Argument <hi>à fortiori</hi> would he approve of the conduct of the Independants as reaſonable, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſubmit to a Judgement that is humane and fallible.</p>
            <p>BUT the true Conſtitution of Synods according to them, when they look upon them as the Aſſemblies of the Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, of Divines, and of faithful people, and the true uſe they make of them, and which ought to be made of them, is to ask, and receive from them advice and counſel, as one expects, and as one ought to receive it from wiſe and experienced men, and not by way of command and impulſe. That is all the Authority that the great Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> gives them, when they conſider them as ſuch: And alſo the Oecumenical Synods which were held under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and <hi>Martian,</hi> had no more, before thoſe Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41651:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
gave to their concluſions the force and prevalence of Canons, and the Sanction of Imperial Laws.</p>
            <p>THEY take the Apoſtolical Synod for the model of the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of all Synods, at leaſt of that which they would attribute to themſelves: and although it was the onley Synod that was guided by the ſpirit of Infallibility, and its Authority was much more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent otherwiſe than that of all the Synodal Aſſemblies in the ſucceeding Ages; yet it never went, as the others have done ſince, to throw out <hi>Anathema</hi>'s at the heads of thoſe who refuſe to be obedient to them; but it only concludes with this exhortation, <hi>if you keep theſe Canons, you will do well,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY ſpeak of the nature of the Church, of the power and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Paſtors, and of their Ordination, and according to the good maxims of <hi>Monſieur Meſtrozat, Monſieur Pajon,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Claude,</hi> and their Doctors were the firſt who have eſtabliſhed the true nature of Schiſm.</p>
            <p>AS to what reſpects the Power, the Authority, and the Juriſdiction of Paſtors, they acknowledge no other in the Church than that which is confined in every particular Church, and which goes not beyond per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or at the fartheſt a declaration that it makes, that it no longer owns ſuch and ſuch, either for the Paſtors, or Members of its Society: And this is what is done by a natural right, and not in ſhooting out the thunderclaps of Excommunication, or depoſition againſt them; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is not a buſineſs that is much diſputed of among them. The hereticks and the wicked, being condemned by their own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have no need to be excommunicated, becauſe they are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of themſelves, as the Biſhop <hi>Godean</hi> tells us in his Paraphraſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the eleventh Verſe, of the third Chapter of the Epiſtile to <hi>Titus, A man that is an Heretick after the firſt and ſecond Admonition reject, knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubverted, and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and it is what he ſays, after Saint <hi>Jerome.</hi> If any one of their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies practiſe Excommunication, it is that of the Ancient Chriſtians, it is not a privation from the holy Supper, but an ejection of the body out of the Aſſembly, no longer to be reckoned any of their Members.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VI. An Anſwer to thoſe who ſay that the Congregational way is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the Civil power; and that it deprives the Magiſtrate of the Right he hath to the Government of the Church; that it is Introductory of Irreligion, Ignorance, and Schiſm in the Church.</head>
            <p>THE four and twentieth Chapter of their confeſſion of faith, condemns thoſe who ſpeak of them, as of perſons that deſpiſe Superiour Powers: For it is eaſiy to demonſtrate that their way is ſo far from being, as <hi>Monſieur Daille</hi> believed, pernitious, and ſuch as troubles the peace of the world, or which over-throws the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it, and the authority both of Soveraigns and their ſtates, that, on the contrary, there is no way in the world which contributes more to the ſtrength'ning of Empires, Eſpecially of Monarchies, and which ought leſſe diſquiet the Crowned heads for fear leaſt they ſhould cauſe by it any commotions in the State, than theirs: For as they do not ſet up and eſtabliſh any Eccleſiaſtical tribunal indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant on the Magiſtrate, which draws along with it the two thirds of the moſt conſiderable perſons of the State, eſpecially, thoſe who are moſt nice and Scrupulous in Religion; it is impoſſible that there ſhould be any troubles made by leagues and confederations in that manner as may be in all the Presbyterian Churches of a Nation, and as thoſe practiſe it, when they forme to themſelves, as oft times they have done an Aſſembly of their deputies.</p>
            <p>ALL the world knowes that theſe general and National Aſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Clergy, have been formidable to Kings and Parliaments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe they are as an Altar, and a Soveraign Eccleſiaſtical power; oppoſed to a Soveraign and civil power, of which there have been ſeen pernitious effects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and which <hi>France,</hi> would have found, if the reformed Religion had prevailed over the Romiſh: And I am very much perſuaded that nothing ſo much diverted <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth from the thoughts he might have had to eſtabliſh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41651:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Religion in <hi>France,</hi> as the apprehenſion he had that his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being ſomewhat free, might be too far lookt into and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Synods and the Conſiſtories, and that his perſon ſhould be brought under their Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>AS therefore the Independants do condemn theſe Maxims, and theſe practiſes, which are abſolutely contrary to theirs; how ill intended ſoever they were, or might be, it is no more poſſible for them to ſet up in a Kingdom, a Soveraign Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, than for all the Companies of Merchants and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or for all the Families of <hi>France</hi> to erect a Tribunal, and a Merchandizing, or Oecumenical Power, which may be equal with that of the Civil State,</p>
            <p>IN a word, as the Congregational Churches do neither receive Ordinances, nor Commandments from their Synods, but only counſells and advice, and that they cannot aſſemble in a body by their deputies, they give a great advantage unto Magiſtrates to poſſeſs an intire and perfect Soveraignty, and to take for their <hi>Motto, Divide &amp; Impera.</hi> For thoſe who deprive their Synods of all Authority, and who do not attribute to themſelves any other power than that of perſuaſion, are the moſt remote of all from framing to themſelves, either an Empire, or one to be chief over them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'TIS true, their weakneſs is their ſubſcribing to that Maxim of</hi> Cicero, libr. de Officiis. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t tutela, ſic procuratio Reipublicae ad uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem eorum qui commiſſi ſunt, non ad eorum quibus commiſſa eſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runda eſt: <hi>and to that of</hi> Salvian, libr. de Providentia. Infinitam Regiae Majeſtatis poteſtatem iſti agnoſcunt, qui infinitam divini Numinis Omnipotentiam non credunt.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, they are accuſed for depriving the Magiſtrate from the ſame Authority, and Soveraign Intendence over the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical State, as over that of the Civil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But notwithſtanding they do ſufficiently ſatisfy all reaſonable and conſiderate perſons of this in the four and twentieth Chapter of their Confeſſion. Beſide thoſe who condemn that collaterality of Governments and of Tribunals, the one Eccleſiaſtical, and the other Civil, in one and the ſame territory, and who believe that it comes from the forge of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and that it hath introduced <hi>Popery</hi> into the world, do not trouble themſelves about reſolving the difficulty, nor about aſſigning to each his Lawes, his Courts, his Officers, his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41651:13"/>
and the meaſure of his Power and Authority.</p>
            <p>I add, that as the force and efficacy of Laws does not conſiſt in, whither they are Eccleſiaſtical or Civil, nor in their goodneſs, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and truth; but in the will of him, or thoſe, who ſit at the Helm of Affairs, the Congregational Churches muſt of neceſſity acknowledg the force of all thoſe Laws, whither for the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical, or the Civil State: only they affirm, that as the Magiſtrate is not Infallible, he may poſſibly abuſe his right, and orr either in the publication, or the execution of his Laws, of what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſoever they be: and as they are not obliged to obey all Civil Laws, no more are they obliged to obey all Laws Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical; they affirm alſo, that as the Empire of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, is not over the bodies, but over the hearts of men, the Magiſtrate who is the Protector and Defender of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in his Territories, ſins extremely, when he makes Laws and Ordinances that do violence to the bodies of his Subjects, and that take from them that liberty, which every man ought to have in the choice of his Religion, and in the manner of ſerving <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that crime which is impoſed on them, ſuppoſing it to be one, is incomparably leſs, than that of <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Churches, all which follow the eſtabliſhment, and the practiſe of <hi>Calvin,</hi> who ſet up in <hi>Geneva</hi> an Eccleſiaſtical Tribunal, Independant and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from that of the Magiſtrate; inſomuch that a learned man named <hi>Monſieur Jurieu,</hi> has writ a large Book, wherein he endeavours to prove, that the Soveraign Magiſtrate, conſidered as ſuch, has not any juriſdiction, nor Intendence over the Collected Churches in his Dominions, and that he hath no other right than that of Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conſidered as a Chriſtian, and one of his principal Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein <hi>Monſieur Jurieu</hi> is more <hi>Independant</hi> than the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> themſelves, and he does not afford ſo much Authority to the Magiſtrate over the Churches that are collected within his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Dominions, as the <hi>Independants</hi> do.</p>
            <p>THE Independant Churches and their Paſtors are very wide from theſe thoughts and practiſes: For the Authority of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, being as that of every Family, what liberty ſoever it has to govern it ſelf according to its own way and humour, it is not, neither in right, nor in power, nor even in will, to ſet up a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal diſtinct from, and Independent on that of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:41651:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
AFTER all, a Prince who ſhould endeavour to eſtabliſh an Arbitrary Power in his Kingdom, that ſhould depend only upon God and his Sword, might imagine he ſhould be leſs hindred by ſeveral thouſands of Independant Congregations, not only on him, and on his Courts, but alſo the one Independant on the other; than by one entire body of all thoſe Churches, which ſhould ſet up by their deputies an Eccleſiaſtical Tribunal diſtinct from, and Independant on the Civil: For the ſtrengeh of all thoſe Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Congregations, would be like that of ſeveral threads, which may eaſily be broke one after another, whereas the ſtrength of all thoſe Churches joyned in one body, would be like to that of all thoſe threads twiſted together, which it would be almoſt, if not abſolutely, impoſſible to break, or to undo, but by the ſame way that <hi>Alexander</hi> took to break the Gordian-knot.</p>
            <p>AS the Independent Churches do come the neareſt to thoſe of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ſo likewiſe they are further off, than any of the other reformed Churches, from that thought and practiſe which has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the Myſtery of Inquity, which is nothing elſe but the Empire of the Clergy, and ſo conſequently That of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in the Empire of the ſecular Powers, under the Mask and Diſguiſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Eccleſiaſtical power.</p>
            <p>AS to the Objection that is made againſt them, that in caſe there ſhould be no other Eccleſiaſtical Eſtabliſhment in a Kingdom than theirs, the three fourths of the Inhabitants would live in great negligence, and a groſs Ignorance of Religion. To that they ſay, that their way does not exempt Paſtors from attending upon the Office of their Miniſtry, at all times and places, both within and without their particular Congregations; and to take the ſame pains as the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters do, for what repects the preaching of the word in the moſt publick places: alſo they do very much approve, that the Magiſtrate ſhould erect Academies, and Colledges; aſſign Tithes, and Revenues, and Temples; eſtabliſh perſons to be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the inſtruction of people in publick, to invite them to it, and to excite the Ignorant to frequent the Schools, and the Lectures of the Profeſſors of Arts and Sciences, where they ſhould go for the love of vertue and knowledge, without being conſtrained.</p>
            <p>AS to the crime of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which is impoſed on them, as their being ſeperate from all the viſible Churches of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in the ſame manner as the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the <hi>Novatians,</hi> and the <hi>Luciferians</hi> did:

'tis a falſe Accu ſation. Thoſe who accuſe them of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> do not underſtand the nature of <hi>Schiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. 'TIS not <hi>Schiſm,</hi> when a particular Church ſeparates from another Church, as the Church of <hi>Luther</hi> from that of <hi>Calvin,</hi> nor the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from the <hi>Papiſts:</hi> nor even one particular reformed Church from ſome other, with which it made before but one body of a Church: But true <hi>Schiſm</hi> is formed among the Members of one and the ſame particular Church, as was that of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. 'TIS not <hi>Schiſm</hi> when a number of <hi>Hereticks</hi> ſeparate from the Orthodox party of a particular Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to make a Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on apart, to the end they may profeſs their <hi>hereſie</hi> with greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but it is an Apoſtaſie, and an abandoning and forſaking of the Orthodox faith, or Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and viſible: and upon this ground the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not a <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> but an <hi>Apoſtate</hi> Church; although it be one for the firſt reaſon, becauſe that what ingagement or tye ſoever all its Members have to one head, however they are not all agreed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Schiſm</hi> properly is when the Members of one Church are at variance, as were thoſe of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and upon that account there is alwayes a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

5.

            </p>
            <p>NOW this clearing up of the Nature of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> which ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtabliſhes the <hi>Independancy</hi> of the Churches, and makes it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſonable, does not deſtroy the Confederation of the Churches into one body, even under a national <hi>Synod,</hi> when for the mutual preſervation of theſe Churches againſt a common Enemy that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes them, they are conſtrained to make but one body of State or of Churches, ſuch as is the Confederation of our Churches in <hi>France.</hi> But then that neceſſity does not deſtroy the natural liberty of every particular Church to be <hi>Independant:</hi> 'tis a Confederati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on eſtabliſhed with prudence, in that manner as was that of the Cities of <hi>Achaida,</hi> and as is at this day that of the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and of the <hi>Swizers;</hi> the conjunction, of which into one body, and under one and the ſame juriſdiction does not diveſt any Town or Province of their natural freedome and liberty to be <hi>Independant</hi> on one another.</p>
            <p>THERE is however this temper, and menage to be obſerved in this Religious Confederation, that it ought to be made, not by vertue of the Power of binding and looſing, and of the Keys of the Kingdome of heaven, which it is pretended that <hi>God</hi> hath committed to Paſtors, or <hi>Synods;</hi> but by vertue of a confederated diſcipline, which is in the place of a Magiſtrate.

            <p>AND this is that wherein the prudence of our firſt Reformers in <hi>France</hi> have been wanting, when they ſat up a diſcipline by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an Eccleſiaſtical power diſtinct from that of the Magiſtrate, and from that which has its operation upon the heart by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word; and of a power faſtened to the Keyes of the

            <p>BEFORE I go to another Chapter, I ſhall take notice that the reſult of the thoughts, and of the practiſes of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionals, their Churches and their Paſtors, do come to theſe two Maxims.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT to eſtabliſh peace and true Religion in the World, and among Chriſtians; we muſt go back to the <hi>Materia prima</hi> of the Congregational Churches, which is, that every perſon, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Society hath the liberty to deliberate and conſult about the choice of a Religion, and of the way to ſerve <hi>God;</hi> and to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that point the counſel of wiſe and ſincere perſons, provided that that counſel tends not to Irreligion, and to ſome Eſtabliſhment of ſuch maxims which ſhock the natural Notions concerning the exiſtence of a <hi>God,</hi> his Providence, the Immortality of the ſoul, the neceſſity of a Divine Worſhip; provided alſo that the manner which every perſon, and every Church hath choſen to govern it ſelf by, doth not trouble the State in which one lives; unleſs that trouble happen by accident, in the manner that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſayes of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> which excites troubles, and brings Wars and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT this maxim of a national Church in every Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:41651:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with an uniformity of Doctrine, and diſcipline, diſtinct from the civil Tribunals in juriſdiction and officers, hath introduced the <hi>Pope</hi> into the World; that it hath been, it is, and it will be the cauſe that there never will be a Church in the World in its true purity, unleſs <hi>Almighty God</hi> reſerves ſome among the Congregational Churches.</p>

            <p>I Could eaſily ſhew that for above this four thouſand years before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and even during the height of <hi>Popery,</hi> and in the boſome of the Church of <hi>Rome, God</hi> hath alwayes reſerved ſome true Worſhippers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by the way of Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Aſſemblies; there were an infinite number of them in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, during the perſecution that was ſet on foot by the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and when, as St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſayes, all the World were <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to come more particularly to the thing; they have had <hi>Independant</hi> Churches in all times, and in all <hi>places,</hi> before the <hi>Law,</hi> and under the <hi>Law,</hi> in the time of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and after the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> there were of them in the time of <hi>Exos</hi> the Son of <hi>Seth;</hi> for ſo muſt be underſtood the laſt Verſe of the fourth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis, when men began to call upon the name of the Lord:</hi> that from his time the Children of <hi>God</hi> began to form themſelves into particular Congregations, and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from thoſe that ran after the World, and its vanities, and to be called the Children of <hi>God</hi> or of <hi>Jehova,</hi> and to pay their ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to him as to their Creator and Benefactor. The family of <hi>Noah</hi> and his <hi>Ark</hi> was a Congregational Church, which <hi>God</hi> had ſeparated from all the reſt of the World. The family of <hi>Job,</hi> that of <hi>Abraham, Joſuah, Samuel,</hi> were <hi>Independant</hi> Churches. <hi>Paleſtine</hi> was full of them, as <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us, and they were truly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant,</hi> becauſe they neither had any thing to do with the natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclude, the ſeven thouſand men, that had not bowed their knee to <hi>Baal,</hi> were <hi>Independant</hi> Churches; for it cannot be thought that ſo great a number of perſons could aſſemble together in one place, and that too in a time of ſo great perſecution.</p>
            <p>THERE were of them in the time of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> for the Apoſtolical Colledge was an <hi>Independant</hi> Church, and in his time, two or three perſons aſſembled in his name, made a Church, as alſo ſayes <hi>Tertullian, ubi tres, ibi Eccleſia, eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amſi Laici.</hi> Immediately after the Aſcention of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the firſt Aſſembly of Chriſtians in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was <hi>Independant;</hi> and that where <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his family were aſſembled, was a Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Church, of which St. <hi>Peter</hi> was the Paſtor for ſome days. <hi>Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> had one of them in his houſe.

The <hi>Independant</hi> Churches of <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt ſome of them, are formed after this Model, and exact from their Members, that they ſhall abſtain from thoſe crimes of which <hi>Pliny</hi> makes mention.</p>
            <p>NOW that cuſtome of the Chriſtians in the time of <hi>Pliny,</hi> which exacted from the Members of their Churches, a life perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exemplary, ſtops the mouths of thoſe, who turn into rallery, the <hi>Independant</hi> Aſſemblies, becauſe they only do admit of thoſe that are holy, and in whom they find the marks and ſigns of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and who oblige themſelves by Oath, or verbal promiſe, to abſtain from thoſe crimes that <hi>Pliny</hi> here has reckoned up, or to undergo the Penalty ſet, according to the diſcipline of the Church.</p>
            <p>ALSO that cuſtome of the Chriſtians teſtifies, that beſides the numerous Churches, as for inſtance that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> which conſiſted of ſeveral thouſands, where it could not be otherwiſe but that there muſt be a good number of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and debauched and looſe perſons, there were eſtabliſhed other Congregational, taken out of the great Church, whereof the Members were more holy and more Orthodox; and who reſembled thoſe whom <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of, and thoſe <hi>Stations</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions: where beſide the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Aſſemblies, ſome families ſet a part by themſelves one day of the week to faſting, to prayer and other exerciſes of Piety, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the Celebration of the holy Supper: and this is what they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſed, and with good edification: for it is with ſmall Churches, as with ſmall States, little Republicks, Families, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Synods</hi> of twenty five or thirty perſons; wherein it is much more eaſie to eſtabliſh a good order, and to bring thoſe who are of it unto the practiſe of good manners and life, than in great States, in great Churches, and <hi>Oecumenical</hi> Synods, and ſuch as are <hi>National,</hi> wherein Ambition, Envy, Factions, Avarice, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>THESE conſiderations do furniſh me with ſeveral others, which confirm me in this Opinion that the Congregational way was that which <hi>God</hi> made uſe of, in the Ancient Church, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the faith, thoſe, who were not Chriſtians, but by outward profeſſion, <hi>from a State of nature to a State of Grace:</hi> and that the way which they take at this day, when one perſon preaches to ſeveral thouſands is neither properly, nor efficaciouſly that which gains ſouls to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And this will appear by the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Government at this day in the Church, to that of the antient Primitive Chriſtians. I believe, there will be found but very little <hi>conformity,</hi> not onely, in the perſons that attend upon the Miniſtry, but alſo in the places, and manner, where, and how it is performed. Heretofore the Biſhop alone in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick did execute the office of preaching, and the other duties of the holy Miniſtry; for he left thoſe of leſſer conſequence to the Deacons; but at this day juſt the Reverſe is practiſed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. 'Tis now only the Prieſt that preaches in publick in the Aſſemblies of ſeveral thouſands. And likewiſe as the extent of the place unto which the Miniſtry of theſe at this day is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſo it was alſo heretofore that of the Biſhop, and he moſt commonly dated his Letters thus <hi>ex mea paraecia.</hi> Which, by the way, plainly ſhewes us, that the Intendance and Government of the Biſhop in the Primitive Church, was only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Town or <hi>Villa,</hi> which they called a Pariſh or a Suburb, for alſo every <hi>Villa</hi> and Burrough had their <hi>Chorepiſcopum. Monſieur Larroque,</hi> without thinking of it, makes it clear and evident, that it was the Ancient practiſe, for the Biſhop alone to have the charge of preaching in the greateſt, and moſt numerous Aſſemblies, becauſe the Biſhops being aged and ſick, they called to his help and aſſiſtance, not the Prieſts of the Biſhop's Presbytry, but ſome neighbour Biſhops. He tells us of one <hi>Nareiſſus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> who, being a hundred and ſixteen years old, had for his Coadjutor <hi>Alexander,</hi> that had been Biſhop of <hi>Capadocia:</hi> and of one <hi>Theoctenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> that ſhared the care of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy with <hi>Anatolius,</hi> who, in truth, was not as yet Biſhop, but who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was then conſecrated and called Biſhop: which plainly ſhewes
was
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:41651:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that a Prieſt could not be his Coadjutor. This is alſo confirmed by the example of <hi>Valerius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> who being old and decayed, took not one of thoſe who was to continue in the Presbytry for his Coadjutor; but he took <hi>Saint Auſtin,</hi> who was to be his Succeſſor, and who alſo was called Biſhop of <hi>Hippo</hi> during the life of <hi>Valerius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS to thoſe of the Presbytry, who were called Deacons, as they were the Creatures of the Biſhop, and wholy at his Devotion, ſo likewiſe their Miniſtry was that which is ſpoken of in the 6. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which was not that of preaching in publick.</p>
            <p>AS for the Prieſts or Elders, who were not Deacons, they did not ordinarily preach in publick aſſemblies, whence it happened, that we read of very few Homilies compoſed and made by the Prieſts. Their Miniſtry was concluded and bound within the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment or <hi>paraecia</hi> of the Biſhop, and, as I have already ſaid, it was leſs fixt, and more Itinerant, for they went from houſe to houſe: there was not a day paſt but that the Prieſt, or Elder, viſited the good Families, went to prayers there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expounded the word, and adminiſtred the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper to them: and as for Baptiſm, it was moſt commonly celebrated by the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons in great Aſſemblies, or in great Churches, at the entrance of which, the Fonts were placed, or the <hi>Baptiſterium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'TIS true, the Biſhops did frequently oppoſe thoſe private aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and by their <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> (ſo far as that the <hi>Synode</hi> of <hi>Gangr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>phales<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and condemned even thoſe that communicated with them. They would do the like alſo to perſons of quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that kept in their houſes Prieſts, and Oratories. 'Tis true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>Saint Chryſoſtome</hi> would have the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> to be as publick as <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and that both ſhould be celebrated and performed in the eyes of the whole World.</p>
            <p>BUT becauſe it would ſcarcely be believed, that one Biſhop ſingly, as <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Saint Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> could preach in publick one Lord's day, to above a hundred thouſand Auditors that were in each of their <hi>Villa's;</hi> they ſay, that of neceſſity ſeveral of the Presbytry muſt perform the office of Preachers in thoſe other places of the City where the Biſhop did not preach: and this appears by the Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of <hi>Saint Chryſoſtome, ad populum Antiochenum,</hi> when he was not Biſhop: That is true, but alſo thoſe Prieſts had no fixt places,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41651:18"/>
no cure, nor certain, pariſh, over which they were paſtors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Biſhop himſelf was the Curate of the Pariſh, ſo that the Prieſts were only the Vicars of the Biſhops, in the ſame manner as <hi>Nicholas.</hi> 1. called the Biſhop of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of <hi>France, Suos Epiſcopos &amp; Vicarios.</hi> Thoſe Prieſts were, as the Deacons at the devotion of the Biſhop, and were entirely his Creatures, and they might rather (I am ſure better) be called the Miniſters of the Biſhop, than of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or of the Church, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the ſix and twentieth Canon of the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Agde,</hi> for they were like perſons taken upon hire, and to whom the Biſhop gave Salary for their pains and trouble.</p>
            <p>AFTER all theſe diſcoveries and Manifeſtations, there is no doubt but that the Churches in the time of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and for a long while after, were congregational, and <hi>Independant</hi> on <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodes,</hi> ſince that even every Family of the moſt conſiderable, and better ſort was a Church, or, at leaſt, they had one among them, where the exercizes of Piety were regularly performed every day, and where, during their repaſt, the holy <hi>Scripture</hi> was read, as we may learn from the <hi>firſt Epiſtle to Timothy, Chapter the</hi> IV. <hi>verſe the fifth. For every Creature of God is good, and nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with thanksgiving: For it is ſanctified by the word of God, and prayer.</hi> And where before they departed, or, indeed, roſe from Table, they received the Communion as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us in his book <hi>de Corona Militis,</hi> declaring that this practiſe was agreeing with the inſtitution of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as it was alſo practiſed much in the 3. Age in the time of Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> as he tells us in one of his Epiſtles, <hi>Quotidie communicamus.</hi> Although ſeveral families, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Lord's day,</hi> made very great and Numerous Aſſemblies, where in moſt ſolemn manner they attended upon prayer, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and celebration of the holy Supper, yet he, who performed the Action, was called <hi>Primus Presbyter, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41651:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Deacons, and whoſe gifts were leſs for praying and preaching in publick.</p>
            <p>FOR though I believe that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did not eſtabliſh diverſe degrees of Paſtors, and that in their time, and a long while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they were called indifferently Biſhops, Prieſts, Elders, <hi>ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes,</hi> Miniſters, and Deacons: And that the ſame Deacons bore a part in the Miniſtry of the word, with the reſt, as it is ſeen, for Example, in Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Phillip,</hi> and by what <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> tells us in the <hi>ſixth book of his ſtrom ites,</hi> and <hi>Mr. James Capel</hi> in his <hi>Catechiſme:</hi> yet it is moſt certain that from the ſecond age, they were diſtinguiſhed in names and offices, that the firſt Prieſt, or Biſhop, attended more peculiarly upon preaching in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and the Prieſts and Deacons upon the <hi>functions</hi> of leſſer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, as <hi>alms-giving</hi> &amp;c. from whence it is, that we read ſo often of the firſt Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſuch a one created ſo many Prieſts, ſo many Deacons, and that <hi>Hyggen</hi> in the year 141. cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated fifteen Prieſts, fifteen Deacons, and ſix Biſhops. That <hi>Eleutherius</hi> in the year 184 ordained 12 Prieſts. 8 Deacons, and 15 Biſhops, not to ſerve in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in other places, where the Biſhop, who had ordained them, was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the <hi>preaching</hi> in publick, and the Prieſts and Deacons upon the other <hi>functions</hi> of the holy Miniſtry; for their Miniſtry was leſs fixt; they went to break bread from houſe to houſe, they inſtructed, they comforted, they confirmed Chriſtians, and thoſe whom they called <hi>Fideles</hi> in the profeſſion of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in the Practiſe of Piety, and drew over <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> to them, and they baptized them, adding every day ſome or other to the Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to be ſaved. In a word, they formed almoſt as many independant Churches, as there were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but which then did not conſtitute a Communion diſtinct from that of the ſame <hi>Fideles</hi> in the greater and more numerous Aſſemblies, and where they aſſiſted, not only at the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aring of the word, but alſo at the participation of the holy ſupper, and all the ſacred Ceremonies, as <hi>Mounſieur le Sueur</hi> tells us.</p>
            <p>I muſt needs make one obſervation here which will be of no mean conſequence, as to what I have ſaid, about the diverſity of the names of Biſhop, Prieſt, Elder, <hi>Sacerdote,</hi> and Deacon in the ſame Miniſtry, againſt thoſe who would fain perſwade us, that not only this <hi>Intendance</hi> of a Biſhop over the Prieſts, but alſo the

               <hi>prerogative</hi> that they attribute to themſelves of having alone the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and the right to ordain Paſtors, is <hi>of divine right,</hi> and by the Inſtitution of the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> I muſt needs obſerve, I ſay, that ſince the words, and the Offices have been diſtinguiſhed, <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Antiquity never thought this <hi>Intendance</hi> and <hi>Prerogative</hi> to be <hi>of divine right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> becauſe it was in the liberty of a Biſhop to abandon the order or office of Biſhop, without quitting the office of Prieſt, or of Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and indeed without being able to do it, unleſs he were conſtrained to it by the ſentence of depoſition. They did deprive themſelves then of an humane, arbitrary, and Mutable order, unto which they were called by men, but they could not diveſt themſelves of that which they had received from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> That was the Judgment of the Councel of <hi>Ancyra</hi> in the year 314. which having depoſed ſome perſons from the Epiſcopacy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> leſt them in the Presbytry. This is what the ſixth Oecumenical Councel did, <hi>Canon</hi> twenty, which depoſed a Biſhop, but did not take from him the Presbytry; ſo that if there was then an Indelible Caracter, it was not that of Biſhop, but that of Tresbyter, and this is the farther confirmed, and more ſtrongly, by this conſideration, that, as it was an Uſurpation, or at leaſt a Right purely humane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when one of the Members of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, who was called Biſhop, attributed to himſelf alone the right and the office of <hi>Preaching</hi> in publick, and not of communicating it to others, but only as far as he pleaſed: The ſame Judgment ought to be made of this <hi>Intendance</hi> over Prieſts, and this <hi>prerogative</hi> to ordain; and to conclude, that neither Epiſcopacy, nor the power to ordaine, nor that to preach in publick which one perſon reſerved peculiarly to himſelf, were of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.</p>
            <p>THIS is, if I am not miſtaken, an obſervation, which has not as yet by any been thought on, but which is the unravelling of all the difficulties that thoſe great men <hi>Mounſieur Daille</hi> the Father, <hi>Mounſieur Larroque</hi> &amp;c. On one ſide, and <hi>Mounſieur Pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> on the other, have formed concerning either the Eſtabliſhment, or the overthrow of Epiſcopacy. And here now is the Reſolution of the words of Saint <hi>Jerome,</hi> which have put ſo many people on the rack, and have ſpent both ſo much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious time and paper. <hi>Quid facit Epiſcopus, quod non facit presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, except<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41651:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the power that the Biſhop reſerved alone to himſelf, by a right purely humane, to regulate the Affairs of the Church; becauſe it would be a thing altogether abſurd, to make <hi>Saint Jerome</hi> ſay, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had in all things equalled the Prieſt to the Biſhop, except the power to ordain. And now alſo you may ſee, by all theſe declarations and diſcoveries, a very ſtrong eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Congregational way. But I now will return from this digreſſion to purſue the ſubject I left off for it.</p>
            <p>THE conduct and Government of the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> under the time of Perſecution, and before that of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> differ'd very much from the manner which was obſerved when the <hi>Emperours</hi> were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and when they aſſembled together, both more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and in greater numbers, enjoying their full liberty. As a Rigorous diſcipline under thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperours could not be practiſed but upon a ſmall number, in great Towns, as <hi>Rome, Antioch, Alexandria, Canſtantinople,</hi> &amp;c. Moſt of the perſons, who could not be diſtinguiſhed one from another, in the Crowd and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and on whom they could lay nothing by way of reproach, either entred into no diſcipline, and were neither <hi>Poenitentes,</hi> nor <hi>Catechumeni,</hi> or elſe they paſſed for thoſe who were called <hi>fideles,</hi> and whom they never ſo much as queſtion'd whether they were baptized or not: For <hi>Saint Ambroſe,</hi> who was looked upon as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good man, and one of the <hi>fideles</hi> that frequented the Religious Aſſemblies both in publick and private, was neither in orders, nor baptized, when the people of <hi>Milan</hi> took him, and carried him away as a holy body to be a Biſhop. Will they ſay that after he was a Biſhop, he paſſed through all the degrees of diſcipline, or peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and that he was a <hi>Catechumen,</hi> and afterwards a <hi>fidelis?</hi> which name was given only to thoſe, who were called Lay, or Secular perſons. And the example of <hi>Conſtantine the great,</hi> who was baptized, at the very point and moment of his death, and that of <hi>Satyrus</hi> the brother of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and of <hi>Valentinian,</hi> whom that Father ſo highly commends, and who died before they were baptized, are a very ſtrong proof and argument for that which I here maintain.</p>
            <p>NOW, thoſe of the faithful who were ſo, rather in reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the <hi>name,</hi> did not under thoſe <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Emperours, quit their good cuſtome of converting their houſes, and their families into ſo many little Churches; they performed there the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:41651:20"/>
of Piety, both during their repaſts, and out of them.</p>
            <p>BUT I muſt here make one remark by the way upon the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Saint Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy,</hi> the 1 <hi>Epiſt</hi> 4 <hi>Chap. and</hi> 5 <hi>Verſe.</hi> which I lately mentioned: that that good practiſe of reading the holy Scriptures during their repaſts, ſucceeded both a good and an evil cuſtome, among the Heathen of quality and condition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diſpoſition of perſons, and according to their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: for the <hi>debauchees</hi> during theirs, had, as <hi>Pliny the Younger</hi> tells us, their <hi>Moriones,</hi> and their <hi>Cynaedos, qui inerrabant Menſis,</hi> to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the time, and pleaſe the Company. But thoſe who were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and more compoſed, as <hi>Cicero, Cratippus, Seneca, Pliny</hi> the <hi>Elder, Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Spurinna,</hi> had their <hi>Anagnoſtes,</hi> who read to them the <hi>Golden Sentences</hi> of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and of the other <hi>Sages</hi> of <hi>Greece<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It doubtleſs therefore thus came, that the Heathen fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies which were of the diſpoſition of theſe latter, being come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as was that of <hi>Cornelius</hi> the <hi>Centurion, Publius</hi> the Proconſul, <hi>Philemon,</hi> and <hi>Lydia,</hi> took this good cuſtome, not only to have a Church in their houſe, but to practiſe there all the Religious duties as well during their repaſts as out of them.</p>
            <p>THIS comes very near to the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Congregational way, which is to be conſidered in two reſpects, either when their Paſtors, and their people retire and withdraw from the crowd of the world, I mean, from the Worldlings, to live con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the contemplation, and meditation of the works of Creation, of Providence, and of Redemption, in the devotion, and elevation of the Soul to <hi>God:</hi> or elſe, when thoſe ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons do form to themſelves Religious aſſemblies, diſtinct from the national Church, and Parochial aſſemblies; in a word, when they are diſtinct from the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Government, which is of the ſame extent, as that of the <hi>Civil,</hi> that is eſtabliſh'd by Lawes; though, in this laſt reſpect, their ſeparation be not an abſolute and intire abandoning of the profeſſion of the doctrine, and life of thoſe who follow the Religion of their Country; but of thoſe who condemn that carriage, that doctrine and Diſcipline, which retained the moſt of the <hi>Apoſtolical.</hi> 'Tis a ſeparating of the good Seed from the Chaff, whereof there is but too much in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Aſſemblies, where one is as much, if not more, a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> by the chance of birth, of place, and of cuſtome, than by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:41651:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
inward principle, or deſign fratned: for otherwiſe the people of the <hi>Independant</hi> Church, and their Paſtors, are no more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, than the Epiſcopal men or the Presbyterians, to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate with them in the Miniſtry of the parochial Churches, provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they do not force them there to practiſe ſuch things as they do really believe from their Conſciences, to be contrary to the word of <hi>God,</hi> and provided alſo that they permit them to believe, that if the Churches reformed from <hi>Popery,</hi> where all ſorts of perſons are received, are the true Churches of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may be had, they ought to have no leſs good and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion of the <hi>Independant</hi> Churches which are come out from them.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe reaſons, all diſintereſſed perſons, that have a zeal for all the true Worſhippers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> indifferently, in what way of communion ſoever, whither Epiſcopal, or Presbyterian, or Congregational, may eaſily be perſwaded, that this laſt retains more of the <hi>Apoſtolick,</hi> becauſe it is not only the Cream and beſt of the others, and a part of that good Seed that has the leaſt of chaff in it; but alſo becauſe it hath more goodneſs, love, and Charity, in the eſteem of thoſe who follow it, for the way of communion with others, and of thoſe who are of it, then the others have for the Congregational way. 'Tis very rarely ſeen that any one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation does not love all good men, of what Communion ſoever they be, and that they do not ſpeak of them as of the true Churches of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> whereas even the more ſober, and honeſter party of the Epiſcopal men, and ſome of the Presbyterians, are ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepoſſeſſed with prejudices againſt thoſe of Congregations, that they are in their account no better than Hypocrites, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and men of ſtrange Enthuſiaſms.</p>
            <p>A Learned Lawyer having caſt his eye upon the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this Chapter, aſſured me, that one <hi>Mr. Hubbart</hi> a grave Barreſter, in a Cauſe between <hi>Colt</hi> and <hi>Glover plaintiffs</hi> on the one part, and the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter defendant</hi> on the other, makes it out, that the Aſſemblies in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church were Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational.

the Towns were full of little private Congregations, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together voluntarily in the Towns, and which the <hi>King</hi> permitted, whileſt neither Juſtice, nor the publick peace, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted. He preſt me likewiſe mightily to inſiſt upon the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition which the Church of <hi>England</hi> made of the Church in its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith made in the year, 1562. Article the XIX. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is abſolutely conformable to that which the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Churches give of theirs, to be, as I have already a little touched, an Aſſembly of perſons together in one place, to attend upon the <hi>hearing</hi> of the word of <hi>God,</hi> and upon the <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> of the Sacraments.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Of the great Benefits and Advantages that come from the Eſtabliſhment of the Congregational way in the World.</head>
            <p>THUS you ſee we are inſenſibly fallen upon the <hi>conformity</hi> of the carriage and government of the <hi>Congregational</hi> aſſemblies, with that of the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians,</hi> for their ſmalneſs of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and for the way and manner of gaining ſouls to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by Prayer, by Exhortation, and by Preaching, which they do to a few perſons, or a few Families; as when their Elders inculcated into them every day, and <hi>line upon line,</hi> the neceſſity of leading holy and exemplary lives: ſo that the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> people made far greater progreſs in Sanctification, by the means and helps of thoſe Elders, than when they aſſiſted at publick aſſemblies, where the ſeverities of diſcipline, and the degrees of penitence, through which but very few perſons went, ſeem'd to retain more of the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed devotion, of pride, and of worldly pomp, than of ſincerity, and where the fruit of the Biſhop's preaching, was like to that, of which <hi>S. Chriſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks in one of his Homilies, which reſembles the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is thrown in Buckets upon a great number of Bottles, which have a ſtrait Neck, and where there goes in but a few drops, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the fruit of the exhortations which are made in private to a few, is the effect of him, who having taken the bottles, wil fill them by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:41651:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
degrees one after another. Beſide that, it is impoſſible, that a Biſhop, or other perſon, who ſhares out all his time between his Chamber-ſtudies, and preaching in publick, and who hath ſome thouſands of perſons under charge, it is impoſſible, I ſay, that he can ſuffice, and attend upon the Inſtruction of all thoſe Auditors, and of every one of them in particular, which is moſt eaſy to be done by the way that the Paſtors of <hi>Independant</hi> Churches take, whereof every Congregation is not, at the moſt, above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſons, and who are alſo eaſed and help'd by their <hi>Coadjutors</hi> in the work of the holy Miniſtry, ſo that this kind of Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal way, ſeems to be the accompliſhment of the Propheſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Covenant of Grace which <hi>God</hi> was to make in the leſt times with his people, where there ſhall be no more need to have recourſe to the Biſhop, or to his Curate for receiving inſtruction, becauſe every perſon, who is in the Covenant of Grace (as the greateſt number of thoſe who compoſe thoſe Congregations do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to that Covenant,) ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the Lord, and the Paſtor himſelf ſhall go to viſit his ſheep and take a particular care of them: So likewiſe this is the way of the Paſtors of the little flock of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to whom he will give the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>THERE are alſo other Conſiderations which confirm me abſolutely in this opinion that <hi>God,</hi> in a more eſpecial manner, approves of the Congregational way: One is, that, moſt an end, in all others, the Miniſters are influenced by worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, by ambition, and the deſire of ruling, that its Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could never be made without noiſe, and without the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Magiſtrate and the people: for they have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways againſt this erection of a National tribunal <hi>Independant</hi> on the Magiſtrates, who never had given their conſent to it, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the advocates and pleaders for this national tribunal had been indefatigably buzzing into their ears theſe fair and ſpecious <hi>Remonſtrances;</hi> that it was the voice of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> that the world ſhould be governed by two Collaterall powers. This is what the <hi>Decretals</hi> made the Kings and the people to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the ninth age, and they ſtrongly inſiſted that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was to be at the head of the Eccleſiaſtical power, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe laws to them by the Miniſtry of his Clergy for the regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Religion, and for the Affaires of the Church. And
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:41651:22"/>
this is what <hi>Calvin</hi> alſo made thoſe to believe, who left the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he erected a Tribunal for the matters of Religion, in which the Magiſtrates ſhould not be ſeen in the quality of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but only as Members of the conſiſtory: But yet a Tribun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al that ſhould be as much inveſted with <hi>Inconteſtability,</hi> and with a power not to appeal from it, as that of <hi>Rome</hi> is with <hi>Infallibility</hi> And this is what <hi>Calvin</hi> carryed by main force, not only againſt the will of the Magiſtrate, and of the people of <hi>Geneva,</hi> but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the practiſe of all Churches, and againſt the Judgment of all the Divines of his time.</p>
            <p>BUT it hath not been ſo with the Eſtabliſhment of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way, to which the people have had as great an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and natural forwardneſs as the Paſtors themſelves. Which has been ſeen in <hi>England</hi> for above this forty years. For of more than <hi>ſixſcore</hi> perſons, who made up the Aſſembly of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, there was above a <hi>hundred</hi> of them for the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and about eight or ten for the <hi>Congregational</hi> way, and two only, <hi>Coleman,</hi> and <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> for the opinion of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> Yet nevertheleſs, when it came to the Execution and practiſe, there was not one of ten thouſand people that would ſubmit to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government. And one of them, who was the moſt Eminent, confeſſed to me, that being Paſtor of the greateſt Pariſh in <hi>London,</hi> he was never able to eſtabliſh in it a conſiſtory, nor find any that would be of it but a pitiful <hi>Scotch</hi> Taylor. This diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty was not ſeen as to the Congregational way, for whereas only the Paſtors were for the Presbyterian way, there were proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as many people as Miniſters, who joined in the Aſſemblies of the Congregational way. Which they did with more heat and fervour than the <hi>Parliament</hi> would have had them; in ſo much that they were forced to publiſh a Declaration, by which they exhorted the people to put off the gathering of Churches, till the <hi>Parliament</hi> had made a more publick regulation thereof. As to the opinion of <hi>Eraſtus,</hi> though it was not approved in the Aſſembly but by two Divines, it had notwithſtanding the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of moſt of the Magiſtrates, of the learned and more illuminated, who were not of the Gowne; which diſcovers.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT Intereſt is the Toole, and Engine that moves moſt men in the world; and that, if the Magiſtrates were for an <hi>Intendance,</hi> which the Presbyterians would take away
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:41651:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from them; theſe were no leſs in love with, and eager of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT it is very probable, that the <hi>Advocates</hi> of the Congregational way were ſincere, whileſt their number had a juſt proportion of Miniſters, Magiſtrates, and People that were much for it.</p>
            <p>I proved in the ſixt Chapter of my <hi>Jugulum cauſae,</hi> that of theſe two truths, the firſt was put beyond all peradventure, that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Mundus exercet hiſtrionem,</hi> that the greateſt men do oft times mix ſome grain of wordly intereſt with that of Heaven, adding not the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile</hi> to the <hi>honeſtum,</hi> but the <hi>honeſtum</hi> to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſing, or quitting their Opinion according as they are actuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moving principle of <hi>ſua cuique <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitas,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks. For they reſemble Pope <hi>Pius</hi> II <hi>d.</hi> who, being a <hi>Cardinal</hi> ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Pope</hi> to the <hi>Council,</hi> but he changed his Opinion, as ſoon as ever he came to be <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf. Much about twenty years ſince, the Learned <hi>Dr. Stillingfleet</hi> preferred the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Government to the <hi>Epiſcopal;</hi> but now he has had ſeveral fat benefices beſtowed upon him, and he is advanced to the Deanry of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> Epiſcopacy is moſt excellent, both in his eſteem and opinion, and in his writings.</p>
            <p>THIS way is ſo much the more excellent, juſt, and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, as it hath a Compatibility with the Government of a National Church, which makes but one entire body with that of the Republick, as under the legal Oeconomy; whereas the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a National Church, diſtinct and <hi>Independant</hi> upon that of the Republick, is not compatible with any government, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that of the Magiſtrate, nor with that of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Churches; though the government of this latter might be compatible with all kinds of Government, if it would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; for a multitude of ſmall Congregational Churches is as much compatible with the <hi>Civil State,</hi> as is a multitude of Families; becauſe neither the one nor the other do form to themſelves a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by their deputies which eſtabliſhes a Tribunal diſtinct from, and <hi>independant</hi> on that of the <hi>Civil State;</hi> whereas the Popiſh, Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal, and Presbyterian Government, erects a Tribunal in every Territory <hi>independant</hi> on all others. <hi>Calvin</hi> gave the firſt Model of it in <hi>Geneva; Volui,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>ut Judicium Eccleſiaſticum diſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium eſſet à Civili:</hi> and he makes theſe two Tribunals ſo <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,</hi> one on the other, as hotly to maintain, that he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer death or baniſhment, than permit the appeals of <hi>Conſiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Sentences to the <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:41651:23"/>
TO be ſhort, the Congregational way hath this advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the other eſtabliſhments of Religion, both the National, Popiſh, Epiſcopal and Presbyterian Church: theſe cannot ſubſiſt but with a ſubordination of Conſiſtories, <hi>Colloquies,</hi> Provincial and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional <hi>Synods;</hi> things which are not practicable, but under Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Powers, either which may approve them, or elſe may to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate them; whereas the Congregational way ſubſiſts not only under good Emperours, as were <hi>Conſtantine the Great,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius the firſt,</hi> but alſo under the Pagan <hi>Diocleſians,</hi> and under an <hi>Arrian Conſtantius:</hi> for what perſecution ſoever may be raiſed againſt this way, nothing hinders, but that a Miniſter who watches over a ſmall flock, may go to viſit the Members from houſe to houſe, to adminiſter ſpiritual paſture, and food to them, for their nouriſhment and <hi>growth in grace.</hi> To conclude, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of this way appears in this, that it is far leſs expoſed to perſecution than any other, and that the Presbyterian, and the Epiſcopal, do fall into it when the Magiſtrate is contrary to them.</p>

that the Confeſſion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Article XIX, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT ſuch a Church is <hi>Independant</hi> either on other Churches, or on <hi>Synods;</hi> that it may very well take from one or other, advice and Counſel, but it ought not to ſubmit to their Commands.</p>

            <p n="4">4. THAT this Church hath liberty to do its own buſineſs its ſelf; or to connect into one body, in the ſame manner as the Churches of <hi>France</hi> have done; that it hath the liberty to retire from that connection, or confederacy, as the Churches of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Sedan</hi> have done.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THAT this Church to which the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is joyned, is obliged to ſeek, and to preſerve a ſtrict communion of Faith and Charity with the other Churches, but yet hath a liberty of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſeparate diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="6">6.

            <p>I could alſo find theſe maxims in the Writings of the Engliſh Divines, and ſhow that in treating of the nature of the Church, or of any other matter of divinity, they have kept the language of the <hi>Independants,</hi> or at leaſt have approved of their practices.

            <p>BUT the <hi>Independants</hi> have reaſonably outvied <hi>Luther,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctors, for they hold though the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould not have any defects either in Doctrine or Diſcipline, yet they were not to be condemned for ſeparating from <hi>Rome,</hi> and for being <hi>indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> on the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church and her <hi>Synods,</hi> more then to find fault with the Church of <hi>Sedan,</hi> which is ſeparate from that of <hi>Metz,</hi> in regard of any <hi>dependance</hi> one upon the others, or upon the <hi>Synods</hi> that were common with them.

            <p>THOSE, who ſhall approve of the wiſe conduct of the Congregational Churches, in the compoſing of a Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that hath ſo much conformity with the pureſt Churches of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> will be eaſily perſwaded that neither Wiſdome, nor Prudence have been wanting to them, when with that conformity of Faith, that there is between them and the Churches that are at great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance from Popery, they have preſerved to themſelves their liberty, as to matter of diſcipline, to do their buſineſs a part in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependantly one on the other, and on all other Authority be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> without making uſe of that way of Reconciliation which hath been practiſed in all Ages by the means of conferences and Synods, which have rather ſharp'ned and exaſperated ſpirits, and perpetuated quarrels, than any ways ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed and huſhed them; and whereof all the advantage that can be hoped, is at moſt to make ſuch an accord, as it may be, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles, or diſguiſes, or elſe ſuppreſſes the truth.</p>
            <p>THIS is no more than what appeared in the Colloquy of <hi>Poiſſy,</hi> where the greateſt defenders of Tranſubſtantiation, and thoſe who combated and oppoſed it as a vile Monſter of <hi>Rome,</hi> concurred to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon the Article of the real preſence in the Euchariſt. And this is what appear'd alſo in the Overture of Reconciliation which was made in the year 1578. in the Synod of <hi>Saincte Foy</hi> with the <hi>Lutherans</hi> by the means of a formulary or preſident of ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:41651:26"/>
of Faith as ſhould be general and common with all Churches as they propoſed to draw up: but that Overture could only tend to a Reconciliation as difficult as that of finding a <hi>Medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Tranſubſtantiation, and the Opinion of our Churches which is contrary to it. Certainly our Churches were never able to draw back from the purity of our Doctrine, nor from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity with which they expreſs it without being at the ſame time guilty of great prevarication: And moreover, the <hi>Lutherans</hi> would never have yielded to go off from their ingagement to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and his Conſubſtantiation. If both had complied, and met at half way, it would have been a moſt wretched peace, <hi>quae,</hi> as <hi>Saint Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            </p>
            <p>THE preſent poſture of the Affairs of <hi>England</hi> is a very clear and convincing proof, that the Indeavour of thoſe Reconcilers, how good ſoever their deſigns were, is ruinous both to Church and State. There has been an attempt for above this laſt Age to get into a Neighbourhood, and Vicinity with <hi>Rome,</hi> thinking to ſweeten the ſpirits and tempers of thoſe of its communion, to draw them over to ours, or at at leaſt to make but one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of two. In the beginning of the Reformation there were ſeveral of the Ceremonies retained, and fifty years afterwards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them were introduced, they have attempted to bring in Images, and ſo to paſs from thence to worſhipping of them. Every where the Altars are new ſet up on purpoſe, no doubt, to make there the Sacrifice of the Maſs to Smoak; which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by the bowings and cringings to thoſe Altars, or at leaſt to the places where they are ſet, (or as ſome will have it be) to the Eaſt. The Ordination of Romiſh Paſtors is held for good, and for that of the true Church of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, that of the other Reformed Churches, becauſe they were not Epiſcopal is rendred void and null, and becauſe they had not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ark of the beaſt upon their fore-head, whereat <hi>Monſieur Claude</hi> is extreamly offended: Nay, they have gone to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that one <hi>Henry Dodwell</hi> hath newly publiſhed a large Book, where he labours to prove, and eſtabliſh this maxim, that there where there is no Epiſcopal Ordination, there is no true Church, no Miniſter of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> no Sacrament, and no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They have leſt out thoſe expreſſions that are a ſhock and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Pope is the Antichriſt, the man of ſin, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:41651:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Son of Perdition, the Doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Thorndike, Tailor, Bramhal, Patrick, Sherelock,</hi> &amp;c. have ſweetned the Doctrines of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make them relliſh and go down the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the Proteſtants. In a word, to compleat the deſign they had to teſtifie their kindneſs for <hi>Rome,</hi> they have perſecuted them moſt who are got at greateſt diſtance from it. They have made the Image of their perſons, and of their devotion to tread the Stage, to render them both odious, and ridiculous. They have loaden them with calumnies, in the ſame manner as the Pagans of old cloathed the Chriſtians with Bears skins and Lyons skins to ſtir up the rage of Maſtiff Dogs againſt them; they have treated them with the Appellations of Schiſmaticks and Rebels, who have been concerned deep in the late Conſpiracy, a thing that gives one a horrour to think of: And the mildneſs and moſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle treatment is that of Fanaticks, Enthuſiaſts, and Medlars that perpetuate the diviſion between the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and hinderers of their coming together. To conclude, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſayes, <hi>proximorum odia ſunt acerrima,</hi> their averſion and hatred are ſo great againſt the Presbyterian, Puritan, and Independant party, that theſe words are very frequently in their mouths, and it is their diſcourſe both as they walke along the Streets, and ſet at their Tables, that they would rather be Papiſts than Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians. 'Tis then a thing much to be wondred at, that whileſt the Prelatical party have ſo much love and kindnsſs for <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo much averſion for <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and our Churches in <hi>France,</hi> as to raſe them out of the number of the Churches of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to reject the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of their Paſtors as Null, and to tear in pieces with calumnies the puritanical party only for this reaſon, becauſe it hath a venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for our Churches, and for the Memory of <hi>Calvin;</hi> 'tis, I ſay, a very ſupriſing thing, and much to be wondred at, that our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors in <hi>France.</hi> (at leaſt the greateſt part) ſhould make their Court to that Epiſcopal party, and call thoſe faithful people in <hi>England,</hi> Enthuſiaſts, Fanaticks, and Hypocrites, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the Doctrines, Cuſtomes, Practiſes, and Lives of thoſe that Perſecute them. But yet a People, who, by the Purity of their Doctrine, the holyneſs of their Lives, and their Conformity with <hi>Calvin,</hi> and his Diſciples, keep off, and retard the Introduction of Paganiſme in <hi>England,</hi> and the Judgements
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:41651:27"/>
of God upon the Nation. Certainly it, is a very ſurpriſing thing, that the Fat of the Prelates Kitching, and the luſtre of their Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy ſhould ſo dazle the eyes of our great men in <hi>France,</hi> as to poſtpone in their eſteem, the beſt, the moſt holy, and the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Party of the People of <hi>England,</hi> to that which glitters and dazles moſt, and which now have the uppermoſt ſeats in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues.</p>
            <p>BUT that Church which will have all or nothing, ſhews more heat and vehemency againſt theſe Reconcilers, than againſt thoſe that proteſt againſt all Reconciliation with <hi>Rome:</hi> which imitates the Lyon in the Apologue that devoured the Aſſe for deſiring to ſhare with him.</p>
            <p>THE Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is ſaid to be Infallible, is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable Rock; the Reformed, at leaſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church, is a floating Boat upon the Water which is faſtened to that Rock by a Rope; now he that thinks to draw it to him, will be much deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for he will but pullhimſelf nearer to the Rock. 'Tis true, that neither the whole body of the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> which ſet at the helm of Affairs, nor any of them has been concerned in the late at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon the life of our moſt gracious <hi>King,</hi> but it is true alſo, that the Papiſts had never been brought or tempted to think of ſuch a thing, if they had not been ſtrongly perſwaded, that the life of the <hi>King</hi> was the only Impediment, why thoſe, who had already come over three parts of four of the way to <hi>Rome,</hi> had not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reſt of their Journey to them.</p>

THAT to compaſs this Union, every party of different perſwaſion and Judgement in matters of Faith and Diſcipline ought to abate ſomething of their rigour, and their right, and come one part of the way to a Reconciliation: that is to ſay, that every party ought to recover an inſidious peace, to abandon the truth he believes he has on his ſide, or to enervate the force of it.</p>
            <p>THESE maxims, which are thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> have been and will be the cauſe why there will never be in the World, neither Church, nor Reformation without ſome mixture of corruption. The Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of being freed from theſe, is only to be found in the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Church.</p>
            <p>ABOVE all, they find the 5<hi>th.</hi> maxim to be unreaſonable, wicked, and tyrannical<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> principally when they preſs to an Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Diſcipline all the Inhabitants of a Territory or Kingdom, under one and the ſame Soveraign, about which both the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of people, and the moſt illuminated are divided, and do not find one clear, conſtant, and perpetual truth, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures to preſs the Uniformity of it, nor the neceſſity of that way that they find as to what concerns Faith. <hi>Theodoſius the II.</hi> had his reaſon better grounded, when he commanded all his Subjects to believe according to the Faith of <hi>Damaſus</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> then if he had commanded them an Uniformity in Diſcipline, which he did not do, and which he could not execute: For he could not be ignorant that as there was but one Faith, to which every faithful ſoul ought to adhere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be verily perſwaded that his was the true, it was not without reaſon that he rather commanded the belief of that Faith, than the practiſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:41651:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a diſcipline, ſince that the one was expreſly laid down in the holy Scripture, and the other was not.</p>
            <p>'TIS after this manner the Independant Churches argue. They believe, with <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> that the Subjects of an Empire are obliged to embrace the ſame Faith, ſuppoſing it be that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> but they are not obliged to practiſe one certain diſcipline, which is not found in the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>THE firſt maxim was that of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> who alone did ſhed more Chriſtian bloud than his Predeceſſors all together had done. It cannot be practiſed without Fire and Sword, and it is as full of Impiety and of Paganiſm as Excommunication. <hi>Titus Livius lib.</hi> 39. <hi>tit.</hi> 9 puts among the Roman Laws, <hi>Ne qui Romani Dei, neque alio more quam patrio colerentur: &amp; ne quis in publico ſacrove loco novo aut externo ritu ſacrificaret.</hi> The <hi>Scythians</hi> cauſed <hi>Anacharſis</hi> to be put to death for having a Worſhip a part, which he had learnt in <hi>Greece.</hi> And <hi>Mecaenas</hi> exhorted <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to puniſh thoſe who would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themſelves to the Religion of the Countrey. <hi>Dio. lib.</hi> 52 <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>.</p>
            <p>BUT yet this maxim was not ſo much practiſed when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was more popular, and when Altars were erected to ſtrange Gods, and to ſome unknown: for, after they had ſubdued Nations, they alſo brought their Gods in triumph.</p>
            <p>I met with the Defeat and overthrow of the fifth maxim, in a diſcourſe at the beginning of a Treatiſe of that excellent Knight, to whom I Dedicated my <hi>Faſciculus,</hi> as an Anſwer to ſome que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions that were put to him, by thoughts much agreeing with mine, before ever we had any communication of them together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which he alſo confirms by thoſe of a Learned Divine, whoſe name is <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and whoſe Authority is ſo much the more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and weighty, as being a Church of <hi>England</hi> man. There are, ſay they, but two wayes to make all Chriſtians to enter into one and the ſame communion; either in taking away the diverſity of Opinions that divide them, which is impoſſible without a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and unleſs God had eſtabliſhed and ſet up a viſible Judge to whom their differences ſhould be referred; or elſe being all perſwaded that this diverſity of Opinions ought not to hinder their communion, and their Union, in things wherein they do agree, and where charity, complaiſance and condeſcention ought to have place, without any ones being deprived of their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:41651:29"/>
or that one ſhould perſecute the other that differs from his.</p>
            <p>DOCTOR <hi>Jeremy Tailor,</hi> who was a ſtrong man for the Engliſh Hierarchy, by reaſon whereof he was made a Biſhop in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and who was extroardinarily illuminated and Learned, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in the ſame Sentiment with Dr. <hi>Chillingworth,</hi> and hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a great Book, whoſe Title is, <hi>the Liberty of Prophecying</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked and unreaſonable carriage of thoſe who rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly impoſe ſet Forms of Faith to others, and who Perſecute and ill-uſe thoſe who are not of their Opinion in matters of Religion.</p>
            <p>ALSO the Independants have indeavoured not ſo much to eſtabliſh the goodneſs of the Congregational way in ſound clear minds, becauſe they are ſoon convinced of it by the deſcription they make of it, as to diſabuſe them of thoſe maxims which are but ſo many illuſions, though moſt commonly it is eaſier to refute Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, than to eſtabliſh Truth; as <hi>Cicero</hi> very well ſays. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam tàm facile poſſem vera probare, quàm falſa convincere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW the tyranny of theſe maxims, which are as much that of the Proteſtants as of the Papiſts, is the cauſe why the tranſition of the Romiſh Religion to the reformed is but imperfectly done in <hi>France, Germany, England,</hi> and elſewhere, how little complaiſance ſoever we have had for <hi>Rome,</hi> and for an affinity with her, it has coſt us very dear: we have thought we ought not to go from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to another at one leap. As we fell from the Impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Tranſubſtantiation ſo likewiſe have we gone from Tranſubſtantiation, to Conſubſtantiation its Neighbour; then we have retained the real preſence in the Sacramental Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which has ſome agreement, and is conciliable with thoſe three illuſions of words. 'Tis ſaid indeed, that this preſence was ſpiritual, but at the ſame time it was clothed with the fleſh, when they kept at the beginning of the reformation ſuch wayes of expreſſing themſelves which have been a great Shock to <hi>Bulling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and many other great men of his time: <hi>That we were nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in this Sacrament with the ſubſtance of the fleſh, and with the blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which has given occaſion to the Biſhop of <hi>Candom,</hi> to <hi>Mounſieur Arnauld,</hi> and to Father <hi>Maimbourge</hi> to put this Interrogatory to us, <hi>if you ſpeak as we do, why do you not believe as we do?</hi> Eſpecially the Biſhop of <hi>Condom</hi> has made uſe of it, and they have given him reaſon to triumph over us as much
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:41651:29" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in that, as he hath done as to the eminent Authority that is eſtabliſhed in our Churches with as much inconteſtability as if it were Infallible. The Miſſionary <hi>Pean</hi> ſayes, that it is a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limauphrey of the Proteſtants to ſpeak of being nouriſhed with the ſubſtance of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and with his fleſh, and not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Tranſubſtantiation. A Learned Engliſh Dr. named <hi>John Hales</hi> hath written a Learned Treatiſe upon this Subject, where he condemns this way of Reconciliation that ſayes one thing, and believes another, and that turns again to <hi>Rome,</hi> and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts his Brethren to condemn rather the uſe of it than to juſtifie it. He ſayes alſo that <hi>Martyn Bucer</hi> was the firſt of the Reformed that made uſe of this way of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that as the weakneſs of thoſe great lights of Reformation <hi>Bucer, Calvin,</hi> and <hi>Reza,</hi> was very great, when they explained thoſe Scriptures concerning the Lords Supper, by a Comment that was more obſcure than the Text, nor hath it been leſs great in thoſe that have come after them, when they have explained the words of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in S. <hi>John</hi> VI. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fleſhly eating, to the Sacramental and Spiritual eating, and when they have made long comments upon the words of <hi>Calvin</hi> to ſweeten and ſmooth the harſhneſs of them, inſtead of condemning them: this obſtinacy in adhering to errors, hath brought in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended infallibility into the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Inconteſtability into the Reformed Churches. <hi>Inter caetera mortalitatis incommoda hoe eſt, errandi neceſſitas, &amp; erroris amor, Seneca.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW theſe ways of ſpeaking which ſimbolize with thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> and which give it occaſion to inſult, and triumph over us, makes me remember what I have read in the Memoirs and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialties that <hi>Joſeph Hall</hi> hath made of his Life, and abſolutely convinces me of this truth, that it has been ſo unlikely that they, who have believed they might gain upon <hi>Rome,</hi> by retaining ſome of their ways and modes of ſpeaking, or their practiſes, ſhould have ſucceeded therein, that on the contrary She has been ſo much the more ſet and hardened againſt us, and have gone ſo far in it, as to make us, and their Religion far more reaſonable than ours. He ſayes, that in his journey to the <hi>Spadan</hi> Waters for his health, he had before a great company of perſons of quality, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, a very hot diſpute with a Sorboniſt, a Prior of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> who maintained that the Kneeling
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:41651:30"/>
practiſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> at the receiving of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, ſtrongly ſhewed that ſhe believed Tranſubſtantion; for that kneeling and the belief of Tranſubſtantiation were things inſeparable, and always went hand in hand together; and ſince the one had never been believed in the Church without the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of the other; and ſince it was a diſtraction of reaſon, and a wicked practiſe to carry their adorations to Elements that were only Bread and Wine, this kneeling of neceſſity muſt be a natural conſequence of the belief of Tranſubſtantiation: Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> adds, that as the company was divided in their judgments and that ſeveral of them joyned with thoſe of <hi>Rome,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning this kneeling, unleſs it was a conſequence of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, more than two thirds of the company were ſo heated againſt the poor Biſhop, that he had not the liberty to ſpeak, nor to ſtand up in defence of the Church's Opinion: For if they had given him time to ſpeak, he had alleadged the Rubrick of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which undeceives the Communicants from the thoughts that they might poſſibly have that that Kneeling or Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is carried out to the Bread and the Wine: But beſide, that there is not of a hundred Communicants one who reads the Rubrick, it might have happened that thoſe who were ſo violent againſt Biſhop <hi>Hall,</hi> would have pleaſantly ſtopt his mouth with the Apologue which <hi>Beza</hi> writ in a Letter to the good Arch-Biſhop <hi>Edmund Grindal,</hi> who ſeeing that he was offended at this kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after Tranſubſtantiation was baniſhed, endeavoured to cure him of the ſcandal he had taken, making him to know that the Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> would give him enough wherewith to be ſatisfied: Upon which <hi>Beza</hi> returned him this ſtory. A Lord having built his houſe near to the high way, where he left a great ſtone that he had no occaſion for juſt in the road, ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons coming by in the night ſtumbled at it, and did hurt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and often complaints being made to him about it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties that he would take it out of the way, he was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate a long while, and was reſolved not to meddle with it; but being wearied by the continual ſolicitations that were made to him, he bethought himſelf to ſet over the ſtone a Lanthorn with a light Candle in it, to warn people of it; but that Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proving troubleſome too, one of his friends came and gave him this good Counſel; Sir, if you would be at quiet, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:41651:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
both ſtone and Lanthorn together. The ſtone of ſtumbling is this kneeling at the Sacrament, and the Rubrick is for a light and Declaration, to ſignifie to the Communicants, that this kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not done to the bread and wine, but to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If you take away both, you will take away the ſcandal, and the remedy to the ſcandall: You will bring back the way with which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> inſtituted the holy Supper, who gave it not kneeling, but in the poſture of thoſe who take their ordinary repaſts at their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, ſo that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> never required any Genuflexion either at the time or place.</p>
            <p>THESE two ſtories hit (as we generally ſay) two birds with one ſtone. For they may relate to that neerneſs of aſſinity with <hi>Rome,</hi> which I have already ſpoken of above, and which I have ſhowed has rather ſharpened and embittered the Spirits and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of thoſe of that communion, to plot againſt the ſacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the KING, and againſt his Government, than it has any wayes ſweetned them: and moreover, they diſcover that thoſe who go furtheſt off from the Doctrines and practiſes of <hi>Rome,</hi> who renounce all reconciliation with Her, as the people of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way do, have moſt conformity with the bleſſed peace-Makers of whom <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſpeakes, and whereof the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the Children of God which he gives them upon this reſpect, carryes them ſo much the farther from all thoughts of Rebellion.</p>

            <p>I Think my ſelf here obliged to add an Apology as to my own account, for what I have ſaid as to the Independant Churches. I do imagine I ſhall be accuſed at firſt for having made the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41651:31"/>
of the congregational way, not according as it is in effect, but in that manner as <hi>Xenophon</hi> did the <hi>Cyropaedia</hi> to be the perfect model of a Prince. They will ſay that any other intereſt than that of the inward knowledge I have of the goodneſs, truth and holineſs of the Congregational way, ought to have excited me to commend it ſo as I have done. That I commend what I do not approve in the bottome of my heart, ſince I do not joyn my ſelf to it. They will ſay likewiſe that I have had no other deſign than to gain my own Sentiments credit, with which they ſay I am moſt fondly in Love, in adjuſting them to thoſe of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; and becauſe I condemn Eccleſiaſtical power, and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, which I have undertook to poſſeſs the World with the belief of, that ſo they ſhould baniſh the uſe of it. To which, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that though I ſhould joyn my ſelf to their Aſſemblies, it would be no argument that I ſhould approve of all the things they did, and all they believed, as they cannot conclude by my not joyning to their Congregations, that I have not the Congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way in greater and higher eſteem than any other. As I am a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and by the grace of God of the reformed Church, I joyn to the Church of my own Nation, to which I am ſo much the more ſtrongly invited by the holineſs of the Doctrines, and lives of our excellent Paſtors, <hi>Monſieur Muſſard,</hi> and <hi>Monſieur Primeroſe;</hi> and becauſe they adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper in the ſame manner as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did it with his Diſciples; not having any thing to give me offence in their conduct, unleſs that they are not abſolutely undeceived of the practiſe of our Paſtors in <hi>France,</hi> of excommunicating in the Name and Authority of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of interpoſing the ſame ſacred Name, and the ſame ſacred Authority to excommunicate as St. <hi>Paul</hi> made uſe of to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the <hi>Inceſtuous</hi> perſon over to <hi>Satan;</hi> though they cannot find this Authority of excommunicating in all the Bible, nor juſtifie it, unleſs they elude that harſhneſs of expreſſion by this way of ſweetning, that their only intention is to declare that thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of whom they make the number, take the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their Condemnation, if they do not repent before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
            <p>AS for other accuſations, although I believe that of all Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Religion, that of the Independant Churches is the moſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical, yet I do not believe it is infallible, and I cannot approve of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:41651:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
all they ſay, nor all they practiſe concerning diſcipline nor concerning the uſe of the Eccleſiaſtical power, and excommunication; though this uſage be not in all the ſame, nor in all the Churches; becauſe ſome among them do retain it <hi>jure ſocietatis, &amp; vi, &amp; virtute paoti &amp; federis eniti.</hi> However it is, both of them make uſe of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical power and excommunication very innocently, for they do not ſet up a National Tribunal, Independant on the Magiſtrate, and they Attribute to their Synods no other Authority, than that of perſwaſion, both from wiſe and experienced perſons. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, from the manner that they expreſs themſelves in the VII. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the firſt Chapter of their Confeſſion of Faith, one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that beſide the Juriſdiction which works upon hearts by the word, they acknowledge no other than that which is taken by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right, and that wiſdom and prudence has not been wanting to them, by their having in a joynt conſent agreed in one and the ſame Doctrine, becauſe it is of divine and perpetual right, but in not having eſtabliſhed any thing determinatively to be a perpetual rule upon an Arbitrary and changeable matter, and of humane right, as is the diſcipline of the Churches, and the Authority of the Paſtors in their conduct and government.</p>
            <p>BUT although they ſhould have retained ſome uſage of the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical power and excommunication, which are ſo many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of <hi>Rome</hi> that have accompliſhed the Myſtery of iniquity, and brought the Pope into the world, they would be no leſs priviledged than St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apoſtles, who, after they had received the holy Ghoſt in greater meaſure than all the holy men that had been before them, yet they alwayes retained ſome leven of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Moſaical Ceremonies. If the Chriſtians that came from Paganiſme, have alwayes kept ſome pollution of it, it ought not to be any great ſurpriſe to ſee the pureſt Churches in the World, yet not throughly cleanſed from all the Impurities of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR theſe conſiderations, I feed my ſelf with the hopes that the Miniſters of the Independant Churches, who are too much illuminated long to remain in the belief and uſe of this illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Eccleſiaſtical power, which hath brought Epiſcopacy, that is the firſt ſtep of Aſcention to the papacy, and after that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication and Infallibility; and that they would put in practiſe inſtead of excommunication, that denuntiation which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:41651:32"/>
S. <hi>Paul</hi> recommended to his Diſciple and ſon <hi>Timothy,</hi> it is that in caſe any diſorderly, or wicked perſon of the Congregation, cannot be perſwaded to change his opinion, and life, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to leave the Communion of the Church, it ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed aloud in the face of the Church, and the faithful ſhould be exhorted to ſhun his company: and in caſe that he perſevere in ſuch refractorineſs, he ought to be expelled by force, as well from the Table of the Lord, as from the Church. And this is what may be practiſed by a natural right, &amp; <hi>de jure ſocietatis</hi> without any need of making ſuch expulſion of credit by the Keys of the Kingdome of Heaven, and by the power of binding and looſing. In ſhort, I hope they will be perſwaded by this conſideration that the benefit which comes by the Eccleſiaſtical power and Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication will never recompence the pernitious effects that they have produced.</p>
            <p>NOW I believe that theſe three conſiderations, that I am a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> that I am a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and that I do not <hi>joyn</hi> to any one certain <hi>Congregational Aſſembly</hi> as a Member of it, will give more Authority and credit to the relation I have made of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conduct, and make it leſs the ſuſpected, than if I were of their Number, of their Nation, and a Divine by Profeſſion: For if I were qualified in three wayes, I could not ſpeak as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon diſintereſſed, but as having a perſonal inclination to the way I ſhould have eſpouſed: And that is the weakneſs of all thoſe who plead for their own cauſe, as we learn from S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> and <hi>Optatus Milevitanus,</hi> who were of this opinion, that a ſincere Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or Heathen, whether a Phyſitian, a Sophiſter, a Philoſopher, or belonging to the Magiſtracy, were more competent Judges in matters of Divinity, and differences among Chriſtians, than perſons of the Prieſthood, and Sacerdotal function.</p>
            <p>AS S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not elect a more diſintereſſed perſon to gain the Chriſtian Religion credit, in the minds of men, and to write his Goſpel, as he calls it, and the Acts of the Apoſtles, than S. <hi>Luke</hi> the Phyſitian, to whom the world is more oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than to a thouſand S. <hi>Chryſoſtomes,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtins,</hi> and to all the perſons of the Sacred Order, without ſo much as except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very Apoſtles themſelves: I believe that the ſame Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought to be made of me, and that my quality of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian ought to give ſtronger impreſſions of the goodneſs of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:41651:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Congregational way in the minds of men, than would that of a Divine, of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, or any other perſon ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by profeſſion either to the Epiſcopal, Presbyterian, or even to the Congregational way. As Reaſon and Grace in the hopes of glory are the three Reſſorts or principles which have alwayes moved and governed me in all the courſe of my life, and in all my Writings: ſo have they been always leſs violent by the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and intereſts in the profeſſion I make of a Phyſician, than if I had been either a Divine, or a Lawyer.</p>
            <p>I ought here alſo to acknowledg my Obligation to the Biſhop of <hi>Condom;</hi> not only for the firſt hints of this truth; <hi>that the Congregational way is of all the Eſtabliſhments of Diſcipline and Government the moſt conformable to reaſon, to the holy Scripture, and to the practiſe of the Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians:</hi> but for having abſolutely confirmed me in this truth: though the deſign of that Biſhop has not been to put the <hi>Congregational way</hi> above the <hi>Romiſh;</hi> but only to diſcover, (and this he hath done by Arguments that come very near to demonſtration) that going up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hypotheſis of the neceſſity of ſeting up a Tribunal in the Church, and of the ſubmiſſion of the people to that Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, as being the only Rampi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>AS it was in my thoughts to finiſh this diſcourſe by the word <hi>Finis,</hi> a Learned Presbyterian coming in, and having appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended my deſign, put one objection to me againſt the defeat and overthrow I pretend to make of the neceſſity of a Tribunal in the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid that ſince that Tribunal which requires the people to ſubmit themſelves to it is as much ſet up in an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Church, as in a National, and ſince both preſuppoſe that that Tribunal is ſubject to errour, the ſubmiſſion of the people is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together as reaſonable to the Tribunal of a National Church, as to that of a Congregational. I confeſs there is ſome weight in this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which <hi>Monſieur Jurieu</hi> has not thought of, but which neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs is eaſie to be anſwered according to the principles I lay down.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT all manner of Government, Presbyterian, Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational, National, Epiſcopal, Hierarchical, Papal, is of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that of the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT the ſubmiſſion required, and given to all manner of Eccleſiaſtical Government is of the ſame nature with that which is required and given to a Civil and Political government, the Reſſorts of which are not the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, nor the power of binding and looſing, but the will of the ſtrongeſt, and moſt numerous that hath ſo ordain'd it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. AND conſequently that the Cenſures of excommunication and depoſition, being of the ſame nature with the Law of the Magiſtrate, the validity of which is not in the Juſtice, nor equity of the thing, but in the will of thoſe that decree and ordain it, they ought to be accounted as a Civil puniſhment.</p>
            <p>THESE three conſiderations deſtroy that erection of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Tribunal, which is equal with the Civil in one and the ſame Territory, ſince both being of the ſame nature, it would be a pure piece of Gallimaufrey and hotchpot to offer to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:41651:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
two Civil Governments in one and the ſame dominion or Territory, which ſhould be independant one on the other.</p>
            <p>ALSO this difficulty is eaſie to be overcome according to the principles of the Independants. The Inconvenience of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated or depoſed perſon unjuſtly by his Congregation is not great, ſo long as it does not extend beyond his Juriſdiction, and that of a hundred Congregations in one Territory, it is impoſſible but that at leaſt there might be one to recompence the Juſtice of his cauſe; which is not a thing feaſible, if he be ſtruck by a National Judgement, unleſs he leaves his Country. And ſince the perſon oppreſſed is in the liberty of framing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a Congregation Independant on all the Churches of the world, though it be but of ſeven or eight perſons, his innocence and legitimate right will eaſily furniſh him with the means to do it. I add further, that a perſon who is ſenſible he is guilty of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; can eaſily conceal them in the crowd of a National Church, (which he cannot ſo well do in a ſmall number of perſons,) and commonly prevent the Cenſure of his Congregation, and not expect that they ſhould excommunicate him and drive him out of it which is done in that manner as St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Godeau</hi> would have the Heretick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of whom S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks in the 3 <hi>of Titus</hi> 11. <hi>knowing that he that is ſuch,</hi> (i. e. an Heretick) <hi>is ſubverted and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf:)</hi> To do, when he excommunicated himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaved his Church that trouble.</p>
            <p>IT muſt not be forgot that tho there is no Government ſo perfect wherein one cannot find ſome faults, and ſome Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, yet it is certain there is found leſs in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal way, whereas you may find almoſt an infinity in that of the National, whereof a thouſand perſons that deſerve the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Church, there is not one of them that undergoes its becauſe its diſcipline is like to ſpiders Webs, where the Fly's are taken, but the Birds paſs through; and where it is impoſſible in a Town or a Church of many thouſands of Chriſtians, that one Biſhop or Paſtor can poſſibly have an exact inſpection over them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in a Congregational Church compoſed but of a few perſons, and thoſe all cull'd out of the multitude who fun after Vanitics and Vices, one has but little or no uſe of excommunication and depoſition, and where Avarice, Ambition, Hereſies, and quarrels do not enter as in National Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:41651:34"/>
THESE conſiderations give me to hope that the learned and illuminated of the Congregational way will agree and joyn with my principles or Hypotheſes, to eſtabliſh the true nature of their Juriſdiction, and to undo with caſe the difficulty of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: although according to their principles it reſembles the Foils, which touch the perſon, but do not wound it: For in caſe of a wound, they have a thouſand remedies to heal it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; whereas there is no remedy either againſt Infallibity in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or againſt inconteſtability in a National Church.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Remarks upon the Fault that ſome may find in the Title of this diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>I Will finiſh theſe conderations by the diſcuſſion and explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Title of this diſcourſe, to which ſome have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, becauſe they find there is not one Eccleſiaſtical Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, even of thoſe which differ moſt from one another, that do not pretend to this Conformity, as indeed they have either more or leſs: for there is not one of them, no not even of thoſe that are the fartheſt off from the Doctrines and Government of the Ancient Chriſtians, and that have but very little agreement one with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there is not one, I ſay, but what hath in ſomething a confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with them. Every way of Government boaſts of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining this conformity with the Ancient Chriſtians: I my ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this glory in favour of the Congregational way. Not long ſince a Learned Miniſter of <hi>Roüen</hi> publiſhed a Book intituled, the <hi>Conformity of the diſcipline of the Churches of</hi> France <hi>to that of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Chriſtians:</hi> Beſide, though the diſcipline of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> hath not any agreement with that of the Churches of <hi>France;</hi> and it is impoſſible that two diſciplines ſo diſagreeing to each other, ſhould have both of them much conformity to the diſcipline of the Ancient Chriſtians yet it hath ſo happened that a Famous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41651:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in his preface to his Engliſh Tranſlation of <hi>the Novelty of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> maintains very zealouſly the ſame thing in favour of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Monſieur Larroque</hi> has done in favour of thoſe of <hi>France. If I were,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>to ſpeak to French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I would indeavour to convince them fully, that we retain in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>more of the Primitive and Apoſtolick Government than all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches in the world. Dr. Floyd,</hi> and <hi>Dr. Tillotſon</hi> ſay the ſame thing. But I believe that this conformity is much what like to that which is between <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and St. <hi>Francis. For</hi> I do openly maintain that of all the Eſtabliſhments of Religion, That of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is wideſt from the diſcipline and practiſe of the Ancient Chriſtians. But he is not the only perſon hath ſpoke after this manner, <hi>England</hi> is full of Books upon the ſubject of the Conformity of its Hierarchy, and of its Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Government to that of the Ancient Chriſtians. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops <hi>Bilſon, Andrews, Hall, Morton,</hi> and <hi>Pearſon,</hi> find it in <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> and in <hi>Ignatius;</hi> ſome of the Doctors of <hi>Rome,</hi> meet with it in <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite:</hi> but unleſs this Conformity be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the times of the Apoſtles, to which I find more foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in the Congregational way, than in any other, I believe we are all in an error as to what concerns our conformity to the Doctrine, Diſcipline and Life of the Ancient Chriſtians. Above all, the diſagreement is found in the life, which was heretofore much more exact and exemplary, than in theſe laſt times it is; the Devotion of our days is but cold and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in compariſon of theirs. It was in that, that their glory did conſiſt, whereas ours is in having a greater knowledg, and a more full and ample illumination into the myſteries of Faith, than the firſt Chriſtians had; alſo to be better verſed at this day in the knowledg of the Apoſtolical conduct, of the nature and Government of the Church, of its Authority, and of that of its Paſtors, who were the Chriſtians that immediately ſucceeded the Apoſtles:</p>
            <p>I will finiſh where I began; and that ſhall be by the force of thoſe prejudices, wherewith all Chriſtians, as well Proteſtants as Papiſts are anticipated and prepoſſeſt, when they generally imagine that the Primitive Church was more Orthodox, and pure in Doctrine, than that of the following Ages, becauſe of their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:41651:35"/>
nearneſs with the times of the Apoſtles: but I am as much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the contary, as of any thing in the world. 'Tis ſaid that God never built a Temple, near to which the enemy of our Salvation has not built a Chappel, but than it was a Chappel both greater and more ſpacious than the temple it ſelf: For dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time whileſt God built a little Temple wherein he had circumſcribed the twelve Apoſtles, and a ſmall flock of faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who conformed themſelves to the purity their Doctrine, and the holineſs of their lives, a number incomparably greater of falſe Apoſtles, falſe Doctors and falſe Brethren, ſeparated from them. For even in the firſt three hundred years of Chriſtianity, all or the moſt part of ſincere perſons, and alſo of Fathers, had a great deal of falſe allay mixt among their gold. This is what we learn from <hi>Eutychius,</hi> who lived in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, from whom we have the Hiſtory of the Church in <hi>Arabyck</hi> publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pocock,</hi> and whom they recommend for an Author of an irreprochable fidelity. There he tells us, that <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> ſent to all the Churches of his Empire Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to let them underſtand that they were to make choice of the moſt Religious Biſhops, and thoſe that were moſt learned in the Myſteries of the Chriſtian Faith; and that they then imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſet themſelves to obey the Orders of the Emperour, and that two thouſand and forty eight Biſhops came to the Town of <hi>Nice,</hi> whereof near two thouſand, how pious and ſincere ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever otherwiſe they were, were either moſt ignorant, or moſt erronious in the knowledg of the Chriſtian Religion. For they were either <hi>Manichees,</hi> or <hi>Murcionites,</hi> or <hi>Montaniſts,</hi> or <hi>Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> or <hi>Samoſatenians,</hi> or <hi>Arrians;</hi> and in that great number of Biſhops, there were but three hundred and eighteen who had an affection for, and ingaged themſelves to, the Orthodox Faith, which was that of <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS Relation according to <hi>Eutychius</hi> is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable than after that manner as it is reported by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> by <hi>Socrates,</hi> by <hi>Baronius,</hi> and by <hi>Monſieur Claude:</hi> For what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is there that that number of Biſhops convoked from all places of <hi>Europe</hi> a great part of <hi>Africa,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Aſia, Phaeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, Greece, Maceaonia, Theſſalia, Paleſtine, Arabia, Pamphilia, By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinia, Capadocia, Thrace, Cilicia, Pontus, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Scythia,</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:41651:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould amount but to three hundred and eighteen Biſhops? There is alſo leſs likelihood that thoſe three hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Biſhops ſhould appear ſo ſharp and ſo divided among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as to put out Libels of accuſation one againſt another, and that during their Seſſion, they made a cruel War within themſelves. Theſe Accuſations might be true as to the other Biſhops, who were as much divided in affections, as in Judgments, but not of theſe three hundred and eighteen, who becauſe they were all Orthodox, and Children of peace, and well united in their affections, ſuch as were <hi>Alexander, Spiridion,</hi> and <hi>Paphnuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> were choſen by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> out of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Hereticks, Factious, and contentious perſons. Beſide, the unanimity of theſe three hundred and eighteen Biſhops in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of the Faith of the Council, having but four Biſhops that refuſed ſubſcribing to it, plainly ſhews that their ſpirit <hi>was</hi> not that of contention nor animoſity one againſt another, but of peace and concord.</p>
            <p>IF the Book of that excellent Author <hi>Eutychius</hi> the Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria</hi> had appeared with all its Truths, and had been ſeen by all thoſe that had eyes and would uſe them, during the lives of <hi>Monſieur Salmaſius, Monſieur Blundel,</hi> &amp;c. they had been yet more ſtrongly perſwaded than they were, that all thoſe circumſtances ſo diſtant from, the relation that <hi>Eutychius</hi> makes of them, ſavours as much of Romance, as thoſe three Croſſes, which <hi>Helena,</hi> Mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> found, or as the donation of that Emperour to <hi>Silveſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CERTAINLY the providence of God did clearly appear in the choiſe of thoſe three hundred and eighteen Biſhops. 'Twas an Act of God, and not man, when he raiſed up the good Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to recommend them to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and when he inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart of that Prince to hearken to his Counſel. For if the Emperour had let himſelf been overruled at the beginning of that Counſel by any other Biſhop, as he did at the end of his Life, the firſt Eſtabliſhment of Faith and Religion, had been that of <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme;</hi> whereas the orthodox Faith taking the firſt poſſeſſion, under the firſt Chriſtian Emperour, this ſerved moſt powerfully to gain it credit, and to make it paſs, and tranſmit it to poſterity.</p>
            <p>I would ask here by the way thoſe that deprive the Soveraign
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:41651:36"/>
Magiſtrate of the Intendance, of regulating by a Soveraign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in all places, either of an Empire, or a Territory, the matters of Religion, and give him no other Authority than that of a private perſon, I would ask thoſe, I ſay, what expedient a good Biſhop, ſuch as this of <hi>Alexandria</hi> could be able to find out to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize the Faith that was contrary to that of <hi>Arrius,</hi> in caſe God had not inclined the heart of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> to eſtabliſh it by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in all the places of his Empire?</p>
            <p>I ought not to forget here one circumſtance in our Author that extreamly fortifies the right of the Magiſtrate, eſpecially if he be Orthodox, to the Soveraign Intendance in the Government of the Church, and which moreover ſtrongly proves that the Rules, Canons, Cenſures, and Anathemas of Councils, are only Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the declarations of wiſe and experienced men, before the Magiſtrate hath given them Authority by his Sanction. In ſhort, this paſſage of <hi>Eutychius</hi> is the accompliſhment of the propheſie of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 2. <hi>Know you not that the Saints ſhall judge the World?</hi> that is to ſay, know you not that God will one day e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh Faithful Magiſtrates, who ſhall be governours in chief of the Church; he ſays than that the choice of three hundred and eighteen Biſhops being made, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> entred into their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and after he had ſaluted and harrangued to them, he laid his Scepter upon the Table, his Ring, and his ſword and ſaid to them, I give you the power of regulating the affairs of the Church; that done, the Fathers humbly thanked him for the Authority which he was pleaſed to fortifie them with, and rendered him his Scepter, his Ring, and his Sword.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, if <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had been an <hi>Arrian,</hi> his erronious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion had done as much miſchief, as the contrary opinion to that of <hi>Arrius,</hi> and wherewith he was poſſeſſed, did good by its Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment: but it is true alſo, that if the Soveraign of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire hath no other authority in the Church than that of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, it will never be poſſible, and it can never happen, that an Orthodox Prince will be able to eſtabliſh the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by his Commandments in all the places of his Empire. 'Tis true, by this Soveraign Authority of the Magiſtrate, Errour and Impiety may as well be eſtabliſhed by Lawes, as truth and piety: but it is true alſo, that when the Soveraign Magiſtrate,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:41651:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
either hath no part, nor is intereſſed in the affairs of Religion, as during the three firſt Ages of the Church, nothing could keep the Biſhops, as were thoſe two thouſand and forty eight of whom <hi>Eutychius</hi> ſpeaks, from divinding into many erronious parties, and the Orthodox party to be always the leaſt in number, and this cannot happen, when God gives to the Church, ſuch Princes as reſemble <hi>Conſtantine the Great, Theodoſius,</hi> and <hi>Martian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT happens notwithſtanding that during ſuch diſorders, and ſuch confuſions of diverſe opinions, as were thoſe of the two thouſand and forty, that God reſerves always a ſmall number of good Paſtors, as were thoſe three hundred and eighteen, who form in a great Empire, ſuch as was the <hi>Roman,</hi> ſeveral little Congregations, all like to thoſe of our Independants, whom God makes uſe of, amidſt the greater corruption and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to keep and perpetuate to himſelf an Orthodox and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people in the world.</p>
            <p>'TIS true then, that whither God gives a Chriſtian Magiſtrate, but a Heretick; or whether he does not give any, if he be not poſſibly a Heathen, as during the three firſt Ages, the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience is great; but it is otherwiſe certain, that when God bleſſes his Church with a Magiſtrate that favours the Orthodox and true Worſhippers of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the condition of the Church of God is incomparably more happy, than under any other eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Religion or of the State. For although perſecution ought to unite Chriſtians by a holy, and the ſame Faith, and by a life correſpondent to it, yet it hath not that Efficacy nor that vertue to produce thoſe two good effects which commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low under the Reign of good Princes, as <hi>David, Hezekiah, Joſiah, Conſtantine, Theodoſius,</hi> &amp;c. under whom the people are united well otherwiſe, and kept in good order, and in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one and the ſame, and a good Religion, which they are not under perſecution. For even the Church is not without diſorders, and violent ſhakings under the beſt and moſt Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Princes, which happens by their Indulgence, who keep not up that Authority they ought to take in the government of the Church, and who delegate it to the Clergy, and permit them to exerciſe by a pretended power derived from <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Independant on the Magiſtrate, and who, in ſhort, raiſe up Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41651:37"/>
to ſuch a greatneſs and wealth, as to have credit enough to partake and ſhare the Soveraignty, and to diſpute the moiety of it with him, who of right is the Soveraign of the whole, leaving him the temporal Soveraignty, and reſerving to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſpiritual as they call it.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe matters I diſcourſe of in my Book, not yet Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, intituled, <hi>An Eſſay towards a true Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory.</hi> One <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Alexandria<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Cyrillus,</hi> were equal, and went check by jole in Authority with the Emperour, and had built an Empire in that of their Soveraign. For even thoſe and their Succeſſours had built ſeveral of them, when a Pope was ſet up among them, who ſubjugated them all, and made them all agree, to ſet up but one Catholick Church; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there were in the ſame Empire many Catholick Churches which mutually deſtroyed each other. <hi>Donatus</hi> acknowledged no other Church in the World than his own: That made <hi>Theophilus</hi> alſo of <hi>Alexandria</hi> do ſo, who perſecuted St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to the uttermoſt, and who treated him as an Heretick, a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and calling all thoſe that adhered to him, <hi>Johannites.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid of the concurrence of <hi>Meletius,</hi> of <hi>Flavian,</hi> and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Antioch,</hi> who ſhared the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and the Church into two Catholick Churches.</p>
            <p>I leave ſincere perſons to Judge, what integrity of Faith thoſe Prelates could preſerve during not only the three firſt Ages, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe following.</p>
            <p>ALL the Chriſtian Antiquity, put aſide that of the Holy Scripture, cannot produce ſuch peices that may come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with the Inſtitutions of <hi>Calvin,</hi> or with the confeſſion of the Congregational Faith; the firſt Centuries of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church ſwarmed with Hereſie and Hereticks; The moſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox as <hi>Irenaeus, Juſtin Martyr, Tertullian, Clement, Denis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Origen, Cyprian, Euſebius, Arnobius, Lactantius,</hi> &amp;c. who oppoſed thoſe hereſies, were not themſelves exempt, and they had all ſome touch or other of one of the Hereſies of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

of it moſt an end, as <hi>Pelagius</hi> has done, without any ones tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular heed to it, or oppoſing it, becauſe they never treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that matter throughly, and ſearched into the bottom of it, and have not made any expreſs and particular book about it: this is what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays. <hi>In lib.</hi> 1. <hi>in Julianum, cap.</hi> 2. <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li quaeſtione nullus Pulſabatur, pelagianis nondum ligantibus ſecurius loqucbantur.</hi> They have all conſecrated their Errors to Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, becauſe of their Ancientneſs; but as <hi>Cyprian</hi> tells us, <hi>diſt.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 8. <hi>Conſuetudo ſine veritate eſt Vetuſt is erroris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT appears than by all I have here ſaid, that if Intereſt, Cuſtome, Obſtinacy, the love that every one has for their own particular Opinions, govern the greateſt part of Mankind in matters of Religion; we may ſay of prejudices, that thoſe are they which tyrannize over them; ſuch as in our dayes is that of every ſort of the reformed, who imagine that their reformation, their Doctrine, and their Diſcipline, come the neareſt to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. This is what <hi>Monſieur Claude</hi> maintains moſt confidently of our reformation in <hi>France:</hi> But as I agree with him, that it is the pureſt in the World, I do not agree with him that it hath any conformity with the Ancient Primitive Church, except he means the Apoſtolical, and not that which was immediately after the Apoſtles. For even ſo the conformity of the Congregational way with the Chriſtians after the Apoſtles is not as to the Doctrine, but only as to the outward diſcipline and way of Government.</p>
