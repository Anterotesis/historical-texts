            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now though that marriage ſong was

this ſong penned by Solomon himſelfe;
not to expreſſe his affections to Pharaohs

            <p>The firſt Reaſon why this Song is

And there is an holy and uſefull truth
in each one of theſe interpretations; but
the laſt doth exceedingly magnifie the

making it a divine abridgement of the

And that this booke was chiefly pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

So then the Church of Judah is here ſet

This ſhewes us what it is that makes
the Church blacke, wherein the defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of it ſtands, in the fall and ſins of the

            <p>If Solomon ſhall ſet up other Gods,

            <p>Theſe Roes and Hinds are wilde and

yet if the eſtate of the Church ſhould

invites Chriſt to come in unto her, in it,
yet hee diſpoſeth himſelfe ſo, as more
willing to call her abroad. So wee may
ſee, that notwithſtanding the purity and
ſimplicity of Chriſts worſhip, yet Chriſt
is not bound to any place; if things were
never ſo reformed, yet he might leave us,
and goe into the wilde field. Rome hath
long doted on <hi>Peters</hi> Chaire, and Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem

leaves them: Never reſt we then in any

The Palatinate hath beene as reformed

and their beames were of Cedar, and
their rafters of Firre, yet God hath left
them: for doe we thinke that if God had

we ſhould ſee and diſcerne Chriſt
ſpeaking and working in them: See here
the Church lookes not at <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſo much,
but at Chriſt in him. Doe they heare a
rumour of a deliverance? It is the voyce
of Chriſt, and it muſt needs be a ſtrong
voyce which Chriſt is the author of.
The wiſeſt <hi>Daniel, Shadrach, Meſhach</hi> and

            <p>So the holy Ghoſt teacheth, what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
any doth ſhew to the Church, it is
Chriſt that doth it; ſo take it, that if any
good befall the Church, it is Chriſt that
doth it; If any lead into captivity, <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi>
or any other, it is Chriſt that
leads her into a wine Cellar: If there be
any noiſe or worke of deliverance, it is
Chriſt that comes leaping and skipping:

This is a wonderfull ſtay to Gods
Church, and to every member of it; for
man cannot bring it into captivity, and
bring it out againe: Mans hand cannot
bring hard things upon the Church, nor
bring her out againe of them; for if it
were in mens hands, or in Sathans, or in
our own hands, it would not goe well

There ſhall be ever ſome <hi>Sanballat,</hi> or
<hi>Tobiah,</hi> or ſome other to be nibbling at
the Church of God: wonder not at this,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61322:41"/>
for this will be ſo; but obſerve touching
theſe enemies of the Church,</p>
            <p>Firſt, they ſhall deale ſubtilly and
craftily with her.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they may diſturb and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
her peace and proceedings; but</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they ſhall in the end be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,
as in <hi>Revel. 19. 20. And the beaſt
was taken, and with him the falſe Prophet
that wrought miracles before him, &amp;c. Theſe
both were caſt alive into a lake of fire bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

foxes know the time will come when
Chriſt will either take them, and chaine

<note n="†" place="margin">Luke 3. 2.—4.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Mar. 1. 3, 4</note> by the manner of ariſing, like

            <p>Firſt, the Temple of Chriſts body;

            </p>

<hi>verſe</hi> 9. King <hi>Solomon</hi> made himſelfe a
Couch, the word may be tranſlated
Coach or Couch: this latter I rather
take, partly for the Etymologe of <hi>Apirion,

            <p>No earthly father, but Chriſt by his

wee are to come before God in the

Chriſt the love of our ſoules; not to
ſhew our fine garments, wantonly to
gaze at beauties; not to ſatisfie the Law
or friends, for faſhions ſake; but to ſeeke
Chriſt inſtructing us in temptations:
Some come to catch ſomething from
Chriſt to entrap him, &amp;c. but it is our
duty to come unto him, as a Spouſe to

to Chriſt, that hee may caſt the ſeeds of

               <note n="†" place="margin">Pſal. 119 24, 25. &amp; 30. 6, 7, 8.</note>: ſo it is now with

our brethren beyond the ſeas, whom
you might have commended a yeare or
two agoe, and have found Chriſt there;
but now he is gone, ſhe ſeekes him but
findes him not: See the Church of God
ſometime enjoyes all the ordinances of
God, ſometimes none; ſo a Chriſtian
ſoule ſometimes hath Chriſts left hand
under her head,<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 6.</note> and his right hand to

which will not bee good for it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in regard of fearefull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
for they will ſtart away; many

So <hi>John</hi> was perfumed with graces for

now ſpeaketh not to the mother Church
of the Jewes, but to a ſiſter Church, the
Church of the Gentiles; ſuch a ſiſter as is

Chriſt in truth without feare of lawes,

let all his faithfull ſpouſes goe with him;
when there are dens of Lions, and men
cannot keepe the profeſſion of Chriſt,
but fall into their mouthes, then it is
time to goe: But are there theſe cauſes

onely, the Church is Gods garden or

            <p>Firſt, as the garden of Paradiſe was
the habitation of <hi>Adam</hi> in the eſtate of

rather ſhut up by reſtraint; for the word

            <p>Againe, the Church prayeth for the

<hi>verſe</hi> 16. and therefore her preſent ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p>The Church was then ſaid to be ſhut

Secondly, becauſe the Church then
aſſembled in private cloſe places, woods,

            <p>Thirdly, becauſe it was ſhut up from

neither were the Emperours willing
their Subjects ſhould repaire to them,
nor the Church willing to admit all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly.</p>

<hi>Chap.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
            <p>

abundance of proſperity in <hi>Conſtantines</hi>
time, neglected the purity and power
both of doctrine and worſhip, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
corruptions; of which were prayers
to Saints, building of Temples to them,
Superſtitious regard of their reliques,
Images, and their worſhip, Ceremonies
annexed to their ſacraments, choyce of
meats, affecting and applauding Monkiſh
life, Purgatory, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My heart waketh:</hi>] The Church was

            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:61322:74"/>
Secondly, to diſcerne ſome ſuch groſſe
hereſies as quenched the heart and life of
Chriſtianity; as the impiety of <hi>Arius,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
the God-head of Chriſt; of <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
and <hi>Eunemius,</hi> denying the perſon of
the holy Ghoſt; of <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> dividing the
perſons in Chriſt; of <hi>Eutiches,</hi> confounding
their natures: other ſtraw and ſtubble
built upon the foundation they neglected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
ſaying, Open.</hi>] Chriſt uſed good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
to awaken his ſpouſe, and to raiſe her
up from this carnall ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Firſt, he calleth to her in the voice of
ſundry good Divines, who complained of
the intolerable burthen of humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
wherewith the common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
were defiled and dabled, as Chriſt
here complaines: His locks &amp; haire were
full of the drops of the night;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ep. 119.</note> drops with
coldneſſe of Religion and darkneſſe of
ignorance ingendred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, he knocked by the raps and
blowes which <hi>Conſtantius, Valens,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
gave to the Church; the two former
perſecuting the orthodox Biſhops and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and other Chriſtians, in favour of
the <hi>Arians;</hi> and <hi>Julian</hi> making flat A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:61322:75"/>
from the Church, and ſubtlely
ſupplanting the nurſing of Religion.</p>
            <p>I put off my coat,<note place="margin">Verſe 3.</note> how ſhall I put it on?
I have waſhed my feet, how ſhall I defile
them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I have put off my coat.</hi>] Thus upon ſleight
pretence the Church refuſeth to open to
Chriſt: ſhe pretends, Religion &amp; the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God would appeare too naked, if it
were not clothed with goodly &amp; comely
humane inventions; how then ſhould ſhe in
ſo naked a manner open to Chriſt? Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
inventions do not clothe Religion,
or the Church profeſſing it with any
comely ornaments; but, as it were with
warme blankets, lap her and lull her aſleep
in the bed of perfunctorie worſhip and
carnall ſecurity.</p>
            <p>I do not here conceive that the Church
acknowledgeth ſhe hath caſt off her gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Chriſts righteouſneſſe; for then
how ſhould ſhee remaine the ſpouſe of
Chriſt? yea, how then ſhould her heart
have beene otherwiſe then aſleepe too?
but onely ſhee pleadeth ſhee ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
too naked if ſhee ſhould open to

            <p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:61322:75"/>
               <hi>I haue waſhed my feet:</hi>] Not with the
laver of regeneration, for that would
have beene no impediment, but a furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
to the pure worſhip of God; but
ſhee had waſhed her feet, ſhee had freed
and cleanſed her converſation from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements
of ſecular affaires: ſhee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up a devout regard of virginitie, or
hermitiſh or monkiſh ſolitary retiredneſs;
ſhee being cleanſed and waſhed in theſe
devices, cannot betake herſelfe to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
the Lord in his ſimple ordinances, and
in the waies of her calling, without ſome
defilement: Thus marriage and worldly
buſineſſe (though both allowed by God,
yet) ſeeme a defilement, in compariſon of
more ſtrict ſuperſtitious devotion.</p>
            <p>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of

him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of
the doore;</hi>] Or, <hi>My beloved put downe his
hand by the hole of the doore.</hi>] Either of
which imply, that Chriſt did at firſt uſe
meanes for himſelfe to open the doore,
when ſhee would not; attempting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the impediments which hinder him
from enjoying his ſpouſe: Firſt, <hi>put his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61322:76"/>
hand by the hole of the doore,</hi> when he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up Chriſtian Emperours, ſuch as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi>
and both the <hi>Theodoſii,</hi> to call Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods,
and to command the Fathers aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
to give all diligence to roote out all
hereſies, and depravations of doctrine
and worſhip, that the pure and holy faith
might ſhine forth.</p>
            <p>How eaſily might the Church, upon ſuch
encouragements, have broken the barres
and bolts of ſuperſtition crept into the
worſhip of God, whereby Chriſt was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred
from drawing neer to them? The
Biſhops aſſembled in thoſe Councels of
that time, condemned thoſe groſs hereſies
which blaſphemed the doctrine of the
Trinity; but how deeply did they neglect
to redreſſe all other enormities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions?
Beſides, Chriſt is ſaid to put in
his hand by the hole of the door, when he
puts his ſpirit, which is the power &amp; finger
of God<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 12. 28. with Luke 11. 20.</note>, into the hearts of his people,
whereby they are enlightened to know
him better, and ſtirre up men honeſtly to

ſtirred up <hi>Leo Eſauricus, Conſtantines</hi>
ſonne, and <hi>Leo Copronimus,</hi> to bend their
beſt endevours to roote out Idolatry, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61322:76"/>
to remove Images, which were one of

up out of the blankets of theſe humane

to reſtore openly the ſimplicity of

            <p>

though Images were in ſome places

            <p>

The Church, finding her ſelfe ſo hardly
dealt with by the Miniſters and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates,
would not give over her ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Chriſt; yet now ſeeketh him in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip

&amp;c.]</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians, the daughters of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi>
from this day forward, to the daies
of <hi>Petrus Waldus</hi> (of whom the <hi>Waldenſes</hi>
tooke their name) were very ignorant of
Chriſt, and therefore they ask who hee
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61322:79"/>
was, and wherein better then another:
But in ſtead of him they magnified the
Church; <hi>Holy mother Church</hi> was all
in all with them: Her they acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be faireſt among women, though
they ſee nothing in Chriſt better then in
another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My beloved is white and ruddy, &amp;c.</hi>]<note place="margin">Ver. 10.</note>
Thus <hi>Petrus Waldus,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lions,</hi>
opened Chriſt to the daughters of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
to the children of the Church, ſetting
before them the white innocency of true
holineſſe in him, and the ruddy ſcarlet
dye of his death. The righteouſneſſe and
death of Chriſt plainly, yet powerfully,
opened by him, brought many to behold
Chriſt, and to profeſſe him; who (when
by perſecution ſtirred up againſt them by
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> they were diſperſed
into many places) multiplied exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly;
and being then called <hi>Albingenſes,</hi>
in many battels fought againſt the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third had
ſent againſt them, under conduct of <hi>Simon
Mounteford,</hi> and others ſigned with the
croſſe: in many of which the <hi>Albingenſes</hi>
prevailed, helped by <hi>Reymund</hi> Earle of
<hi>Thelus,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> King of <hi>Aragon;</hi> though
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61322:79"/>
afterwards they were overcome and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
further into many places of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.
So in regard of theſe troupes
of many thouſands, Chriſt is here called
the <hi>ſtandard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> bearer,</hi> as the word ſignifieth,
or <hi>the choice of ten thouſand.</hi> Again, at
that time Chriſt may be ſaid to be white
and ruddy in regard of his members, who
were then white with innocency of life,
yet ruddy, enduring perſecution.</p>
            <p>His head is as the moſt fine gold,<note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> his locks
are buſhie, and black as a raven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His head is as the moſt fine gold.</hi>] Chriſt
comes now to be deſcribed in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
more particularly: This head of
gold Chriſt ſhewed on the earth in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of <hi>Frederick,</hi> the ſecond Emperour of
<hi>Rome,</hi> a Prince of much purity and worth,
as an head of the Church of fine gold:
He contended with many Popes about
the headſhip of the Church, advanced
the headſhip of Chriſt and of himſelfe,
his Vice-gerents, above he counterfeit
head of the Popes Supremacy. He wra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtled
for Chriſt againſt them with much
difficulty, yet prevailed; ſo that even in
the popiſh ſchools his election of God was
agreed and condeſcended unto by ſundry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:61322:80"/>
               <hi>His locks are buſhie,</hi> or <hi>curled, and black
as a raven.</hi>] Curled black haire is a ſigne
of heat and courage, and wit in him that
it groweth upon: Such was the Emperour
himſelfe, &amp; ſuch were the common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
of that age that did depend upon
their Emperour; they ſtuck cloſe to him:
learned men with wit, more then former
ages had yeelded, and ſouldiers with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
maintained his perſon and cauſe.</p>
            <p>His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the
rivers of water,<note place="margin">Ver. 12.</note> waſhed with milke, and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>
               <hi>Doves,</hi> diving in rivers of waters, dive
their bellies deepe into the waters; ſo that
their eyes looke cloſe and narrowly upon
it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>eyes</hi> are here ſet forth by their
care of the Church; he is not ſo farre off
removed from it, that he had need of the
Pope to be his viſible Vicar to looke to it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by their milde innocency, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
in that they are <hi>doves eyes</hi> and <hi>waſhed
with milke;</hi> whereas the Popes eyes were
as hawkes eyes, looking eagerly after the
prey.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, by their fit ſtanding, ſoe as
they may well looke to the whole bodie;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:61322:80"/>
whereas the Popes eyes cannot poſſibly
watch to looke well to the eſtate of the

            <p>To this purpoſe tended the doctrine of

both God and man with the ſavor

the eſtate of the Church reformed.
Sometimes againe, the members of the
Church ſcattered abroad in the wilde

Chriſt, as in the former Chapter.</p>
            <p>The Church is here viſible, as in a

Reformed Churches, which is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon

            <p>Queenes differ from Concubines in
foure reſpects:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Queenes, or chiefe wives are
taken into fellowſhip with their royal
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:61322:94"/>
husbands by ſolemne ſtipulation,<note place="margin">Gen. 29. 22</note> and
with conſent and ſolemne rejoycing
of friends: The Concubines are not
ſo, as <hi>Bilhah</hi> and <hi>Zilphah,</hi> &amp;c. A man
takes ſuch to him rather by right of
Dominion, than by fellowſhip of
Wedlock.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Queenes, or chiefe wives
bring with them dowries to their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 9. 16.</note>.</p>
            <p>Hence,<note place="margin">Acts 3.</note> 
               <hi>Lesbonius</hi> to <hi>Luſitoles,</hi> in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,<note place="margin">Sect. 2.</note>

taken without dowry for the moſt
part, as <hi>Hagar, Bilhah, Zilphah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, chiefe wives had the keyes
of the families in their owne hands,
they had government of the houſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and with their husbands. Hence it
is that <hi>Hagar,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 16. 3.</note> though called <hi>Abrahams</hi>
wife,<note place="margin">verſe 6.</note> yet is ſaid to be in <hi>Sarahs</hi> hand,

<hi>Sarah</hi> her Miſtreſſe,<note place="margin">verſe 9.</note> as likewiſe the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel

            <p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:61322:94"/>
Concubines, though ſecondary
wives, yet were but as ſervants, ſave
onely they were admitted to the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip
of the bed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, chiefe wives brought
forth children, to whom belonged the
Inheritance; whereas Concubines
children had, for the moſt part onely,
ſome gifts given them.<note place="margin">Geneſ. 25. 5, 6.</note> That <hi>Dan</hi> and
<hi>Naptali, Gad</hi> and <hi>Aſher,</hi> the ſons of
<hi>Bilhah</hi> and <hi>Zilphah</hi> had Inheritances
among their brethren, was by extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>Queenes then are ſuch Reformed
Congregations where ſuch properties
of Queenes are found: Chriſt (indeed)
lookes for no Dowrie from us for his
owne uſe, he needeth nothing of ours,
neither have we any thing to give him,
but our owne nakedneſſe, filthineſſe,
and beggery.<note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 5, 6.</note> Here therefore looke at
Chriſt in the perſons of the Miniſters,
whoſe Vicegerents they are, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours
alſo; and in whoſe name they
being married to the Churches, doe
beget children to Chriſt;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15</note> though Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
conſidered in compariſon with
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61322:95"/>
Chriſt, they are but as the friends of
the Bridegroome, not Bridegroomes
themſelves.<note place="margin">Iohn 3. 29.</note> Such Churches then, and
Congregations are Queenes, whom
the Miniſters and Congregations doe
with mutuall free conſent chuſe either
the other; as when the people do give
up themſelves,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 8. 5.</note> firſt, to the Lord, and
then to the Miniſters by the will of
God. Of this ſort are ſundry Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
in England, and very many
in the Reformed forraigne Churches:
other Congregations, which have Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
thruſt upon them without
their liking and conſent, and whom
Miniſters have to them by ſome clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine
conveyances, are more like to
Concubines.</p>
            <p>Againe, ſuch Congregations as
come to their Miniſters with a good
dowry, and comfortable and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
maintenance, they are like wives.
Others who bring little or no mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
with them, are like to Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines,
though indeed the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
is more eſſentiall to lawfull
marriage; to wit, free conſent, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61322:95"/>
mutuall ſtipulation on both ſides; for
as ſometimes lawfull wives have but
poore dowries, and Concubines ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
bring large maintenance with
them: ſo ſome Congregations that
freely conſent to the acceptance of
their Miniſters can allow them but
ſlender maintenance, whereas ſome
others upon whom Miniſters thruſt
themſelves are richly endowed: Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore,
ſuch Congregations as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the power of the keyes, they are as
Queenes, lawfull wives. The keyes of
the Kingdome of Heaven, are</p>
            <p>Firſt, the one of knowledge, <hi>Luke</hi>
11. 52.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the other of Juriſdiction,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. and both of them men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19.</p>
            <p>Where then a Congregation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth
a faithfull Miniſtry, opening
an entrance into the Kingdome of
Heaven to penitent believers, and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it againſt impenitent hypocrites
and ſcandalous livers, there the power
of the keyes is not wanting; and if
withall they haye liberty exerciſing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61322:96"/>
Juriſdiction, there is their Queen-like,
or wive-like authority more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.
Of this ſort are divers, both
Engliſh and forraigne Churches,
though ſundry Germane Churches
diſpenſing the keyes of knowledge
more corruptly in their Doctrine of
the Sacrament, and predeſtination, and
neglecting the uſe of excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
doe rather turne to the condition
of Concubines.</p>
            <p>But ſuch Churches as have no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
or ſuch as have no power in their
gifts to open and ſhut the Kingdome
of Heaven, to the conſcience and
ſoules of men, they are as Concubines.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſuch Congregations where
the people remaine ſtill ignorant in
darkneſſe, and are not brought on to
be begotten of God by the lively word
of Regeneration, but continue altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ignorant, worldly, and prophane;
they are as Concubines, whoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
inherit not, though God may
give them outward bleſſings. But
ſuch Congregations where the word
is lively to the begetting of ſoules to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61322:96"/>
an immortall inheritance, they are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wives, yea Queenes: Of this ſort
our Engliſh and forraigne Churches
have many, (God be bleſſed) though
the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> hath but a few
names.<note place="margin">Revel. 3. 4.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Damoſels are without number, &amp;c.</hi>]
Damoſels, or Virgins in this marriage
ſong are of leſſe reckoning, as being
yet either not ſpoken to in way of
marriage by Chriſt and his Miniſters,
or coily refuſing him. Of this ſort
there were many Churches at the firſt
reforming of the Goſpel, to whom
for want of Miniſters Readers were
ſent; whence one of the Martyrs wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
that every able Miniſter might
have ten Congregations committed
to his charge, till further proviſion
could be made; ſo that ſuch Churches
there were, even ten to one, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
many that ſcarcely heard of
Chriſts knocking at their hearts by
any conſcionable Miniſtry; yea, and
how many be there at this day, that
either doe want ſuch Miniſters as doe
eſpouſe them to Chriſt, or elſe doe
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61322:97"/>
coily deny their motions, and ſtand
out againſt Chriſt and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
            <p>Of Queens he reckoneth threeſcore,
of Concubines foureſcore. A certaine
number put for an uncertaine; and of
Churches, the leſſe pure the greater.</p>
            <p>Damoſels he reckons without num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
            <p>Firſt, partly, becauſe they have been
exceeding many of them, and are ſtill
too many.</p>
            <p>Secondly, partly, becauſe Chriſt
maketh no account of them, as if they
were with him <hi>nullius numeri,</hi> not
worth the reckoning.</p>
            <p>But my Dove,<note place="margin">Verſ. 9.</note> my undefiled is one, &amp;c.]

of good works God forbid, but rather

            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Harlot of Rome
ſo delighteth ſo much to boaſt of her

Chriſt ſpeakes of himſelfe to imply

The Church enjoying theſe great
mercies and bleſſings from Chriſt,
chargeth all her daughters, members,
to walk ſo thankfully, and fruitfully
towards God, and lovingly and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
one towards another, and ſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly,
and inoffenſively to them
which are without, that no occaſion be
given of their alteration of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

charge before, it was in regard of the
Roes and Hindes of the field;<note place="margin">Chap. 2. verſe 7.</note> feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Chriſtians comming on towards
Religion, willing to flocke, and feed,

               <hi>Who is this that commeth up from the

            <p>The calling and eſtate of the other

ſhall require, <hi>ver.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a ſatisfaction given by this
little Siſter, to the elder, how her
eſtate ſtandeth, together with the cauſe

hearkening unto her, <hi>ver.</hi> 13.</p>
            <p>Secondly, by the Churches prayer
unto Chriſt, that he may haſten the

end of the world, <hi>ver.</hi> 14.</p>

               <hi>Solomon had a vineyard in Baal-ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi>

A place ſo fruitfull that for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
it was called the Lord of a

He let out the vineyard unto
keepers, who paid him a great rent,

for their owne paines.</p>
            <p>My vineyard which is mine, is before

            <p>

To wit, I let not out my vineyard

let <hi>Solomon</hi> take his thouſands
for his fruits of his vineyard, and the
Reapers their hundreds; I will not
ſo doe, but take all the paines to keep
my vineyard, and reap all the gaines

Aſſyrians, Egyptians, and neighbour-Nations,
hee will then keepe his
Church with his mighty power, that
neither Dragons, nor wilde Bores, nor

            <p>
               <hi>The companions hearkning to thy word</hi>

words in the originall which implyeth
either that Church would have the
Mother Church of the Jewes take
care of all other Chriſtian Churches,
and give directions unto them, and
yet not as unto her handmaids, but as

Secondly, hearken to the voice and

            <p>Thirdly, continue in calling upon

            <p>Make haſte my beloved,<note place="margin">Verſ 14.</note> and be thou

that the Nations of the Gentiles ſhall
not be caſt off from the fellowſhip
of the Church, when the Jewes are
called, as the Jewes were out of the

burne up all our impediments, if no
afflictions can diſcourage us from
him, if no proſperity can ſhake our
intire deſires after him, we are then wel
