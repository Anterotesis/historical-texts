            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE ROBERT LORD <hi>RICH,</hi> Baron of Leez: Grace and peace from the Father, Prince, and Spirit of peace: Amen.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight Honourable, worthy is that saying of Salomon, Cant. 2.2. <hi>Like as the lillie among the thornes, so is my loue among the daughters.</hi> By the <hi>lillie</hi> is meant the Church, and the true members of it: so called, 1. Because they are <hi>planted</hi> by the good husbandman in the feild of the Church, <hi>watred</hi> with the dewes of heauen, <hi>hedged</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by his continuall care. 2. They are <hi>beautifull,</hi> for Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in all his royaltie is not clothed like one of the <hi>lillies</hi> of this feild, who are couered with the roabe of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, who is the true Salomon. 3. They are <hi>fragrant</hi> for their smell: <hi>The smell of their garments,</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Cant. 4.11.</note> the graces of God, which decke and adorne their soules, as a costly and comely garment doth the bodie) <hi>are like the smell of Lebanon:</hi> which in the spring by reason of the Cedars, and other sweet trees, gaue a most sweet sent: euen so these graces in Gods children smell sweete, that is, are in much acceptation, and delightfull to God and good men. By <hi>thornes</hi> are meant wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, hypocrites, heretikes, tyrants, open and flagitious sinners, scandalous in doctrine, and life: so called, 1. because although the earth be a naturall mother to them, as a step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother to the lillies; yet Satan the malicious man busieth himselfe in the incessant sowing and setting of them. 2. They would for euer choake and keepe vnder the lillie, if the hand of God were not euer with it to preserue it. 3. They are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to meddle withall, except a man be well fenced: hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can a man carrie coales in his skirt, and not be scorcht; and
<pb facs="tcp:18792:3"/>
as hardly runne into wicked companie, and not be hurt. <hi>So is my loue:</hi> the faithfull spouse of Christ is his <hi>loue.</hi> So called because, 1. he maketh her louely: 2. accounteth her so: 3. worketh a reciprocall loue in her heart towards him: 4. desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth mutuall coniunction with her, and effecteth it: 5. his loue beeing liberall, he giueth her himselfe, and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, all things which pertaine to life and godlinesse: euen grace here, and glorie hereafter. <hi>Among the daughters:</hi> not virgins, as Cap. 1.2. who make vp this loue of Christ; but all other assemblies in the world, which professe themselues daughters, by challenging the Catholike Church for their mother, and yet indeed cleaue vnto it but in outward professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onley.</p>
            <p>From this place I gather two conclusions. <hi>First,</hi> what is the estate of the Church in respect of it selfe, it beeing <hi>as a lillie among thornes. Secondly,</hi> what it is in respect of God, <hi>so is his loue among the daughters:</hi> The former sheweth, that the condition of the purest Church vpon earth, is to be beset with dangerous and noysome <hi>thornes,</hi> hurtfull and gracelesse men, who prick and annoie the <hi>lillies</hi> in their goods, names, liberties, and liues. For when there were but two persons borne in the world; one was a <hi>lillie,</hi> and the other a <hi>thorne,</hi> which trod downe the <hi>lillie.</hi> Cain drew his brother into the feild and slue him. Afterwards, when one would haue thought that all the <hi>thornes</hi> had bin destroied by the flood brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world to this purpose, yet was there a Cham left, of whome quickely sprowted that cursed race of the Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, who were euer pricks in the sides, and <hi>thornes</hi> in the eyes of Gods people. It is no newe thing for Iacob to be ouertopped by an Esau: nor for Ioseph to be pricked and molested both at home and abroad: neither his fathers house, nor his fathers eye can safegard him. Nay, the fairest <hi>lillie</hi> that euer saw the sunne, was most beset with <hi>thornes</hi> that euer was: all his innocencie, wisedome, meeknesse, puritie, and loue, could not keepe them off him; but they pricked him to the heart, and wounded him to the death, euen the shamefull
<pb facs="tcp:18792:3"/>
and ignominious death of the crosse. How was this <hi>lillie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set with <hi>thornes</hi> in Egypt, in the wildernesse, in Babylon, in Iudea, when Christ sent his Disciples out as sheepe among wolues? how in the tenne persecutions? how at this day? and so shall it be till the great day, in which all the <hi>thornes</hi> shall be cast into the fire. And no wonder, <hi>thornes</hi> do but their nature, which are good for nothing but to pricke and to burne. It standeth therefore the <hi>lillies</hi> in hand, to be so much the more carefull to fence themselues against their molestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this shall they doe by obseruing these fowre rules. 1. Because the <hi>thornes</hi> hinder the rooting of the <hi>lillies,</hi> these must double their diligence in the rooting of themselues in the grounds of true religion: for this yeeldeth hope of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, stablishing, and continuance in the faith. 2. Because <hi>thornes</hi> seeke to keepe the sunne from the <hi>lillies,</hi> and hinder the comfortable heat and light of the word from them: these must so much the more carefully frequent the places where the light of wholesome, pure, and comfortable doctrine doth more brightly displaie it selfe. 3. Because <hi>thornes</hi> seeke to pricke the <hi>lillies</hi> in their names and profession: these must more circumspectly fence themselues, with innocencie and godly conuersation, and in nothing, in no part lie open vnto them. 4. Because the <hi>lillie</hi> is a weake plant to defend it selfe from the stiffnesse of the <hi>thorne,</hi> it must fortifie it selfe partly with comfort in the presence, care, and loue of God the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman who is euer in his feild; and partly with the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of faith, that he would be pleased still to looke vnto it, to raise vp Pastors and teachers according to his owne heart to water, cherish, and preserue it: especially in these last daies, wherein the feild is ouergrowne with scandalls, Apostacies, trials and reproches, wherewith the <hi>lillies</hi> are daily scratched, torne, and in great ieopardie.</p>
            <p>The second conclusion is, that the Lord maketh a pretious account of euerie faithfull soule, and preferreth it aboue the wicked, so farre as a <hi>lillie</hi> is for the beautie &amp; sweetnes of it, to be esteemed aboue all the <hi>thornes</hi> with which it can be beset.
<pb facs="tcp:18792:4"/>
And indeed beleeuers are the most precious of men, the most noble persons of the earth, descended of the blood of Christ, neere vnto God, and next attendants to the king of glorie: advanced aboue all the rest by the speciall grace of free ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of iustification, of sanctification, and adoption. And who can denie seeing these are <hi>Gods peculiar,</hi> an <hi>hallowed thing,</hi> a <hi>chosen people,</hi> the <hi>Lords first fruits,</hi> his <hi>remnant</hi> called out of all nations and kinreds, the <hi>sonnes and daughters of God, brethren of Christ,</hi> and <hi>heires apparant</hi> to the crowne of heauen; but that they are highly aduanced as the <hi>choise of God,</hi> and <hi>Gods delight</hi> aboue all the people of the earth? And hence followeth it, that whosoeuer would be in this price and reckoning with God, must be sure he be a <hi>lillie</hi>; which he shall know by these three notes. 1. If he be <hi>planted</hi> in the garden of God, and be a true member of the Church, not tied to it as a scion to a tree by a threed of outward profession, but by soundnes of faith, and loue; the former of which setteth into the head, and the latter vniteth to the members. Secondly, if he haue the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of a lillie vpon him, 1. in the sight of God, by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Christ iustifying and couering him. 2. in his own eyes, by the sanctification of the spirit daily washing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science from dead workes. 3. in the sight of other men, by an innocent life and godly conuersation. Thirdly, if euerie where he leaue a <hi>sweet smell</hi> behind him, that the places where euer he goe sauour of the graces of God laid vp in his heart: by bewraying the humilitie, faith, loue, patience, hope, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, and the like. A <hi>lillie</hi> can leaue no stinke behind it any where, as many in their meetings, whose speaches are, if not hurtfull, yet vnsauourie and vnfruitfull.</p>
            <p>These things I write not, as taking vpon me to teach your H. who wanteth not choice men and meanes to bring you forward both in the vnderstanding of pure doctrine, and in the institution of holy life. But 1. to put your H. in mind how highly the Lord hath honoured you both in his owne eyes, as also in the eyes of his children. The <hi>former,</hi> in that vnto out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward greatnes (which is as a rich legacie giuen by God both
<pb facs="tcp:18792:4"/>
to good and bad) he hath vouchsafed to adde the chiefe good, and made your H. RICH indeede by disposing vnto you the inheritance of his children: which is apparant, in that by a sound profession of the truth, he hath <hi>planted you</hi> in his own ground or garden; in that he hath set the beautie of <hi>a lillie</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; and hath graced you with a sweet <hi>smell</hi> of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious graces, which euerie where you leaue behind you. The <hi>latter,</hi> both in that he hath put in your heart a speciall care of fencing your selfe by religious and innocent walking; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you haue adorned your holy profession, in not laying your selfe in any part open to the enuious scratching of <hi>thornes:</hi> As also hath expressely engrauen this part of his image vpon you, to esteeme his children <hi>as lillies among thornes</hi>; whereby a good euidence is ministred to your owne heart, that you are <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated from death to life.</hi> 2. That I might stirre vp your H. as you haue cause to reioyce in, and set your heart vpon this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase which is the portion but of a fewe, to esteeme it, as it is, your truest honour and nobilitie; your vnperishing riches and treasure: whereas all earthly glorie, and greatnesse, worldly wealth and abundance, abstracted from this, neither are your owne, neither if they were, can they make you happie: It was an excellent speach of that noble Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Magis fe gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere quod me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

That I might adde one incitement and prouocation to proceed (as you haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun happily) in the loue and practise of true pietie: wherein whilst you profit and encrease, you prouide a good stocke for the time of neede. Let your H. giue me leaue to encourage you to goe on in ennobling nobilitie it selfe, by beeing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to fewe of your honourable ranke,<note place="margin">

And as all the parts of Christianitie are distinct one from another, so lie they heare or there in these rich coffers distinct, so as euery Christian may draw out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, direction, and consolation according to his owne necessitie.

But ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it follie to paint a pearle, I will rather now giue some tast and reason of that I haue done: as also remooue some scruples which may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise perhappes be mooued against it.</p>

He that prophesieth speaketh vnto men to edifying, to exhortation, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> and, <hi>he that prophesieth edifieth the Church.</hi> This is that which the auncient Fathers since the Apostles haue fruitfuly laboured in, as appeareth by their learned Sermons preached &amp; written. This is that which the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Pastors in all ages (especially of later daies since the cleare light of the Gospel was restored) haue so industriously and happily employed themselues in; as there is almost no place in the Scriptures so hard, whether matter of Historie of things past, or prophecy of some things yet to come, vnto which they haue not endeauoured to bring some perspicuity and clearnes:
<pb facs="tcp:18792:7"/>
as witnes all the worthy Commentaries extant, which haue more opened the Scriptures within this last hundreth yeares, then in a whole thousand and some hundreths before.</p>
            <p>Now setting before me the singular good accrewing hereby vnto the Church sundrie wayes, I thought that my selfe could not more profitably be spent the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this seruice of the Church; nor more acceptably lay out my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters talent then in adorning this worthy Epistle, which hath not been by any before me so largely handled as here thou hast it. In the opening of which I haue examined the nature of the words; cast euerie branch into his proper place by an easie and familiar method; sifted out the true sense which might best stand with antecedents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> consequents, parallel places, and analogie of faith: conferred with the best interpreters, consulted in matters questiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the auncient Fathers, raised naturall doctrines, and applyed them to their seuerall vses of instruction, reprehension, consolation, or confutation. In some whereof howsoeuer I aimed at the necessitie and occasions of mine owne auditorie, yet generally I haue presented generall instructions; and all this in that plaine stile wherein it was deliuered; both then and now, more aiming at soundnesse of matter then sounding of words, and more inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to perswade the hearts then to please the eares of men.</p>
            <p>If it be here obiected that this Epistle concerneth but one person, and one more generall might haue beene more profitably and fitly chosen. I answer, That <hi>1.</hi> my choise was fitted to my auditorie, wherein were as many young Titusses to be instituted to the seruice of the Church, as ordinarie Christians to be instructed in the duties of a religious life. <hi>2.</hi> This Epistle was not so much written for Titus, as for the whole Church, and therefore he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>teach these things</hi> publikely,<note place="margin">

               </note> as things of speciall vse for all the people of God: and in all probabilitie this Epistle was openly read by Titus to the whole congregation, whom in the ende he saluteth in these words, <hi>Grace be</hi> (not with thee, but) <hi>with you all. 3.</hi> We haue not onely the spirit of God recording it among other holy writings to the whole Church, but sundrie gracious Pastors haue beene delighted to be conuersant in it: as M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> acknowledgeth of himselfe to M.

<pb facs="tcp:18792:7"/>
the interpreting of such a materiall Epistle in one moneth: neither did I think it the part of a faithfull expositor, either wholly to neglect things pertinent, though they seeme smaller, or altogether to avoide treatises which might prooue more laborious. <hi>3.</hi> Seeing corruption of manners is the rifest griefe of our dayes, I cannot be iustly blamed if I haue more enlarged my selfe in bending my greatest forces against this most dangerous disease: and yet my hope is that my Reader shall not iustly challenge mee with multiplication of matterles words, who haue laboured to thrust much varietie of matter into as fewe words as possibly I could. If it be further obiected, that there is no great neede of writing bookes in this age, which rather surfetteth of them then otherwise. Although this no more concerneth me then others, whose labours merit better respect then they meete with, yet I answer, that <hi>1.</hi> pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers complaine not of any surfet of sound Commentaries of the Scriptures, especially of some bookes (whereof this is one) but rather haue cause to wish more helpes of this kinde then they haue, as my selfe did when I first attempted this Epistle. <hi>2.</hi> be it graunted that the learned haue many good helpes, yet ordinarie Christians complaine of want of sauourie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries in our owne tongue, who are in their godly desires to be respected. <hi>3.</hi> he that obserueth how thicke Popish bookes are sent in amongst vs, and what armies of Popish Priests and Iesuites are without intermission dismis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the seducing of our simple people from their loyaltie to God and their soueraigne; cannot with any conscience prosecute any such allegation. <hi>4.</hi> besides the instance of many godly friends, my owne present condition helped forward this labour: for beeing hindered in my course of ministerie, how could I better spend my silent time, then by casting such a mite as this into the publike treasurie of the Church.<note place="margin">

Hence was it that (least Gods husbandrie should vtterly miscarie) the Apostles were put to new trauells: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vpon them the care of all the Churches which they had founded; and seeing Satans subtilties incessantly breaking out in his seducing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, teachers of lies, and false Apostles, to the annoyance of the Church; were constrained with a second hand to stablish their first worke, and with no lesse labour to vphold and repaire that house and building of God, which like good master-builders they had formerly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and erected. This truth is euident, not onely in other Churches plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this our Apostle, the Doctor of the Gentiles, as by his seuerall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles

And therefore no sooner was <hi>Paul</hi> departed hence (although he left <hi>Titus</hi> behind him to further the worke) but Satan thrusteth in corrupt teachers, some erronious in doctrine, others in life, scandalous; both of them exceeding infectious: some of them seeking the ouerthrow of the doctrine, others of the gouernment of the Church established: others would for the honour of the seruant, despise the Son, by ioyning Moses and Christ together: all of them disioyned the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and practise of pietie; and by this meanes peruerted many, and drew them into their owne destruction. Our Apostle therefore wrote this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to Titus, 1. that he might authorize and backe him in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie against such as might otherwise carrie themselues contemptuously towards him. 2. That he might direct him in redressing and repressing such disorders as beganne to preuaile: for which ende he both describeth what manner of persons he should place Teachers ouer the congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as also what doctrine he would haue him particularly applie to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree and condition of men; that by the sufficiencie of the former, the false teachers might be foiled, and by the euidence of the latter all sorts of men might be sensed, and out of daunger of corruption by them. 3. Because Titus was young (as it seemeth) he teacheth him how to carrie his whole doctrine, how to order his life, how to deale with the tractable, how also with obstinate offenders, who studied rather parts, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these foure verses containing the <hi>salutation,</hi> which is the <hi>exordium,</hi> or first part of the Epistle, we haue two things to consider:

                     <item>1. The persons, 1. <hi>saluting:</hi> 2. <hi>saluted.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The person saluting, is described, 1. by his name, <hi>Paul.</hi> 2. by his office: 1. more generall, <hi>a seruant of God:</hi> 2. more speciall, <hi>and an Apostle of Iesus Christ:</hi> which is further enlarged by the <hi>ende</hi> of it, namely, either to preach the faith of Gods Elect (as the <hi>Geneva</hi> translation hath it) or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hereby to bring the Elect vnto the faith; <hi>according to the faith of Gods Elect:</hi> vpon which occasion he entreth into a large and notable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of this faith, and thereby proceedeth in amplifying the dignitie of his calling; as we shall see in the seuerall parts when we come vnto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi>] In this name, two questions come to be resolued. 1. How the Apostle came by this name, seeing he was a Iew, and on the eight day, beeing circumcised according to the law, was named <hi>Saul,</hi> after the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish manner, and not <hi>Paul? Ans.</hi> Not to stand vpon the opinions of some, who thinke he was called by both these names,<note place="margin">Orig. in praesa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. epist. ad Rom.</note> because he was both a Iew by birth, and a Gentile by his freedome in Rome: neither of such, as thinke he was thus called, because he conuerted <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> the Proconsul vnto the Christian faith: for we read that he was thus cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18792:11"/>
before we read of the others conuersion, Act. 13.9. neither of that father who thought he was called <hi>Paulus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">August. lib. 8. confess. cap. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>quasi parvulus Christi,</hi> vpon his conuersion: for he was called <hi>Saul</hi> a long time after his conuersion. But the simple and receiued truth is this, That beeing called to Apostle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,<note place="margin">Act 9.15. 1. Tim. 2.7.</note> and <hi>ordained to be the teacher of the Gentiles in faith and veritie,</hi> he was presently to giue ouer his Apostleship among the Hebrewes: and withall he giueth ouer the vse of the Hebrew name, whereby he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly knowne vnto them: and vndertaking his office among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, he also taketh vp this name, more familiar vnto them, whereby he would giue them to know, that he was now appropriated and after a sort, dedicated vnto the seruice of their faith. And this truth seemeth to be grounded in Act. 13. for before he and Barnabas were separated vnto this worke of the Lord, he was euer called <hi>Saul,</hi> but after this time neuer.</p>
               <p>Here we may obserue two considerations. 1. That it is and may be lawfull sometimes for a man to change his name; else had it not beene lawfull in Paul, nor Peter, who was before called Bar-jona: nor Salomon, who was first called Iedidiah. Not here to speake of the Lords owne changing of names, as in <hi>Abraham, Sarai, Israel,</hi> wherein the Lord in some new names would hide some new mysteries, according to the new occasions offered: yet here, these caueats must be diligently obserued. 1. it may not be done to the hurt or offence of any man (as in nicknames taken vp in scoffe or for reproach of our selues or others) but to the good of men.<note place="margin">3. rules in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging mens names.</note> 2. it may not be done to the hiding or couering of any sinne; as many fellons, and Iesuiticall fugitiues vse it. 3. some good ende must euer be propounded in it, wherein God may be more glorified, and men edified. Thus haue sundrie godly men changed their names in their writings, to preuent preiudiciall thoughts taken vp against their persons, that the truth might more prosperously spread it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Note hence, that such names are to be giuen to children, as may put them in minde of some good dutie: as Paul could neuer heare, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member his new name, but also be put in minde of his new office, and dutie which he was to performe among the Gentiles. And so much as may be, these names must be giuen in the naturall language: thus the Hebrews giue fit names in Hebrew: the Greekes in Greeke, as Timothie: <hi>There was a disciple named Timotheus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16.1.</note> 
                  <hi>his mother was a Iewesse, but his father a Grecian:</hi> which last words seeme to include the reason of his name:<note place="margin">Rom. 16.22, 23.

The former beeing in the excesse, giue names aboue the nature of

men, some drawing too neere the Deitie it selfe, as Emmanuel, and the Iesuits; some of Angels, as Gabriel, Michael, &amp;c. some of vertues, as Grace, Faith, Mercie, Patience, &amp;c.

               <p>The second question is, Why this name is here prefixed? <hi>Ans.</hi> There be three especiall vses of setting mens names vnto divine writings. 1. to shew that men were called of God vnto that worke. 2. that they were readie to iustifie and stand to that they had written. 3. to preuent the mischiefe of forging writings, and fathering them vpon men which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wrote them. Which regards mooued <hi>Paul</hi> in all his Epistles to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue two things: 1. in the beginning of each, to prefixe his name: as in all his 13. Epistles. 2. in the ende of each Epistle, he added the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall salutation, as himselfe witnesseth, 2. Thess. 3.17. <hi>The salutation of me Paul with my owne hand, which is the token in euery Epistle.</hi> Coloss. 4.18. <hi>The salutation by the hand of me Paul.</hi> And both these, partly to shew his calling which was so strange and extraordinarie to be from God, Gal. 1.1. <hi>Paul an Apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Iesus Christ:</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that he might iustifie the truth he wrote, Rom. 1.16. <hi>I am not ashamed of the Gospel of Christ:</hi> As in the last place to preuent that mischiefe which was euen then inuented, 2. Thess. 2.2. <hi>Be not suddenly mooued, nor troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by spirit, by word, or letter, as though it were from vs:</hi> he would not therefore haue any goe vnder his name, which had not his name at it. Hence learne,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That in the former respects it is conuenient that a mans name should be set to his writings, which he commendeth to the vse of the Church: after the example of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cases in which a man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to set his name to his writing.</note> who did not (as many now a daies) for his names sake set himselfe on writing; but for his writings sake set to his name: yet so, as there be cases when it shall be neither necessarie nor wise to affixe the name of the author. The principall of them be three. 1. When the name shall bring neither credit to the truth, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> profit to the Church, but danger and hurt to the partie himselfe: which case holdeth firme so long as he writeth generall truths, and not perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall: for els it may prooue an hurtfull slander. 2. When the high esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and account of the penman in the Church, may cause the truth to be receiued not for it selfe, but for the writer. 3. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the contempt of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the writer, through the corruption of the people, shall on the other hand preiudice the truth, that it shall haue none, or lesse regard in respect of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18792:12"/>
him. And this is thought to be the cause, why (not to insist in other Scriptures, as many of the Psalmes, bookes of Chronicles, &amp;c. the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of which the spirit of God hath not discouered) the Epistle to the Hebrewes (generally by the learned thought to be Pauls) wanteth both the name,<note place="margin">Euseb. hist. eccl. lib. 3. Iun. par. praesat. c. 2. ad Hebr.</note> superscription, and subscription, which all his other Epistles haue:<note place="margin">This reason is giuen both by Clemens Alex. and Athan. dial. de Trinit. See also Nicephor. lib. 2. hist. eccl. cap. 26.</note> not because he was the Doctor of the Gentils, and so was out of his way in writing to the Iewes, but because he knew his person and name to be merueilously hated at Ierusalem; and that he was growne into great contempt among the enemies of the Gospell from whom he had separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: whose furie he gaue place vnto, and would not excite by adding his name, beeing desirous that they should entertaine the naked truth for it selfe. And howsoeuer it is a vaine thing to be peremptorie in defining it to be Pauls; yet is it more vaine to conclude it none of his, because it wants his name; for by the same reason, it hauing no bodies name, they might conclude it to be no bodies: nay, rather vpon this occasion, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his name, it is liker to be his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From Pauls example euery Christian man may learne to be readie to giue his name to the Gospel, and like a child of wisedome by a bold profession, to iustifie it vpon euery iust occasion: many are too indifferent herein, and loth to be knowne disciples of Christ: the shame it is of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny professors in such a sunneshine day as this, to cast themselues with <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus into the night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A seruant of God</hi>] This is a title which all the Apostles delight in; for thus also <hi>Peter, Iames, Iude,</hi> in the beginning of their Epistles, stiled themselues: which is not to be vnderstood in a generall sense, as <hi>Reu.</hi> 7.3. for thus not onely they, but all Christians, nay more, all creatures (euen the worst) are some way seruiceable vnto God in executing his will: but it here specially respecteth that office and function to which they were set a part, expressed more particularly in the next words, <hi>and an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle.</hi>

                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> This beeing the first title whereby the Apostle would get himselfe authoritie, teacheth, That the very name of a seruant of God, is full of honour and authoritie. The Apostle comparing the glorie of Christ with the glorie of the Angels, Heb. 1.14. advanceth them as farre as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly he can, that Christ his glorie beeing so much more excellent then theirs there described, might be most highly exalted; and yet the highest ascent of their honour which he can rise vnto is, to title them <hi>ministring spirits,</hi> standing about God: from which seruice they are honoured with glorious names, of thrones, dominations, powers, Rulers, principallities: and although the Scriptures most vsually vnder this title expresse the low and humble condition of Christ,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.7.</note>

In Moses, in that he did all things according to the patterne in the Mount: In Christ, in that his doctrine was not his, but his fathers: neither did he any thing of himselfe, but all that his father taught him <hi>that spake he,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 7.16. and 8.28.</note> and all that he <hi>sawe the father doe, that did he.</hi> This same was the faithfulnesse of the Apostles also: who preached onely what they <hi>had heard and seene of Christ,</hi> and deliuered onely what they had <hi>receiued:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.1.3. 1.

Vnto which we may bee mooued not onely in that we haue such a cloude of worthie examples, but also in that we serue a good master, one full of faithfulnesse, readie to retribute our fidelitie with infinite advantage: a farre more foreceable ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to bind vs vnto God, then that of the Apostle to binde seruants to faithfull seruice of <hi>beleeuing masters.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

But also pittie it is that euen of Protestant ministers, not a fewe may bee charged with Demas his sinne, <hi>in embracing this present world:</hi> which if any doe,<note place="margin">2.

               <q>And an Apostle of Iesus Christ]</q>
               <p>Now the Apostle descendeth from the generall to this special seruice, which was the highest Ministrie in the Church; and sheweth that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was in the most serious busines of the Church, next vnder Christ, who had furnished him with an embassage for the reconciling of men vnto God; and that not as an ordinarie Minister, but 1. as an <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle:</hi> 2. an Apostle of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That he was an <hi>Apostle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Three priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle.</note> appeareth by three properties agreeable only vnto Apostles. First, hee was immediatly called by Christs owne
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18792:14"/>
mouth, Act. 9.5.6. <hi>I am Iesus, arise:</hi> for this was the Apostles preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, to see Christs face, and be called by himselfe immediatly, and not (as this day) mediatly by the Church. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> prooueth himselfe an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Am not I an Apostle? haue I not seene Christ?</hi> namely, though not while he was in the flesh, and in his base estate, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles; yet by reuelation, and beeing now glorified; which was of his farre more speciall grace: once in the way to Damascus, Act. 9.17. and another time in the Temple he saw Christ appearing to him,<note place="margin">Act. 22.18.</note> wishing him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>to make hast out of the Cittie. Secondly,</hi> as he receiued his calling, so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise his doctrine immediately from Christ, as the other Apostles did. True it is that beeing brought vp at Tarsus, he was first instructed in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane literature and knowledge,<note place="margin">Act. 22 3.</note> that he was able vpon occasion to cite the testimonies of sundrie Heathen Poets; and after that he was brought vp at the feete of Gamaliel, a Doctor learned in the law, in which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited so much as he became vnreprooueable, and liued according to the perfect manner of the law of the Fathers; and he spake with tongues more then all the Apostles. Notwithstanding all this, when he commeth to learne the Gospel,<note place="margin">Galat. 1.1.</note> he had it not <hi>from</hi> man, nor <hi>by</hi> man, but immediatly by Christ from heauen. This knowledge was too high for him to hammer out by his owne studie, God himselfe shewed it him by reuelation. Eph. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3.3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> he was not now tied to any one certaine place, but was called to carrie the name of Christ <hi>among the Gentiles:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9.15.</note> and to confirme this, we read more of <hi>Pauls</hi> trauels then of all the Apostles besides put together: his commission to Damascus was not halfe so large and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as this he hath now receiued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He calleth himselfe an Apostle of <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> 1. Because he was called, furnished, and sent by Christ. 2. Because he was now to teach Christ; not the letter of the law any longer, but the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; neither righteousnesse by the Pharisaicall obseruation of the law, but by the faith of the Sonne of God.</p>
               <p>

                  <note place="margin">Chiefest offices in the Church are for seruice.</note> teacheth vs, that the chiefest offices in the Church are for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of it. Was there any office aboue the Apostles in the Church? and yet they preached the Lord Iesus, and themselues <hi>seruants for his sake.</hi> Nay our Lord Iesus himselfe although he was the head,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.5.</note> and husband of his Church, yet he came not into the world to <hi>be serued,</hi> but <hi>to minister and serue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Ministers must neuer conceiue of their calling, but also of this seruice, which is not accomplished but by seruice: thus shall they be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to <hi>Peters</hi> exhortation, 1. Pet. 3.3. to feed the flocke of God depending vpon them, not by constraint, but willingly; <hi>not as Lords ouer</hi>

               <p n="2">2. Wouldest thou know what ambition Christ hath permitted vnto his Ministers? it is euen this, that he that would be chiefe of all, should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>seruant of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In regard of that <hi>actuall election</hi> and choise of some peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nations aboue other, vnto the true meanes of life and saluation, so to become the people of Gods election.

In respect of that <hi>eternall election</hi> of God, which is according to grace; whereby of his good pleasure he chooseth from all eternitie, out of all sorts of men, some to the certaine fruition and fellowship of life eternall, and saluation by Christ.

                  <hi>They went out from vs, but they were not of vs</hi>; yet this is the priuiledge of this election, that it is the <hi>firme purpose</hi> of God to saue, and haue mercie. <hi>Obiect.</hi> It will be here alleadged, that seeing there is not acceptation of persons with God, Rom. 2.11. he cannot more accept one to saluation then another; or if he do, how shall it not be most vnequall, that those who are equall, should not be equally delt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all? <hi>Ans.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>nor regardeth the rich more then the poore, seeing they are both the worke of his hands:</hi> but freely in his Christ chooseth such as are good in his sight, the rest being reiected. As for such as alleadge vnequall dealing in God towards such as are equally corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and lie all alike in the same masse; there beeing no more matter of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in such as are chosen, then those who are reiected: all this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no way to a dependent election or reprobation, which hangeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some outward thing without the most absolute will of God; much

lesse maketh the straight waies of God vnequall. For may not he doe <hi>with his owne as he will?</hi> who art thou that darest <hi>dispute with God?</hi> that presumest to prescribe laws to thy Maker;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.19, 20.</note> that he should deale with one man thus, or with another otherwise? or who hath spoiled him of his so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie ouer his creatures?<note place="margin">Rom. 11.33.</note> If thou canst not sound this <hi>depth of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of this wisedome and knowledge of God,</hi> acknowledge then how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searcheable are his iudgements, and how his wayes are past finding out.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This first conclusion teacheth vs, 1. To make sure our owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and shew our selues vnto others to be of this small number: namely, by holy and vnblameable walking,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.4. 2. Pet. 1.4 10. 2.

               <p n="2">2. It confirmeth vs against the scandal which is common in the world, wherein most men beleeue not, most men repent not, nay scorne them that doe: at which we may not stumble, seeing that some, yea the most are refused: there must be in euery corner such as are blinded vnto destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p n="3">3. Hence we must blesse God who hath chosen vs, that he might put a difference betweene vs and others; whereas he found no such difference in vs, who were the children of <hi>wrath as well as others:</hi> he chose vs (not when we were, but) <hi>that we might be holy and vnblameable,</hi> Ephes. 1.4. that from the first to last, in our saluation all the glorie might be his: yea that our ioy might be more full, and our glorying in God more firme and cheerefull, he hath made it knowne vnto vs, that beeing elected, we are sure of our happinesse:<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.28.</note> for nothing shall be <hi>able to plucke vs out of his hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second conclusion is, that the elect haue a faith by themselues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here called the <hi>faith of Gods elect:</hi> where by faith is not meant the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, as Iude 3. <hi>Contend for the faith once giuen:</hi> and 1. Tim. 1.19. but rather the gift of faith, whereby we vnderstand, and imbrace that doctrine: neither is euery gift of faith here meant. For there is 1. an <hi>historicall faith,</hi> standing in an assent and acknowledgement of the truth of things written, and taught. 2. There is also an <hi>hypocriticall faith,</hi> which passeth the former in two degrees. First, in that with knowledge
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18792:16"/>
and assent is ioyned such a profession of the truth, as shall carrie a great shew and forme of godlinesse. Secondly, a kinde of gladnesse and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying in that knowledge: for it is ascribed to some, who in temptation shall fall away,<note place="margin">Matth. 13.20.</note> to <hi>receiue the word with ioy.</hi> To both which may be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sometimes a gift of prophecie, sometimes of working miracles: as some in the last day shall say, <hi>Lord haue we not prophecied, and cast out deuills in thy name,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 7 22.</note> and yet they shall be vnknowne of Christ. Neither of these is the faith of the elect here mentioned:<note place="margin">The true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of sauing faith of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> but a third kind called <hi>sauing</hi> faith, the inheritance of which is the proprietie of the elect: for the iust man only liueth by this faith: which in excellencie passeth both the former in three worthy properties. 1. In that here with the act of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and assent vnto the truth, there goeth such a disposition and affection of the heart, as apprehendeth, and applieth vnto it the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of grace vnto saluation; causing a man to reioyce in God, framing him vnto the feare of God, and to the wayting through hope, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of the promise of life. 2. In that whereas both the former are dead, and not raysing vnto a new life in Christ, what shewes soeuer be made for the time, the sunne of persecution riseth and all such moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture is dried vp: This is a liuely and quickning grace, reaching into the heart Christ and his merits, who is the life of the soule, and the moouer of it to all godly actions, not suffering the beleeuer to be either <hi>idle or vnfruitfull in the worke of the Lord.</hi> 3. Whereas both the former are but temporarie, this is perpetuall and lasting: the other rising vpon tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie causes and reasons, can last only for a time, as when men for the pleasure of knowledge, or the name of it, by industrie attaine a great measure of vnderstanding in diuine things; or when, for note and glorie, or commoditie, true, or apparent, men professe the Gospell: let but these grounds faile a little, or persecution approch, they lay the key vnder the doore, giue vp house, and bid farewell to all profession. Thus many of Christs Disciples,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.66.</note> who thought they had truly beleeued in him, and that many moneths: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This conclusion teacheth vs, 1. That true faith is an infallible marke of election,<note place="margin">Contra Concil. Trid. sess. 6. can. 15.16.</note> assuring the beleeuer as certenly of his saluation, as if he were alreadie gathered vp to his fathers: or as if he had a speciall reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. For besides that here it is a grace impropriate to the elect, the Sonne of God teacheth it, Ioh. 6.37. <hi>All that the Father giueth mee, shall come vnto mee:</hi> that is, all those whom the Father chuseth to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18792:16"/>
he giueth to the Sonne to saue: for election is founded in Christ: and those who are thus giuen vnto the Sonne by the Father, <hi>come vnto the Sonne,</hi> that is, beleeue in him: for so the 35. verse confoundeth them, <hi>He that commeth vnto mee shall not hunger, and hee that beleeueth in mee shal neuer thirst.</hi> So as those that beleeue, are giuen to the Sonne to saluation. The same teacheth the Euangelist, Act. 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to life, beleeued:</hi> and 2. Thess. 2.13. the Apostle maketh <hi>sanctification of the spirit,</hi> and the <hi>faith of truth,</hi> two infallible notes of election. All that can be here of moment obiected is,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that a man cannot know certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he hath faith. But that is false:<note place="margin">Sol.</note> for <hi>Paul</hi> 2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may a man knowe that he hath this faith, that so the beleeuer may rise vp to the assurance of his election?</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> There be diuerse notes and companions of it,<note place="margin">Foure notes whereby the truth of faith is discerned.</note> more easily discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned then it selfe is: as first, It purifieth the heart, Act. 15.19. and will not suffer it to be taken vp with vncleane thoughts, or vnlawfull lusts: it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the affections and cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 6.45.</note> from the works of loue, a man may conclude he hath faith, Gal. 5.6. <hi>faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worketh by loue</hi>; first to God, then to man for Gods sake: for it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect both to him that begate, and him that is begotten. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> plentifull in prayers and praises, which vnbeleeuers are as heauie vnto, as a beare to the stake; because they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the spirit which <hi>crieth in the hearts of Gods children, abba, father.

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may hence gather a cause, why some beleeue, some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not: it is not because some will, and some will not, whatsoeuer free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will-men presumptuously auouch: the Holy Ghost telleth vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> it is <hi>not in the willer, nor in the runner,</hi> but therefore men come to the faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are elected, Act. 13.48. And why did not the Iewes beleeue the heauenly doctrine of Christ himselfe? the reason is giuen, Ioh. 10.26. Ye beleeue not, because <hi>ye are not my sheepe:</hi> most true is it here, <hi>the elect haue obtained</hi> (sauing <hi>faith) the rest are hardened</hi>; Rom. 11.7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18792:17"/>The third conclusion is, that this peculiar faith of the elect is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily wrought in them,<note place="margin">Faith ordinarily wrought in the ministerie of the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</note> by the ministrie of the word; this beeing noted here, that the end of the ministrie is to bring the elect vnto the faith, Iob. 33.23. <hi>If there be a messenger, or interpreter, one of a thousand to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to man his righteousnesse:</hi> now this righteousnesse is no other then the righteousnesse of faith: for this ende were the Apostles called, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, and sent out into the world, to teach men faith on the Sonne of God, as appeareth in their commission, Mar. 16.16. <hi>Goe into all the world, and preach the Gospel to euery creature: he that beleeueth and is baptized shall be saued:</hi> to this purpose is it that <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth of the great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Godlinesse, that it must first be <hi>preached vnto the Gentiles,</hi> and then <hi>beleeued on in the world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. If this be the principall ende of the ministerie, let ministers herein employ their first and principall paines, to bring men vnto the faith; wherein they shall imitate our Apostle, not onely here, but in his other Epistles; who first dealeth in the causes and meanes of saluation, and then instructeth in Christian manners; as one whom the wisdome of God had taught, that if the inside be not first made cleane, and the heart purified by faith, whatsoeuer actions can proceede from men, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so glorious, yet indeede they are no better then glistering sinnes: he hath the right way of teaching in the schoole of Christ, that first layeth for his ground faith in Christ, and then buildeth thereon, all his precepts of Christian Philosophie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Minister ought to propound before him, Gods end in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of euery ministeriall dutie, and that is by enlighting, conuerting, confirming, comforting, to bring and stablish men in the faith. Which iustly reprehendeth such, as (forgetting themselues, their dutie and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple) out of the pride of their hearts, busie themselues in finding out ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and darke mysteries, tying hard knots to vntie them againe: not much vnlike the dogge which refuseth soft meate to gnaw vpon bones, and all this to get the praise of nimble heads, and sharpe wits: whereas the true glorie of a Minister, is the number of those that are begotten to the faith: who are gathered by the plaine euidence of the word, in the words, not which mans wisdome, but which Gods spirit teacheth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Lord hauing set out the ministrie for this vse, let euery hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer acknowledge herein Gods ordinance, and yeeld themselues with all submission vnto the ministerie, and the word there preached; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may haue faith wrought in their hearts. God will haue men taught on earth, and not from heauen: by man, not Angels or dead men: let this meanes be despised, nothing in heauen or earth can do thee good: fast, pray, afflict thy soule, forget not to distribute, doe all the good thou
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18792:17"/>
canst; but yet all this while despise the word offered, and thou hast for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken thine owne mercie; nay more, come to the ministerie, heare the word read, preached, ioyne in the prayers and Sacraments of the Church, if thou commest without the submission of thy heart, whereby thou art become as prepared ground, to couer the seede vnto increase, all is in vaine: for <hi>what is Paul? what is Apollos?</hi> what is the minister (be he neuer so choise and excellent) except he be the <hi>Minister of thy faith?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.5.</note> and so what is the ministerie to thee, if it be not the ministerie of thy faith?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Euery man may hence examine himselfe, whether in the vse of the ministerie, he finde sauing faith, begotten &amp; wrought in his heart; and by examination, some may finde their vnderstandings more enlightened, their iudgements more setled, their practise in some things reformed: but a very fewe shall finde Christ apprehended, and rested in vnto saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seeing so fewe there are that liue by faith in the Sonne of God: for of all the sinnes that the spirit may and shall rebuke the world of, this is the chiefe, because <hi>they beleeue not in Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 16.9.</note> Howsoeuer many are in some things bettered by the ministerie, yet very fewe haue attained this principall ende of it, which is to put men in possession of true faith, and by it of saluation.</p>
               <q>And the knowledge of the truth which is according to Godlinesse]</q>
               <p>The Apostle beeing called to beget faith in the elect, magnifieth and extolleth this his calling from the difficultie of the worke: for it is not to bring forth by his trauell any blind perswasion of faith, which (beeing too naturall to men, would rise of it selfe fast enough, without any such manuring: but such a faith as is peculiar to the elect, as before we heard. In the which, least men should be deceiued, as easily and willingly the most be, he taketh paines to set downe the whole nature of it in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And first, here we haue the ground of faith, which is <hi>knowledge:</hi> and because the truth of faith cannot find footing vpon follies, or fansies, nay, nor vpon euery profitable knowledge, he teacheth what kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he speaketh of, and that is the knowledge <hi>of the truth,</hi> that is, of the Gospel, beeing a word of truth, yea, truth it selfe; so called by way of excellencie or eminencie, as though no other truth deserued that name:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> or because this carrieth the onely vndoubted truth with it. And further, because many thinke all cocksure, and that they cannot faile of faith if they be able to discourse of this truth: he teacheth vs, that it is not eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry knowledge of the truth he meaneth; but such a one as <hi>is according to godlinesse,</hi> that is, such as frameth the heart of the possessor to true God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse.</p>
               <p>Whence naturally arise these three conclusions:
<list>
                     <item>First, that the doctrine of the Gospell is the truth it selfe.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:18792:18"/>Secondly, that the knowledge of this truth is the ground of faith.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, that where it is aright, it frameth the heart to Godlinesse.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, the <hi>doctrine of the Gospel is truth it selfe.</hi> 1. because the author of it is truth it selfe, and <hi>cannot lie:</hi> it beeing a part of his word, who can neither deceiue, nor be deceiued. 2. because the penmen of it were inspired by the holy Ghost, and spake, and writ as <hi>they were mooued by him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 1.21. The Gospel called Truth, for 3 reasons.</note> who is called <hi>the spirit of truth,</hi> Ioh. 14.17. 3. because it is a doctrine of Christ, and aymeth at him who is the the truth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, as well as the way of our saluation: Whence it is, that the Apostles often stile it by <hi>the word of truth,</hi> as, Eph. 1.13. <hi>After ye heard the word of truth, euen the Gospel of your saluation:</hi> and, Coloss. 1.5. <hi>For the hopes sake whereof ye haue heard before by the word of truth, which is the Gospel.</hi> True it is, that the Lawe is a true word, without all error; but yet neuer thus called: For the morall law will not now affoard such a truth, as by which a sinner can be iustified in the sight of God: and the ceremoniall law, although it doe acknowledge such a truth, yet was it a farre off, and in types, and not in the truth: but the Gospel onely is such a truth, as whereby we are raised to saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Ministers must rightly devide this word of truth, as such who would be approoued of Christ, both the author and subiect of it: for the more notable the subiect is, the more care must there be in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it.<note place="margin">1. Pet. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> Which the Apostle Peter teacheth, <hi>If any man speake, let him speake as the word of God.</hi> The word of truth would be truely dealt with, purely preached, wisely applyed, and so faithfully dispensed, as that both God, and good men, and a mans owne conscience, may approoue his worke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This word so purely handled shall euery soule finde to be truth it selfe, so as beleeuers shall not faile of the saluation published in it: and vnbeleeuers shall as surely meete with condemnation, seeing hereby they are condemned alreadie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Not to haue this truth seated in our hearts, is a fearefull case; for it argueth a man to be giuen vp to error and delusion. 2. To doubt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of it, is to giue a lie to all the rest. 3. To seeke for saluation out of it, or besides it, (as the blinded Papist doth) is to cleaue to folly and falsehood. 4. To despise this truth, is to contemne great saluation: for if to despise Moses law bringeth death without mercie;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.28.</note> how much more sorer punishment is he worthy of which treadeth vnder foot the Sonne of God? 5. But to fight against this truth is most wofull, for it is stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest and will preuaile: neuer man lifted against the truth, but he found it too heauie for him: neuer man spurned against it, but to the bruising of himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:18792:18"/>Secondly, the <hi>knowledge of this truth, is the ground of faith:</hi> for so our Apostle would haue vs conceiue,<note place="margin">Knowledge of the truth is the ground of faith. 2. Thess. 2.13.</note> that the faith of the elect is raised vpon knowledge of the truth as the matter of it: and in this sence, we read that faith is called the <hi>faith of truth,</hi> euen for this reason, because it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten in the acknowledgement of the truth: and <hi>Paul</hi> in asking that question, <hi>How shall they beleeue, except they heare?</hi> plainly concludeth,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note> that no hearing of the truth, no faith in it: and how may he that runneth read in the Scriptures, that to whomsoeuer faith is giuen, they be such as are <hi>taught of God?</hi> such as to whom the holy spirit is become a schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, who openeth their vnderstandings, that with much assurance they can see and acknowledge the truth for seeing faith is much more then an vncertaine opinion, or wauering fancie; it followeth that that knowledge which is the ground of it, must be no shaking reede with euery winde; but a certaine acknowledgement of the truth, approouing of it, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting vnto it. Neither may we thinke that the spirit of truth traineth men in blinde and vngrounded conceits, nor leaueth their hearts in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties; but that wheresoeuer he worketh such an eminent grace as faith is, he maketh men able in some good measure <hi>to giue a reason of the hope that is in them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.</note> And as little reason haue we to conceiue that the worke of the Ministerie, is to build castles in the ayre, or the castle of faith without a foundation; but that Ministers are sent to make the misteries of saluation cleare in the euidence and demonstration of the spirit: and so lay men on that foundation, to become a spirituall house, consisting of liuing stones fit for the honour of the Lord. And to ende the proofe, notably doth the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> prooue the <hi>effectuall faith</hi> of the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> from this ground of it: <hi>for our Gospel was not vnto you in word only,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Thess. 1.3.5.</note> 
                  <hi>but in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance:</hi> which place must be vnderstood so to be both in the teachers and the hearers, as the context declareth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. If knowledge be the ground of faith,<note place="margin">Lampas fidei facile extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nisi subinde infundatur oleu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> verbi dei. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sost. in parab. virg.</note> then sleight is the faith of the most, whatsoeuer men professe. Numbers of most silly creatures swarme euery wheare, who pretend, and presume vpon as strong a faith to God ward, as the best preacher of them all; and yet liue no better then Atheists, euen without God in the world: without the knowledge of his waies, without his feare in their hearts: to loue God aboue all, and their neighbours as themselues, is but a breath with them: to beleeue in Iesus Christ, is so naturall, as they neuer doubted of it all their liues; to bring forth fruits of faith (whose propertie is to worke by loue, in the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Commandements of the first and second table,) this they do, they hope as well as God wil giue them leaue, or as others of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours do: whereas, alas, euen their speach bewraieth them to be destitute

of vnderstanding, and consequently vtterly voide of the faith of truth.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Fides explicita, implicita.</note>2. If the ground of faith must be a certaine knowledge of heauenly truth: then hereby, 1. is ouerturned that fond distinction of the Papists, which masketh there more then Egyptian blindnes, ioyned with wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and obstinacie, vnder their modest vaile of vnexpressed faith, or the faith of lay-men; whereby if they can professe themselues Catholikes, &amp; liue, and die in the beleefe of their (falsely so termed) Catholike Church; although they know not what it beleeueth, it is sufficient for their saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

All that pedagogie during the law, was onely to traine men vnto Christ, and to saluation by him. But that rudiment bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abolished, and the truth further breaking out, the chiefe doctor of his Church (setting himselfe a coppy to all teachers) called men to no other thing, then first to seeke the kingdome of God, and to labour (not for the perishing food) but that which abideth vnto eternall life. And after him his holy Apostles made no other vse of those maine articles of our faith, the truth of which they left confirmed in all their writings: as if they were occasioned to speake of the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, it was to the ende that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers should die to the world, that henceforth they should vse it, as not vsing it, or as men crucified vnto it: if of the <hi>resurrection</hi> of Christ, it was to the same purpose, that men should be raised with him henceforth to seeke the things which are aboue: if of his <hi>ascention,</hi> it was that men might in heart, and affection ascend vp after him.</p>

Which course if a minister take not, long may he looke for an haruest, yea, euen till his eyes faile, but he shall neuer see his seede againe: he hath sowne to the winde, and what can he looke to reape but earthlinesse, or atheisme amongst his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

The second instruction out of the words is, That true faith neuer goeth alone; but as a Queene, is attended with many other graces, as knowledge, loue, feare of God; among which hope here mentioned, not only adorneth, and beautifieth, but strengtheneth and fortifieth the beleeuer, and as an <hi>helmet of saluation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6.17.</note> causeth the Christian souldier to hold out in repentance, and obedience. Hence it is that our Apostle speaketh not of the <hi>faith of the elect,</hi> but he mentioneth as an insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble handmaid, <hi>the hope of life eternall:</hi> so doth the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>We are now the sonnes of God:</hi> here is <hi>faith,</hi> making vs the the borne of God: and we know that <hi>when he shall appeare, we shall be like him:</hi> there is hope: and, <hi>whosoeuer hath this hope purgeth himselfe, as he is pure:</hi> there is the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of the beleeuer in <hi>obedience.</hi> Notable for this purpose is that place in Rom. 5.1, 2. &amp;c. where the whole traine of graces attending and following faith, are fully and excellently described.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>hope</hi> is a <hi>gift of God, whereby the Saints patiently, and firmely expect good things to come alreadie beleeued, especially their resurrection,</hi>

                  <hi>and life eternall, prouoking them in the meane time to all dutie.</hi> In which description, diuerse things are to be considered. First, the <hi>originall</hi> of it. It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is a <hi>gift of God,</hi> and obtained by prayer, as faith also is: whence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle praieth that the God of our Lord Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.17.</note> would giue the Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians to know, <hi>what the hope is of his calling. Secondly</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>subiects</hi> in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> whom it is, <hi>The Saints:</hi> for as the practise of beleeuers before Christ to waite for his first <hi>comming</hi> in humilitie, as we read of Simeon, Annah,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.37, 38.</note> &amp; many others; so now beleeuers as constantly waite for his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the comforts of it, Reu. 22.17. And that it belongeth only to the Saints is cleare: 1. In that it is ioyned with the faith of the elect in this text. 2. Because it ariseth from faith, is nourished by it, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionall vnto it. 3. The thing hoped for, belongeth only to the Saints: they only haue right in the tree of life, and only they enter in, through the gates into the Cittie. 4. That which meriteth the thing hoped for,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.24.</note> that is, the righteousnesse and obedience of Christ, belongeth only to them; for them only he praied while he was on earth, for them only he died, he rose againe, ascended into heauen, and now maketh requests at the right hand of his Father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the obiect of this hope; Things to come, and namely after <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the resurrection, <hi>life eternall.</hi> In which regard the Apostle calleth it an hope <hi>laid vp in heauen:</hi> which is all one with that in the text, hope of life eternall; vnto which it lifteth vp the heart and affections. Where the excellencie of the grace may be conceiued, from the excellencie of the

And this grace it is which putteth such a difference between the godly, and the wicked, that whereas these are well appaied, and contented with things present, and wish for most part, there were no other heauen, then that happinesse they enioy here vpon earth: the other looke vpward, and outward, and see a farre off; and are such as waite for the adoption of sonnes, and the redemption of their bodies, which is the full haruest of those first fruits which they haue alreadie receiued.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is added in the description, that this grace of hope doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>firmely</hi> and not waueringly expect this eminent obiect: and this it doth, both because it is grounded not (as the Papists teach) vpon mans merit, power, or promises, but vpon the most firme promise of God, (more sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the hills) of which mention is made in the next words: as also in that the holy Ghost, who first worketh it, doth also nourish it, yea and so sealeth it vp vnto the heart, as it <hi>can neuer make ashamed:</hi> it may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede be tossed and shaken with many kinds of temptations,<note place="margin">Hope the sure anchor of the soule.</note> yet in the patient attending vpon the Lord, it holdeth out, and faileth not.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, the fruit or effect of it, is in the last words expressed, namely, that it prouoketh vnto all holy duty, yea and continueth the beleeuer in it. Thus Abraham by faith <hi>obeyed God,</hi> and held out, <hi>looking for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward:</hi> whence it is, that as true faith is called in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Coloss. 1.5. 1.

And is a companion of faith, which is not the portion of the most. It casteth anker in heauen, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and striueth not to become the heire of the earth, as most men do, whose whole studies are to plant and build, and call the houses after their owne names, and raise their families, and make themselues great in the earth: of whom we heare the holy Ghost speaking, that their hope is onely in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> this life, and they haue no hope in their death. It is also accompanied with many graces, which are not the garlands of euery head, not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> beauties of any, but the spouses of Iesus Christ. It is not found but in an
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18792:23"/>
heart <hi>humbled</hi> with the touch for sinne, and yet possessed with true <hi>peace</hi> in God, grounded on that promise which is made to the poore in spirit: for of these two it is ingendred. It procreateth and preserueth <hi>heauenly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> mindednes,</hi> lifting vp the heart to wait, and wish for their masters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, so as that day neuer commeth vnawares vpon them, as it doth on those who are yet in the night, and in darkenesse. It suffereth not a man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> to walke in the wayes of sinne, either in hope of mercie, or presuming of repentance; but <hi>he that hath this hope purgeth himselfe,</hi> and auoydeth the corruptions that are in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he world, through lust.

So that although when pleasure or profit is to be cast off, or when crosses and losses betide the hypocrite for his obedience, <hi>all his hope peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth,</hi> and vanisheth as the dewe before the sunne; yet this hope maketh <hi>not ashamed</hi>; but comforteth in this life, and crowneth in the life to come.</p>

Heb. 6.12. be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them, who through faith and patience attaine the <hi>promise,</hi> that is, life promised. This truth was liuely typified both in the sonnes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, as also liuely shadowed in that earthly Canaan. The sonnes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham were Isaac and Ismael, two sonnes, but one heire, and he the sonne of promise: by which title alone he held his prerogatiue, whereas Ismael was the first borne. Hence was it vsuall with the Apostles to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the sonnes according to the flesh, to the sonnes of promise. And as it was then,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.8.</note> so now is there a <hi>seede of promise,</hi> euen all faithfull men and women, who are raised out of faithfull promises, faithfully apprehended, called elsewhere not sonnes onely,<note place="margin">Heb 6.17.</note> but <hi>heires of promise,</hi> that is, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such, as to whom the promises belong, but such as claime their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8.17.18.</note> not onely because it was long before promised to Abraham and his posteritie, many of whom for many generations onely so enioyed it: but also because those that were brought to the possession of that good land, had it not for their owne worthinesse: they were charged to beware of such thoughts; for God gaue them this power by <hi>stablishing his couenant</hi> with them:<note place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring vnto vs no other thing, but that this blessed rest prepared for the people of God (the truth of that shadow) is held in no other tenure but by vertue of the promise, neither here nor hereafter: adde hereunto that whatsoeuer grace the Lord powreth into the hearts of the elect, they all (beeing not onely steppes and degrees, but pawnes also and pledges of eternall life) looke out vnto the promise: faith apprehendeth it, hope expecteth it, loue thankfully entertaineth it, yea, and all the rest are quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and strengthened by it.

More plainely we may consider a twofold assurance, on which our hope may be confirmed. The former is the assurance <hi>of faith,</hi> flowing from our iustification: the latter is the assurance of <hi>sanctification.</hi> The former is when the spirit wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth to our spirits that we are adopted, which may be in weake Chrsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, young conuerts scarcely yet experienced in their owne change, yea such as can obiect such things against their faith as themselues cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily answer, yet euen in this is there an assurance of faith, which can onely leane vpon the promise and the truth of it: and this I take to be more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially meant in this text of our Apostle. The latter ariseth from the experience of our owne sanctification: the vse also of which is not to make vs so, but to trie our soundnes in the former; yea to seale it to our selues, and cleare it vnto others: this is that the Apostle <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of in the place alleadged.</p>
               <p>Yet notwithstanding that we may meete with an error on the other hand in the practise of Protestants, we affirme with our Apostle, that true hope relying vpon the promise goeth with faith, knowledge, godlines, and groweth vp in these, and therefore those the tenure of whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions runneth thus, Because grace hath abounded, we may doe as we list; because Christ hath blood inough, God hath mercie inough: we haue promises inough, we may be the boulder in our sinnes: these I say turne Gods grace into wantonnes to their owne destruction: thus indeed to leane or bolster a mans selfe on the promises, is an high presumption. The reasonings of the spirit in the Scriptures are of another kinde: Doth grace abound?<note place="margin">Tit. 2.</note> oh this must teach me to <hi>denie vngodlines</hi> &amp; worldly lusts: hath God mercie? <hi>mercie is with him that he may be feared:</hi> hath Christ blood?<note place="margin">Psal. 131.</note> it is to <hi>purge me from all my sinnes,</hi> both the guilt, and the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:<note place="margin">1.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. We must often haue recourse to the promises,<note place="margin">Acquaint thy selfe with these promises.</note> and acquaint our selues with the Scriptures, wherein we may peruse our priuiledges, and thus euer be laying surer hold of eternall life, by the applying, &amp; bringing the promises home to our owne hearts: otherwise faith shall be easily sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, hope quickly foyled, and the rest of our graces in a continuall wane and decaie. Cast anchor out of the ship, if it sound no bottome, the ship shall be at no stedfastnes in the storme, but be in danger of shipwracke by euery surge and billow: in like manner, the anchor of hope if it pitch it selfe vpon promises, it keepeth the soule in stabilitie and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in weldoing; but impossible it is that in stormie temptations or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, the hope of the heart should strengthen and vphold that man, that is not acquainted with the promises.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> 2. The next instruction out of the former words is,<note place="margin">God cannot lie.</note> that <hi>God cannot lie:</hi> which sheweth the promise to be stable, and infallible. That God cannot lie, appeareth both by testimonie of Scripture, and reason. <hi>Balaam</hi> himselfe vttering his parable could say, <hi>God is not as a man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 23.19.</note> 
                  <hi>that he should lie:</hi> &amp; the Apostle, Heb. 6.18. saith, that <hi>it is impossible that God should lie.</hi> And the reason is, because to lie is against the nature of God, so as he shall as soone cease to be God, as once to doe it: truth is of his nature, yea he is truth it selfe: truth in all his promises, which are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen:</hi> truth in all his threates, <hi>for shall he say it, and not doe it?</hi> wicked Nebuchadnezar hauing good experience of both, in beeing cast among the beasts, and after raised vp againe aboue men, could confesse,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.34. 2.

Now to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe a lie vnto God, were to impute not onely change, but contrarietie to that most simple nature of his: for what is a lie, but to vtter something contrarie to the knowne truth, and that with an euill intention: which wickednesse seeing it implyeth a contrarietie betweene his will, and his word: seeing he hath conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned it in his law, as not induring it in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: seeing this of all other is such an odious iniquitie, as that the phrase of the holy Ghost, includeth vnder this title all manner of vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes; &amp; opposeth it vnto all holines, Zeph. 3.13. how can it be ascribed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the high maiestie of God? vnles we will blasphemously say that he hath enacted laws against something which standeth with his nature and will; or at least that he hath cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged his wil, to loue that which once he hated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why may not God change his will, which euen a creature may doe without sinne? or if he cannot, how can he doe all things, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18792:26"/>
remaine omnipotent?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Papists teach that the Scriptures are variable and fitted to the times, so as if the Church change the sense, so doth the holy Ghost also. Cusan. see hence how truly.</note>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. To change the will, were an argument of weaknes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, for euen so is it in man, whether he freely doe it, or forcedly. If freely, it is because some second deliberation seemeth sounder then some former, which argueth want of foresight, and wisedome: if forcedly a man change his minde, it argueth want of power, which suffereth the former deliberation to be letted by some crosse accident: neither of which can befall that most simple, and immutable will of God; who neither of his owne accord, nor yet by constraint, can be forced or hindred: because he seeth all things in their causes and consequents together in one act; &amp; as soone and easily produceth the thing he willeth, as he pronounceth the word; as appeareth in the creation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The omnipotence of God is to be referred to the things which he willeth, and can will: for his power cannot thwarte his will, nor his arme disapoint his mouth:<note place="margin">Impossibile est deo, non quod virtuti arduum, sed quod natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae est contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium. Ambros. lib. 6. epist. 37.</note> nor either of them goe against his nature. That God then cannot lie, denie himselfe, change his purpose, proceedeth not of weaknes or infirmitie: but of wisedom, power, and maiestie; to whom on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that is impossible, which is contrarie to his nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But God hath spoken many things in the Scriptures, some of which implie change in him, and some seeme altogether vntrue; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer appeares in such places, as where he is said to <hi>repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t him that he made man,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 1. Sam 15.17. Exod. 32.14.</note> 
                  <hi>that he made Saul King,</hi> that he <hi>changed his minde</hi> from the euill which he threatned to doe to his people. <hi>Ans.</hi> All such speaches as these, are to be vnderstood not properly, but figuratiuely, improperly, and according to mans apprehension:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> for in proper speach Samuel in the same Chapter verse 29. denieth that God can repent, whom he had heard a little before repenting that he had made <hi>Saul</hi> King. The like in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams</hi> confession, Numb. 23.19. Yet it pleaseth God in the Scriptures to set out himselfe to our weaknesse, not as he is in himselfe, but as he can be knowne of vs: for as man speaketh like a man vnto God, so God spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth like a man vnto man, who else could not be vnderstood of man. We must therefore meeting with such speaches, hold these grounds: 1. That all those things which we cannot doe without motion, and change of our selues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord doth them without motion, and change of himselfe. 2. That God may change his action but not his counsell and will:<note place="margin">Mutatio non est in deo sed in rebus neque Deus mutatur cum in opere apparet muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio. Calvin.</note> for before all worlds he did so decree to change his action. When he deposed <hi>Saul</hi> to stablish the kingdome in <hi>Dauid,</hi> he did from all euerlasting dispose so to depose the one, and set vp the other: so as here was no change in God himselfe, but in the thing formerly determined so to be changed.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Lord promiseth many things to his children, which he seemeth after vtterly vnmindfull of; he threatneth things which neuer
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18792:26"/>
come to passe: as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> with death, but presently retreates it: the <hi>Ninevites</hi> with destruction after fortie dayes, but destroied them not: yea he seemeth to faine, by vttering things cleane contrarie to his minde; as when he biddeth Moses let him alone that he might destroie the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, whereas he neuer meant to destroie them. To which in generall I answer, 1. That all promises are made with condition of faith, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, as also with the exception of the crosse. 2. That all threats are made with exception of conuersion, and repentance, in neither of which the condition is expressed often, but euer included: and beeing added to that threatning against the Nineuites, and against Abimelech,<note place="margin">Deus non mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar consilium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That the Lord neuer changeth his counsell and secret will, but sometime his reueiled: and that then, when it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth some condition depending vpon some euent: which condition had it not bin included in the denunciation against Ezechias, the decree of God had beene absolute, and so not revocable, neither by the prayers, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of that good King as it was. 4. That the Lord may denounce a thing which yet he neuer decreed to doe, and yet neither lie nor faine: as in deliberatiue propositions, such as that was against the Israelites, <hi>Let mee alone:</hi> for had <hi>Moses</hi> taken it for a simple interdiction,<note place="margin">Exod. 32.10.</note> I see not how he could haue without sinne proceeded on in his intecession for them: but he perceiued the Lord carrying this matter as one in a deliberation what he might best doe in it. Againe, although the Lord cannot speake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his will, yet he doth and may speake something diuerse, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides it: as here both to teach Moses what it was that withheld his wrath, euen his prayer, which was whetted hereby; as also to quicken the people to speedie and vnfained repentance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But in the Scriptures we meete with many parables, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolicall speaches, which neuer were, nor can be true: as the conference among <hi>the trees</hi>;<note place="margin">Iudg. 9. Ioh. 21.25.</note> and that the world were not able to <hi>containe the bookes</hi> of Christs words and workes: which we see not how they can stand with the truth of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> In the Scriptures are some speaches diuerse, and some contrarie to the truth, and yet neither lies, nor sinne.<note place="margin">Iudg. 10.14. 1. king. 22.15.18. Mark. 7.9. 1. Cor. 4.8.</note> For God speaketh sometime by 1. contraries, as by <hi>ironies</hi> or speaches of derision: which are not alwaies vitious in man, neuer in God, but carrie with them most seuere reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions against sinne. 2. sometimes by parables, in which not falsehoods, but by fained things, vnfained truthes are taught and deliuered. 3. some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by excesse of speach, speaking of infinite and incomprehensible things, so as we may comprehend and affect them. But in all such formes of speach, we must hold these conclusions: 1. That they tend to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and edification of the Church. 2. There can be no purpose on
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18792:27"/>
Gods part, to deceiue (as in a lie) but to profit, by a more powerfull, and forcible manner of teaching the truth. 3. He intendeth nothing but the truth it selfe: for he conceiueth not one thing in his minde, and vtter another, but onely omitting the proper speach, in figuratiue and tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, he more elegantly, powerfully, and profitably explaneth the same truth.</p>
               <p>Thus hauing prooued and cleared the doctrine, we descend to the vses of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Neither can his Ministers spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king from him lie.</note>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. If God cannot lie, then whatsoeuer his Ministers promise or threaten from him, and out of his word, is aboue all exception; seeing he hath spoken it, who cannot lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deceiue, or be deceiued: which should stirre vp euery man to giue glorie vnto God (as Abraham did) by sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to his truth; that is, by beleeuing and applying vnto his owne soule euery word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God: for whosoeuer thus <hi>receiueth his testimonie, hath sealed that God is true:</hi> then which no greater glorie can be giuen vnto him. Whereas not to beleeue him on his word, is as high a dishonour as any man can cast vpon him: for it is to giue God the lie: <hi>hee that beleeueth not, hath made him a liar:</hi> which in manners and ciuilitie we could not offer to our equall, and which euen a meane man would skorne to put vp at our hands. Hath God made thee any promise that he will be with thee <hi>in sixe troubles, and in seauen?</hi> hath he promised that he will <hi>dispose of all things to the best</hi> to thee that louest him?<note place="margin">Isa. 43.2. Rom. 8.28.</note> hath he said that no <hi>good thing shall be wanting</hi> to thee that fearest him?<note place="margin">Psal. 34 10.</note> doe thou leane and hang <hi>vpon these promises</hi>; and giue God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of truth by beleeuing him. Thou wouldest trust a man, whom thou thinkest will not lie, though thou knowest he can lie, and deceiue thee: much more maiest and oughtest thou the high God, who is as farre from the power as the will; and as farre from both, as from ceasing to be God.</p>
               <p>Yea, but I see no meanes, no hope, but all things are rather cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the promise: and the common order of things carried against it. Be it so: yet must thou depend vpon the naked promise, which is <hi>true and not lying,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> speaketh of the annointing. Thus haue the seruants of God done before vs: <hi>Hezekiah</hi> knew not what to doe; but his eies were to the Lord: <hi>Abraham hoped aboue hope:</hi> yea then when all meanes fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the order of nature was set against him, did be not doubt of the truth of the promise, but gaue glorie vnto God: the victorious conquest of whose faith, is often in the Scriptures recommended vnto our imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

And what is the issue of it? surely thou hast escaped a beare, but a lion meetes thee: thou art leaped out of the panne, but into the coales: thy very breaking of prison hath made thy case more hopeles and desperate then euer it was before, thy durance had beene farre lesse miserable, then thy escape.</p>

Men are wise inough in outward things, to strike while the iron is hote, to watch their best windes, which blow them profit, to foreslow no time in striking vp gainfull bargaines; but here as though the wisdome of men were not in them, are without all prouidence, and haue cast care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: and yet how hath the Lord a long time manured vs, that like good trees of righteousnesse, we should be laden with fruits of righteousnesse, and repentance in our due seasons? yea how hath his pruning knife of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection followed vs for the same purpose? hath not he taken many from the meanes? and doth he not many waies threaten to take away the meanes from those that are left? doth not the time of his mercie seeme to be dated and full expired vpon vs, in that though he hath most fearefully smitten vs with durable and lasting iudgements, yet he cannot satisfie his iustice, but his arme is stretched out still? and seeing that as his hand is against vs, our hands are still against him; may it not be thought that the period of his vengeance is vpon vs, and that the vision of wrath and burden of England cannot long be deferred? It is high time then to meete the Lord, if after such prouocations yet his wrath may be turned away. Wisedome yet crieth in our streetes: Gods word in the mouthes of his messengers; his workes of mercie, and iudgement which runne into our owne eyes, all of them call vs to be wise hearted, to know the season of our fruitfulnesse. Let vs presently answer the Lords present call. Say not with thy selfe, when I haue dispatched this or that businesse, or purchased this or that pleasure or profit, or haue ouergrowne such a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and distraction; as though repentance stood in the change of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward estate, and not in the change of the minde: but know it that no time is thine, but the present: and it is little better then Poperie, to professe free will in this matter: it is too much thou hast beene deceiued in the time past; deceiue not thy selfe also in time to come. Well said one, God hath left man time past to repent of, and time present to repent in, but the time to come, he hath reserued in his owne hands.</p>

Which point is plaine, in that the preaching of the word is an ordinance of God: 1. to make Christ knowne, in whose name alone saluation is to be had: 2. to beget and confirme faith in the heart, by which alone as by an hand, we apprehend and applie him with his merits to our saluation.<note place="margin">Preaching is the siluer trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet appointed by God to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the elect.</note> The former the Apostle affirmeth, Ephes. 3.8. the vnsearcheable riches of Christ was by <hi>preaching made knowen</hi> to the Gentiles: and, Coloss. 1.27. <hi>God would make knowne what is the

Whosoeuer would finde comfort in themselues, or cleare and iustifie their callings to others, or doe good in that place of the body wherein they are set, must be able to prooue that they are not intruders, but pressed by this calling and commandement of God: that as Paul performed euery dutie in the Church by vertue of his extraordinarie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, so they by vertue of their ordinarie. For can any man thinke that a small aduantage to himselfe, which our Apostle doth so dwell vpon in his owne person, and that in euerie Epistle? making his calling knowne to be committed vnto him, not <hi>of</hi> men, nor <hi>by</hi> men, but by Iesus Christ? See Gal. 1.1. and cap. 2.7. Eph. 3.2. 1. Thess. 2.4.</p>
               <p>The necessitie of this <hi>commandement</hi> appeareth: 1. because it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a fitnesse in the persons so commanded, for the Lord sendeth not a message by the hand of a foole: for this is as he that <hi>cutteth off the feete.</hi> A Prince would not send an ambassador, who is onely able to reade his message out of a paper, euerie poste might doe that; but one of parts and gifts, by whom the message might carrie all the grace it possibly could.

two sorts: 1. of graces, as wisdome, vnderstanding, &amp;c. signified by the garments with which they were to be arrayed: 2. of sweete smell, the which both by holy doctrine and life, they were to diffuse in the Church; signified by the sweete oyle powred on their heads, v. 12. These onely are sanctified, and set apart by the Lord to serue before him, Exod. 29.4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This commandement imposeth a necessitie to performe the duties of the calling, the acknowledgement of which breedeth conscience, and willingnesse therein, not for the profit and commodities, but because the dispensation is committed vnto him: <hi>Paul</hi> seeing that necessitie was laid vpon him, denounced a woe against himselfe if he should not preach the Gospel;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.16.</note> not for the vaine applause of men, but <hi>to please God which tryeth the hearts,</hi> 1. Thess. 2.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This commandement maketh the function and works of it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, &amp; fruitful in the hearts of all men, euen the greatest: and whereas such as haue not their commission sealed from the Lord, finde not their sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices burnt by God, but often labour all day, and all night, and catch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea themselues with their worke perish together: the tongues which the Lord armeth from aboue are cheines vnto authorities, linkes of iron to binde Nobles and Princes, and bridles euen to the deuils them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: yea not seldome by vertue hereof, Princes and people may stand vp in apologie and iust defence of a poore man whom the Lord repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: as Ier. 26.15. <hi>He is not worthie to die, for he hath spoken to</hi> vs in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This commandement bringeth much comfort in all troubles raised vp against men, whilst they endeauour in the faithfull execution of this most thankles office amongst men; which otherwise might well be taken for so many plagues wherewith God followeth him who runneth vnsent: for such is Gods grace, as he neuer comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, but includeth also a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of blessing to the obseruer; and namely of speciall protection, which is so necessarie for such as are dispatched to encounter against Satan and the wickednes of the world: so as hereby the heart is fenced and strengh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened against the malice of Satan and men: which while the sonnes of Seeva wanted,<note place="margin">

But the scope of that place is, 1. to condemne the ambitious seeking and boasting in the titles of father, doctor, &amp;c. 2. to teach that no man should depend vpon any other, as the principall efficient cause of his birth, either naturall or spirituall: for God is properly the father of vs all, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our spirituall birth onely, but euen our naturall also: for he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth in the wombe, he bringeth out of the wombe, and in him we liue, and mooue, and haue our beeing: and what Ministers or fathers of our bodies act herein, they doe it as instruments, by whom the Lord worketh. True it is that the Lord hideth his worke by instituting such meanes, as haue in them some shew of inherent power, to produce such effects; and for their further reuerence ascribeth to these instruments his owne work, and his proper titles of <hi>fathers, sauiours</hi>; yet is no man for this to ascribe the principall power of begetting him, whether in the flesh, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Iudas so liued as no man could say, blacke was his eie, but yet was a deuil: out of which example we euidently see, that euen the supernaturall decrease, and restraint of vice in the reprobate, is farre from the new birth of the elect. Let him then that would not be deceiued in this waightie matter, looke he be renewed, that he be a new creature, a new man compleat in all his parts: for as the soule is whole in euery part of the bodie, so is the beleeuer renewed in euery part; that although there be no lust but may assaile him, yet none shall dwell peaceably with him.</p>

they see they owe them (which Paul challenged of Philemon) not onely their seruice, but euen their owne selues vnto them.</p>
               <p>Let Ministers feele this fatherly, yea this <hi>motherly</hi> affection, Gal. 4.19. towards their people, and like tender mothers reioyce when they prosper and thriue in grace, mourne when they are sicke: but when they are like to die, be readie to die for them and with them: such a tender mother was <hi>Paul,</hi> that wished himselfe rather accursed, then his countrimen should be cast away. We haue many teachers euery where, but few such fathers: too many Ministers resemble the mother of the dead child, who care not what become of the liuing one, whom the true Salomon shall in the end discouer to be no naturall mothers of his children.</p>
               <p>And iustly may we call for childlike affections at this day in our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, especially seeing a number challenge the Church for their mother, but deale with their fathers, as Simeon and Leui dealt with their father Iacob, so farre as they can, making them to stink among their inhabitants: or like another cursed brood, with Cham, seeke to discouer their fathers nakednes: well may we wish such to become children <hi>in malitiousnesse:</hi>

               <p n="2">2. This apostolicall faith is not a faith of two or three, but a common faith which euery beleeuer hath: but the apostaticall Popish faith (false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Catholike) is not so: for it is the faith of the teachers of the Church onely, which their hearers may safely rest in, although they haue no speciall faith of their owne; neither indeed know what their Church or teachers doe beleeue: but who seeth not that this grosse faith in the lumpe cannot be either sauing or Catholike? sauing can it not be, for the sauing faith of the elect goeth with the knowledge of the truth, v. 3. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can it be Catholike or the common faith, no more then that can be a common commoditie which is ingrossed into some few mens hands, and neuer seeth the open market; or rather which is a monopolie: for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, say they, as the Pope beleeueth (although they know not what he beleeueth) is sufficient.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This apostolicall common faith purifyeth the heart, cleanseth the conscience from dead workes, and worketh by loue: but the apostaticall Romish faith, is a pragmatical fancie working by rage, furie, violence, and blood: filling their hearts and hands with detestable resolutions and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, fouling their consciences with most impure, and impious workes of the flesh, and such as the issues of death follow, as often experience hath beene their mistrisse.</p>

Hence will it follow, that their faith not beeing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith, I say not that they must <hi>amend</hi> their faith, but <hi>change</hi> it, if they will be saued by it: it is not all the patching and daubing, and refining of their points will helpe them; nor all the baulme in Gilead can so supple their positions, that we may ioyne with them, vntill they beginne againe and laie the same foundation with vs, which is to seeke to enter into life by the doore, and not as theeues, seeke to creepe in at the window: till this be done, the ioyning with them will be the departing from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon faith: till this be done, we may not giue them the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.

Cor. 8.23. so he calleth himselfe the <hi>father</hi> of the Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and yet them his <hi>brethren:</hi> as Onesimus a poore seruant by vertue of this common faith, became the sonne of Paul, and yet his faithfull and beloued brother:<note place="margin">Philem. 10.</note> so as howsoeuer in earthly relation, we haue our diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and inequalitie; yet in regard of this common faith, beleeuers may say (as they in the Prophet) wee haue all one father, and one mother, yea one meate, and cloath, one education, and one inheritance. The Ministers must therefore so acknowledge himselfe a father, as that he is a sonne too; so a teacher, as that he be a diligent hearer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainer of the doctrine also. The Master must not forget he hath a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in heauen, and that his seruant in regard of the common faith, is or may be, his fellow seruant, and if he be a religious seruant, he must be counted more then a seruant, euen an Onesimus, <hi>a brother in the Lord.</hi> The Magistrate must so rule, as a subiect vnder Christ, and not altogether stand on authoritie; but cast an eye vpon the common faith. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band must not altogether stand on his headshippe, but like a man of knowledge,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.7.</note> dwell with his wife, as one who is with him a ioynt heire of the life of grace: so in other relations. Which consideration, were it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, it would cut off much discomfort in families, cities, societies, Church and common wealth: it would keepe men from offering occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of vnbrotherly strife and contention, as we see in Abraham and Lot, it would cause them to forgiue and forget old iniuries, as Ioseph, Gen. 50.17. if they would conceiue that they are all brethren in the faith.</p>
               <p>The third point in the words, is to consider of the adiunct of sinceritie by which Titus is commended, <hi>my naturall sonne:</hi> that is, not illegitimate, or base borne;<note place="margin">

and reuerence receiue him thus highly commended. 3. to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish Titus from some other of his sonnes, who a while fathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vpon him, but after falling from the faith, prooued but bastards, and counterfeit, as <hi>Hymenaeus, Philetus, Alexander: Titus</hi> was not such a one, not Timothy, see 1. Tim. 1.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. In that the Apostle powreth not out his commendation of Titus, neither this but vpon good ground:<note place="margin">We must be warie whom we commend, for what, and how farre.</note> obserue how warie euery man should be both whome, and to what ende, and how farre they commend another, and yet this more especially, if their iudgment be required or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed. Thus Paul commendeth Titus, 1. one well knowne to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and not out of partiallitie. 2. for a good end; the benefit of the Church, that his person and doctrine might be more louingly embraced: and that this was his ende appeareth, 2. Cor. 8.23. <hi>If any enquire of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, he is my helper and fellow: or of our brethren, they are messengers of the Churches, wherefore shew towards them the proofe of your loue.</hi> 3. he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth him sparingly, and is not lauish beyond the truth: Neither is he generall in such elogyes, for scarce any else but Timothie receiued such a testimonie from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> In this Seedplot of the ministerie, whence young Titusses are to be commended vnto the vse of the Church: it standeth those in hand, who are to dismisse them with letters testimoniall, not hand ouer head to giue a rash testimonie to euery one that requireth it: but know the party to be worthy, and one who shall not be found inferiour to the testimonie giuen of him: not because he is a friend or kinsman, or one whom thou wouldst preferre, neither for forme or fashion; but because herein thou shalt dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge a good dutie in faith to God, and his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. Because the iudgement of men in the places of Masters &amp; Fellows of Colledges, are much esteemed and relyed on.<note place="margin">Letters testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall not to be giuen rashly, why.</note> 2. it is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much moment, to commend a man to be set ouer a people: for which function the Apostle asketh, who is sufficient? 3. the setting to a rash hand here, is as the rash laying on of hands; which sinne the Apostle forbiddeth Timothy, not onely in his owne person, but euen the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with it in the persons of other men. 4. this rashnesse draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not onely thy selfe into the sinne of false witnesse bearing, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Church: but also it draweth others into the same, as Patrons, Prelates, beeing the collaters and Instituters to benefices: besides, it is a confirming of the insufficient partie himselfe in his insufficiencie, and a speciall patron of idlenesse; seeing euery insufficient person by friends or fauour, may procure an ordinary forme; and be as farre commended as the diligent hand. All these reasons, besides the example of our Apostle, should prouoke our care in this, which is more then a matter of ordinarie

               <p>In these words is laid downe the forme of the Apostolicall salutation.

               </p>
               <p>In the words, 1. of the meaning, 2. of the doctrine.</p>

               <p>By <hi>mercie</hi> may be meant the former, and that not idly added, because the freedome of this grace might be more liuely expressed, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and yet because mercie hath euer an eye to miserie, I rather vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand hereby some fruits of that former grace of God in Christ: such as are remission of sinnes, iustification, sanctification, and life eternall, by which we are freed from all miserie of sinne and punishment, in pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By <hi>peace</hi> is meant the effect of this mercie, and that is peace with God through Christ who is our peace: peace with the creatures, and peace with our selues inward and outward: so as in these three tearmes, in this order depending one vpon another, is requested whatsoeuer can make to the accomplishment of happinesse, temporall or eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>From God our Father</hi>] This title of Father is attributed vnto God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1. <hi>essentially,</hi> or 2. <hi>personally:</hi> when essentially, it is taken for the whole Trinitie, as Deut. 32.6. <hi>Doe ye reward him, O foolish people? is he not your father?</hi> In this sense God is a Father two wayes: 1. <hi>generally</hi> of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all nature, and naturall things, in that he frameth and gouerneth all his creatures, yea, men and angels. Thus he is called the <hi>father of spirits,</hi> Heb. 12.9. and thus is Adam called the sonne of God, Luk. 2.38. and angels the sonnes of God, Iob. 1. and of both may be spoken that of the Prophet, <hi>haue we not all one Father?</hi> Mal. 2. 2. More <hi>specially</hi> by <hi>grace,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of those who are adopted and renewed by grace: and thus God is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly our father in heauen, and no man is to be called father in earth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when God is personally called father, then it is to be taken for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18792:43"/>
the first person: and this title is giuen principally to the first person in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:<note place="margin">The first person called Father, why.</note> 1. because he is the Father of the second person the word, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by eternall generation. 2. because he is Father to Christ, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of his manhood, not as to other men, by nature, or grace of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by personall vnion: the humane nature subsisting in the person of the word. 3. because from both these followeth, that by Adoption he becommeth the father of all the elect beeing members, and making vp the bodie of Christ. And this is the respect wherein God is tearmed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this place, both because it hath relation to the second person here nominated; as also because in prayer we must repaire to God the Father, in Christ our head and Mediator.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And our Lord Iesus Christ</hi>] Christ is <hi>Lord</hi> in himselfe, as God and Lord ouer all, blessed for euer, both in that he giueth essence, and sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to all things; as also possesseth all things; and ruleth euen the most powerfull and glorious of all creatures, and is called <hi>Lord of the Angels</hi>; much more ouer the Deuils themselues.<note place="margin">Christ our Lord, why.</note> Againe, he is <hi>our Lord,</hi> 1. as Mediatour, we beeing his inheritance giuen him of his Father. 2. as a Redeemer, purchasing vs beeing captiues, and thralls to Satan. 3. as a head of his Church, quickning and gouerning the whole bodie of it, whether militant or triumphant. 4. in regard of his power and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for to him all power is committed in heauen and in earth, who hath put all things vnder his feete; in him we hold all things, as in <hi>capite,</hi> and to him we owe all homage and subiection in all obedience, both actiue, and passiue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can Christ be a Lord, seeing he is euery where called a seruant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Christ considered in the office of Mediatourship, is after a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner a seruant of his Father: and so his Father calleth him, <hi>for my seruant Dauids sake:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 37.35. and chap. 42.1.</note> and, <hi>Behold my seruant:</hi> because he faithfully serued him in the worke of redemption, in that he was made man, came into the world, fulfilled the law, prayed vnto his Father, and was made obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent euen to the death: yet all the while of his seruice, he remained a Lord in himselfe, and by his seruice became the Lord of his Church, &amp; redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ones, in a speciall manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Our Sauiour.</hi>] There is no <hi>other name</hi> giuen but this. <hi>Obiect.</hi> The Father and the holy Ghost saue also. <hi>Answ.</hi> Although all outward workes of the Trinitie,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.7.</note> which make for our comfort and saluation, are vndeuided, as beeing one, and coworking; yet in performing them, we must obserue an order among them: the Father is the fountaine from whom, the Sonne for whom as a meritorious cause, the holy Ghost by whom we communicate of all blessings: so all three saue, but the Father
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18792:43"/>
by sending the Sonne, the Sonne by paying the ransome, the holy Ghost by applying it: so all create, redeeme, sanctifie: yet obseruing this order and manner of working; when the workes are more personally attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto them, creation is ascribed to the Father, not excluding the sonne, and holy Ghost, redemption to the Sonne, and sanctification to the holy Ghost. Which order is rather here to be obserued, because our Apostle expresseth it in his prayer for these graces, when he craueth them both from the Father and the Sonne, not excluding the holy Ghost: whereby we are taught, how to direct our suits also, namely, that the Father, by the Spirit, through his Sonne our Lord Iesus Christ would enrich vs with grace, and the fruits of it. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But there are other sauiours; as Ioshua, and other Iudges, and Kings: yea, Prophets, and Ministers,<note place="margin">Men called Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours 3. waies.</note> are called sauiours. <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. These all were men, and as men saued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But of Christ it is said, <hi>Behold our God, he shall saue vs.</hi> 2. Some of them, as Iudges, were typicall sauiours, sauing, 1. the bodies, 2. of one people the Iewes, 3. from temporall death and oppression; but Christ saueth the bodies and soules of all beleeuing Iewes, and Gentiles, from hell and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 3. Others, as Prophets, and Ministers, are onely ministeriall and instrumentall sauiours, not properly: onely for sundrie causes the worke of the efficient, is ascribed to the instrument, whom the Lord vseth in publishing this saluation: but Christ alone saueth by meriting and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the price, and bringing home to the heart this redemption. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But we haue yet sinne in vs, and therefore are not saued from it. <hi>Answ.</hi> We are saued euen for the present, from the wrath and poyson of it in part, &amp; for euer from the damnation of it, so as the strength of it is gone.</p>
               <p>This is the meaning of this salutation, which beeing a prayer, sheweth vs, both of what kinde our salutations ought to be, in which we would testifie our loue, to whom we write, namely, to wish them the best bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings: as also in what manner; not sending formall salutations without feeling, abstracting curtesie from conscience: but they must proceede from a religious and reuerent affection of the heart: for euery prayer ought to come from the heart, and as hauing God himselfe a witnes of the truth of the spirit in such wishes; as Rom. 1.9. and Phil. 1.8.9.</p>
               <p>Now the principall lessons in this prayer are two:
<list>
                     <item>1. That the free and euerlasting grace of God in Christ, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all blessings spirituall and temporall.</item>

and condition: Deut. 7.7. <hi>The Lord set his loue vpon you, and chose you, not because you were moe in number, for you were the fewest, but because he loued you:</hi> &amp;, cap. 9.4.6. <hi>Say not in thine heart, because of my righteousnes, the Lord hath giuen me this good land: for thou art a stiffnecked people:</hi> and were they not yet further off from meriting and procuring to themselues spirituall blessings, and that heauenly Canaan, and euerlasting rest prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the people of God? and if we consider our condition, before this grace be reueiled and shine vpon vs, are not we in our blood, when the Lord first couereth vs with his skirts? and no eie but his pitieth vs: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs with Adam out of our thickets, when we runne from him, and are hiding our selues, then finding vs, when we would not be found.</p>
               <p>

Besides, if our iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication &amp; saluation were partly by grace, &amp; partly by our own dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; preparations; grace were not euery way grace, &amp; consequently no grace at all. The Prophet Hosee sheweth the nearest reason that we can reach vnto of this grace of God;<note place="margin">Hose. 14.5.</note> I will loue them <hi>freely:</hi> but wherfore? not for any disposition or desert in them, but <hi>because my wrath is turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> If we be about the doing of any good, it is not I, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>the grace of God in me,</hi> that doth it: for as it was in the building of the second Temple, Zerubbabel who represented Christ, must lay <hi>the highest stone of the</hi> building,<note place="margin">Zach 4.6.</note> notwithstanding the <hi>high mountaines,</hi> that is, the strong opposition of the enemies: and this he must doe, not <hi>by armie or strength, but by his spirit:</hi> so in this liuing Temple (which we are) the Lord himselfe both foundeth the lowest, and laieth the higest stone, not by our arme or strength; nay we rather haue mountaines of impediments to hinder this greate worke, and our selues are the greatest enemies to our owne building; but by the power of his spirit, which maketh all plaine before him. Yea further, whereas the abstaining from the least e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, is good, though the least good; euen this is denied to our power, and laid out of our owne reach, and must be giuen vs from the father of lights. Let the Papists therefore sacrifice to their owne nets, and burne incense to their yarne, as though their owne hand had made them rich, and their owne arme happie: but let vs labour to see, 1. how woefull creatures we are by nature, and be ashamed of our selues, and sinnes: 2. flie to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite

grace and mercie, which is the liuing fountaine of our welfare: 3. returne the praise and honour of all our good, to the right author of it: which is the right vse and end of all the doctrine of free election, iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vocation, and saluation: all which are noted by Paul, to tend <hi>to the praise of the glorie of his grace</hi>; yea and of all the Gospel, which is to stop euery mouth, and cause all that would finde saluation and happines,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.6.</note> to seeke, and finde it onely in God, and the riches of his grace.</p>

Many say, who will shew vs any good, and can reioyce when their corne, and wine, and oile is encreased: but to say, <hi>Lord lift thou vpon vs the light of thy countenance,</hi> is the voice of the smallest number. Thus it is too plaine that the <hi>spirit of</hi> prayer and supplication hath no delight in the most; who can heartily pray for daily bread, for health, for wealth in the want of them; but neglect the fountaine which is Gods grace, and mercie in Christ: and no otherwise doe they craue for others, then they haue done for themselues: in these distempered prayers resembling sicke persons, both in that they haue more sence and griefe for the fits of their sicknesse, then for the cause: as also that they most desire that which standeth with the feeding of the vicious humor, which should rather be purged and expelled. The spirit of God is the spirit of wisedom, and directeth to a more compendious way of preuailing with God; and so teacheth vs to aske, as that we obtaine farre more then we haue asked, or that which is farre better.</p>

                  <hi>Verse. 5.</hi> For this cause left I thee in Creta, that thou shouldest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew to redresse the things that remaine, and shouldest ordaine el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in euery citie, as I appointed thee.</q>
               <p>Now we come to the second part of this Epistle, which containeth the <hi>narration,</hi> and the subiect matter of it. Wherein partly to authorize <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> and partly to encourage him: 1. the Apostle maketh a declaration of the place and dutie to which <hi>Titus</hi> was destinated, and vnto which he was incited, from the finall cause [<hi>beeing therefore left in Creta.</hi>] 2. he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him direction, how to carrie himselfe in it.</p>
               <p>The dutie enioyned <hi>Titus,</hi> is twofold. 1. Generall, <hi>to correct things that remaine.</hi> 2. Speciall, <hi>to ordaine elders,</hi> that is, to institute Ministers, and Pastors, and that <hi>in euery Citie:</hi> that is, where there was a bodie of people to set them ouer.</p>
               <p>The direction is also twofold. 1. more generall, <hi>As I commanded thee.</hi> 2. more speciall, <hi>If any be vnreprooueable, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before we come to speake of the 2. branches of <hi>Titus</hi> his dutie; we are to consider the entrance thereto, in these words, <hi>For this cause I left thee in Creta:</hi> which words offer vnto vs some worthy considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Note.</hi> That the Apostle himselfe continued not long in Creta after there appeared an outward face of a Church, but went elsewhere to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to the faith; wherein his faithfulnesse appeared, in the diligent performance of his owne administration: for the office of the Apostle was to plant Churches, and to leaue them to others to water: to found the house of God, as master builders, but other labourers must build it vp: to trauell in birth till the Churches of God were formed, but left them to others to bring vp;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.10. Matth. 28.19.</note> to make Disciples, but others must confirme them.</p>
               <p>Which lets vs see the difference betweene the Apostle, and the Pastor. The former is as the Lords leiftenant to set Christ in the possession of his kingdome;<note place="margin">The difference betweene an Apostle, and a Pastor.</note> the latter is as a deputie to keepe him in possession. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:18792:46"/>
gathereth a flocke of the wild beasts of the forrest, the Pastor must staie to feed, and attend vpon that flocke: the Apostle must change his place vpon immediate commandement; the Pastor may not: for he must be readie at all assaies to <hi>feed</hi> the flocke depending vpon him, 1. Pet. 5. he must alwaies present himselfe as a <hi>patterne</hi> and example vnto it, 1. Tim. 4.12. except we will say that the ordinarie Ministerie of the Gospel, is not as straitly bound to dutie, as the ordinarie Minister of the law: for the Priests must alwaies be readie in the Temple to answer all doubts, as <hi>Ely,</hi> 1. Sam. 1.9. to keepe in the holy fire, and lights; to receiue all sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and oblations, to renew the bread before the Lord: yea and for this end was that institution, that the Priests might not dwell farre from the Temple, but their houses were builded close to it, according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne of Dauid, 1. Chro. 28.13.</p>
               <p>Yet so, as by the Churches call, a Pastor whose gifts are found fit for such a purpose, may be sent from his place (if in the interim it be sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided for) either to gather a Church, or reduce such as haue gone astraie. See 2. Chron. 17.7.9.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Note.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> departing from Creta, leaueth them not at sixe &amp; seauens, neither neglecteth the busines, and worke he had in his hands;<note place="margin">Euery child of God must wish and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour that the Lords work goe forward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euery where.</note> but leaueth <hi>Titus</hi> to perfect that which he had begunne. Herein teaching vs, that euery man whome the Lord hath called to doe good in his Church, and whose conscience stirreth vp his care; must finde in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe this holy desire, that the Lords plow be euer followed: his building euer reared: his worke euer furthered by all, but especially so farre as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his power by his owne meanes; and that both in the places abroad, as also where he liueth. <hi>Paul</hi> careth not onely for the Churches where he becommeth, but where he hath beene; and this was the ground why he left Timothie at Ephesus, 1. Tim. 1.3. and Titus here at Creta, vpon which occasion he wrote both these Epistles. So should euery man in his place, whom God honoureth to be the beginning of any good thing imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that worthy <hi>Nehemiah</hi> in his care, <hi>Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber me, O God,</hi>

In like manner, if a man be called from his place, so as he must leaue it to another, his care must be, that it be furnished with a fit man.

Memorable is the speach and practise of Moses, who when the Lord had bid him goe vp into the Mount, and see the land, and then die: he neglecteth himselfe, and forgetteth after a sort, his owne present death, and breaketh out into prayer for the people: <hi>O Lord God of spirits,

               <p>Fearefully sinne they against this example, who while they craple and couple liuings together, that they may fill their owne bellies, and haue there portion in the fleece and fat, neither staie themselues, to teach as they ought, nor yet leaue any Titus behind them (of whose sufficiencie we heard before) to redresse things that remaine: but offer the sheepe of Christ to the wolfe, and sell soules for peeces of siluer, and morsells of bread.

The Minister must propound before him his end, which is the <hi>gathering together</hi> of the Saints; hence a necessitie is imposed vpon him,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.12.</note> and wo to him that not ayming at this end, preacheth not the Gospel.

How doth the Lord vrge his people to the pure vse of his holy ordinance of marriage, otherwise then from the three ends of it. 1. in that thence they must expect an holy seed: 2. for auoyding of fornication: 3. from the comfort of a fit helpe, and a comfortable compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, Mal. 2.14. compared with 1.

               <p>And further from hence, let him that would take a compendious way, to entertaine the Ministerie, alwaies behold with one eie, the end of it: for otherwise it will often seeme harsh, and intolerable: flesh willingly abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not the handling of the Minister: oh no, meddle not with mine eies, my deere and tender sinnes: the bodie abideth not the pulling out of eies, or cutting off of hands and feete: so as let the Minister come to saw or feare a desperate member, there is such reluctation and opposition, as maketh a whole parish too little for the Minister and people. The cause of all this is, they consider not this end of the Ministerie. If they could thus reason; for this end is this man set here, to be the watchman ouer the house of Israel, to sound a trumpet against the sinnes of Iudah, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse our disorder, to plant Gods graces amongst vs, to beate downe sinne, superstition, ignorance, profanesse; then should we not here such gracelesse speaches, as Corah and his companie vtter against Moses the man of God; Who made him a controller? he is very busie to meddle with such and such things, which concerne him not; come let vs smite him with the tongue: and much a doe is there to keepe Zidkiahs fist from Michaes face. Whereas if they could thinke them the Ministers of God <hi>for their wealth,</hi> (as the Apostle speaketh of the Magistrate) or if they could conceiue them to haue the watch of their soules committed vnto them: either of these arguments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the iudgement of the spirit of God, would be strong inough, to enforce reuerence vnto their persons, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto their doctrine.</p>

Chron. 31. who gathered all Israel to breake downe altars, cut down groues, cast downe the high places; and then made the diuisions of the Priests and Leuites, according to their ministerie in the Temple. Of Iosiah, see c. 34.1. <hi>ad</hi> 8. Yea, Iesus Christ the wisdome of his father, could not, nor did establish any thing vntill in his first sermon he had reformed the grosse expositions, and Pharisaicall glosses, whereby they had corrupted the law: teaching the same truth with our Apostle, that the redressing of disorders is but a way and meanes of planting the Lords ordinances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> We pray that Gods kingdome may come euerie where, and that the Lords ordinances onely may take place in his Church; now that this may be effected, we must also pray, that he would ouerthrowe the man of sinne, and disperse the mists of darkenes in all countryes, which trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the shining brightnesse of the Gospel: that the whole bondwoman may be cast out, which standeth against the right of the right heire; that the head and tayle of Antichrist may be cut off, and that no stumpe of Dagon may remaine to keepe out the institutions of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For the former of these two: It will first be asked, what power Titus had to controle disorders in this Iland; and if he had any, whether it did not derogate from the power of the ciuill Magistrates? <hi>Ans.</hi> Titus had a ministeriall power, which no more derogated from the soueraigne power of the Magistrate; then if the Gospel were now established in it againe, would it weaken the power of the Venetians,<note place="margin">Ministeriall power weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not, but st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reason is, because the power of the word and sword of the

magistrate and Minister, are of a diuerse nature: for although both of them haue their power from God; and one generall scope, which is the good of men; yet in them is it farre different. 1. In their <hi>obiect.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Difference of these two in 3. things.</note> The one hath power ouer all men, and all the things of men.

                  </gap>d, the other onely may execute them. 2. In their <hi>manner</hi> of commanding. The ciuill power may command obedience to it selfe in it owne name, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hauing vnder God, the power in himselfe: but the ecclesiasticall or mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steriall power, is not in the person of the Minister, but in Christ, neither can he command obedience to himselfe, but vnto Christ, nor come in his owne name, but in Christs: as being (not his Leiftenant as the Magistrate, nor his vicar, for as he is Mediator he hath not any, but) his Minister on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. 2. the ciuill power may absolutely compell the outward man, but the ministeriall can onely perswade and exhort. 3. In their <hi>meanes</hi> of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing. The ciuill hath the vse of the sword, to arrest, imprison, make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> warre, execute the sentence of death vpon malefactors: the ministeriall can only either by admonition cure, or excommunication cast out the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate offenders, and esteeme them as Publicans and heathens. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of this warfare are spirituall, as doctrine, exhortation, admonition, reproofe, good life, &amp;c. This latter then while Titus exercised, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached not vpon the ciuill Magistrates power, nor weakened, but strengthened it. Christ himselfe although the rightful King of the Iewes, would not so much as devide an inheritance; but subiected himselfe to all tributes, and hard sentences; and yet all his life and death was nothing else, but the establishing of his owne scepter: one of these powers is the ornament, and muniment of the other: and therefore let none commit Moses and Aaron together, but esteeme it as a sweet vnion when Dauid and God consult together: Iehoiadab and Ioash; and when Iosiah stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with Huldas the Prophetesse: and for a man to oppose the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Christ, with this humane ordinance, is to set the bodie and soule together by the eares. Not therefore the faithfull Ministers of Christ, but such as stand with the beast and his ordinances, and with the Antichrist of Rome, are enemies vnto magistracie, and weakeners of the power of Princes, while they teach, that all Ecclesiasticall persons are to be exempted from the ciuill power; while they binde their hands, in freeing their subiects from all obedience, euen in ciuill commands, and while they highly dishonour them, in giuing the Pope a power ouer them, to set them vp, and depose them at his pleasure, and that in thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which is a ground of sundrie considerations:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Comites Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolorum.</note>First, it noteth what was the speciall worke of an Euangelist; namely, that beeing the companions of the Apostles, they were to bring on the work of the Lord to perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, both by establishing that foundation they had laid, &amp; building on further by their direction, where they left off. The office was middle betweene the Apostle and the Pastor, the calling was immediate from the Apostles, as the Apostles was immediate fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christ. Where by the name <hi>Euangelists,</hi> are not meant those, who in a straighter sense are so called, as whose helpe the Lord vsed, to write the historie of Christ, and beginnings of Christian religion; two of which were Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and other two their companions, as Marke, and Luke: but those whom we call vice-apostles, or pastors fore-runners, who were in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospel, planting the ministerie, and administration of holy things, to be (as hands and feete) wholly at the Apostles appointment, to call and recall, whether and when they would: such as Timothie, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Marke, Tychichus, seruing now in one Church, now in an other, as the Apostles pleased to vse them; whose office because their calling was from the Apostles, and their worke seruing the founding and rearing of the first Christian Churches, and that by the direction of the Apostles, must needs also cease with the Apostles.</p>
               <p>Secondly, notwithstanding many defects and wants in this Church, and those great ones, and that in constitution, for we see their cities were destitute of elders, and Church gouernours: yet was it neither neglected by Paul, nor separated from by Titus, as a cage of vncleane birds: tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs,<note place="margin">Ex ijs quae in Ecclesia Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiana requirun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur vt partibus suis omnibus constet, solam doctrinam vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri nobis absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te &amp; sine vlla exceptione ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessariam.

How much better were it that the spirit of meekenes should lead into a patient expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when God will further beautifie his Sion, to make her become the praise of the world; then that the spirit of pride should hurrie vs into a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18792:49"/>
rash and peremptorie sentence against euen whole Churches? Did not Paul when the Church of Galatia had reuolted from the Doctrine of free iustification by Christ, yet call and account it a Church still? Let them shew any of our errors of this nature. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But those Churches, and this in Creta was in constituting; but yours after a long time by publike lawes, and common consent, haue refused the lawes of Christ, and that after you haue beene conuinced not to be the Church of Christ. <hi>Ans.</hi> But where is this sufficient conuiction? If it be said in their bookes; the truth is, although they haue pointed vs to some wants, yet none of them haue sufficiently concluded vs no Church at all: and suppose our case were altogether as ill as they would make it, who are they that they should giue vs a bill of diuorcement? If a priuate man erre and offend, must he not first be admonished, and then censured, and iudged? but by whom? by priuate men? no, but by the Church: and shall not a whole Church, or many Churches challenge the same forme of proceeding? and therefore seeing this is not done by our neighbour reformed Churches, which no doubt are the true Churches of God: wee remaine, and shall truely retaine the name of the Church, and people of God; and leaue them to the reforming of their error, both in the matter of their plea, as also in the manner of their proceeding.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we learne hence, that no Church is hastily brought to any perfection. The Apostles themselues the master builders,<note place="margin">No Church can suddenly be brought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: why.</note> with much wisdome, and labour, and often in long time, made not such proceedings; but that, had they not prouided labourers to follow them with a diligent hand, all had beene lost. Much a doe had they to lay the foundation, and prepare matter for the building: and yet this they did, by conuerting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> men to the faith, and baptizing them: but after this to ioyne them into a publike profession of the faith, and constitute visible faces of Churches among them, required more helpe and labour, and for most part was left to the Euangelists. So as the building of Gods house, is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to the finishing of other great buildings: with what labour are stones digged out of the earth? with what difficultie depart they from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall roughnes? what sweate, and strength is spent ere the Mason can smothe them? as it is also with the timber: and yet after all this, they lie a long time here and there scattered a sunder, and make no house, till by the skill of some cunning builder they be aptly laid, and fastened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their frame: So euery mans heart in the naturall roughnes of it, is as hard as a stone; his will and affections like the crabbed and knottie okes, invincibly resisting all the paines of Gods masons, and carpenters, till the finger of God in the Ministerie come, &amp; make plaine, and smoothe way, working in their conuersion. And yet many conuerts (although

they belong to the Catholike Church) make not a particular visible Church, till they ioyne in some publike seruice, and worship of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the lawes, and orders appointed by himselfe. 2.

See we not that almost euery yeare requires a new parliament for the ordering of the commonwealth, that new disorders may be restrained, or redressed by new lawes? doe we see any man let his house, but from yeare to yeare, but he will surely bind the tenant to constant reparation, as often as neede shall require? and yet inconsiderate men can boldly, and bluntly bolt out; they meruaile what men meane that seeke for more, and further reformation, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what they would haue. But alas, are we so neare God as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly be drawen nearer? what meane then the common blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, drunkennes, fornications, riots, Sabbath breakings, &amp; what sinnes not? committed almost without all feare? what meaneth it that such dens and breaches are vnmade vp, but that hogge and swine may enter into the presence chamber of the great King? Let the strong man keepe these holds, we shall see all the earth fit still inough. But easily may we in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular member see the necessitie of daily strengthning the whole against such daily declining, as the first and purest Primitiue Churches planted by the Apostles themselues could not free themselues from; and

For how meete is it that the man of God should be furnished with grauitie and authoritie, that euery way he may be worthie of double honour, both in regard of his person, as also of his gifts, place, and workes sake.

               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Euen there where the Church is planted, is such an absolute necessitie of a setled ministerie, as without it, it is impossible that religion can either thriue or continue: and therefore as the Lord had formerly dealt, in planting his politie among the Iewes, so doth he here in planting Christian religion among the Gentiles: no sooner was his law giuen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Tabernacle, but Aaron and his sonnes, and the tribe of Leui must be sanctified to the office of Priesthood, to attend on holy things, to teach and offer, and performe their seuerall duties according to the Lords direction, else had the former labour beene lost: in like sort in vaine had the publishing of the Gospel beene (although by the Apostles the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues) had they not established such ordinances euerie where, as ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

for the strengthening and proceeding of it: of which the setling of the ministerie, and appointing Pastors ouer people, is the principall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 1. How necessarie was it for the whole administration of God among his people to haue a set place of abode, that they might aske <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> counsell at his mouth? offer sacrifices Ilasticall, and Eucharisticall? put vp their prayers vnto him, and receiue from him instruction and speciall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? and hence was it that the Lord sometimes setled himselfe at Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh, and sometimes his dwelling was in Sion: and no lesse, nay far more full comfort, may we receiue in our assemblies and Bethels, where the Lord as the sunne, by his Ministers, as by so many cleare lights, not onely dispelleth darkenesse and errors in mind and manners, but directeth vs in all our waies we haue to walk: answereth vs in all our doubts, in all our petitions, raiseth vs in our falls, supporteth vs in our weakenesse, and prouoketh vs to cheerefulnesse in all the pathes that are good in his sight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our weakenesse is such that notwithstanding all the benefit of stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ministeries, we are euer recoyling and falling backeward more and more: our bodies are not more prone to pine away for defect of daily foode, then our soules, if by the meanes of the heauenly Manna they be not daily repaired: no eie seeth not the neede of daily directions to guide vs to daily duties; and those which must be often done, we must often be put in mind of.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Experience sheweth, that in such places, where such ministeries be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not setled, we neede not seeke for adulterers, swearers, drunkards, theeues, and lyars, such soyles are fruitfull of such imps, that a man would thinke the old Sodomites were returned from hell: yea the malitious man slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not to sowe these too thicke, in such fields as good seede is cast into continually.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ordinance it selfe speaketh for it owne necessitie: beeing the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> meanes wherby those, who by it are brought to the faith, are also preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in it; the milke whereby babes begotten grow to strong meate, and are led from their infancie, to their full age in Christ.<note place="margin">Eph. 4.11.</note> For we may not alwaies be babes and weaklings, but there is a perfection of Christianity which hereby we must be led vnto, Heb. 6.1. not that any perfection of knowledge or holines can be attained of vs, as Anabaptists foolishly dreame; but partly in respect of that further degree which we ought e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to contend vnto, for in the schoole of Christ we may waxe olde dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learning, and the greatest scholler shall yet be farre from perfection: and partly comparatiuely, men of grace and knowledge may be called perfect, and haue attained a further degree of perfection, then such as are rude and ignorant, subiect to be carried about with euery winde, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18792:53"/>
are not yet gotten out of the elements of religion: a man is said to be of perfect wisedome, strength, and other gifts of bodie and minde in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of a child, or one not come to mans estate; a Master of Arts may be called a perfect scholler in respect of a schooleboy: and to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Christianitie are we led by meanes of this ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Euery man sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> To reprehend such as conceit themselues, that when they haue gotten a smattring of knowledge, they must needs haue faith also, and afterward need no Ministerie nor sermons: but marke where the life of God is, it will make the soule craue the daily bread, as the naturall life doth the bodie: neither seeth that man any thing of God, and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his kingdome as he ought, that presumeth of his knowledge so farre, as that when he hath begunne to build, and laid a foundation, like the foole giueth ouer, and neuer commeth to laie the roofe. Perfection of true knowledge is the sight, and sence of imperfection, and religion in the heart, espieth daily wants and decaies in the soule: and repaireth to the ordinarie Ministeries, for the daily repairing of them. Which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances whosoeuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptuously forsake, great schollers they may be, but they were neuer good men.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Let vs reioyce, that the Lord hath so liberally supplyed vs in this necessitie, and testifie our thankefulnesse in diligence and subiection vnder the setled ministerie, that our iudgements, wills, and affections may be setled in the truth: for to the obseruer it will appeare, that such for most part are wauering and variable, who content themselues with a variable ministerie, now hearing one, now another, now here, now there, without fixing themselues to some one. As for such as vnder a setled mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie come and goe at their pleasure, now they heare one Sermon, then another, slipping in and out as they list, to them I say, litle is their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, great is their sinne, and manifest is their ficklenesse and inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in their religion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Pray that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in want hereof may be supplied.</note>3. Hence is a ground of petition that God would place Pastors in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie congregation, that his kingdome might come euerie where, that euerie candlesticke might carie a burning and a shining light: seeing we see here that it is Gods ordinance, that so it should be. And the greater the haruest is, the more ought we to apply the Lord of it, that he would thrust forth labourers into his haruest, remoouing whatsoeuer impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he seeth to hinder such a blessed and glorious worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As I appointed thee</hi>] After that the Apostle had declared Titus his place and dutie; he commeth to the second point, namely, his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction therein: not giuing him leaue to adde any thing of his owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, or alter any thing which Paul himselfe had done; but bindeth his hands from doing, or vndoing any thing, in his whole administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

The Church is the house of God, and must not be ruled by mans inventions, but by the direction of the great housekeeper: and seeing the father hath committed all the gouernement of it to his Sonne, who hath purchased it with his blood: the charge and burden of it now lieth vpon his shoulders, and his prerogatiue it is to giue laws and orders, and by his voice to rule the house of Iacob. The whole Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to the verie pinnes, must be framed according to the patterne; and yet that was a mooueable in comparison of our most stable admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, which shall continue to the ende of he world: and the Lord in describing the parts thereof seuerally, still remitteth them to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, to the patterne, and forme shewed in the mount: See Exod. 25.9.26.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> cap. 27.8, &amp;c. twise repeated in so many words, Act. 7.44.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Let the bold Papists come and say one by one, I haue a vision, or I haue a dreame,<note place="margin">No traditions or impositions vnder Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call authoritie warrantable.</note> I haue found out this or that tradition concerning pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for the dead, fasts, or feasts, confirmed by some diabolicall delusions: let them pretend their rules of perfection, standing in the obseruation of Euangelicall counsels, such as concerne chastitie, voluntarie pouertie, &amp;c. let them obtrude to vs the Church, the Church, and the Church must be heard; and hereby thrust vpon vs, what lawes they list, for the holding and keeping of life in that beast of Rome: We say to all these things, that if any of them stand by Apostolicall authoritie, we will receiue all such traditions; but if they be vnder Apostolicall power, who are they? or what haue we to deale with them, or they with vs? seeing that neither an Euangelist may take vpon him, nor we take from him any impositions vnder Apostolicall authoritie. <hi>Obiect.</hi> They alleadge Luk. 10. <hi>He that despiseth you, despiseth me.

And things strangled were before the Apostles times prohibited for the former reason, least blood not let out should be eaten. Which two latter, although their nature were changed and free in themselues after Christ: yet the Apostle in the time of gathering the Church of the Iewes and Gentiles, because he would haue no bones of dissention cast betweene them, and auoide the scandall; for a time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, and forbore to abrogate them: but would haue them for the time retained without all opinion of worship, necessitie, and much lesse of merit: by all which bonds the Papists would fasten vpon vs all their humane inventions: so that all their allegations are too weake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooue vs from this hold, so immooueably grounded vpon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>

Our Apostle here in the first place, and more largely insisteth vpon the life of him that is to be chosen, and afterwards in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> words requireth his fitnes for doctrine: and so in his charge to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie that he should laie hands on no man rashly,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.22.24.</note> addeth, that some mens sinnes goe before hand, and some mens sinnes follow after iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: as though he had said more largely, Vse all the circumspection thou canst, yet some hypocrites will creepe into the Ministerie: some are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly profane, and such close sinners thou canst not discerne, till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they manifest themselues: others are open sinners, of which thou maiest iudge aright: these latter thou art to hinder; the former reclaime, or seasonably remooue, and so salue vp the sore againe: for how requisite is it, that such a sweete and sauorie doctrine, should be matched with a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sweet and sauorie Christian conuersation? 2. That such an high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is to be graced with an vnreprooueable life, was typified in the law sundrie waies, as after we shall more clearely see in the positiue vertues required: especially in that prohibition, that none of Aarons sonnes, or seed, that had any blemish in him, might once presse to offer before the Lord,<note place="margin">Leuit. 21.17.</note> neither come neere the vaile, nor stand by the Altar. 3. A scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and obnoxious person, shall neuer do good in his calling. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the things of Christ, as the Word, Sacraments, and Doctrine, depend not vpon the person of the Minister, but on the ordinance of Christ; neither in themselues are the worse in bad mens hands; no more then a true mans peece of gold in the hand of a theife: yet by our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in such a mans hand, they are weaker to vs: and although no man can answer, or warrant the refusing of pure doctrine (which is not to be had in respect of persons) for the spotted life of the Minister, who while he sitteth in Moses chaire (be he Pharisie, be he hypocrite) must be heard; yet can it not be, but that the wickednes of Helies sonnes, will make the people abhorre the offerings of the Lord: which what a greiuous sinne it was before the Lord, see 1. Sam. 2.17. Againe, how can he benefit his people, whose hands are bound, whose mouth is shut, and cannot vtter the truth, without continuall galling and sentencing of himselfe? and when euery scoffer shall be readie to say to him; <hi>art thou become weake like one of vs?</hi>

It is a most dangerous condition to himselfe to be a good teacher of a bad life:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.7.</note> for such a one is in the <hi>snare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the deuill,</hi> that is, when he seeth his life still more and more exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and himselfe more despised euery day then other (for it is iust with God, that with the wicked should be reproch) then he beginnes to grow so bold, and impudent, as that he casts off all shame, and care, and as one desperate and hardened in sinne, prostituteth himselfe remorselesly vnto all lewdnes and vngodly conuersation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.

And therefore he will play at small game ere he sit out. If he cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Ministerie, he can disgrace it: If he cannot discontinue it, he can continue a deuill still: that is, both an aduersarie, and an accuser of it: for either Christs Disciples wash not, or fast not; or Christ himselfe is a good companion; or Iohn Baptist is too austere and precise; or some natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie (as Elishaes bald pate) shall be cast as a rub in the way to make the Doctrine lesse welcome.

                  </gap>eard what is generally required of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Minister that he be <hi>vnblameable:</hi> Now we are with the Apostle, to descend to those priuate vertues which concerne his economicall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration. And those in this verse are two; the former concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in preseruing his owne chastitie: the latter respecteth the persons within his family, namely, his children, ouer whom he is to exercise Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian authoritie, gouerning them as a father, who is a Minister: framing them to dutie towards God, and himselfe, and trayning them vp careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the doctrine both of faith and good manners. For 1. concerning their religion, it is required that they be <hi>faithfull children.</hi> 2. For their manners they must be, 1. <hi>temperate,</hi> 2. <hi>obedient.</hi> And both of these declared in their contraries whereof they must be free: as 1. they must not be <hi>slandred of riot,</hi> which is a lauish wasting, and a needles spending of goods. 2. Not <hi>disobedient,</hi> but such as will endure the yoke. These two vertues must especially be exercised of euery one that is to be a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Christ: the former of which beautifieth his owne person; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter graceth his family; and both of them adorne his calling and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>To vnderstand the former aright, we must first remooue the false inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations: and 2. propound and establish the true sense, and then come vnto the doctrines. And first where the Apostle requireth that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster be the husband of one wife: the Papists interpret it most ridiculously in an allegorie, affirming that Pauls meaning is, that an Elder must haue but one wife, and that must be his Church. But the scope of the place is not to answer the question, whether one minister may haue two Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or no; but what a one he ought to be for the gouernement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his, that is to be set euer any people. 2. What meaneth it that this husband must haue faithfull children; if he may not haue a wise other then the Church? If it be said, that by these children must be meant the faithfull and the children of God begotten in the Church: I answer, that the same Apostle to Timothie, cutteth the sinewes of all such cauills: where he expoundeth the same precept necessarily to be meant litterally, and not in this allegorie; by the reason of it annexed,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>for if he cannot go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his owne house, how shall he gouerne the house of God</hi>?</p>
               <p>Secondly, others say, he must be the husband of one wife onely, and that after the first he may not haue a second. Which opinion <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> extended to all sorts of men: the Grecians after restrained it to the Clergie: and the Romanists were readie inough to take it vp, and
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18792:57"/>
stil reserue it among the rest of their rubbish. But that also is as grosse and false exposition. For 1. he that marrieth a second wife after the decease of the first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (if he keepe himselfe faithfully vnto her,) is still but the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife, seeing the lawe of the former is by God dissolued.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a generall commandement, that if the brother die without children,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.5.</note> his next brother was to marrie his brothers widow, and raise vp seed vnto him. Now as in the other tribes, so doubtlesse happened it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Leuites, and therefore the Leuite although a widower, was to marrie his brothers wife. <hi>Obiect.</hi> If it be here said, that we now are in precepts deliuered to Ministers of the newe Testament; and are not to square our selues vnto that speciall administration of the old: I answer, that the generall precepts of the newe Testament affirme no lesse: as, He that cannot containe, let him marrie: and to all widowes the Apostle gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth leaue to marrie,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.39.</note> so in the Lord: and that that is of generall &amp; perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall equitie to men, as well as women, and to all sorts of men, as to one kind, is plaine by Rom. 7.3. The woman if the husband be dead, is free from the law of the man, so as <hi>she is not an adulterer if shee take another man.</hi> To which truth many of the fathers accord.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, an other sleight of the Papists must be auoided, who haue thus corrupted it: <hi>If any haue beene the husband of one wife,</hi> and now be not, he may be a minister: but the spirit of God changeth no tenses here, and the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, must be supplyed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>Lastly, neither must it be vnderstood, so as the Minister must of necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be the husband of one wife, and may not liue single: for though all cannot receiue Christs speach concerning continencie, yet some there are to whom it is giuen,<note place="margin">Matth. 19.11, 12.</note> and to them his counsell is, <hi>he that is able to receiue this, let him receiue it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the true meaning is, that the minister ought to be content with one wife at once, and not defile himselfe by polygamie: and this precept was not without ground: for among both Iewes and Gentiles, the custome of polygamie had so farre preuailed, that it was become as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, to marrie many wiues at once: now the Apostle perceiuing that custome, had taken away the sense of the sinne, and placing Titus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse things amisse, he beginneth at this great enormitie, and prohibiteth him to choose such into office in the Church, as had giuen such note of an inordinate life. <hi>Quest.</hi> But was it lawfull for other men to haue more wiues then one at once, seeing the precept is giuen onely to ministers? <hi>Ans.</hi> No: and yet the minister here onely inhibited directly, as whom he dealeth with: but the people herein also, so farre as his example was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to their imitation, in the obseruation of the whole law of God. For here we may fitly obserue these 2. rules for our directions. 1. That
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18792:57"/>
all the vertues which are required of common Christians, must be much more in the minister, as euerie thing in the sanctuarie, was double to that which was common, as the cubit, the shekel of the sanctuarie. 2. That all the morall vertues required and expressed in the life of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, must be imitated of common Christians; who must follow him so farre as he followes Christ: and in his generall dutie see their owne; both of them hauing but one way to heauen.

Againe, because the Apostle speaketh of some carnal persons matched together, that they regard the things of the world, and the pleasing one of another aboue the pleasing of God: can any shewe of argument evince, that therefore either marriage is vnholy, or is of any sort of men to be disavowed? for that the place must be so vnderstood, is euident: else what shall we think of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, Elcanah and Annah, Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Elizabeth, Aquilla and Priscilla: shall we thinke that these faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

couples cared not for the things of god? and if they did, why cannot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beleeuers? and if mariage were such an enemie to prayer, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of pietie in it selfe, as they would make it, why are all Christians commanded to <hi>pray</hi> continually? to possesse their <hi>vessels in holinesse,</hi> and honour? how is it that we reade of families called <hi>Churches?</hi> how could any man say, <hi>I and my house will serue the Lord?</hi> how doth the wise man say, that by a wise woman the house is <hi>built vp?</hi> And indeede where God giueth such a one, a man is freed from many distractions, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his wife a fit <hi>helpe</hi> made vnto him; whereas it was not good for him to be alone. Finally, as all married persons neglect not; so all single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons seeke not the things of God: for we reade of many foolish vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, where the Apostle affirmeth it to be <hi>good</hi> to abide single, either in virginitie or widowhead; and not to giue the daughter in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, &amp;c. and that onely in regard of the present times; shall no time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford lawfulnes for some sort of men to marie? And that those precepts are so to be vnderstood, the Apostle himselfe expresseth: for if <hi>good</hi> were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to euill of sinne; then had the Apostle contradicted himselfe, when he said, that he that marrieth (not only doth not euill) but doth <hi>well:</hi> but good is opposed to that which is incommodious, or inexpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: so is the word also vsed Matth. 19.10. and this is that the Apostle saith, it is not <hi>good</hi> for the present necessitie: that is, it is not conducible,<note place="margin">

The like precept was giuen vpon the like occasion to the Iewes, that they <hi>should not marrie, nor get children:</hi> Why?<note place="margin">Ierem. 16.</note> some Papist would hence affirme, because marriage is an vncleane thing, and a sinne: No: but in regard of those most heauie times of warre, exile, and captiuitie; wherein they should haue lesse sorrow and greefe who had none to care for but themselues: and this is the reason expressed by the Apostle, where he saith, that such as are married <hi>shall haue sorrow in the flesh: vers.</hi> 28.</p>
               <p>Many more places they abuse, but these are the chiefe.

Tim. 3.12. the euidence of which two places collated, none but such as are willingly blind can resist: which with some other places haue so pressed them, as that they haue beene driuen to, and from many poore shifts. As 1. they alleadge against this place, that in the Apostles daies indeed while the Church was rude and defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, there were fewer precepts giuen, and there beeing but few conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

Others seeking to elude this text say, that the Church indeed had power then to appoint what constitutions she pleased, and saw fittest for her present condition, and that this power she still retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth: so as looke as the Master of a family hath it in his power to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine none but single men seruants in his family; the like power hath the Church if she please, to admit none into this seruice or Ministery but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle persons. <hi>Ans.</hi> But to follow them also into that starting hole: 1. They must prooue their Church to be this family of Christ: and the Pope to be the master of this familie. 2. Let them improoue that the Master of this familie is the Lord Iesus, who hath alreadie prescribed a certaine forme, by which he will haue his Ministers chosen: and for the vse of the Church to the ende of the world hath recorded it in the Scriptures, of which this is a speciall branch, <hi>if any be the husband of one wife.</hi> 3. Others haue found out another shift: namely, that he who now is the husband of one wife and hath children too, may be chosen: but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith not, that after one is made a priest, he may marrie a wife: so that if the worst fall, the vow of chastitie at the consecration of a priest shall still stand in force. <hi>Ans.</hi> But what a miserable shift is this? for can it be lawfull for a married man to be a Minister; and not for a Minister to be a married man. It is all one as if an Anabaptist should thus reason; He that is now a Magistrate, may lawfully vse his Magistracie; but yet it is not lawfull for any man to become a Magistrate: or when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to feare God, a man might thus reason: God bids him that hath his feare exercise it; but yet he enioynes vs not to vse the meanes to come by it.

shall be one flesh. In which first institution are two grounds ouerturning this sinne. 1. Gods action of creating one man, and one woman, and no moe. 2. His iniunction and strait charge to all posteritie, that one man should cleaue to one wife, who must be his wife and no stranger; and not to many wiues at once: so as it is against the law of nature, and the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord by Moses forbiddeth it, Leu. 18.18. Thou shalt not <hi>take one woman to her sister:</hi> that is, thou shalt not take one woman to another, to make them as sisters; for in the 16. verse the marriage of the wiues sister is forbidden by proportion euen in monogamie: no not after the sisters death, seeing consanguinitie and affinitie agree in duration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like. Besides that the phrase in Hebrew is commonly so vsed: as Gen. 26.31. Exod. 26.3. and the reason of the precept is, that such a one must not be taken to <hi>greeue</hi> the other, and seemeth properly to be meant of wiues in polygamie,<note place="margin">aemulae.

               <p n="3">3. The Prophets themselues reprooue it vpon the ground of the first institution, Mal. 2.15. God made but one woman at first: and why but one? not that he wanted spirit, for he had <hi>abundance</hi>; but because he <hi>sought a godly seede:</hi> wherefore keepe your selues in your spirit, and let no man transgresse against the wife of his youth: where the Prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it to be not onely against the first institution, but wisheth all poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie carefully to avoide it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ himselfe taxeth it as a violencing of the first institution, Mat. 19.4.5.

Prophets, and Christ call men, not to example, but to the rule of the first institution. 2. We neuer reade of any of them (no not the best) well ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it: but what fruit had it betweene Hadah and Sillah at first, it still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: For what molestation brought it euen to good men? what a stirre had Abraham to compose Sarah and Hagar to peace; and in their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Isaac and Ismael, what a number of sparkles of contention were kindled? what heart-griefe was it to Iacob to see such daily emulation betweene Leah and Rahel? and what other was the fruit of their enuie, but an occasion further to draw him into sinne, in taking first one of their maids, and then anothers, and all to please both; to say nothing of the doe he had doubtlesse about their children. When Moses speaketh of Esaus 2. wiues, he added, they were an heart griefe to Isaac and Rebecca, Gen. 26.35. when the Scripture speaketh of Gideons 70. sonnes begotten of his owne bodie, with the reason, for he had many <hi>wiues,</hi> Iud. 8.30. the very next chapter sheweth how Abimelech slewe all these 70. sonnes on one stone, saue Iotham. How was Elcanah troubled to satisfie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence his wife Hannah, for the reproach wherewith <hi>Peninnah her aduersarie vexed</hi> her sore?

                  <note place="margin">1. king 11.1.</note> which sinne brought him to all the wickednesse that was found in his hands. 3. Whereas it is said that the Patriarks were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried hereunto not by fleshly lust, but in desire of increase of that holy seede which was in that one people: I answer, we may so religiously and charitably conceiue of them, and in that regard of the Lords more speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all indulgence and connivence, yet can it not prooue lawfull; it may make it in them a lesse euill, but not no fault: for if it had beene lawfull for the fathers in regard of multiplying the Church, and filling the earth, it had beene much more lawfull and fit for our first Parents, for to them was said, <hi>encrease and multiplie, and fill the earth,</hi> and yet God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it not to them, but it crept into the world against that first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Those words (into thy bosome) indeede often signifie the neere coniunction of marriage: yet here, as in some other places, it signifieth onely, that they were giuen vnder Dauids power and hand, namely, into his subiection; and so it signifieth sometime nothing else, but to haue something with a man: as elsewhere Dauid saith, he bore the reproaches of the mightie <hi>in his bosome</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 89.50.</note> so here Dauid had with him his Master Sauls wiues. 2. If the phrase should not so be here taken, incest would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

in Dauid; seeing the consanguinitie of the wife is in the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the husband as to the wife: and therefore Dauid could no more marrie the stepmothers of his wife Mical, then if they had beene his own. 3. We neuer read that Dauid tooke any of them that were Sauls, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wife vnto himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> Deut. 21.10.15. there are two laws which seeme to fauour it. If a man cast his affection vpon a woman, &amp;c. And if a man haue two wiues, the sonne of the hated, if first borne, shall inherit: and therefore the Lord at least permitteth polygamie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Neither of these two were simply lawfull, nor by the law approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be done: but after it was done, the Lord prouideth a law to auoid the greatest confusion, by tolerating and not dissoluing it: neither is the law vnrighteous herein, seeing it neither approoueth it, nor simply per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth the fact, but (supposing such a disorder may be done) sheweth what is best in such a confusion: so the Lord tolerated the bill of diuorce, but neuer as agreeable to his will: but as obseruing a wise rule of lawgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,<note place="margin">Videndum &amp; quid debeas, &amp; quid possis.</note> that in publike corruptions, speciall euills are then to be tolerated, when they cannot be cured, without a more grieuous publike euill. If it be here said, that the wisedome and power of God might haue amended or cut off such disorders, if he had so conceiued of them: I answer, it is a vaine allegation of men, not considering that the Lord then susteined the person of a lawgiuer to a people whom he chose aboue all the nations of the earth, and not of a Iudge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect. Deut.</hi> 25.5. The law was that a brother dying without issue, the next brother (who perhaps was married) must marrie his brothers wife.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> We shall not neede to answer with some of the learned, that the widow was not to become the wife of the brother suruiuing; but that he was to goe in to her and doe the dutie of a husband in raising seede to his brother: but that it was a speciall commandement, for those times, for certaine persons, and causes. For it was not so generall as some may take it: seeing 1. it must be meant of brethren dwelling together, that is, such as had not planted themselues in some other familie. 2. and not if any brother should die, but if the eldest or first borne, whose name and family must be preserued and reared;<note place="margin">see Matth. 22.</note> both in type and signification of the prerogatiue of Christ, the first borne of many brethren; as also for the preservation of inheritances to families, and by families the politie and ordinances of God amongst his people.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. 3.11.</note> as a <hi>doue without heart:</hi> that is, without vnderstanding of the sence and danger of sinne, through too neere acquaintance with it: he that liueth in a mill (we say) hardly discerneth of sounds, and he that hath beene in a noysome place is stuffed; euen so many a one we see who a while will straine cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie with some sinne, as drunkennes, swearing, riot, wantonnes, gaming: but after the second or third greeting, grow so familiar, as they seeme in their eies to be vertues, at the least necessarie vices. Thus by Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the heart is hardned, and sinne riseth to his regiment: men are of too good nature, too soft, and gentle in the case of this acquaintance, and too loth to offer it the least discourtesie: which is a maine cause why the Prince of the aire, the patron of it, worketh so mightily in the sonnes of disobedience. Let vs therefore apply our hearts to learne the Apostles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>Let no roote of bitternes spring vp to trouble you.</hi> Let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of rooted sinnes, shut the doore of the heart,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.15.</note> that Satan may finde no entrance, whose manner is where he finds the least welcome, to bring in seauen spirits worse then himselfe: and if he can sow a seed if it be no bigger then a graine of mustard seed, he hopeth the next haruest for a great tree of it: sinne seemeth verie reasonable in the beginning, and the tempter saith, is it not a small one? But if the Lords Samsons suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be bound with small cords at the first, which they may thinke to breake from at their pleasure, the enemie will ere they be aware bring on them the two new ropes which will hold them fast inough,<note place="margin">Lex divina cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat de minimis.</note> till they be made a pray for the spoyler.</p>

If with iudgement we waigh examples by the word, I say not, number them, but waigh them in the ballance of the sanctuarie, and trie them by the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Temple. It is verie liable to exception to say, others that are learneder, wiser, greater, grauer, doe so and so, and teach thus and thus: but what if the author be blinded, as euerie man may become a lyar? or what if he will not speake the truth, because he will not be a meddler, or beare the times displeasure? this is such an argument as whereby Christ himselfe should haue beene denyed; for did any of the rulers beleeue in him? Salomon saith, that he that beleeueth hastily is light in his heart: and the reason why examples ouercarrie men into euill, is because they can easilier giue credance vnto the persons of men, then soundly iudge of the actions of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hauing faithfull children</hi>] After a mans owne person, respect must be had of his priuate gouernment and cariage, whom the Lord will haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so neere him, as to serue in holy things before him: and because it is meete that such a one be a man of experience and gouernment, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle would haue him obserued in the priuate ordering of his family, whence an aime may be taken, how he is likely to behaue himselfe in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: that if his fitnes &amp; skil be tried in ruling the lesser and fewer, he may the better be trusted with the greater. For that this is the reason of all this diligent enquirie, is plaine in 1. Tim. 3.5. <hi>For if he cannot gouerne his owne house, how can he gouerne the house of God?</hi> We know that he that is not able to guid a boate, is not able to gouerne a great ship: and he that being married, cannot rule two or three of his own children, so neare him: much lesse can he gouerne a whole Church, men and women, who in comparison of the other are as strangers, and few of them fully knowen vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But in ordering the familie, the first care must be had of the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18792:63"/>
wife; why doth the Apostle vtterly omit that both in this place, and that of Timothie, and in both places only mention the gouernment of the children?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. That care is not excluded. 2. The wife is not so absolutely put vnder gouernment as the children; but are partly gouerners in the familie with the husband; and beeing the wife of a Minister, is presup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be of that grace and wisedome, as that she is able to take vp her owne dutie without such enforcement: and therefore the Apostle thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it sufficient to shew what a one the Ministers wife ought to be, 1. Tim. 3.11. But 3. and especially, because in the gouernment of his children there is a more liuely resemblance, of such duties of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he is to dispense towards the Church. And if we looke a little nearer the words, we shall see that there is nothing enioyned the Minister as a Father of children, which belongeth not vnto him as he is a spirituall father of the children of God. For if we respect matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and doctrine, he must haue <hi>faithfull children:</hi> so in the Church, by diligent teaching of the doctrine of faith, must he bring men vnto the faith: or if we looke at matter of manners, he must do two things: 1. displant vices, and plant the contrarie vertues, that they may <hi>not be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of riotous</hi> or other vngodly courses; which also he must publikely performe in the congregation by the word of exhortation and rebuke. 2. correct and chastise the obstinate and rebellious, that they be not <hi>disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient:</hi> and so as Minister he hath a rod of correction, and the censures of the Church to inflict vpon the obstinate.</p>
               <p>Now in the children of Ministers are required two things: 1. for their <hi>institution,</hi> that they be <hi>faithfull children:</hi> 2. for their <hi>conuersation,</hi> they must not be, 1. <hi>riotous:</hi> 2. <hi>disobedient.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>faithfull</hi> children, are meant such as beeing instructed in the faith, are at least in externall conuersation, answerable to the profession of the faith they make. <hi>Quest.</hi> But is it in the power of any Minister, or man to haue faithfull children: may not a good man and a Minister too, haue most graceles children? <hi>Ans.</hi> There is no man but he is to endeauour that his children may haue euen the grace of faith; which is further laid out of his power then by getting himselfe within the couenant.

As if it be a zealous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, proceeding from pure zeale; it hateth disorder most of all in the owne bosome: it lesse spares sinne in the owne heart, then in the house; and lesse in the house then abroad; and the nearer this serpent approacheth, the more is it feared and fled from. Well knew the Apostle, that he that cannot abide reformation in himselfe, can neuer endure it in another; and he that suffereth vanitie, prophannes, irreligion, and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his house, he can neuer hate these in the house and Church of God: and therfore maketh it a sufficient cause to debarre such a one from the Ministerie.</p>

How dangerous a thing it is for a man vnreformed in himselfe, or family, to take vpon him in publike the reformation of other, we see in Moses himselfe, Exod. 4.24. whom as he was going downe into Egypt to be the guide and deliuerer of the Church, the Lord met in the way to haue slaine him: and the reason was, because his sonne Eliazer was not circumcised, and so his owne house was vnreformed. Whence we may gather, how indignely the Lord taketh it, that any man should come to gouerne his house, that gouerneth not his owne. If Moses himselfe be to plant circumcision among the people, much more must all his owne males be circumsiced: and this must be done, or he shall die for it, before euer he come where he must serue the Church of God.</p>

But this dutie is not discouered in the fruits of it: nay, the practise of our youth without, and on the Sabbath, pointeth with the finger to that rule that is within doores throughout the weeke: and if to profane the Sabbath, sweare, raile, curse, game, contemne superiours, be notes of faithfull children; there is a number such: but if these be things

better beseeming the education of infidels, it is a shame for professors of the Gospel to haue them so rife amongst them. And what other is the next cause of the generall profanenes and dissolutenes of our age; surely, because men content themselues to send their children to Church (and yet some scarse that, and many that for a fashion,) that if they can meete with knowledge of God or religion there, so it is, but they banish it out of their houses. And how infinitely doe we hereby disadvantage our selues? The Papists confesse that all the ground we haue got of them,<note place="margin">Preface of the Catech. of the Councill of Trent.

Whence in generall may be noted, that the carriage of a mans children is a great credit or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to his profession, which as it is true in euery professor, so especially in the Minister: for either the fathers glorie is seene in his gouernement; or the profanenes of the children is the fathers blemish. A wise sonne, saith Salomon, is the crowne of his father: but lewd children are like Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon and Leui,<note place="margin">Gen. 34.30.</note> which make their father (otherwise a good man) stinke among his inhabitants.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18792:66"/>
daughter was accused to be corrupted in their house, and they did not their dutie in watching ouer her virginitie: and accordingly as the matter was found in issue, the father was dealt withall: for if the defamation prooued vntrue, the partie must make the father amends, by giuing him an hundred shekels of siluer: and yet shall he not be troubled with his daughter: and if the daughter was conuicted, she must be brought to <hi>her fathers doore,</hi> and all Israel must stone her: and the reason is added, why she must be there stoned, because she hath wrought follie in Israel, and plaied the whore <hi>in her fathers house,</hi> that is, for transgressing the lawe of God, violating her parents authoritie and credit, and defaming her fathers house.</p>
               <p>But an especiall lawe besides was made for the daughter of a Priest.

The former is alwaies a note of irreligion, disobedience in the child: the latter for most part, a note of indiscretion, and that is remisnes in the father: both of them vnbeseeming common Christians; but in a Ministers house may raise a iust suspition, that he is not a fit man to order and gouerne the house of God: for if euery family of common Christians be, or ought to be a little Church; is it more then iust and meere that the family of the Minister be not onely, not a conspiracie of rebels, sonnes of <hi>Belial,</hi> and disordered and licentious mates; but such as may ioyne together in the worship of God, and holy conuersation, for the good example of others?

Looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examples.

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 2.51.</note> notable was the obedience of Isaac even to the knife in the hand of his father, and a liuely type of Christ, who was obedient to his heauenly father, and that <hi>vnto the death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip 2.8.</note> Whereas on the contrarie, disobedient children neuer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped vnpunished, as in the examples of Cham, Absolom, Reuben, Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, Phineas, Abimelech, and many others, as we might plentifully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plane. And looke what dutie the Lord requireth to naturall Parents, the like also is due to those who are in stead of fathers and mothers, as step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, tutors, masters; <hi>Ruth</hi> loued <hi>Naomi</hi> her mother in lawe, and claue vnto her as vnto her owne mother: the sonnes of the Prophets o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed their masters as their owne fathers; <hi>Elisha</hi> spake of <hi>Eliah, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my father,</hi> 2. Kin. 2.12. this lesson if it were so heedefully regarded as it might, would be of speciall vse in this place aboue all other in the land besides, wherein so many youth miscarrie, euen for this; because they cast off the yoke, and willingly knowe no dutie nor subiection to supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, tutors, and those who are in stead of parents vnto them.</p>

                  <note place="margin">1. king. 1.6.</note> Yea, but parents say, what would you haue vs doe? they be but young and youth must haue a time, and we may not euer be dulling them with correction; their owne rodde will beate them well enough in time, and soone ripe will be soone rotten. To whom I say, I would haue you to consider the state of your children, and the great measure of follie that is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> bound vp in their hearts, which the rod of correction only can driue out. 2. To knowe that if children get head while they are so, they are likely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to hold it when they are stronger: note the speach of Salomon, <hi>Euen a child maketh himselfe knowne in his works,</hi>

That it is the note of a fleshly minde in thee, to loue nothing but thine owne flesh in thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and to carrie no loue to their soules: nay, it is not loue but <hi>hatred which spareth the rodde:</hi> or call it loue if thou wilt, it is a cruell loue, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell I say, 1. to thy child, 2. to thy selfe. 1. to him, because thou negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his timely correction; the Lord either causeth him to fall into the hand of the Magistrate the father of the countrie; or else takes him into his owne hand to controll, or else cut off: whereas thy rodde might haue giuen him wisdome, and thy timely rebuke might haue deliuered <hi>his soule from hell,</hi> that is, his life from the graue. 2. to <hi>thy selfe,</hi> for we seldome read, but that the darling child,<note place="margin">Prou. 23.13, 14.</note> was the sorrowe and shame to

                  <note place="margin">Prou. 29.15.</note> and God hath most crossed his children, in their children best beloued, to teach them to loue all of them in good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>Neither in all this would I haue parents to prouoke or exasperate their children, as Saul did Ionathan: 1. both by an vniust commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to deliuer his friend, and an innocent to death: as 2. by an vndeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued reproach, calling him the sonne of an harlot: and 3. by a furious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of casting his dart at him to slay him: which made Ionathan rise and leaue him. Neither yet doe I here exact the forfeyt of euery offence in the child (as neither the Lord doth of his children) knowing that the child is the fathers owne bowells; and that the parent after a sort suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth with the child: and sometimes God himselfe threatneth, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beareth, and warneth his owne children: as Exod. 32.34. But yet this precept enioyneth parents so seasonably to breake their childrens corrupt desires, as that they be farre from disobedience, to God, or themselues: and therefore that is a worthy precept of Salomon to euery parent, read according to the best translation, <hi>Be thou great in the feruencie of thine anger in forgiuing a fact:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 19.19.</note> that is, shew thy great indignation against that sinne, the correction of which, for the present thou forbearest, <hi>saying,</hi> that is, threatning, <hi>that if thou shalt deliuer him, thou wilt further punish him afterwards.</hi> And thus trayning them in obedience at home, it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thy glorie, and their beautie abroad. Whereas the cause that now they swagger, and are masterlesse abroad, is because they were neuer well mastered at home: and the reason why now in mans estate, perhaps vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a faithfull ministrie, they are so incorrigible, is because in their youth they bare no yoke, were not inured with corrections. Fathers affoarded no helpe to the Ministers, by their good education, and therefore now good meanes cannot preuaile with them.</p>

which we read seldome separated in the Scriptures. See Act. 20.28. Heb. 13.17. 1. Tim. 5.17. 1. Pet. 5.1. Thus must euery Minister whom the Lord hath made an ouerseer of his people, watch their soules as those who must be counteable for them; for if they die for want of food, and be famished; or else for want of ordering, of admonition, reprehension, correction, and censures according to Christs holy institution: there blood shall be required at the Pastors hand: for looke what charge A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab had concerning Benhadad; the same hath euery Minister concerning euery soule committed vnto him: <hi>Keepe this man, if he be lost and want,</hi> namely by thy default,<note place="margin">1. king. 20.39.</note>

See for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose a notable allusion Isa. 56.9.10. where the Lord compareth his Church to a flocke of sheepe: the Priests and Prophets to shepheards, and shepheards dogges: the enemies of the Church to wolues and wilde beasts: and beeing offended with his people, he calleth all the beasts of the feild and forrest, to deuoure and rauin, that is, the Chaldeans, Assyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Antiochus, and the Romans; by all whom they were diuersly oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and the reason is added because the watchmen were all asleepe the doggs were sleepie, and greedie, dumb and barked not: ease tooke vp some, couetousnes others; and therefore no remedie, if those that should driue away enemies from the Lords folds cannot be at leisure to espie the danger, but a fearefull spoile and destruction most needs befall such a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> The cause of all corruptions in elections,<note place="margin">It is a generall corruption to begin where God endeth</note> and designements to offices and places lyeth here, that men looke not to the qualitie of the place first, but (beginning where God ends) first at the man, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a proper man for parts, and gifts of bodie and minde, or by such and such commended, or furnished to performe such expectations and contracts, or an auntient, or a kinsman, &amp;c. this marres all, and often setteth fooles on horsebacke, when wise men walke on foote by them. Let everie man whom it concerneth learne wisedome of God and his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit here, which first inquireth into the place: and so in passing their suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in elections, thus reason; oh this is a difficult matter, where haue we a fit man for it: if to choose a Magistrate, this requires one able to execute the Lords iudgements: where haue we a man of courage fearing God, and hating couetousnesse? If a fellowe of a colledge, this requireth lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, iudgement, and one able at least to bring vp youth in knowledge
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18792:71"/>
and godlinesse, where shall we finde such an one? but if a minister, oh this requires one able to build vp the bodie of Christ, and who is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for this thing?<note place="margin">Reasons for the dutie.</note> The reasons hereof are, 1. the externall election of the Church ought to follow the internall of the spirit: see 1. Sam. 10.24. 2. it euer argueth corruption, to preferre priuate respects before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like good. 3. the ends of euerie calling are, 1. and principall Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, 2. neerer and inferiour: 1. the helping of the communion of Saints, 2. building of the Church, which he who is likely most to preferre, is principally to be preferred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As Gods steward</hi>] Here are likewise to be considered two things. 1. the signification of the word. 2. the force of the argument.</p>
               <p>First, the word implyeth thus much, that God is a great housholder, Matth. 21.33. that his house is his Church, where he as a great personage keepeth his residence; more stately and honourable then the court or standing house of any earthly king in the world; in that herein he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to manifest his presence by his spirit, working in the word and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie: and as it is with other great houses, so the spirit of God speaketh of this, as committed not to one, but many <hi>stewards,</hi> who take the charge of it, to order and gouerne it according to the minde of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and vnto his greatest honour and aduantage.<note place="margin">Ministers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led stewards, why.</note> And these stewards are the ministers, so called 1. because as the steward in an house is to dispence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> all necessaries vnto the whole familie, according to the allowance and liking of his Lord; euen so the Minister receiueth from God power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister according to the necessities of the Church, all the things of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as word, Sacraments, prayer, admonition, &amp;c. 2. As the steward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the keies of the house to open and shut, to lock and vnlock, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or exclude out of the house: for so is it said of <hi>Eliacim,</hi> Isa. 22.22. euen so euery Minister receiueth the keies of the kingdome of heauen; to open, and shut heauen, to bind and loose, to remit and retaine sinnes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as Matth. 16.19. 3. As the steward sitteth not in his owne as an own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or freeholder,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.2.</note> but is to be <hi>counteable</hi> and to <hi>giue vp</hi> his bills moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or quarterly, when the master shall call for them; so euery Minister is to be counteable of his talents receiued, and of his expenses, and how he hath dispensed his masters goods. Heb. 13.17. <hi>They watch for your soules as they which must giue accounts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> From which similitude, we may learne that it is the dutie of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Minister, to see that he haue both the calling, and also the <hi>properties</hi> beseeming him, who is the steward of God. And for his calling, he must be <hi>Gods steward:</hi> the Lord must set him in this place of seruice so neere him; or else he is but a theife and intruder: of whom it cannot be said, <hi>that the Lord hath made him ruler ouer his house.</hi>

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18792:71"/>
steward are principally two, 1. Wisedome, 2. Faithfulnes. So we finde them in the place alleadged: who is a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>faithfull</hi> seruant,<note place="margin">The properties of a good stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. 1. faithfulnes in 3. things.</note> whom the Lord may make ruler ouer his house? And first of the faithfulnes of this steward: as the cheife Doctor of his Church hath gone before in exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who was first <hi>appointed,</hi> and then <hi>faithfull</hi> vnto him that appointed him, Heb. 3.2. so is it required of euery <hi>Minister of Christ</hi>;<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.1.2.</note> and <hi>dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the secrets of God, that he be found faithfull.</hi> Now this faithfulnes standeth in, 1. <hi>distributing,</hi> 2. <hi>all,</hi> 3. <hi>his masters</hi> allowance to those of his houshold. For 1. he is called to be a distributer to distribute their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> meate vnto his fellow seruants, as it was the manner in those times wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Sauiour liued, for the cheife seruant to deuide vnto the other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants their portions of meate; and this not as a Lord ouer them, but as a superiour seruant with them: and the steward euery where is as the hand of this economicall bodie, to take in and giue out; the which hand if it should not for ease or idlenes be plucked out of the bosome to feed the body, that bodie must needs starue and perish.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He must distribute his <hi>Lords</hi> meate and allowance, according to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> his Masters minde: that is, the pure word of God, without mingling or corrupting. Wholsome food, not drawne out of the poysoned puddles of Popish Friers, or postillars, of Poets, or Philosophers, neither of his own or any other mens inventions or traditions: but out of the store of the Prophets and Apostles, which is a sufficient treasurie whence he may bring out abundance of things new and old. For herein the minde of the Master must be the square of his seruant, who himself would not, neither suffer others to giue for bread, stones; nor serpents for fishes: but as the master calling his seruants to emploiment, deliuereth them his <hi>own goods,</hi> so also calling them to accounts,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.14.</note> requireth the returne and gaine of his <hi>owne.</hi> Whence also euery Minister is here called <hi>Gods steward,</hi> and the dispenser of <hi>Gods mysteries.</hi> Who if he <hi>speake,</hi> he must doe it as the <hi>words of God:</hi> if he <hi>minister,</hi> he must doe it as of the <hi>abilitie which God ministreth:</hi> if he haue receiued the gift,<note place="margin">1.

and vnfailing patterne of all faithfulnes, we shall clearely see that herein he approoued his faithfulnes to him that appointed him: for his <hi>whole doctrine,</hi> himselfe affirmeth it was not his but his Fathers, Ioh. 7.16. and that he gaue to his Disciples, and so by them to all beleeuers, the words which his Father gaue to him, Ioh. 17.8. And for his <hi>workes,</hi> he <hi>did nothing of himselfe,</hi> but as <hi>his Father taught him,</hi> Ioh. 8.28. and for both, he set himselfe an inimitable coppie vnto all the seruants of his house. Moses indeed was faithfull in all the house of God as a seruant, and herein his faithfulnes appeared, that he did and caused all things to be done in the tabernacle <hi>according to the patterne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 3.5.</note> but Christ as the Sonne, was faithfull not in anothers, as Moses was, but as a Lord in his owne house, goeth before Moses and all other his seruants.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. He must distribute <hi>all</hi> his masters allowance, else is he a theife and an vniust steward. He must keepe nothing backe, but deliuer the <hi>whole counsell</hi> of God; and then if any within the house die for want of meate, the fault is not in the steward, who measured them out their portion; and deliuered faithfully that whole truth of God necessarie to saluation; but their blood is vpon their owne heads,<note place="margin">Act 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27.</note> in that they refused that food which the steward dispensed vnto them. All which branches of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes if they be not performed, assuredly the day commeth wherein the vnfaithfulnesse of euery such offender shall be discouered. Many eyes are vpon thee for the present who art vnfaithfull in Gods house.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this steward of God must be wise as well as faithfull: this wisedome standeth principally in two things.<note place="margin">The second propertie of a good steward: Wisdome in 1. forecasting.</note> 1. In a wise forecast and prouision of necessaries before hand, that he may be able to bring out of his store such things as the necessities of the house shall require: together with a plotting and contriuing to put forth his Masters goods to the best profit: for else although he intend neuer so much faithfulnesse, yet shall he not avoide the accusation of a <hi>waster of his masters goods.</hi> 2. In a wise dispensation of things so prouided;<note place="margin">2. Dispensing in due 1. sort.</note> and this 1. in due <hi>sort.</hi> 2. in due <hi>measure.</hi> 3. in due <hi>season.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18792:72"/>
to seruants then to sonnes: stronger meat for men of yeares then for chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. No wise steward would set milke before strong labourers, and beefe bones before sucking children: so the minister as a wife steward must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the age of men in Christ, whether men be weake or strong Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and accordingly apply himselfe to feede them with milke, or lead them to stronger meat: so whether he be to deale with men wicked or godly, that he may set courser meate of threats and iudgements before the former; and finer and sweeter dainties of promises and blessings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter: so also whether they be sicke or sound, that if they be diseased or of sicke consciences, he may heale them; if dangerously wounded by Satans temptations he may salue them; if broken hearted he may helpe to bind them vp. Which point of wisdome where it is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or neglected by the Minister, he laieth himselfe open to that fearefull woe, Ezech. 34.4. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in due <hi>measure,</hi> some neede more promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses some more threatnings,<note place="margin">2. measure.</note> he must be wise not to exceed the measure in either; for thus he shal make such wanton who should rather be kept vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by speaking peace to whom it belongeth not; as also make their hearts heauie and sad, whom the Lord would haue lightened and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. And this is made the worke of the faithfull and wise steward to giue euerie man his <hi>portion,</hi> both for quantitie and qualitie. <hi>Thirdly,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. season.</note> this portion must be giuen in <hi>due season:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk 12.42.</note> this due season the Apostle hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be <hi>in season,</hi> and <hi>out of season,</hi> that is instantly, importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, watching all good occasions hereunto; not once a quarter, nor once a moneth, nor so often as men shall say they neede, who for most part haue lost their stomacke and appetite hereunto; but euen so instantly, as his master can neuer come but he may <hi>find him so doing,</hi> Luk. 12.43. and blessed shall onely such seruants be: whereas on the contrarie,<note place="margin">Non fidelis haec dispensatio sed crudelis dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patio est.

Let men learne with more diligence to attend on the ministerie, and not be satisfied, till they haue the whole counsell of God necessarie to their saluation, reuealed vnto them: let them call vpon their stewards and vrge them to faithfulnes. There is no seruant but he may &amp; will look for that whole portion which he knoweth his master alloweth him; and cannot abide that the steward should gain any thing by him: oh that men would call for their portion in heauenly things also, or that they would receiue it, beeing forced and thrust vpon them.

               <p>The second thing in this similitude to be considered, is the force of the argument, which is this; That because euery Minister is called to a place so neere the Lord as to be his steward, therefore he must be vnblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.

Whereof we haue an excellent example in Ezech. 44.9. to the 15. for the Levites which had serued before idols, were thrust from the Ministery of holy things; yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they were of the house of Aaron, yet could they neuer be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into the preists office to come neare the holy place, but at most must keepe the doores, or do some other inferiour seruice: So as such as come neare vnto God, whether Ministers or professours, may not say, they do but as others do; much lesse as many seruants abuse their Princes, or Lords cloth to the priuiledge of their disordered courses, and to face out their bad matters: but the seruants of this house, as they must haue a speciall representation of the image of their master; so may they not doe many things which are lawfull for other men: the Priests, who must come into the inner Court, may not marrie widowes but maids, nor such as were diuorsed, verse 22. both which were lawfull inough for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

God forbid I should thus sinne against God. I am the steward of Gods house, and it is for the honour of God, to haue the steward of his house vnblameable: my place is to blame and censure all disorders in the family, and can my selfe be so disordered. See and consider an excellent example in Nehemiah,<note place="margin">Nehem. 6.11.</note> when he was warned by a prophecie (though a false one) to flie into the Temple for his life from before his enemies: he answered, <hi>shall such a man as I flie?</hi> this were neither glorious to God, nor honourable to my selfe: he set me about this busines, and he can and will deliuer me: and my selfe am the captaine, and set ouer all the people, <hi>and can I flie? who is it that beeing as I am, would goe into the Temple to liue:</hi> the fact then beeing in this, and other

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Euery professor of the Gospel, beeing drawne much neerer vnto God, then the common sort of men, must endeauour to walke <hi>worthy of God,</hi> Colos. 1.10. and worthy <hi>of the calling to which he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> Eph. 3.1. namely, both the generall calling of Christianitie, which must be beautified and adorned: as also the speciall calling and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of life, vnto which the Lord hath disposed him: for euen that must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be holily and wisely managed. And such force hath this reason drawne from our caller and calling, to mooue beleeuing hearts to watchfulnes ouer their waies, as that the Apostles most frequently vrge it vpon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: As where we are commanded to be holy, because God is holy: to walke in the light, as God is light: to walke in loue, as God is loue: to walke in the truth, as God is the truth; by all which, and many moe like precepts, what else is enioyned a Christian man, but that the life, the nature, the goodnes, and holines of God reuealed in Christ, be the example and direction of his life and course: for this is the walking wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of God, to which we are exhorted by this argument, because <hi>he hath called vs,</hi> 1. Thess. 2.12. And further, if we consider vnto what we are called, the same place of the Apostle sheweth, that we are called to be very neare vnto God: <hi>walke worthy of him that hath called you, to his kingdome and glorie:</hi> to a <hi>kingdome</hi>; we were indeed farre off, alients, and Gentils, and very despicable, without all hope: but now are called to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in another manner of kingdom then that of great King Ahashue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosh, to which poore Hester was called: And seeing many may be in the court of a Prince, and yet some of them abide in baser offices, and not many of them glorious, or gracious, as the Queene, and children are: God hath called vs to a kingdome and <hi>glorie</hi>; that with the residue of the Church, we might become his owne spouse, and so partake of his own glorie and maiestie. Now how much are such beggars as we, (called to such aduancements) bound to walke worthy of such a condition, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to which in Christ we are called? 2. Let euery professor consider, that the falls of such as are nearer God, more dishonour God, and more hurt the Church, then grosser sinnes of other men, and therefore the Lord can lesse beare their falls vncorrected. Dauid tooke it more heauily that such as did eate bread at his table should despise him, then others further off: and that Absolon his owne bowells should seeke his life, then that Shemei should raile on him. Professors of Christ must thinke that they dip in the same dish with Christ, and therefore they of all should be farre from dishonoring him. Which one consideration, should enforce them the rather both to sorrow for sinne past, and breaking off
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18792:74"/>
sinnes present; as also the preuenting of sinnes for time to come. 3. Whereas Salomon saith, that the righteous falling before the wicked, are <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as a <hi>corrupt well,</hi> and troubled <hi>spring</hi>; that is, they trouble, offend,<note place="margin">Prou. 25.26.</note> and after a sort poyson many: let the godly be more carefull to make right steps vnto their feete: and the rather in these daies, which so much the more call for our watchfulnes, by how much the wicked are more ready maliciously to disgrace our profession: that before we shall go away vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reprooued, they can cast reproaches on vs for well doing: yea and for our sakes, euen vpon ciuill conuersation, often in such as haue no grace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew, or substance of religion in them. And therefore seeing we are so sure to suffer, let vs be sure we suffer not as euill doers.</p>

Indeed neither Minister nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18792:75"/>
Christian, may be as shaking reeds, tossed hither and thither with euery blast of winde; but yet is it a wise mans part to heare and trie, and not stick to his owne counsell; as a man wiser in his owne conceit then seauen men that can giue a reason: for there is greater hope of a foole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> then of such a one. 3. There are many necessitudes and occasions betweene the Minister and people: he must admonish the inordinate, raise with comforts the afflicted, restore those that are fallen, and set their bones againe tenderly by the spirit of meeknes: and priuately encourage those that do well. Againe, they must consult with him, aske him some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of his doctrine, lay open vnto him their greife, as to their Phisici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vnder Christ, and seeke for particular direction in speciall cases from him: in all which and many moe mutuall duties, they may not by this inordinate humor be deterred, and hindered: but rather with all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and lenitie be allured, louingly enterteined, and contentedly dismissed from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This doctrine may be profitably applyed both to Mnisters and people. The Minister must learne to be 1. docible, 2. affable: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fitteth him to learne of others, the latter to teach others: for none can be apt to teach others, who is not apt to learne of others: and in the Minister especially a tractable and teachable disposition, is a singular invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of others by his example, more easily to admit his teaching, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by reprehension, admonition, or howsoeuer. Elihu ioyneth learning and teaching together, <hi>Let a man of vnderstanding tell me, let a man of vnderstanding hearken vnto me:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 34.34.</note> and euery one will thinke it fit, that young Ioshua should minister vnto Moses, young Samuel to Eli, Elisha to Eliah, Baruch to Ieremie, Titus to Paul; yea the disciples to Christ; &amp; thinke it vnreasonable that the blind should offer to lead the blind. But this is the fault of many Ministers, that conceiuing they are now fitted to teach others, they disdaine to be taught by others, and thinke it too base for them to heare such as they conceiue meaner and weaker in gifts then themselues:<note place="margin">Great schollers may and must be taught by meaner then themselues.

As for the other vertue opposed to frowardnes, namely, <hi>affabilitie,</hi> which teacheth to entertaine the talke of others with signification of our good will vnto them in our speaches and gestures, it is a great grace, and a profitable ornament in a Minister, that can graciously and wisely weld it.</p>

                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Hastines or pronesse to anger is a great enemie vnto the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, and such a blot as may not appeare in him, who is to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into that calling: which proposition must not so be vnderstood, as that euerie hastie man is to be debarred from the ministerie (for this infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie will dwell with the best) but sheweth that he that ordinarily is so fierie and furious, as euen small trifling occasions inflame him; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is so farre from crossing and curbing his corruption, as that he rather followeth and fostereth it: this man is vtterly vnfit for the ministerie.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons.</note>For 1. whereas a minister ought to be a man of iudgment, knowledge, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and vnderstanding (for these are most essentiall vnto his calling) yea, a man of such wisedome, as whereby all his actions ministeriall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon should be ordered; this flashing anger ouerturneth for the present, yea and drowneth all his iudgement: for what other is it then a little furie and a short madnes? which the wise man had well obserued, when he said, that whereas the wise man ordereth all his works with iudgement, anger resteth in the bosome of fooles: and where it resteth it ruleth, so as there is no place for wise deliberation; but a rash carriage of matters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18792:76"/>
to the heate and headie violence of the distempered affection. Not vnfitly therefore doth the same Salomon note, that he that is <hi>slowe to wrath, is of great wisedome,</hi> and that he <hi>that is hastie to anger, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth folly.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 14.17.29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the pestilent effects and fruits of anger, and the naturall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> daughters resembling the mother are such, as in a Minister of all men are intollerable: as, swelling of the minde so high, and so full, as there is no roome for good motions, and meditations (which should wholly take vp the ministers heart) to dwell by it: the often arming of Gods enemies, and harming and wounding of his friends: for <hi>anger is cruell, and wrath is raging:</hi> it cares not for any, nor spares any that come in the way of it;<note place="margin">Prou. 27.4.</note> for <hi>who can stand before enuie?</hi> And from this indignation of heart pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede vsually, impietie against God, for all <hi>prayers</hi> and parts of his worship are <hi>interrupted:</hi> contumely against men, for the bond of loue is broken: clamor of speach, violence of hands, temeritie of actions, late repentance, and many moe such symptoms of this desperate disease: for he hath lost all the bridle and moderation of himselfe:<note place="margin">Rage blindeth reasons eye.</note> I had almost said his reason, for I thinke Salomon saith no lesse, affirming that such a man as cannot refraine this reuengfull appetite, is like a <hi>citie broken downe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 25.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and without wals.</hi> Now what gouernement is he worthy of, especially in the Church of God, that ordinarily looseth all the gouernement of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
               <p>Thrirdly, the Minister standing in the roome and stead of God, ought (if he would resemble him) to be a mortified man: for till he haue put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> off this <hi>filthie fruit of the flesh,</hi> can he neuer liuely expresse the vertues of God, who is a God of patience, meekenesse, much in compassion,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.20.</note> slowe to wrath: and much lesse can he fitly stampe and imprint that part of his image on others, yea or teach them to withstand such hote and hastie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which so suddenly surprize and enflame himselfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as the Minister is to be a meanes of reconciling God vnto man, so likewise of man vnto man, which commendable dutie an hastie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> man can neuer to purpose performe: nay rather be stirreth vp strife, and marreth all: whereas Salomon obserueth, that onely he <hi>that is slowe to wrath, appeaseth strife:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 15.18.</note> for this vnrulie passion will disable a man to heare the truth of both the parties indifferently, nor abideth to heare the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, but it will be thundring threats before time serue to take knowledg of the matter.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, this vice preiudiceth all his ministeriall actions. 1. in his owne world. For the Minister shall often meete in his calling with those both <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> at home and abroad, who in many things are farre different from him both in iudgement and practise; yea some of weakenes, and others of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18792:77"/>
lothing euen his wholesome doctrine. Now his calling is, and consequently his care should be, to gaine these to the loue and liking of the truth: to which end he is not presently to breake out into anger; for thus he sets them further off, and scandalizeth such as otherwise he might haue wonne; no more then the Physitian is or may be angrie, though the weake stomacke of his patient, loath and cast vp his wholesome phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke; for that would set the patient into further distemper: but such must be <hi>restored by the spirit of meekenesse.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.1.</note> 2. in his peoples hearts, by aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their loue and affection, which are easily worne away with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastfull fruits of this hastie anger: let him instruct, admonish, reprooue, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one findeth this euasion, one he doth in anger, an other not in loue, and so his whole worke is lost and become fruitlesse: whereas by louing vsage hee might haue pearced his people with a permanent and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting affection, and wonne better entertainement to all his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.</p>

Let no man minister, nor people giue place to this vnruly and troublesome affection of rash anger, which must be pleased in euery thing, be it neuer so vniust, or else the whole man is enflamed with the vnnaturall heate of this raging feuer of the mind.

How cursed was the rage of Simeon and Levi, who most treacherously and barbarously, for one offender, brought so much innocent blood vpon themselues? How fearefully did Dauid forget himselfe, in vowing the death not of Nabal only, who was churlish towards him, but of all his guiltles family, who were so well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards him?</p>

And adde herunto the meeknes of our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs to learne it of him: his voice was not heard in the streetes: a brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reed he would not breake: how long bare he with Iudas, beeing no better then a Deuill within his family? that euen when he was meditating his sinne, he was loath to discouer him plainly to be the man; <hi>but hee that dippeth with mee,</hi> and <hi>one of you</hi> shall betraie me; not expressely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Iudas: and when he was acting his sinne, Christ refused not to kisse him, but called him freind, and vttered such words, as might haue wrung out not teares, but blood, out of the most rockie heart of any, but the sonne of perdition. 3. On the vnbounded measure of Gods mercie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> whose vertue his child must endeauour to expresse.

And yet if all this cannot bridle the headines of this vile lust, apply this mercie of God to thy selfe: thou standest in need of a sea of Gods mercie, for the washing of so many foule offences; and

And where our Apostle affirmeth that Gods steward may not be giuen <hi>to wine,</hi> nor a <hi>striker,</hi> what else doth he then second that of our Sauiour in the parable teaching, that of all men the steward may not <hi>sit with drunkards,</hi>

                  <hi>Reasons.</hi> 1. To be addicted to the wine or strong drinke, <hi>taketh away the heart,</hi> Hos. 4.11. that is, troubleth the vnderstanding, confoundeth the senses, and equalleth a man to the bruit beast without vnderstanding: and thus disableth the man of God in all the practise of his calling. As the wise man therefore saith, Prou. 31.4. <hi>It is not for kings to drinke wine, nor
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18792:79"/>
Princes strong drinke, least he drinke and forget the decree, and change the iudgement of the children of affliction:</hi> so much lesse is it for the Minister and Pastor set ouer Gods people, least he forget Gods decrees, &amp; change his iudgements, as Aarons sonnes did. And hence is it that the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth a double reason of that former lawe, both to the same purpose. 1. From the end: Aarons sonnes might not drinke wine or strong drinke, that they might be able to <hi>put difference betweene the holy and vnholy</hi>; cleane and vncleane: and so rightly discerne of the seueralls of their charge. 2. that they might teach <hi>the children of Israel all the statutes of the Lord:</hi> herein implying that if they did not carefully abstaine from wine, they could not but be interrupted in both these. To the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose may we obserue howe aptly the Apostle ioyneth these two precepts together, <hi>vnderstand what the will of the Lord is:</hi> and,<note place="margin">Eph. 5 17.</note> 
                  <hi>be not drunke with wine:</hi> for commonly such as giue themselues ouer to this lust, are by the Lord, giuen vp to sottishnes, that what gifts they haue had are withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken from them: of which, examples are too frequent.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this sitting at wine calleth him from the duties and meanes of his fitnesse vnto his calling; he cannot attend to <hi>reading, exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doctrine,</hi> which is straitly enioyned euerie Timothie, 1.4.13.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, such a man is so farre from performance of any faithfull duty,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that he cannot but become rather an enemie to those that doe. For the manner is, that when the seruants of God call men to sackecloth, ashes, mourning: these invite to the pots &amp; bankets, still strengthning the hands of sinners: when God by his Prophets calleth to <hi>weeping, mourning,</hi>

And can that be a small sinne in any man (and much more in a Minister) which the Lord vsually so fearefully reuengeth, both here, and hereafter, and that with the sharpest arrowes of his quiuer, and the greatest plagues that the treasure of his wrath can afford? for it is plagued with many attendant sinnes,<note place="margin">Many arrows of Gods wrath shot against this sinne.</note> euen the violence of the whole law of God.

As for the plagues wherewith the Lord pursueth this sinne after this life, they are vnvtterable, only let the sinner of this suit know, that it banisheth him from the suite of the Saints, and excludeth him out of heauen: 1. Cor. 6.10.</p>
               <p>Let Ministers and people therefore consider well, what a number of sinnes and plagues that man thrusteth himselfe into, that is giuen to wine and strong drinke, and sitteth downe with drunkards: and yet how hath this sinne as a deluge ouerflowne the land? yea and that height of it seeketh not corners whereby one man sporteth himselfe in making an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other drunke:<note place="margin">see Hab. 1.15.16</note> oh woe vnto that man that maketh himselfe merrie in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other mans sinne, which should be as a dagger at his heart: and woe worth that deuillish reioysing, which triumpheth in putting out Gods image, and bringeth a man to the condition of a bruite beast: whereas our reioysing should be in remoouing blocks from before the blind, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in laying them. Alas, that these should be the fruits of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: will not such things force our God to remooue the hedge of his vineyard, and breake downe the wall? nay is not the hedge troden down already: seeing such &amp; so vile sinns, vnheard of among the heathen, like so many wilde beasts, depopulate and wast this Garden of Eden, planted by the Lords owne fingers? that vnlesse the Lord of hosts returne and visit this vine, and returne vs vnto him by repentance, we that haue bin enuied for our happines, shall come of all nations to be pitied: when the long patience of our God shall be expired, with a soddaine ruine and a wofull downefall. And yet further, we who liue in the Goshen of our Countrie, if darknes couered the face of all the land, we should be light: the sunne is vpon vs, we are in the sunne: let vs walke as in the noone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day:

               <p>This fourth vice seemeth fitly to be set after the former, as beeing an vsuall attendant of them. The right meaning of which that we may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conceiue, we must know that we may not so vnderstand the precept, as that at no time a minister may lawfully strik another; for there be times,<note place="margin">In what cases a minister may lawfully strike.</note> and cases when it may be not only lawfull, but necessarie. For 1. it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth nothing from his priuate economicall right, whereby he may and ought moderately (as occasion is offered) exercise his power of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his seruants, and children. 2. It derogateth nothing from his common right, in case he be set vpon, and cannot call for the Magistrats <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> helpe; in which case by a iust and common law, he is armed and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to become a Magistrate to himselfe; and may not onely strike, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen kill with the sword also; so be his heart be free from that desire, and his intendment be not to kill, but rather weaken the enemie, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himselfe, rather then hurt the other: in which case Christ allowed the Disciples (whom he could haue miraculously preserued) the vse of swords, Luk. 22.36.38. except we will allegorically vnderstand those places, as <hi>Beza</hi> doth: and Peter had a sword readie to draw and smite at Christs apprehension. 3. Some Ministers may be present in a iust and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> lawfull warre, to teach souldiers to fight the Lords battels after the Lords minde, to pray for prosperous successe, to comfort and animate the camp. Thus Moses praied in the campe; and we read of <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the campe of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> and of <hi>Zuinglius</hi> who died in the field: in which case it is not doubted but that a Minister may strike and kill also the enemies of God. The meaning then is, that a Minister may not be a man of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall heart and spirit: such a one as in his priuate matters, will stand out with euery man at the slaues end in contending;<note place="margin">A minister may not be a swash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buckler, or a man of a word and a blow.</note> or a man of a word and a blow, an hackster or cutter: but one of a patient spirit, meeke, long-suffering, following peace with all men: yea propounding himselfe a patterne of peaceable disposition to the flocke. <hi>Reasons.</hi>

The Minister is to watch ouer mens manners more then others: now if espying (as he shall) contempt and rebellion in some; malice, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, dissembling in others, and vnkindnes and vnthankefulnes in euerie corner: what a life should he lead, if he should be alwaies readie to draw? if he should not beare with some faults, and take none at the worst? yea, if he should not resemble God himself, whose roome he standeth in; who striketh not for euery escape, but is slow to wrath, and grieued for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill?</p>
               <p>Let none here alleadge Christs whipping the buyers and sellers out of

the Temple, for he was not onely a Minister, but the Lord of his Temple. Nor the Apostolicall rodde wherewith Peter strucke Ananias dead, and Paul Elimas blind, which was a gift extraordinarie, and temporarie. We must walke by this ordinarie canon, which prohibiteth a Minister to be a striker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. What an happie change of things should our eies see, if this one charge of the Apostle were duely obserued? how might brethren liue together in vnitie, although they retained some difference in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in things circumstantiall and of lesser moment? then such as are too hot, might be wisely cooled without chafing and storming: such as are weake, might be by softnes and gentlenesse suported by the stronger: such as haue strayed, might by the spirit of meekenesse be reduced into the fold: and such as are loath to step awrie, should be incouraged in their godly care. And surely this is the meanes vsed by Christ, and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in the building vp of his kingdome, and maintaining of his causes; who while they had power to command, did rather choose to beseech men, and not onely practised in their owne persons, but prescribed to all those who were to succeed them in their labours, and to continue the ministry vnto the end. Wheras contrariwise, what is it that hath vpholden Antichrist so long, and quickned and preserued life in bad causes, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, crueltie, and rage, against the seruants of God. The strongest arguments in Poperie were euer fire and fagot, and if they could not take away the reasons alleadged by the word, this they could doe, euen take away their liues by the sword of the Magistrate.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here are reprehended many Prophets, and the sonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who perhaps in the schoole of the Prophets are no better then swashbucklers, fitter to receiue pay in the field, then pension from the Churches patrimonie: resolute Lamechs who readily reuenge an iniurie seuentie times seuen fold: whose glorie is to quarrell, and stand out at swords point with any man: that which is Gods glorie they deem co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardise, namely, to passe by an offence. How doe these consider that they are either dedicated vnto, or dismissed with the tidings of peace? that they are to serue vnder the Prince of peace, euen the head of our profession? who in his owne person bare all iniuries, rebukes, and buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of sinners, and commanded his disciples to turne the other cheeke to the smiter: not that it is not lawfull for them to stand vpon their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full defence, but to be so farre from offering or returning iniurie, as that they must rather suffer twaine then revenge one.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The same dutie belongeth to euerie Christian, for the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not a word in all these ministeriall directions, especially in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and carriage of the life of the Minister, but it concerneth euery man

in his place, and may be his glasse of whatsoeuer condition he be: And who seeth it not vnlawfull for any of Gods people to liue in wrath and enmitie, or as we say like dogs and cats? but as the children of one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, members of one bodie, maintainers of one faith, and expectors of one glorie.<note place="margin">Isa. 11.</note> The subiects of Christs kingdome are no longer cockatrises, basilisks, Lyons, but lambes, and as sucking children harmeles and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; so saith the Apostle, the wisedome which is from aboue is <hi>gentle, peaceable,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which meeteth with a number of men marked as Caine was with the deuils brand, who was a manslayer from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: who are men of a word and a writ, nay a word and a blow, if not a stabbe: caring no more in their furie to spill a man, then to kill a dogge: such a blacke image of the deuill is stampt vpon them, as they are profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed enemies to the image of God, and care not in how many they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish it. But such bloodie men whose valour and sport it is to fight it out and quarrell, are for most part hit home in earnest: and as they are the enemies of the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> societies of men, are by God suddenly rooted out of their societie, and seldome go to their graues in peace: for the Lord <hi>scattereth the people that delight in warre, and the cruel and bloodie man liueth not out halfe his dayes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Not giuen to filthie lucre</hi>] This vice of couetousnesse is the fifth and last reckoned by the Apostle, of which he would haue the Minister free. The word noteth such a one as beeing greedily set on gaine, and outward profits, bendeth the greatest part of his studie that way: or else one that will take any course, vse any meanes lawfull or vnlawfull; refuse no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but out of euerie thing neuer so base and meane can carue his owne commoditie: no matter what winde it is that bloweth in his profit.</p>
               <p>But to shew that all is not gained which is thus gotten, the Apostle cals it <hi>filthie</hi> gaine or <hi>lucre.</hi> 1. because this immoderate and vnnaturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction maketh a man most base and sordid in getting; seruill in keeping, and illiberall in expending. 2. because by getting or keeping this gaine, some filthie sinne or other will cleaue to the fingers: as in Achab and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, couetousnesse and murther were coupled: in Achan and Gehezi, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnes and lying were combined.

                  </gap> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. This vitious affection distracteth him, and infoldeth him in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many impertinent businesses, stealing away his heart, and causeth the proper duties of his calling to lie neglected. Most fitly did the Apostle compare the worke of the Ministerie to a <hi>warfare,</hi> and inferreth this same reason against this vice in the person of a Minister;<note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.4.</note> that as he which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a warfare doth not implicate and entangle himselfe with the affaires of this life, but hauing receiued his presse money, that he may please his captaine forsaketh all the care of wife, children, house affaires, and calling, and wholly fixeth his minde and eie vpon the busines and victorie: euen so the Minister seruing not vnder a Cyrus, or Alexander, but vnder the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall sonne of God, ought also to diuorse himselfe from the distractions for the things of this life, which in comparison must be vtterly neglected. He is in this warfare rather to expect dangers, blowes, wounds, to forecast these, to prouide for these; and prepare how to encounter against Satan, sinne, his owne, and others sinnefull lusts: following his captaine at the heeles; and incouraging himselfe hereto, both with assurance of victorie, and the expectation of his pay &amp; penie of life eternall. It was the greatest policie, that euer the deuill watched against the Church (as the woefull experience of many ages hath taught vs) to heape excessiue wealth vpon the Clergie: then was the studie of the Scriptures, and the care of the calling laid aside, and was diuerted into plotting and policie, both to get more, and hold that which was gotten: by this Antichrist came in, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he rose to his height, &amp; hereby he standeth at this day: this wealth ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with pompe and state, is that <hi>Davus</hi> which troubleth all the parts of the Christian world, both the Churches and ciuill states, as in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances might be declared.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this vice will make a minister falsifie the word, turne the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> truth into a lie, and take such a course in handling the word, as shall bring meale to the mill. This was noted in the false prophets to be the maine cause of false vision: Isai speaking of greedie dogges, who could neuer haue inough, maketh this their propertie,<note place="margin">Isa. 56.12.</note> 
                  <hi>euerie one looketh to his owne way,</hi> and accordingly prophesied for his owne purpose and advantage: so Ieremie ioyneth these sinnes together, Ier. 5.31. <hi>The Prophets prophesie lies, and the Priests receiue gifts in their hands:</hi> and Ezekiel telleth vs, that this filthie lucre made the Prophets so base minded, that for verie <hi>handfulls of barley, and peices of bread,</hi> some of them would pollute the name of the Lord, in lying to his people: some of ignorance, by the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and bewitching of this sinne: and others against their knowledge and conscience, powring themselues out through the deceit of Balaams
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18792:84"/>
wages. Hence is this sinne branded iustly to bee the seede of heretikes, and spawne of scismatikes, false teachers, and apostates. What other was the white which the authors of scisme, and heads of faction aymed at? Rom. 16.17. <hi>they serued not the Lord Iesus, but their owne bellies.</hi> And no other God serued the false Apostles,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.19.</note> who were enemies to the crosse of Christ, but their <hi>bellie</hi> was their God; why so? because they minded earthly things; for what any man most mindeth, that he maketh his God. Hence could they please all sorts of men, &amp; soon turne round into square. In their doctrine, ioyne circumcision with baptisme, and so both Iew and Gentile were contented. In their liues, they would suffer nothing for Christ: but howsoeuer the squares goe, their state and pompe must be vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. And at this day, what other is the God of Popish Priests? who for their bellie haue turned all religion into gaine; and almost all essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all truths into lyes; both which are readily to be prooued in particular: whereas the true Apostles were most careful to remooue from themselues euen the suspition of this fearefull sinne: who professed that both the Churches knewe, and God bare them record, that they were farre from vsing <hi>flattering words,</hi> or <hi>coloured couetousnesse</hi> in their doctrine: and for their practise, when they might haue beene chargeable to the Churches, they rather wrought with their hands, that they might be eased.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. If a Minister should speake the truth, yet in this tainture, how powerlesly, how fruitlesly? for is he a fit man to raise others to heauen, whose owne heart is rooted in the earth? how coldly shall he perswade others that godlinesse is great gaine, whose gaine is all his godlinesse? with what heart can he pull other men out of the world, and the loue of it, when it hath wonne the strongest and most inward hold of his owne heart? with what experience can he teach that the truest delight is placed in heauenly things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or that Gods kingdome is first to be sought, when his thoughts are taken vp (as the disciples were once) in dreaming of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall kingdome? with what face can he teach the doctrine of Gods prouidence, when himselfe ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kes and laieth about him, as though he had no father to prouide for him? how can he curbe in others these vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall desires, which (as the dropsie) proceede most of fulnesse and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, when as they are so setled in himselfe? Thus this one lust vnfitteth him to all his duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This confuteth many base minded men in the ministerie, whose thoughts,<note place="margin">Many ministers ayme at no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende.</note> studie, paines, and labour, are altogether bended and set vpon this conclusion, That they wil be rich: to which purpose they heape vp li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vpon liuing, cast their largest extent, and contriue the building of their owne houses, although in the meane time the house of the Lord lie wast.<note place="margin">Hagg. 1.</note> Which grieuous sinne, if it were so fearefully accursed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:18792:84"/>
people of the Iewes; what a grieuous plague hangeth ouer the head of that Minister, whose calling laieth a further necessitie vpon him, not to build a material house made with hands; but a spirituall habitation for the Lord, consisting of liuing stones in the hearts of men: and yet all this worke is neglected, that his owne neast may be well feathered. And from the same fountaine floweth it, that some are knowne vsurers, others are farmours, and husbandmen, rather then <hi>Prophets</hi>; others merchants,<note place="margin">Episcopus aut Praesbyter aut Diaconus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaquam saecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lares curat as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumat, sui aliter dejiciatur.

               <p>Now there is no great hope of the recouerie of those who are alreadie clasped in the windings of this sinne; they are desperately endangered to be drowned in perdition, so sweete is the morsell, and so pleasant is the bootie, that they will not let it goe. To them therefore I will say no more, but as Peter to Simon Magus; Pray to the Lord, <hi>that if it be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> the iniquitie of thy heart may be forgiuen thee. I will rather turne my speach to euery young Timothie and Titus, beseeching and exhorting them all, timely to preuent this sinne: and to frame their hearts to that exhortation of Paul, 1. Tim. 6.11. <hi>But thou, O man of God,</hi> that is, who hast place, or art to haue office in the Church by ordinarie calling, as the Prophets and men of God of old had by extraordinarie; Thou, who after a speciall manner, art to be Gods peculiar, not as all men by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor as all godly men in respect of election and sanctification; but besides these by reason of thy function art, or art to be in speciall seruice about God, <hi>flie these things:</hi> that is, preserue thy selfe from these noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lusts, the breeders of most filthy and detestable cogitations and practises.</p>

Let schollers set apart to the Ministerie, meditate often vpon this place. Let Ministers consider they cannot both performe their dutie, and make tents as Paul could, and therefore they must lay aside such secular busines as distract them from fitting themselues to teach their people: and in teaching so to carie themselues, that out of the testimonie of their consciences they may be able to say with Paul, Act. 20. <hi>I haue desired no mans gold, siluer, or garments:</hi> yea and their people also may see and say of them, that they haue <hi>sought them, and not theirs</hi>; yea not their owne priuate <hi>profit,</hi> but the profit of many that they might be saued. Preists and Iesuites are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to venture life and limme to winne men to Romish religion, and how much more should Ministers of God be content with any condition to gaine men vnto God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Out of the epithite added to withdraw the hearts of men from couetousnes, calling that a <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> which is gotten by it, we will note two more generall instructions. First, That there is much filthy lucre and gaine, which euery Christian must abhorre: which is the rather noted, because men of filthy and corrupt mindes thinke any gaine clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and sweet inough,<note place="margin">Dulois odor lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cri.</note> let it be gotten by hooke or crooke, or blowne in by any winde. But we are to know, that much gaine is filthy, on which the Lord will one day so blow, as the third heire shall haue little cause to smile in it. Now according to our former interpretation, whatsoeuer gaine it is, the prosecuting whereof may argue a base, and filthy minde; or whatsoeuer is ioyned with any sinne, that is a filthy lucre. But because men are loath to take knowledge of such a sweete sinne in such gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, I will in particular giue some tast hereof, and then vse some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues against it. For the former I will comprehend it in three rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Sundrie kinds of filthy lucre.</note>First, all vniust gaine in dealing, whether in bargaining, or out of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, is <hi>filthy lucre.</hi> In bargaine: as selling things, 1. <hi>vnprofitable</hi> for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> the Church or common wealth. 2. <hi>vnsaleable:</hi> as, 1. Church-patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as Symonists: 2. liberalitie, as vsurers: 3. time, as most Chapmen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and Marchants: 4. lies, as lawyers of knowledge defending bad causes. Thirdly, things knowne to them to be <hi>defectiue,</hi> either in <hi>substance,</hi> or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>vse,</hi> whereby they become of vniust price, either in that they are not of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18792:85"/>
that profit to the buyer they ought; or that quantitie, because of vniust weights or measure: but most of this is confessed filthy lucre. Out of bargaine; 1. That gaine which any man taketh for some dutie which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> neglecteth, or omitteth: the sinne of Nonresidents, idle or idol and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient Ministers. 2. That gaine which is taken by vnderhand cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as bribes, which blinde the eyes of the wise, to the staying or peruerting the course of iustice. 3. That which accreweth by vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable or vniust policie; as for a man to breake, and become banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to enrich himselfe: an vsuall course, but dishonest inough, yea an horrible theft, in many deseruing no lesse punishment, then our lawes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict vpon theft.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Rule.</hi> All that gaine that is gotten by gaming for mony, as by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> dicing, bowling, wherein men seeke to benefit themselues by other mens losse, is a <hi>filthy lucre.</hi> For euery penny must be accounted for, and if it be not patrimony or gift, ought to be gotten in the sweate, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a lawfull calling. And consequently all such gaine as comes in by partaking and abetting in these sinnes; as to make gaine by conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their houses into gaming houses, stageplay houses, or tipling hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, all which are the receptacles and roostes of filthy and vicious persons; and the gaine therefore cannot be but filthy: the last of which three, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there haue beene and might be a necessarie vse of, yet such is the common disorder of them generally, that in stead of alehouses we may call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hel houses: for a Christian man need no other hell, then to be next neighbors vnto them: but if there be any better ordered, I speake not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>against them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Rule.</hi> All that gaine that goeth hand in hand with the violence of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> any of Gods laws, is <hi>filthy gaine.</hi> As that which is gotten by needles oaths, true or false; against the third commandement: or by riding out on the Sabbath day, or staying at home by employment in the ordinarie calling, out of verie extraordinarie necessitie, against the fourth: or the price of an harlot, against the seauenth: or by stealth and vailes, whereby men vnconscionably shape out their owne commoditie out of another mans cloth: or by any manner of oppression, and grinding the faces of the poore, as by monopolies, enhansing, ingrossing, and regrating corne or other commodities, against the eight: or by lying, and dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, which is as ordinary with many as their trading is, against the ninth. All these, with diuerse other kinds, almost against euery commandement, are filthy lucre. Of all which the Apostle speaketh, 1. Thess. 4.5. <hi>Let no man oppresse or defraud his brother in any thing:</hi> and addeth two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; 1. because the Lord <hi>is the auenger</hi> of all such things: 2. because we are <hi>not called to vncleannes,</hi> but vnto holines: implying that these are

practises, farre <hi>vnbeseeming that holines</hi> vnto which a professor of Christ is called: as in Eph. 5.3.5. he reckneth vp these kinds of sinnes among those which for the vncleannes and filthines of them, ought not to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among Christians.</p>

And this note brandeth a number of men, whose whole life hath beene nothing but a gathering of goods, and a sauing from himselfe of goods gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, vntill he hath so abounded, as he can see no bottome nor end of his wealth, and then the most nigardly person can be content to set out him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his, euen to riot and prodigalitie: as it was obserued in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous rich man, Luk. 12.19. when his ground was so fruitfull, that he had no more place to lay it: and when he had laid vp goods inough for many yeares, then he could say, <hi>soule liue at ease, eate and drinke,</hi> but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer before. 3. <hi>A withdrawing of the heart and hand from good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> duties,</hi> and neglect of the good of the Church, and of the poore.

and for his graces esteeme them aboue goods, crauing with Salomon, wisdome before wealth; the blessing of Iacob before Esaus pottage. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially labour to feele the want of Christ aboue all things; for this hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger would starue the other, and worke this effect, that while the foole gathereth riches to himselfe, and is not rich in God, thy conuersation shall either be without couetousnesse, or if at any time thou couet,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.21.</note> it shal be certaine, not vncertaine riches, which thou maist treasure vp in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and then send thy heart after them: while the other are fit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fixe the hearts of the possessors in the earth.

Forbidding to take his name in vaine, hee commandeth the holy vse of it: and forbidding to steale or kill, he commandeth truth, &amp; charitie; the ground whereof is this, that Gods lawe is not onely a bridle to restraine vice (as mens be) but also a rule and direction, and way, whereby and wherein to walke.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. The true knowledge of Christ is effectual, &amp; operatiue, for to know Christ right is to be a true beleeuer: Now euery true beleeuer, is 1.

<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18792:90"/>
the flocke. In the precept consider foure points. 1. The occasion of it. 2. whether it bindeth euerie Minister, and how farre. 3. the reasons en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing it. 4. the vse.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, the ground of it was the distressed estate and condition of the Church, which by reason of many tyrants and persecutors was driuen into many straights, partly perceiued in present, and partly foreseene by the propheticall spirit of the Apostle: not onely in the tenne persecutions then imminent, but also in the seuerall afflictions in the world, in which they were to finde tribulation euen to the ende of it. For as it is in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectible world, which is subiect to so many changes and mutations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it standeth in the vicissitudes of yeares, moneths, daies, &amp; nights: so much more is it in the spirituall world of the Church; which in the earth is acquainted with her winter as well as summer, her nights as well as dayes: somtimes the sunne of righteousnesse most comfortably shining, and imparting his heate and light, by his neere approach vnto her: yea, and sometimes there be two sunnes in this firmament: for together with the sunne of the Church, the sunne of the world affoardeth warme and comfortable dayes, for the full beautie, libertie, and glorie of the Church. But sometimes againe this sunne departeth in dispeasure, and carrieth the sunne of the world with him: then is a blacke winter of the Church, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but stormes and tempests, persecutions, and trialls one in the necke of another, and scarse one faire gleame betweene. Now in such times the poore Church is driuen to trauell for rest, and the innocent doue of Christ cannot finde in her owne land any rest for the sole of her foote; well may she flie abroad to seeke her securitie. In all which times euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is bound by this and such like precepts, to giue her harbour and safe conduct, till the dash and storme be ouer. Besides, suppose the Church in generall at her best estate; yet the particular members of the Church, are for most part poore and needie: and euen then subiect to many troubles, for keeping the faith and good consciences, by meanes whereof they are often driuen from house and home, and sometime are in banishment and exile, sometime in prison and bonds: all whom the Lord commendeth to the charitable and Christian deuotion of Christian men; and bindeth them to the cheerefull receiuing and releeuing of them in such necessitie: let them be strangers, yet if they be of the houshold of faith, they haue right to harbour and releefe: and in the practise of this dutie, the Apostle requireth that the Minister be the foreman.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, It will be inquired, whether euerie minister must be harbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hospitable? and if he must, what shall become of them whose liuings are scarce able to harbour themselues; and much more of the swarmes of our tenne-pound men, and verie many scarse halfe that to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18792:90"/>
maintaine their familie: it seemeth that euerie Minister ought to be a rich man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> It is not for me to prescribe any thing in the Church constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning Impropriations and Nonresidencie,<note place="margin">Euery minister euen the poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest may be harbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es.</note> the former whereof were they restored to the Church, and the latter remooued out of the Church, no doubt there were, but that sufficient ministers might be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently maintained &amp; furnished to hospitalitie through the land. But this I say, that the poorest Minister may not exempt himselfe from this dutie, neither is altogether disabled from it: a poore man may be mercifull, and comfortable to the distressed some way or other, as if with Peter and Iohn he haue not money, nor gold, nor meate to giue, yet such as he hath he can giue: he can giue counsell, prayers, and affoard his best affections:<note place="margin">Act. 3.5.</note> such cups of cold water shall not be vnaccepted nor vnrewarded of him,<note place="margin">Matth. 10.42.</note> whose propertie is to accpet a man according to that he hath, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that he hath not, where he seeth a readie minde.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.12.</note> Thus must that place, 1. Tim. 5.10. be vnderstood, such widowes as were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the seruice of the Church, were to be chosen of such as had beene hospitable and harberous: Now in all likelihood many of them, if not the most, were verie poore, and had no great matters to be liberall of: &amp; therfore the Apostle seemeth in the next words to declare wherein this hospitalitie might be shewed, euen by such as had knowne want; namely if they had performed bodily labour vnto them, washed the Saints feete, bestowed their best affections, and chearefull labour for their releefe: and thus might these poore widowes (like that widdow, Luk. 21.2.) casting in their two mites into Gods treasurie, finde more acceptance with him, then many rich men in giuing greater beneuolences to the distressed Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the reasons enforcing this precept vpon the Minister especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of strangers, he must take vp this dutie, whether they be strangers from the faith; that hereby he might winne them to the loue of true religon, which they see to be so mercifull and liberall: or else if they be converted much more, that he may comfort and confirme such as are banished, or otherwise euill entreated for the confession and profession of the truth: for if euery Christian, much more must the Minister be <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to those that are in bonds,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> as though himselfe were bound with them: and consequently looke what kindnesse he would receiue, if he were in their condition, the same to his power hee is to bestowe vpon them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of his owne people, vpon whom by this meanes he sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his doctrine sundrie waies; but especially if he keepe open house for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18792:91"/>
the poore Christians in want, he bindeth the soules of such receiuers to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the word; and encourageth them by his entertainment in their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Gospell. Which is the reason rendred by Hezekiah, why the people must giue the Priests a portion of their offerings, <hi>to encourage them in the lawe of the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Chr. 31.4.</note> And thus by both these meanes the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster by receiuing the poore members of Christ, becommeth a <hi>great helpe</hi> vnto the truth: which dutie is imposed euen vpon euerie Christian, by the Apostle Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. <hi>Ep.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the vse. 1. It teacheth that it were to be wished that the maintenance of euerie Minister were competent, certaine, and proper vnto himselfe, that he might haue wherewith to performe this so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie a dutie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of poore strangers, to stirre vp ministers and people to a liberall heart towards them all, but especially if they be such, as the <hi>land of whose</hi> owne <hi>possessions beeing vncleane, come ouer vnto the land of the possession of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iosh. 22.19.</note> 
                  <hi>wherein the Lords tabernacle dwelleth.</hi> Pittie it is that hauing such a clowd of examples in the Scriptures to lead vs in this dutie, yet that it should be so farre out of request. How fewe children hath Abraham the father of our faith among vs, who sit in the doore of their tent,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> to watch <hi>for and enforce strangers</hi> to receiue their best enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment? Few be our Lots, who will vndergoe any losse, any indignity, before strangers shall sustaine any harme at all: he will offer his owne daughters to their violence, he will vse reasons, they had knowne no man, and that which would haue perswaded any but the Sodomites hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed last, that they were strangers, and were come vnder his roofe. Few <hi>Iobs</hi> who will not suffer the stranger to lodge in the streete,<note place="margin">Iob 32 32.</note> but open their doores to him that passeth by the way.<note place="margin">Rom. 16.23.</note> 
                  <hi>Gaius</hi> hath fewe followers who was Pauls host, and the host of the whole <hi>Church:</hi> he was no inkee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but his house was as open as any inne to receiue distressed Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Fewe women of account imitate the Shunamite, who constrained Elisha as he passed by to turne in, and eate bread; that consult with their husbands to trimme vp some little roome for the men of God, and to set them vp a bed, and a table, a stoole, and a candlesticke: nay, I wish that euen the old Gentiles themselues might not be induced to the shame of Christians: who so religiously obserued this dutie, that of all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues they made their greatest god Iupiter the patron of it, and called him therefore <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reasons to be hospitable to strangers.</note>And as we abound with examples, so we might be plentifull in reasons and motiues to prouoke our hearts hereunto; but to auoid prolixitie I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> will name these foure. 1. It is a notable fruite, and testimonie of faith, which worketh by loue vnto all, but especially towards the houshold of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18792:91"/>
faith. So soone as Lydias heart was touched and she baptized, marke how heartily she inviteth Paul and Silas to her house: If yea haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>mee faithfull, come into my house, and abide with mee: and she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained vs,</hi> Act. 16.15. 2. It is a fruitefull and gainefull course of Christianitie; neuer any lost by it. Some hereby (saith the Apostle) haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>receiued Angels,</hi> as Abraham, and Lot:<note place="margin">Heb. 13.2.</note> and with them the one had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the promise of a sonne, the destruction of Sodome reuealed vnto him; and the other had deliuerance from the same. And surely such strangers as of whom we speake, namely poore Christians, bring no small good with them. That woman of Shunem that receiued the Prophet, had aboue a Prophets reward; the promise and gift of a sonne when she was olde: and the raising of him to life, when he was dead. Iacob be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hunted from home, Laban receiueth him, and is blessed for his sake. Rahab entertaineth the Spies sent from home; and not only she but all her family is saued in the sacking of Ierico. Ioseph beeing sould from home, Egypt receiueth him, and all the Land was preserued by him. Gaius his loue was testified to the Church in his time, but is commended in the Church through all ages. What good our selues haue gotten by strangers amongst vs, we should be vnthankefull not to acknowledge; the blessing of the poore hath light vpon vs, and we haue a long time fared better for affording harbor to the poore Saints of God which haue come a farre vnto vs. 3. Consider that our selues may become stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, for the earth is the Lords; and he may giue our Land to other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and make our selues strangers: and then we would looke for more kind entreatie, then a number shew toward strangers. And lastly, if that be a strong reason of the Lord, Lev. 10.19. <hi>Loue the stranger, for yee were strangers</hi>; it bindeth vs much more, who all of vs are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and pilgrims here vpon earth, not hauing here <hi>any continuing citie, but we looke for one to come,</hi> Heb. 13.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some may be dissemblers and wicked men, whom we may receiue for brethren and Disciples; and not knowing a man, I may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bused, and loose both my gift and reward. <hi>Answ.</hi> Christian wisedom, and Christian loue, must goe hand in hand. But here is a case in which charitie must ouerrule the matter, and that is not <hi>suspicious,</hi> but <hi>hopeth the best</hi> of euery one, where there is no euident proofe or presumption to the contrarie. And if thou receiue a Minister distressed in the name of a Minister, or a priuate distressed man in the name of a righteous man, and giue him but a cup of cold water with a good heart, in that thou thinkest he belongeth to Christ, let him be what he will at his owne perill, thou loosest neither gift nor reward: Christ hath vndertaken to repay it thee; &amp; thou performest a <hi>fruit</hi> of faith, <hi>which shall further thy reckoning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:18792:92"/>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. If strangers by this precept may challenge harbor, much more may the poore members of Christ amongst our selues. If a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, who is cast out of house and home for the profession of Christ, ought to be releeued, much more our owne, suffering in good causes, whether bonds or imprisonment, losse of liuing, banishment, or whatsoeuer they suffer, if for keeping good conscience. And the like is to be said of our aged, feeble, and impotent poore; who haue beene in many places of the Land pittilessely neglected and despised, so farre as (notwithstanding the wholesome lawes prouided in that behalfe) some of them haue beene suffered to pine and die in the streets, for want of harbor and releefe. The Lord lay not this sinne (among other) vnto our charge. Now when we call rich men to reserue some portion of their wealth to such godly vses, oh no they will cast their bread on no such waters, and they finde no abilitie to doe any thing this way; this were to weaken their estate, and to straine themselues so as they should not be able to hold out. Which no doubt were the reasonings of the Corinths, whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.9.</note> that he might stirre them vp to beneficence and liberalitie towards the Saints, wisheth them to consider what Christ had done for them: he strained himselfe, and was content when he was rich to become poore for them: Christ weakned another manner of estate for vs, then any man can for him: he left all his glorie for vs: but how few will leaue their shame, their trash, their couetous and voluptuous lusts for him? and to such as aske where they should haue to hold out if they should be so readie to distribute, he answereth in the 9. chapter, following the same argument, that the Lord <hi>findeth seed to the sower:</hi> and he maketh men rich to all liberalitie, vers. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Others <hi>obiect</hi> and say; but such a one hath offended me, or I know this or that by him, or he deserueth no such thing at my hands. <hi>Answ.</hi> But take heed this be not a churlish Nabals answer to Dauids iust re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, spoken out of partiall couetousnes, rather then as the truth of the thing is. Againe, let the person be what he will, looke thou on Gods image in him, this offends thee not, iniuries thee not, is not vndeseruing of thy loue,<note place="margin">Reasons to be readie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute to the poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ.</note> and the fruite of it: and if thou giue not to the man, giue to manhood in him, and consider that he may be a partner in the grace of life with thee. <hi>Reasons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Hereby thou art like God, <hi>he sparseth abrode,</hi> he vnweariably giueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> good to good and bad: straine thy selfe so thou expresse this vertue of his.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.9.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. What thou giuest to Christian men, thou giuest to Christ himselfe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If Christ were on earth againe, doubtles rich men would send to know his wants and store him with presents. Now we haue not himselfe with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18792:92"/>
vs, but the poore we shall alwaies haue to shew our affection to Christ in: who hath said, in that yee doe it to one of these little ones that beleeue in me, yee haue done it vnto me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. An hard man had rather lend to one that is able to repay him, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> giue to such an one as is not. If thou wilt not giue any thing to Christ, by giuing to the poore, lend vnto him, and he will become thy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because many would giue vnto others, but for feare of wanting themselues, marke the promise of blessing; Prou. 11.25. <hi>The liberall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> person shall haue plentie</hi>; and, <hi>he that watereth shall haue raine:</hi> and, vers. 24. There is that scattereth, and is more encreased: on the contrarie, he that <hi>spareth more then right, commeth to pouertie:</hi> and he that turneth his eare from the crie of the poore, himselfe shall crie, and not be heard: and, iudgement mercilesse belongeth vnto him that sheweth no mercie. I would to God all this would bring on our rich men, who will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for the honour of God,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.3.</note> but halfe the way that the Macedonians were come vnto: who bestowed to the vse of the poore Saints to their abillitie, yea euen <hi>beyond their</hi> abillitie:<note place="margin">vers. 5.</note> but till men learne to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues first to the Lord, and then to his Ministers (as <hi>they</hi> did) it will neuer be done: that is, till they giue vp themselues to obey God, teaching them such duties in the mouthes of his Ministers.</p>
               <q>A lover of goodnesse.]</q>
               <p>Hauing exhorted to the doctrine of beneficence and liberallitie to the poore Saints: Now the Apostle perswadeth vnto the ground, from whence that must rise, for otherwise it will prooue rather a shadow, or carkase of a vertue then a vertue or true grace it selfe, which perhapps may profit another, but not ones selfe. This ground is true Christian loue: of which the Apostle speaketh, 1. Cor. 13.3. If I giue all my goods away to the poore, <hi>and want loue,</hi> it profiteth me nothing: and therefore I thinke it is rather to be read, <hi>a louer of good men:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> seeing the word in the originall beareth well either reading. True it is, that these two are neuer to be abstracted one from another, for good men are to be loued for their goodnes; and whosoeuer loueth goodnes, loueth good men; as he that hateth good men, hateth goodnes it selfe; yet of these two, the context seemeth to fauour and carie vs to the latter. For as the Apostle would haue the Minister harberous, so would he haue his house an harbour not for idle, and voluptuous, much lesse vitious persons; but for <hi>good men:</hi> and besides, there is another word more fit to expresse the former sence, as <hi>Beza</hi> obserueth.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>

<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18792:93"/>
extendeth ouer all his creatures: but his speciall grace in Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he embraceth a small number in comparison of the whole masse of mankind; whom of the children of wrath, he chuseth to the adoption of sonnes: on whom he stampeth his owne image, and so maketh them both louely to himselfe, and worthy to be loued of vs also.</p>
               <p>Now for the better vnderstanding of the precept, two questions are to be resolued. 1. Whether good men only are to be loued, and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill? <hi>Answ.</hi> As God is <hi>good vnto all,</hi> Psal. 145.9. but especially <hi>to Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and those of a pure heart, Psal. 73.1. yea as he loued vs when we were enemies, but much more now beeing reconciled by the death of the Sonne: so is the commandement directed vnto vs, to loue, and <hi>doe good vnto all,</hi> but <hi>especially to the houshold of faith,</hi> Gal. 6. Besides this word seemeth to eye such an inward affection, as draweth into the fellowship, companie, and conuersation of another, in whom for some goodnes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, it delighteth: and vnto whom it would still draw some degrees nearer. Whence thus we may fasten the dutie more surely vpon our selues; I am indeed bound to loue all men, in respect of Gods image, humanitie, and common nature, and the common law of nature; seeing I my selfe, were I neuer so bad, would be loued of all: yea, and in regard that they may participate with me in the same grace of life: but how much more then such as are not men only, but good men, who haue Gods image renewed vpon them, Saints by calling, such as excell in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: how should not <hi>all my delight</hi> in comparison be set vpon these? If I must manifest my loue <hi>to all men,</hi> these may well challenge <hi>brotherly kindnesse:</hi> see 2. Pet. 1.7.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">Whether onely ministers must be louers of good men.</note>2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether this precept belongeth only to Ministers or no? <hi>Ans.</hi> It is here directed vnto the Minister, and commended to his pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise in the first place: as a speciall both helpe and ornament to his calling and person; both to shew himselfe a freind, and familiar companion of all them that feare God, (for such as a mans companion is, such is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) as also to confirme, encourage, and whet vp himselfe and others in all the waies of God, not only by his publike Ministerie, but in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate course, and conuersation. For by this meanes Pastor and people would not liue estranged, but by mutuall conuersing together, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing mutuall knowledge one of anothers course, gifts, and wants; might receiue also mutuall admonition, instruction, strength. And thus the worke of God would thriue in all their hands. And what an encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would it be to pietie and vertue, if publike persons would cherish those who are comming forward? Surely, if the Magistrates eie be on them that are faithfull in the land, as Dauids was, Psal. 101. and if the Minister be a companion of all them that feare God, as euerie Timothie
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:18792:93"/>
ought to be, we should see men flie <hi>as clowds</hi> for multitude, and as the doues for swiftnes vnto the <hi>windowes</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>But yet this commandement beeing no other in the owne essence, then that <hi>old</hi> generall commandement giuen to the whole Church from the beginning; as also that <hi>new</hi> commandement, that is, renewed by Christs appearing (by which although many lawes were antiquated, and reuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet this lawe of loue of the brethren was reuiued and diuersly enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced) it of necessitie belongeth to euerie one that professeth the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus in the most inward closet of his heart and affections, to carie such as are members of the bodie of Christ, sonnes of God, temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, and heires of the kingdome of glorie.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1.

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Many Ministers herein faile, who beeing men of corrupt minds and affections, oppose themselues against good men; if there be any in their parishes more carefull of their waies, more conscionable, more forward in religion then other, these are as beames in their eyes; the obiects of most bitter invectiues: in the meane time they giue their right hands of fellowship vnto loose and base fellowes, who ought to be as vile in their eyes, as they are in themselues: whom I wish timely to consider, that it was alwaies noted for an infallible propertie of a false prophet; to strengthen the hands of sinners, &amp; cast downe such, as they ought to haue spoken peace vnto from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:18792:94"/>2. Although the Lord hath by most straite iniunctions prouided for the welfare of his children, not onely in regard of their safetie, but their louing entertainement also in the world; with acknowledgement of all such offices of loue done vnto himselfe, and of which himselfe will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the rewarder: yet notwithstanding according to the prophecie of the Lord of the holy Prophets. In the <hi>world</hi> good men doe, and shall su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine affliction; their good shall be returned with euill to the great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of their soules; and the world which knoweth not but to loue her owne, taketh no notice of such, but to hate them, and hated they are and shall be of all men almost for the name of Christ. Hence haue such in all ages, were they Prophets, Apostles, or Christians, of whom the world was vnworthie, beene thought burdens vnworthie to be borne, or liue in the world. Here one <hi>Caine</hi> casts down his countenance vpon him whose works he seeth better then his owne, he cannot giue him a good looke. An other wagges his head at such a man, as the Iewes did against Christ, in derision of him. An other is readie to burst for anger and rage, as those wicked ones against <hi>Steuen.</hi> Sometimes superiours breath out slaughter and threatning (as <hi>Saul</hi>) against the Church. Sometimes equalls, yea and inferiours, trie them by scornings and mockings: so as Ieremie himselfe shall heare the reuilings of many against him. Nay, the base multitude shall tell Christ himselfe that he dealt with a deuill. And Satans mallice is so like it selfe in his instruments, that if it be laid in their power, they proceede to drawe the sword, and stretch out their hand (as Herod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iames) to take away their liues; and euen in killing them thinke they doe God good seruice. But how good were it for them to haue nothing to doe against such iust men? for who deale they against? or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom doe they rise vp? against simple men? no surely, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God himselfe, him they persecute, him they blaspheame, the apple of his eie they poare in. Now who euer rise vp against God, and prospered? or who euer kicked against such prickes, and brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed not himselfe? Is not he eternall, to outliue all his enemies? He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod the Archenemie of Christ dyeth, but the enemie of Christs ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies is euer liuing. And is not his wrath the messenger of death? can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not his power grinde his enemies to powder? or shall not his right hand finde them out?</p>
               <p>Againe, thou art for the present a cursed man, that louest not good men:<note place="margin">Gen. 12.</note> marke the terrible threatning, <hi>I will curse them</hi> that curse thee: so as what thou intendest against them, shall fall vpon thine owne head: thy sword shall pearce thine owne heart; Goliahs owne sword shall sunder his head and bodie; Haman shall hansell his owne gallowes; the Madianites that little feared to be slaine by the Israelites, shall be slaine
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18792:94"/>
one by another. For it is iust with God (saith Paul) to render tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to those that afflict his Saints,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 1.</note> that as they secretly hatch mischeife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the godly, so the Lord should secretly deuise and prepare righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudgement against themselues. And surely many a man there is, that carrieth secret plagues about him, some in his inward estate, some in his outward, some in his bodie, some in his soule, some in himselfe, some in his, with which he strugleth and toyleth, and turneth himselfe to many causes and meanes of his harmes, and it may be to some sinnes as causes; but neuer espie this curse passed from the mouth of God against his mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice toward good men, and so toyleth himselfe altogether in vaine. Were these things written in the hearts of men, how could it be but they should stand in awe, and dread (with wicked Balaam, who otherwise was willing inough) to curse where God hath blessed?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let vs learne to see our inbred hatred of good men, at least our want of loue vnto them: and seeing it, bewaile it, and bewayling it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.

                  <hi>Holy</hi>] This holinesse respecteth God himselfe, his worship, his holy things, as the word, sacraments, prayer, his sabbaths, his sanctuarie, in all which the Minister ought to be an example of holinesse, and yet not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in these, but in his whole conuersation also. The commandement is generall to all Gods people, <hi>be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Levit. 12.44.</note> which requireth both the internall sanctification of the heart, and the externall symbolls and profession of the same. But more necessarie is it yet for the Minister
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:18792:97"/>
to be cloathed with these robes of holinesse, both that inward which standeth in getting and keeping faith and good conscience,<note place="margin">Ministers must be araied with robes of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which consisteth in a religious and strict course of life. And yet this must not be so taken, as that holinesse is so essentiall to a minister, as that he cannot be a Minister that wanteth it, for Iudas may be a disciple and a deuill too: but that it is a dangerous estate vnto himselfe, and hurtfull to others for him to be destitute of it. How necessarie it is for men to put off their shoes, that is, their vnsanctified lusts and affectons, before they come to stand vpon such holy ground, I will take a little paines out of the Scriptures to demonstrate, and then make some vse of it.</p>
               <p>To omit the extraordinarie ministerie and Ministers of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the Prophets, some of whom were sanctified in the wombe, and others had their lippes touched with a coale from the altar to remooue their pollution:<note place="margin">Ier. 1.5. Isa. 6.</note> the ordinarie Ministers in the sanctuarie and temple were 1. Leuites,<note place="margin">This vertue was liuely and largely sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: in the 1. Levites.</note> 2. Priests, 3. the high Priest. Many things were required in the setting apart to their service the lowest of these, which were after a sort furthest remooued from God, whose seat was in the Sanctuarie: but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to the sanctification of the higher, and those that approached nearer or next of all. As, first the Leuites were inferiour to the Priests, as whose office was to serue vnder them, to helpe to carrie the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and vtensils of it, to keepe watch for the safetie of it, together with the holy vessels and instruments; to helpe them in killing the beasts for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, although they might not meddle in offering them vnto the Lord: yea as inferiours to the superious, they paid vnto the Priests the tenth of their tenths. And yet what a number of rites and ceremonies did the Lord enioyne to be performed, before these could be admitted to these inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our seruices, first in the tabernacle, and after in the Temple? As, first they must be of one peculiar tribe, peculiar by Gods owne election for the first borne of all Israel, Numb. 3.13. 2. Whereas the congregation was not numbred but from 20. yeares old and aboue, Num. 1.3. for till then they were not apt to goe to warre: the Leuites must be numbred euerie male from a moneth old and aboue, Num. 3.15. not because they were then fit for seruice; but that they must then be brought before the Lord, and set apart to his seruice euen from the beginning of their daies. 3. They must not be presented before the Lord before the 33. day of their age, for till then they were legally impure and vnsanctified, Leu. 12.3. but after this time they must growe on to the thirteth yeare, which was the first yeare of this seruice, Numb. 4.43. at which time they must be taken from among the children of Israel, and set apart to the Lord, Num. 8.6. And further in this separation there were two things more: for 1. they must be purged, and then consecrated. Their purification was, 1. by
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18792:97"/>
sprinkling purification water vpon them. 2. by washing their clothes. 3. by shauing the haire of their whole bodies. 4. by preparing two bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, the one for a burnt offring, the other for a sinne offering for them: see for these, Num. 8.8.</p>
               <p>Their consecration stood likewise in foure things. 1. After all this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, in drawing them neerer to the Lord, v. 9. 2. In the impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Israelites hands vpon them, freely giuing them from themselues to the Lord and his seruice, vers. 10. 3. In Aarons receiuing them of the people, and shaking them before the Lord, v. 11. as such as now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mancipated to his seruice, were to goe and come at his becke: as also such as who daily were to shake off that corruption which hindred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their callings. 4. By laying their hands on the heads of the two bullocks prepared; acknowledging the expiation of their owne sinnes, and in way of thankefulnesse now wholly offring themselues vnto that seruice. When all these rites were performed, they were admitted to administer, and not before.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Priests.</note> the Priests the sonnes of Aaron whose office was to teach the people the doctrine receiued from God, to pray for themselues and the people, to blesse them and offer sacrifices for them; had yet more state in their consecration: for besides many of the former rites, as imposition of hands, their shaking before the Lord, and the sacrifices common with the former: 1. In the election of such a one more care was had: no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed man, no man wanting or abounding with any member, no blind or blemished person might come so neere vnto the Lord. 2. In his consecration he must not haue his garments washed (as the other) but must haue newe garments put vpon him, Exod. 28.41. neither must he be sprinkled (as the Leuites) with holy water, but with holy oyle and blood from the altar: and thus must he be consecrated seuen dayes, Exo. 29.30. 3. In his office he may not lament for the dead of his people, no not for the Prince, but onely for those that are neerest of blood in his owne house, Leuit. 21.3. he may not marrie a whore, nor a woman di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced, or one polluted, v. 7. the reason of all this is, because he must be holy to the Lord. 4. In his failing and offending he must haue more clensing then many other men, before he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be admitted vnto his seruice: for his sinne cannot be put away without a whole bullocke, Leu. 4.2. and no more was required for the expiating of the sinne of the whole congregation, v. 14. and the blood of the bullocke must be sprinkled seuen times before the Lord for the Priest, as well as for the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation: implying that the Lord requireth as much sanctitie in one Priest, as in all the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. high Priest.</note> as for the high Priest both in that he was a more eminent type
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:18792:98"/>
of Christ: as also came nearer the Lord then all the other, euen into the holy of holies; he must haue peculiar garments made by cunning men, filled with the spirit of wisedome, euen beautifull and glorious, Exod. 28.3. in these he must be consecrated, in these he must stand before the Lord; in one part of which, namely, the frontlet which was put vpon his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, must be written <hi>holinesse to the Lord,</hi> that by the Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that might be most conspicuous. Againe, other Priests might not marrie diuorced or defiled women; but he may not marrie a widowe but a maid onely. Neither might he mourne at all; no not for his father or mother (which was lawfull for the other Priests) thereby to pollute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and the holy place. All which with a number moe such solemne rites, betokened a singular sanctimonie in such as were to be giuen vp and dedicated to the Lords seruice. Whence I conclude, that if in those that ministred but in a material Temple; that serued but in shadows, types, and obscuritie; that in comparison were so farre off from the ministerie of the spirit of grace, of libertie, of life, and so after a sort from God himselfe, was required such legall holynesse at the least: how much more is the truth of those representations requisite in vs, who serue in the spirituall house of God: who carie the substance and the bodie; and are so much nearer drawne vnto God, by how much he beeing a spirit delighteth in spirituall seruice before elementarie? In Exod. 19.22. there is a speciall iniunction that the Priests who were to come to heare the law deliuered, should be sanctified, least the Lord destroy them: much more then those that are the mouth of God in the newe testament, to deliuer the law and Gospel, should be carefull of their sanctification, least the Lord sanctifie himselfe in their confusion. For else those should not be such sure conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of the Apostle, where he dehorteth Christians from vnholinesse and prophanenes, because of their present condition: in that they were not vnder the lawe, but vnder grace: and that they were not come to mount Sinai,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14. Heb. 12.</note> but mount Sion. And if such arguments were strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to binde common Christians to followe holinesse, without which no man can see God: surely farre stronger are they to enforce the dutie vpon the minister, whose whole doctrine, meditation, speaches, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions priuate as well as publike, should sauour of the spirit of God, and of his blessed regiment in their hearts.</p>

               <p>And now (to end this large treatise) it wil be asked, But what if any Minister be scandalous in any of the forenamed vices, or defectiue in the vertues mentioned?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If he be not answerable to these Canons, it is plaine by the Apostle, that he is not to be called. 2. If he be called, and after prooue vicious, he must be delt withall as an Elder: 1. no accusation must be receiued vnder two witnesses at least, 1. Tim. 5.19. 2. when he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused of a knowne and scandalous vice, all possible meanes must be vsed to reclaime him. As, 1. by open reproofe, vers. 20. 2. sometimes by translation of him to such a place, as where are lesse meanes of that sinne; as one giuen to drunkennes, or contention, from a drunken and quarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous people. 3. sometime by a temporall deposition from his office, if there be hope hereby to doe him good. 4. after sufficient admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, censures, and trial, by a perpetuall deposition from his place: yea and further, if he still prooue incorrigible, by proceeding to excommunicate him, and cast him from the societie of the Church.</p>
               <p>And the rather, 1. Because Ministers are set ouer a people to edifie, and not destroie them. 2. Because the actions of Ministers haue a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret power, not to lead onely, but euen compell men to the like, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if they be lewd and wicked. 3. Weaker and meaner men for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest vices not repented of, must be proceeded against to excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: much more the Minister, whose scandalous life is infinitly more dangerous and hurtfull. 4. Such proceeding against notorious, insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and scandalous wretches (who neuer came in, nor are kept in by the Apostles canons) would doe good for example.</p>

whensoeuer any blast of heresie, tyrannie, false doctrine, or flatterie, shall rise against him; yet he may hold fast that faithfull word: which is therefore a sure ground of sound doctrine; and thence instruct and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the consciences of his hearers in all necessarie doctrine. Whereby it shall come to passe, that he (keeping himselfe constantly to this truth) shall be fitted fruitfully to turne himselfe to any dutie of his calling: that let him be to deale with either of those kinds of hearers; whether such as are obedient and teachable, he shall build them further and make them sound Christians by <hi>exhortation</hi> out of <hi>wholesome doctrine:</hi> or else such as are stubborne and opposite <hi>contradictors</hi> of the truth, these he shall <hi>convince,</hi> and with manifest reason put to silence.

Pet. 1.21.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> beeing of themselues, either rude and illitered men; as Amos an heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Peter and Iohn fishers, Matthew a toldegatherer; so as the great clarkes of those daies were driuen into admiration, to see the gifts giuen them; knowing them to be vnlearned, Act. 4.13. or else they were most fearce and bloodie enemies, as Paul, whom the Hebrewes could not beleeue, that he was become a Preacher of that truth he had perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, vntill the Lord gaue further testimonie of him, Act. 9.26. 3. The <hi>matter</hi> of this word, is an euerlasting truth: the <hi>Law</hi> an eternall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> rule of righteousnesse, as ancient as God himselfe: the Gospel an <hi>euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Gospel,</hi> Rev. 14.6. containing promises of eternall truth, which shall haue their stabillitie after heauen and earth shall be no more: besides such assured articles of faith, concerning God in the three persons; and the Church of God, that if an Angel from heauen should come, and teach another doctrine, he must be accursed. Moreouer such diuine prophecies, and predictions, together with the exact accomplishments, although some hundreths, yea thousands of yeares passed betweene: as by this one part sufficient euidence may be gathered of the faithfulnesse and steadfastnes of the whole. 4. The <hi>forme</hi> of it, which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of it with God himselfe, maketh it appeare that if God be faithfull, this his word must needs also be so: in that it resembleth him in his <hi>omnipotencie,</hi> for this power and arme of God neuer returneth in vaine, but doth all the worke of it.

This truth hath beene aboue all other oppug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by Satan, Antichrist, heretikes, tyrants, yet neuer a whit of it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer diminished: Salomons bookes may be lost, but not these of the true Salomon Iesus Christ. That the Scriptures were burnt in the Temple, and that Ezra composed a newe Scripture, is to be reiected as a Iewish fable: Ezra might put together parcells of Scripture scattered, and compose them into bookes. But where were Ezechiel, Daniel, Zacharie, Hagge, or what were they doing to suffer all the Scriptures to be lost in their times? or where was the watchfull eie of God, could it winke, or nodde, or not see, or not preuent the perishing of his word vtterly from the Church? 4. This word hath beene so certenly sealed in the hearts of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> elect of all ages, that where it once was harboured in truth, it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be shaken out by any kind of most exquisite torture and torment.

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This doctrine is of speciall vse both vnto teachers and hearers: vnto teachers it affoardeth a twofold instruction. 1. if it be so faithfull a word, to <hi>hold it fast.</hi> 2. to hold themselues fast vnto it. For the former, the teacher must looke that he lay such hold on it, as he neuer suffer it to be wrested from him: no danger, no fauour, no power, no subtiltie, may force him to vnfasten his hold: much lesse goe backe and recoile from it, or play fast and loose with it: or so carrie it as one that would swim be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene two waters but carie it and hold it out as faithfully and constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as becommeth such a faithfull word. Ieremie on this ground that he had a sure word, after he had beene smitten and stocked, he went not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

corners, nor behinde the wall to speake the will of him that sent him: but as one that had laid faster hold on it, in tearmes of defiance and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall application to the stoutest and proudest of them, he vttereth with much boldnesse and plainnesse, what he had in commission.<note place="margin">Ier. 20 2.7.</note> The like we read of Amos against Amaziah.<note place="margin">Amos 7.14.17.</note> The like of the Apostles thorough the Acts, and their Epistles: and all vpon this ground, that the Lord sent them with a faithfull word.</p>
               <p>And if reasons will perswade to this dutie, we haue not a fewe. For 1. what sound comfort can any Minister finde in life or in death, but in bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found faithfull? where was Pauls reioycing towards his death, but that he had <hi>fought a good fight, and had kept the faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.7.</note> 2. This faithfull word was not easily purchased vnto vs, but by the blood of many a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, both of Pastors and people, shed in our owne and other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: and should the preachers of it esteeme lightly of so precious and so dear a purchase? 3. If the Pastor depart or be driue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithfull word, how can his people hold it? he is guiltie of all their Apostacie from the faith. Let the Pastor receiue such a blowe, the sheepe cannot but be smitten. 4. Looke on the danger, and Gods righteous iudgement on such teachers, as esteeme of mens words and writings aboue that is meet, in the meane time not embracing this word in the loue of their hearts. God giues them ouer to beleeue and broach doctrines besides the word: all their learning hindreth not, nay rather armeth them to sticke fast to falshood and errors: and to defend doctrines of much loosenesse and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Especially the iudgement of God is come vpon the Romish Church to the vttermost, who because they lay this for a ground of their doctrine; that this word is not of it selfe faithfull and certaine,<note place="margin">The lesse cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the more certen.</note> vnlesse the Church, and Councels, and the Pope authorize it to mens consciences; and that any other word thrust vpon the Church by the former authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is euery whit as faithfull as this: hence is their whole religion a myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of iniquitie and delusion: hence comes in intercession of Saints, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of images, prayer to and for the dead, pilgrimages here, purgatorie hereafter, reuelations, masses, bread-worshippe, propitiatorie sacrifices, mixture of Moses and Christ, which is a doctrine cutting them off from Christ; who haue before cut off the authoritie and credit of the Scriptures which are the word of Christ: which fearefull iudgement let it mooue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie Timothie, and Titus,<note place="margin">2.

Such was the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie of the true Prophets: Ieremie saith, <hi>of a truth the Lord hath sent me, and bidden me speake these things:</hi> of the Apostles, who deliuered such things as they <hi>receiued of the Lord,</hi> and commanded vs that if an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel from heauen, or a deuill from hell should bring (not a contrarie, but) a diuerse doctrine from that, to hold him accursed: yea of the Sonne of God himselfe, who said, <hi>my word is not mine, but my fathers.</hi> What hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blasphemie then is daily practised in the Popish Churches? whose teachers calling these faithfull words a <hi>nose of waxe,</hi> send men to dumbe idols the <hi>teachers of vanities and lies,</hi>

Was this a faithfull word in Pauls time, and is it not so still? doth the sonne of the eternall father pronounce of his fathers word, that it is not onely true but truth it selfe, and that not one iot of it can passe or faile? and is it any other then the voice of Antichrist, which shall say that it is no certaine word at least to me, vnlesse the Church say so? Shall the spirit of God call it a <hi>sure word</hi> of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, and a <hi>word of truth,</hi> and shall we heare a wicked and lying spirit come out of hell, and say that this stabilitie and truth dependeth vpon man? whereas, let God be true and euerie man a lyar: and that if those men whom they tearme the Church, change their minds or any sense in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Cusanus.</note> so doth the holy Ghost also.

I answer, if the things of which they inquire be either false or fabulous, as that of purgatorie; or not necessarie to saluation, as that of Maries virginitie, the question is not of them; it is no impeachment vnto the Scriptures to omit them, wherein we see many of the words and facts of Christ himselfe omitted: but if they aske of things more necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, if they be of absolute necessitie, these are taught fully and expressely, as the substance of all Christian religion. But for necessarie circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and inferiour truth about them; the Scripture often (entending to prouoke our studie and diligence) is not so expresse; and yet is not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in teaching them; but by proportion and analogie. As in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of baptizing of children, it is by proportion and consequence taught in Scripture, though not in so many syllables: as seeing that circumcision was administred to children, so by proportion may children. 2.

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Apostolike men who writ the Scripture, had no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to write the word; or if they had, they had no intention to write a perfect rule to all the world: but writ <hi>occasionally</hi> either some historie,<note place="margin">Pro re nata.</note> as the Euangelists, or epistles and letters (as the Apostles) according to the condition of seuerall Churches, or men to whom they writ. <hi>Ans.</hi>

them with perfection; that whatsoeuer they can alleadge to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, they are either contained in the Scriptures, or they are not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>obscuritie</hi> of Scripture: We graunt not that the Scriptures be obscure, but that many things in them are difficult. The Rhemists vpon 2. Pet. 3.16. that all Scripture is difficult, especially Pauls Epistles; whereas Peter saith, onely that some things in Pauls Epistles were hard to be vnderstood, and not all his Epistles. Againe, they forget that the same Apostle Peter speaking of the Scripture,<note place="margin">2.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Some things in Scripture diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult how, and why.</note>Now when we speake with the Scriptures that some things are diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, we must take with vs these three caueats. 1. That this difficultie proceedeth either from the maiestie and high excellencie of the things of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God contained in them; or else from the lownes and weakenesse of man, whether <hi>vnregenerate,</hi> or <hi>regenerate.</hi> The vnregenerate person beeing in his naturall estate, is endued onely with a naturall vnderstanding, so as the things of God are beyond his reach and compasse; they are <hi>foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> to him, he cannot conceiue of them. The regenerate, although he hath an inward light of the spirit, which the other wanteth; yet these things euen to him are reuealed but in part; after an vnperfect manner, and in vnperfect meanes, vntill that perfect come: so as the best man is partly ignorant of the nature of the things themselues, besides his failing in the meanes, as the knowledge of the tongues, his studie, meditation, and labour herein. 2. Whereas they say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this obscuritie is in things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> necessarie to be knowne; the truth is, that in all things necessary to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Scriptures are so euident in one place or other, as he that runneth may reade the seuerall points<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 3. Whereas they say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> must be supplied by humane expositions and traditions. I answer, that the commentaries, and expositions of good men are not to be neglected, but yet so entertained as not simply arguing the obscuritie of Scripture; but rather our infirmitie and weakenesse, who cannot receiue a perfect doctrine perfectly. Againe, how were those purest Primitiue Churches directed, that wanted all those councels, decrees, decretalls, summes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; sentences, glosses, and determinations, which the Romish Synagogue would bind vs vnto as rules of faith binding the conscience? surely, they dare not denie but that there was more light, more grace, more zeale and pietie before such trash of theirs, which onely brought in corruption and heresie into the Church, then euer was since, or is euer like to be vnto the ende. We will also conclude this point, noting in one breath of Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine three errors: 1. that he attributeth that to the Scriptures, which is to be ascribed to mans impotencie. 2. that the obscuritie he speaketh of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:18792:105"/>
is in things necessarie to saluation. 3. that supply must be made by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane expositions: whereas the right opening of Scripture,<note place="margin">The sunne is seene by his owne light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> is by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <q>That he may be able to exhort with wholesome doctrine]</q>
               <p>Now we come to the ende of the former dutie, which is, that he who is to be set apart to this waightie function, may be fitted and furnished to all the parts of his calling: which the Apostle reduceth to two heads, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the seuerall condition of the persons, with whom he is to deale: for all teaching is either the confirming and strengthning of sound doctrine, tending to the conuerting and confirming of the tractable: or else the infirming and weakening of false doctrine; seruing to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and conviction of such as are refractarie, and gainsayers of the truth: neither of which can any man possibly fruitfully performe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diligence and setlednesse in the Scriptures, seeing that to these pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses he must hold fast the faithfull word. For the meaning: we must enquire, 1. what is meant by <hi>exhortation,</hi> &amp; wherin it differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And the difference chiefly sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in these 3. things. 1. euerie exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is teaching, but euerie teaching is not exhortation. 2. to teach, is more properly to propound out of Scriptures, &amp; prooue by the Scriptures things to be beleeued or done: to exhort, is to incite &amp; prouoke the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers to the beleeuing or doing of things, so prooued by reasons and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. 3. Teaching is a former worke for the enlightening of the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and frameth the iudgement: and exhorting is a secondarie work more properly pearcing the affections, and so furthering the practise. Secondly, what is meant by <hi>doctrine:</hi> that is nothing else but the word of God taught: for that same which is here called <hi>wholesome doctrine,</hi> is in c. 2.8. called the <hi>wholesome word:</hi> and to shewe the identitie of them, the Apostle ioyneth them together,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.3.</note> If any consent not to the <hi>wholesome words</hi> of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the <hi>doctrine</hi> which is according to godlinesse, he is puft vp. 3. Why is this doctrine called <hi>wholesome</hi>? to which I answer, that that is wholesome doctrine, which beeing well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared afore hand maketh the soule sound, and in good plight and liking: for it is a borrowed speach from the food of the bodie, to the meate of the soule, which is the word of God, here called wholesome doctrine: of which epithite something is to be spoken, but better occasion will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vs in c. 2.1.</p>

Now the teachers in the church, are either the great doctor of the chaire, who fully and sufficiently teacheth euerie beleeuer; and whose teaching is absolutely necessarie to the conuersion of men: or else his Ministers,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18792:106"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Would any man be taught to saluation? not hauing this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge naturally he must get him these teachers.

But if a man will play the trewant, and sit at home when Gods free-schoole is set open, despising the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ministerie, conceiuing that he may by his owne studie or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding attaine perfection;<note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, as this doctrine implyeth teachers, so doth it also learners, and schollers;<note place="margin">

                  </note> Teaching vs that we must all of vs become learners of this word and doctrine: for so long as there is doctrine and teaching on Gods part,<note place="margin">Euery man must become a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> so long must there be an harkning and learning on ours: and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both because that which is said of all knowledge, that it is infinite, is much more true of this, for Gods commandements are <hi>exceeding large:</hi> as also seeing in this schoole we are to become not onely more learned but better men. It may not therefore be with vs (who when we are at the best are but in part good) as many, who after they haue learned a while, giue ouer, as though they were both informed and reformed suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently: but we must be still profiting and going forward, and climbing as it were from on forme to an other: so long as we liue, still aiming at somewhat beyond: for we may not conceiue of Gods schoole as it is in mens, which are fitter for boyes and children, then men of yeares: a shame were it for an old man to goe to schoole: but here whatsoeuer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny an idiot say to the contrarie, that now they are too olde to learne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie man must waxe old in learning something daily: seeing the best man may farre excell himselfe both in wisedome and goodnesse. Thus Paul when he was an ancient scholler in Christs schoole pressed hard to things that were before him. And Dauid with other saints of God, prayed still to be taught of God, euen when they were well taught; as such as who the more they sawe, the lesse they could acknowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:18792:106"/>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> In our learning of this doctrine, we must examine our profiting and progresse, least we be such dunces as Paul speaketh of, who were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer learning, and yet neuer came to the knowledge of the truth. And then we profit when we like good schollers haue passed our grounds and elements: and as the Apostle speaketh, when leauing the rudiments and principles of religion, we are ledde forward vnto perfection:<note place="margin">Heb<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6.1.</note> and then are we ledde to further perfection,<note place="margin">An examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whether we haue beene as fit to learne, as this doctrine is fit to teach.</note> when wee haue taken out the two maine lessons of a Christian man, which Paul in euerie thing would be sure to keepe, euen <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>good conscience,</hi> by which two rules till a man be moulded and cast into this forme of doctrine, he is but a novice Christian, and a superficiall scholler in this schoole of Christ: the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of which implyeth the knowledge of the doctrine, and the latter the ordering of euerie particular action of life by it.</p>
               <p>Now the examination of our selues by these notes will reprooue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of vs as <hi>non proficients,</hi> who would be loth to be so deemed.

If a master should for diuers years together painfully striue with a boy, and could neuer get him out of his letters, what hope were there of his reading? and much lesse of any skill in higher mysteries of learning. It is the case of a number of vs. Many yeares haue the masters of the assemblies plainly deliuered doctrines, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the capacitie of simple men, yea often repeated them, and often beaten vpon them: yet a number that goe for Christians, are extreame ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in the principles of Christianitie. And whereas the Apostle impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that we may measure our owne ability by our fitnesse to teach others: how fewe of vs be there that finde any competent abilitie to teach euen our pettyes in our families our seruants and children? that cost and paines is ill spent, when after seauen yeares schooling a boy is not able to teach an other his letters: but many of vs that haue beene <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Further, whereas he that is cunning in his profession, he can speake of it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to good purpose, because he knoweth the mysteries of it; many of vs cannot speake to any purpose, but when any speach of religion is offred are as mute as fishes; yea are greiued to be drawne to any speach of such things, because our weakenesse is thereby discouered.</p>
               <p>Finally, were it so that we had proceeded but a little way in our profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> here, it would be with vs as with schollers or prentises, who beeing entred a yeare or two, neede not alwaies the presence of their Master or

In like sort many profane wretches debase the word in the Ministerie, conceiuing it as a vaine word without profit; and boldly speake of preaching, as of talking: and others mutter because there is so much preaching, plainely shewing by their speaches that they neuer knew the sweetnes of it in their soules, and therefore as yet haue no part in it, nor in that life which it hath brought to light.</p>

For as Paul writ of Christians, the slownes and weaknes of whom (he knew) required exhortation, as well as doctrine; so that Christian that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides the truth is, there is much knowledge euery where, and so little conscience, as if knowledge and conscience could not stand together: but if men did make conscience of all the duties they know, yet were exhortation still needfull: seeing nothing was more vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the Apostles, then to stirre vp in beleeuers such graces, as they thankfully acknowledged in them. 1.

                  <note place="margin">Then is exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full when it is grounded on wholesome do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</note> we note, that then is exhortation powerfull, and profitable, when it is firmely grounded vpon sound and wholesome doctrine; then it carrieth due weight with it, then is it agreeable to this apostolicall precept, yea to that generall practise of al the Apostles, whose manner was in all their Epistles; first to laie downe plainely the doctrine of faith and saluation, and then to perswade and exhort vnto the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement of it, and to testifie that entertainment by the fruits of faith, and loue. For example: After Paul writing to the Romans had dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the doctrine of <hi>Iustification,</hi> not by workes in the three first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but by faith in the two next; and of <hi>sanctification</hi> in the three next; and of <hi>predestination,</hi> in the three next: In the 12. Cap. and so to the 14. verse of the 15. Chapter, he exhorteth to good workes and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an duties, vnto the verie epilogue, and conclusion. The whole Epistles to the Corinths is a mixture of doctrine and exhortation. In the Epistle to the Galatians after he had disputed the doctrine of the righteousnesse of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18792:108"/>
faith, which the false Apostles had wrung out of their hands: after his manner in the fifth chapter and sixt, he exhorteth them to the studie of good workes. So in all the Epistles may be obserued, that after the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinall part followeth the hortatorie. And as for the particular practise hereof in particular cases, both in propheticall writings, Christs ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and sayings, and in the Apostles Epistles, it would be infinite to obserue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> As this Doctrine affoardeth direction to Ministers, to carrie their exhortations leuell with the doctrine truly raised from the word, that they be as goads to pearce and prouoke to dutie: which not obserued, the speach will be verified; <hi>a sea of words, but scarce droppes of matter:</hi> so doth it authorise euery hearer to examine the exhortations framed vnto them: that if they finde the Messengers of God exhorting them from wholesome doctrine; they may acknowledge more then a speach or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of man: euen such a doctrine, and ordinance, as the Apostle iudgeth fittest for the saluation of man. Which if any shall dare to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, as accounting it (with many at this day) a liplabour of man; or if any shall deeme and repute it an impotent meanes to raise men to the grace of life, I can say no more, nor lesse of such, then the Apostle Paul to the hardned Iewes, that put the word from them: that they <hi>iudge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnworthy of life eternall.</hi> One day to their cost shall they know,<note place="margin">Act. 13.46.</note> that all the force of the word lyeth not in the Ministers tongue; and that his words are more then winde, as they esteeme them, Ier. 5.13.</p>
               <q>And improoue them that gainsay it.]</q>
               <p>These gainesayers are of two sorts: either such as contradict the wholesome doctrine, by teaching false and vnsound doctrine, whether Iewes, Pagans, Heretikes, or false teachers; or else such as contradict it by their wicked manners, and conuersation, as a number of counterfeit Christians, who dare not open their mouthes against such a cleare light, and manifest truth, but in their liues: whereas it commandeth puritie, they are filthy and impure: whereas it vrgeth pyetie, they are impious towards God; and whereas it prohibiteth all iniustice, they are iniurious to men: and in one word, whosoeuer receiue not the word with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and subiection as it requireth, are in the degrees of this sinne of gainsaying the truth. And in the words the Apostle propoundeth three things to be considered of: 1. That all these gainesayers must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced. 2. that euery Minister must be able to conuince and improoue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 3. that he hath this abillitie from the faithfull word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> First, when the word is resisted, and gainsaied,<note place="margin">Ministers must resist resisters of the truth.</note> there must be no bearing on the Ministers part, who is put in trust to resist those that resist the truth. And hence are all our stirres and tragedies, in that this truth
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18792:109"/>
must goe away a conquerer, be it euen against Kings, and Princes, and the great ones of the world. <hi>Pharaoh, Ahab, Herod,</hi> must be gainsaid and resisted, though it cost the Messengers their liberties, yea their liues. Many men fret, and fume, that the Ministers are so bold and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and their sermons are too to censorious, speaking in effect the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Corah, and his complices, <hi>yee take too much vpon you, Moses &amp; Aaron:</hi> &amp; murmur against such truths as crosse their lusts: saying with the Iewes, they are hard sayings, and who can beare them. If the word say, they may not sweare with the swearer, nor be drunke with the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard, nor prophane the Sabbath, nor scoffe at religion, and the exercises of it, but set a watch before their tongue, and keepe the doore of their lips from filthy, idle, and scurrill speach: oh here are bonds indeed, fitter for gally slaues then liberall, and free dispositions. Come, say they, we will breake these bonds, and cast these cords from vs: and yet these men would haue the Ministers tongue tyed, and chafe and fume if they heare any thing they would not. But are you gainsayers of the truth, and must not we resist you? doe you rise vp against Christ in falsifying his word, and contemning his ordinances, and must not we arme our selues against you, sound trumpets, and proclaime open warre against you; yea must not we so weld the sword of the Lords mouth against you, as that we neuer suffer you to haue peace in your sinnes? And if any of you thinke much to be called a gainsayer of the truth, because yee acknowledge in generall the truth of the Scriptures, and for a need can make confession of all the articles of faith. I answer, It may be thou art not come to the height openly to gainsay, as Iannes and Iambres did Moses: nor as Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas and Demetrius; Phigellus and Hermogines, Hymeneus and Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus did Pauls preaching: but if thou secretly spurne against the word, or endurest not the guidance of it, thou art a gainesayer, and maist not look to be pleased in the Ministerie.<note place="margin">Notes of him that resisteth the truth.</note> And to know thy selfe a little better, trie thy selfe by these three notes.</p>

Secondly,<note place="margin">A minister ought to be a man of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> we note what a sufficient man euery Minister ought to be; namely, such a one as hath a word of knowledge in his mouth vpon all occasions both to exhort, and conuince: for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses he must haue a doubled knowledge, and as a good shepheard a double voice, one to gouerne his sheepe, which must be familiar vnto them; and another to driue away wolues: one to stablish and perswade the truth; another to preuent errors, and heresies: herein resembling Nehemiahs builders, who held a trowell in one hand, and a sword in the other, and accordingly built with the one hand and fought with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let a man consider of which of these two he will, and then tell
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18792:110"/>
me whether it be not a matter of great difficultie in any good sort to performe it: but both together will force the Apostle himselfe to aske, <hi>who is sufficient to these things</hi>? it is not euery reader, nor euery ignorant Preacher that can stand vnder this burthen. No, no, if euery part of the Ministers office require as compleate a man as that one: Isai 50.4. if the speaking of a word in season require a learned tongue: how much more doth the whole office require an Ezra,<note place="margin">Ezra. 7.6.</note> a man prompt in the law of the Lord? a workeman indeed, and such a one as need not be ashamed? And can we thinke that the Lord sendeth any other: doth he vse to send a message by the hand of a foole? surely if he send any, he maketh them first able Ministers <hi>of the new Testament,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.6.</note> 
                  <hi>not of the letter but of the spirit.</hi> In the old Testament if he raised vp any extraordinarie persons vnto this worke: what spirit? what power? what deepe vnderstanding? what resolution manifested they? as that they seemed rather pettie Gods then men; both in the exact knowing (although by reuelation) and making knowne things meerely to come: as also in the powerfull resisting of sinne euen in Kings themselues and the greatest vpon earth: Such were Moses, Elias, Isay, Ieremie, &amp;c. If ordinarie Ministers, they also are first fitted: yea though they were but inferiour Levites and Priests, both to be the peoples mouth vnto God, to put incense before the Lord, as also to be Gods mouth to the people, <hi>to teach Iacob Gods iudgement, and Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael his law.</hi> But if high Preists, they must be such as whose lips must preserue knowledge,<note place="margin">Deut. 33.10.</note> and such as who can resolue the people when they seeke vnto his mouth in the difficult cases of the law of God, <hi>for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts,</hi> Mal. 2.7.</p>
               <p>In the new Testament accordingly, if the Church haue need for a time of extraordinarie Ministers, such as are Apostles, Euangelists, euangelicall Prophets; such are raised, and to such is giuen by the spirit the <hi>word of wisedome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.

If ordinarie Pastors bee raised by God,<note place="margin">A dumb mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster cannot be Gods messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</note> by the same spirit is giuen to them the <hi>word of knowledge,</hi> that is, by diligence in the Scripture they obtaine such knowledge, as that they are able to make Christ knowne vnto others, although they be farre inferiour to the former. Where this word of knowledge is wanting, that commission is not sealed from God. The Eunuch could reade well enough,<note place="margin">Act. 8.31.</note> euen as many among our people can, and yet he could not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand without a guide: and how could he haue been a guide vnto him (except a blind guide) that could doe no more then himselfe could? nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reade, perhaps without vnderstanding also.

Whatsoeuer controuersies Christ and his Apostles met withall, they brought the deciding of them vnto the Scriptures, although they might haue otherwise confuted falshoods, and by their miracles haue confounded their aduersaries.

And to the latter, their practise is contrarie vnto Christs and his Apostles, as we haue shewed. As also the practise of the auncient Churches since: as may appeare by that memorable course of Constantine the Emperour, who commanded the Fathers met together in the Nicene Councel, about 362. yeares after Christ, to referre the great controversie then in hand against the Arrians, to the decision and determination of the Scriptures.

The reason is drawne from the description, 1. of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, in these two verses: and 2. of hearers, in the 12. The teachers are described by three arguments. 1. from their indefinite number, <hi>there are many:</hi> not two or three, who are easily set downe, but many. 2. By their adiuncts, which are two: 1. They are <hi>disobedient,</hi> or refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; such as will not submit themselues to the true doctrine, and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church. 2. they are <hi>vaine talkers:</hi> that is, such as beeing giuen to ostentation, and vanitie, contemne the studie, and deliuerie of sound, and profitable doctrine, and search out words, and matters, of wit, and applause, both of them of more sweetnesse vnto the flesh, then soundnes vnto the soule and spirit. 3. By their most dangerous effects, and these also are two: 1. Their <hi>deceiuing of minds:</hi> for which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly practise, he especially brandeth them <hi>of the circumcision:</hi> that is, either by metonimie, the Iewes themselues circumcised: or else Gentiles Iudaizing, embracing Iewish opinions, mixing the Law and Gospel; Moses and Christ; circumcision and baptisme together: making indeed an hotchpotch of religion, by confounding things that can neuer stand together. The 2. effect of them is, their subuersion <hi>of whole houses:</hi> that is, they poyson and infect whole houses: yea and where the grounds and foundation of religion hath beene laid, they ouerturne and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe all. This last effect is declared by two arguments: 1. from the instrumentall cause of it, and that is by their false doctrine, <hi>teaching things which they ought not:</hi> 2. from the finall cause of it, that is, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, <hi>for filthy lucres sake.</hi> Now these teachers beeing so many, so dangerous, and hurtfull, <hi>their mouthes must needes be stopped.</hi> Which is a common conclusion set betweene the two verses, as hauing reference vnto them both; as a common remedie against all the mischeife which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way may be let in by them: and therefore those that are to be admitted into the Ministerie, must be of abillitie to stop their mouthes.</p>

               <p>Now if any would shewe himselfe a true Pastor sent from God, let him ayme at these two things. 1. Gods glorie, not his owne: for to seek himselfe is a note of a false teacher: see Ioh. 7.18. 2. the raising of the Church vnto heauen, and not himselfe in earth.

By placing religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in bodily exercises, not in matters of spirit and truth, Colos. 2.20. thus did the Pharisies in their times, the Papists in these: and whosoeuer more vrge the decrees of men more then the commaundements of God.</p>

Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we haue in the Iesuites, the arch deceiuers of minds, and impostors of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the world. 2. It taketh the highest holds of men, euen the mind, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and iudgement; that the eie once beeing put out, and the light turned into darknes; it might cary men headlong remorslesly to all cursed practises, which necessarily resemble as they proceed from the former. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It ouerturneth all Gods order &amp; ordinances: for whereas the scope of the teachers calling is to enlighten mens minds, perswade their consciences, rectifie their hearts, so as they might growe vp in the sauing knowledge of God in Christ, and the liuely sense of their owne saluation: in a word, whereas they are to set and containe men in the right way, error in their minds causeth them to drawe men out of the right path, as this word properly signifieth.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what is this doctrine to vs, we all professe the truth, and loue it from our hearts, and therefore we hope we are fenced from decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, or beeing deceiued. <hi>Answ.</hi> But let vs consider, 1. That these are the last times which the Apostles prophecied of, euen perilous times, wherein many deceiuers should creepe into the Church,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4 1. 2. Tim. 3.1.</note> and many should giue heed to the spirits of error. 2. That these deceiuers of mindes were such, as liued in the bosome of the Church, among such as profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Christ and his religion. 3. That they lurked secretly, and that the Christians of that time could hardly of themselues descrie them, and therefore the Apostle is glad to helpe them, and wisheth them carefully to preuent them: and therefore there may be priuie impostors among vs. 4. That we hauing set doores open for them, we shal not want deceiuers: for whatsoeuer many men say, most men loue not the truth sincerely delt withall: nay, they desire to be deceiued, while they hate with a deadly hatred such Michaes, as would let them see their estate, and helpe them out. And is it not Gods manner of iust proceeding, when men desire preachers that will preach of wine and strong drinke, to send them such teachers as they desire, that he that is ignorant and filthie, may be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and filthie still?</p>
               <p>Those then that care not for the truth, shall haue teachers which shall be Gods executioners to lead them into error: that as by the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist the Lord reuenged and plagued the contempt of the light in the world: so also in particular Churches and places by false teachers, and pettie Antichrists.

Let A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab once hate Micha; the Lord presently consulteth who shall deceiue him: and if this question once proceede out of Gods mouth, the deuill is present, and so forward in the execution of Gods vengeance, as he shall preuaile against 400. false Prophets at a clappe, before he shall not fall by them. This truth is as a finger in the bile, and beeing rubbed will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps make Zidkiah take his fist from Michaes face, and say <hi>when went the spirit from me to thee?</hi> yet ceaseth it not to be the truth of God concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our selues, who so long as we giue heede to the spirit of error can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want deceiuers.</p>
               <p>Let men therefore professing themselues members of the Church, looke vnto themselues, and labour to knowe the truth, to affect it, to stand vnto it, if they would be fenced against seducers: for such there be, and store of such, seeing there is such store of the contempt of the light:
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18792:115"/>
indeede if there were no hatred of the light, there would be either no deceiuers of minds, or no danger by them, for they could not preuaile: but seeing there is so litle loue of the light, these must needs abound. Hence is it that of late yeares such troupes of Iesuiticall seducers of minds haue entred vpon vs; and haue beene bold (notwithstanding se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere lawes, some enacted, some reuiued and quickened against them) to skulke in ignorant places: and how can it be but that such places as want sound teachers should be haunted with seducers?

                  <hi>Paul</hi> thus notably describeth the Iewes by a principall adiunct, as elsewhere he putteth circumcision,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.7.</note> and vncircumcision for the nation of the Iewes and Gentiles, the one of which was circumcised, and the other not: in which sence also Christ himself is called the <hi>Minister of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15.8.</note> that is, not of the law, which he put an end vnto, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely fulfilled; but in that he was a Minister of the Iewes, within whose borders he contained himselfe, as he was not sent but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. Now the Apostle not so much meaneth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewish nation,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.24.</note> as the Iewish teachers, the teachers of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, such as are mentioned Act. 15.5. with whom the Apostles were alwaies exceedingly troubled: who, as Gala. 6.12. compelled men to be circumcised, not by any outward force or power, but forced it vpon them in hope of merit, as absolutely necessarie to saluation: the omission of which, they taught to be a dangerous, and damnable sinne: whereas indeed by the death of Christ, circumcision was now nothing, as vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision was nothing, neither any outward thing any thing auaileable to saluation, but a new creature within. The persons then whom the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle painteth, were such teachers as would ioyne Christ and Moses, cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision with Baptisme, and the faith of the Gospel with doctrine of the law to iustification. And these he boldly noteth, and nameth, both because there was an apparant vice conuinced; as also because it was such a one, as beeing permitted, would haue ouerturned the Gospell, the faith, and saluation of men. Which we will first shew that it was so, and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18792:115"/>
2. what we are hence to learne.</p>
               <p>For the former, the greatnes of the error will appeare,<note place="margin">Vse and ends of circumcision.</note> if we consider the vse, and ends of the institution of that legall Sacrament of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision. The vse of it (as of all other such ordinances, yea of the law it selfe, by which they were quickned in their times) was,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.1.</note> to be <hi>shadowes of good things to come:</hi> and therefore they all were to receiue their date, and death, when the bodies of things themselues appeared: The which would more clearely appeare in this Sacrament, if we should stand to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that which the Apostle generally vttereth of the sacrifices of the olde Testament (and as true in their ordinarie Sacraments) <hi>almost all things in the law were performed with shedding of blood:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb 9.22.</note> 
                  <hi>and without shedding of blood, was no remission:</hi> All which the Apostle there prooueth to be dated, by the shedding of a more pretious blood, then the blood of bulls and goates. So as although before Christs death, euery mans shedding of his owne blood was needfull to fulfill the rite of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet seeing Christs blood once shed, putteth an end to all ceremoniall shedding of blood, it must follow that this Sacrament must cease, because in Christs blood the circumcision of all was celebrated.</p>
               <p>Againe, consider the end of circumcision, which was either, 1. <hi>politike:</hi> or 2. <hi>diuine.</hi> In regard of both these, it must needs be ceased. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was distinctiue, to distinguish Gods people from all other nations, who in reproch were called vncircumcised; as Dauid in disdaine calleth Goliah an vncircumcised Philistin: the Apostle calleth it a <hi>wall of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> parting the people within the covenant from those that were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Which wall so long as it stood vp, they might contract one with another, especially in marriage: and therefore the sonnes of Iacob would haue this barre remooued, before they would match their daughters or sister to the Sichemites: yea they might not entertaine any stranger ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, but he must first be circumcised, whether he were borne in the house or bought with mony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> If it be said, that other nations receiued circumcision besides the Iewes, as the Ismaelites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, as histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries truely affirme. I answer, it was easie for the people bordering vpon Palestina, to take it vp from the Israelites: as the Moabites, and Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites: and for the Egyptians, they doubtles learned it from them when they soiourned with them 400. yeares. But yet ceased it not to be a distinction betweene them. For, 1. these receiued it not by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, but of their owne heads, by Satans mallice seeking to ouerturne Gods ordinance. 2. Not as a signe of the couenant, for God made none with them. 3. Not as a profession of faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the true God; for they claue still to their idolls: in all which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:18792:116"/>
respects, Gods people duly obserued it: from whom at first they tooke it vp by foolish imitation, and afterward continued it as a rite, and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from their fathers. Now who seeth not, that when the Apostle writ this Epistle, all such distinctions of men were ceased? and that Christ broke downe this partition wall? in whom now neither Iew nor Gentile bond nor free,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.28.</note> male nor female, but <hi>all are one.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second vse of circumcision, is <hi>diuine,</hi> and that is threefold. 1. To <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> remember Gods covenant made to Abraham and his seed: it beeing a seale of it on Gods part, and a signe of it vnto man: and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the name of the <hi>couenant</hi> it selfe.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> Now in this vse it must needs be ceased: for if the covenant it selfe be ceased, the signe of it is void and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. But consider what branch &amp; clause of it you will, this truth will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare; if that, concerning the multiplication of his seede as the starres, which was a temporall blessing, let the Iewes come now and say as in Christs time, we are the seede of Abraham, and Abraham is our Father: answer may be shaped them, that whosoeuer doe the workes of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, are Abrahams seede: or if that principall clause of the blessed seede, in whom all nations should be blessed, Elizabeths speach sheweth the accomplishment thereof,<note place="margin">Luk. 1.42.</note> 
                  <hi>Blessed art thou among all women, because the fruite of thy wombe is blessed:</hi> which words she vttered beeing filled with the holy Ghost, ver. 41. or in generall looke to the whole old cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the old Testament, it is after a sort ceased, and a new established in stead of it; see Heb. 8.8. <hi>In that he saith a new testament, he hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated the olde.</hi>

               <p n="2">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Diuine vse was to signifie the inward circumcision of the heart, wrought by Christ: and therefore called the <hi>circumcision of Christ:</hi> whereby he inwardly cutteth off the corruption of the heart, iustifieth vs, regenerateth vs, setteth vs into himselfe, communicateth all his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and benefits of them vnto vs: to all which purposes he once appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the flesh, and now in his owne bodily absence sendeth out his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.10,</note> This Paul calleth <hi>circumcision made without hands.</hi> Now how iust is it that when the circumcision without hands appeareth, that the other made with hands should cease.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. <hi>Divine</hi> vse was to represent baptisme, which was to come in place of it, in the new Testament, Coloss. 2.12. <hi>yee are circumcised, in that yee are buried with him, through baptisme.</hi> Now then when baptisme, which is Christian circumcision, is once instituted, necessarily must Iewish cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision which was a type of it cease. From which three ends, we may answer that maine allegation for the continuance of circumcision, in that it is called <hi>an eternall,</hi> and <hi>euerlasting</hi> couenant. But 1. the couenant is said to be euerlasting, not simply but conditionally, namely so long as the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18792:116"/>
couenant of it lasted; for <hi>gnolam</hi> signifieth not alwaies a time without all ende, but such a time as after a long durance may admit determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and expiration. 2. In respect of the thing signified, that is, grace in Christ, it may be said to haue euerlastingnes. 3. In regard of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall supplie thereof by baptisme, which is to last as long as time, but not in the ceremonie or shaddowe of it (as the false Apostles taught) much lesse with confidence in it as a meritorious cause of iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>All this hath hitherto let vs see the error and sinne of these seducers: Now the danger will be descried if we consider that of Paul,<note place="margin">Gal. 5 2.</note> 
                  <hi>If yee be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing:</hi> for what were this other then to denie the true Messiah, and his appearing in fulnesse of time? what were it but to reare vp againe the partition wall which is destroied? what else then to renounce the new couenant of grace? and establish againe the olde one of workes, which was to giue place to the new? so as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saith the Apostle, by establishing circumcision a man becommeth a debter to the whole law; which cannot but be ioyned with the fall of all religion, faith, hope, baptisme, and consequently the losse of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> The plainnes of the Apostle in deciphering the seducers so manifestly as they might be knowne; teacheth,<note place="margin">The greater the danger, the plainer must be the reproofe.</note> that where there is a common danger towards the Church, by meanes of false teachers, we are not to spare their credit; but to laie them open, as not onely their errors, but their persons may be knowne and taken heed of: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Paul nameth these deceiuers. And hereof are sundrie other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible reasons: 1. Because the saluation of the Church, and members of it, is more to be respected, then all Satans synagogue. 2. It is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that such should be knowne for feare of infection: for false tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> may do more mischeife in poysoning the flocke, then a number of priuate men can doe. 3. The Apostles tooke great libertie herein; as Paul nameth Alexander the Coppersmith,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 4.14.</note> and wisheth Timothie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of him: and Iohn in his third Epistle nameth Diotrephes for his ambition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and promiseth to decipher him more plainely, and so paint him out in his colours, as that the Church might abhorre him.</p>
               <p>But yet this text affordeth vs some conditions of such plaine reproofe,<note place="margin">Conditions of plaine reproof, three.</note> which necessarily must be obserued to the right performance of the same. As, 1. the error must be certainely knowne, as this was. 2. It must not be euery small error; but such a one, as 1. greatly impaireth Gods glorie:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2. greatly impeacheth mans saluation, as we haue prooued this to doe.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For otherwise if their errors were either lesse dangerous in themselues, or more dangerous to themselues alone (although herein they must be
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18792:117"/>
made voide of excuse: their wickednesse shewed them, and their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red damnation preached vnto them) if they did not hurt others with themselues, the true Pastors might with lesse danger dissemble their errors; and let them rot away in their filthinesse: but in the foresaid <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> cases there must be no bearing of them. 3. In the reproofe, Christian loue must bewray it selfe; as the minde and intention of the Apostle here (no doubt) was not to gall, or vex these deceiuers, nor to wrecke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon them; but carrie in his eye the care of the Church, and the profit of Gods people. Euery good action must be done well in a good manner, and in a good intent: and here especially the manner must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the intent, and that is, when such a spirit of meekenesse putteth forth it selfe, that euen the parties openly reprooued may see their good sought, in hauing their sinne discountenanced: and their persons rather discouered, then disgraced.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine noteth the simplicitie of some, who thinke it very vncharitable so to note open offenders in open reproofs, as men may carrie them leuell to the offenders, or impute it to want of discretion, or to some malitious intent of the discrediting of men; whereas besides that no such thing is intended, the propertie of charitie is more carefull to preuent the common hurt of the Church, then to saue the credit of some few men of corrupt mindes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Sundrie plaine reproofes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note>2. Whereas some idle and foolish heads, haue set themselues on work, to paint out some worthier men then themselues in their colours, and to picture out some sort of men, better then themselues, men of sounder iudgement conspiring in all the maine points of true religion, and of innocent and inoffensiue liues, with the black coales of enuious and slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous invectiues, striuing to besmeare them; these haue no colour of warrant for such a rouing and distempered practise. For, 1. they haue no calling. God neuer setteth any man on worke to defame his seruants. 2. Are such errors as are imputed to them knowne and conuinced: or liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and controuerted? or are they such as ouerturne religion, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? seeing they consent in the whole truth, and substance of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 3. Doe not all eyes which looke on such pictures, see the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the picturers to haue beene gall, bitternes, vexation, and wrecking of mens persons? so farre from the spirit of meeknesse; that the spirit of malice hath suggested them with words as sharpe as swords: and as Iob speaketh of the crocodile,<note place="margin">Iob 41.10.</note> flames of fire goe out of their mouthes, and sparkles of fire leape out: the smoke they send out is like a seething pot or caldron. 4. As the spirit of truth is a peaceable and meeke spirit, so neuer shall a man finde a bitter spirit conscionably vtter pure truths, neither indeed will truth Gods darling dwell with such.

lie then to charge Gods children with damnable heresies? Let all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie be searched, and we shall finde three things which must concurre to make an heretike. 1. The broching of something contrarie to the Articles of faith. 2. A departing from the Church vpon it, with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of drawing Disciples. 3. After solemne admonition, a stiffnesse in such error and faction. None of which if they can be found in such as to whome all are imputed. Let euery man iudge whether such boldnesse in any man deserue not more open reprehension and censure; whereby such might learne at length to spare the credit of such who are so farre beyond the reach of their enuie, as that they iustly pittie their weaknesse and solly; and not with them attempt any more the discouering of their fathers nakednesse, which were a good way to couer their owne.</p>

As for example: Circumcision in the prime of it, was an ordinance to seale the righteousnesse of faith, and for a time was worthily in such reputation, as that death is iustly threatned against the neglect of it; be it in Moses himselfe.

yea their owne rites, and traditions obserued meritorious causes of saluation: for they promise life eternall to masses, indulgences, auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar confession, vowes, pilgrimages, &amp;c. and so tread in the verie steppes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of these seducers. 2.

And thus when the Church shall heare what such persons can say for themselues, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be but vaine babling, and multiplying of words, flowing not seldome from such as are euen <hi>damned of themselues</hi> in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.<note place="margin">cap. 3.11.</note> And this practise is agreeable to that of Christ himselfe, who sometimes by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> Matth. 22.34. sometimes by <hi>reason,</hi> Luk. 20.25.26. <hi>Giue to Caesar:</hi> sometimes by a like interrogation and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Luk. 20.7. <hi>The Baptisme of Iohn:</hi> sometimes by posing, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Matth. 22.46. so set vp and silenced the Pharisies, Sadduces, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and others, as none could either answer him, or durst aske him any more questions. But when men are thus confuted by argument, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne with the sword of the spirit, and confounded by the power of truth, and yet still proceed to trouble the peace of the Church, and the faith of the Saints: then may the Church, and must proceed by cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and admonition, to enioyne them silence: the which if yet they will not heare, they ought by the Church to be driuen from the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of the faithfull:<note place="margin">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This ministeriall dutie requireth a great measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and a man furnished with gifts of varietie of reading, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of iudgement; euen a man who hath a storehouse in his brest. First, he must be well read, and skilfull in the Scriptures, that by them in the first place he may be able to shut the mouth of the aduersarie; partly by the expresse texts of Scripture: partly by harmonical, parallel, and sutable places, as by the mouth of many witnesses: partly by the analogie of faith, arising out of the whole bodie of the Scripture: partly by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of the speach in the fountaine: and partly by the apt knitting of the context, that there may be full concent with it selfe, the antecedents and consequents: yea more, he must be furnished with varietie of reading, euen in the workes and writings of men, that he may be able in good sort not onely to apprehend the state of the questions, and originall of controuersies, but also that he may refute his aduersarie, partly by the concent of the Church in all ages; and partly by the helpe of things that are granted and confessed on both sides; and partly by the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the patrons of errors cannot but vnawares flip into: for it is true of a lyar, or a patron of lies, that he had need of a good memorie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to all this knowledge is required a sound iudgement, that he may be able to inferre good and necessarie consequents vpon the graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the truth he standeth for; and on the contrarie, the absurdities and inconueniences which necessarily follow his aduersaries false positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Now alas, how farre are readers, and dumb men from this one part of the dutie of a Minister? how dangerous are they in their places? se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers may come, and doe, with open mouthes into their parrishes, they cannot stop their mouthes; nay in truth they are as the keyes to open them, and vnlocke them. Well were it, or much better with our Church, if <hi>Theophylactus</hi> his rule were obserued;<note place="margin">Haec si non pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, ne sis Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Hence we further see that it is rather to be wished, then ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, that all Ministers should be of one minde, and accord in the truth, and at peace among themselues. For seeing it is the constant condition
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:18792:120"/>
of the Church, to haue many daubars with vntempered morter, many vaine talkars,<note place="margin">It is rather to be wished then hoped that all ministers should be of one mind.</note> deceiuers of mindes, enemies to the crosse of Christ and the libertie of it: what must now in this case all the world sit still, and be at rest? must Christs Ministers be silent? and the Pastors haue neuer a voice to driue awaie wolues from the Lords foldes? must hurtfull doctrine be winked at, and suffered still to creepe in to the destruction of many? No, no; there must now be opposition and strong dissention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Ministers themselues.<note place="margin">Ier. 1.18.</note> Ieremie must set himselfe as well against Preists, as Princes and people. The Ministerie of the Apostles did spend much of it selfe, against the false Apostles that serued not the Lord Iesus, but their owne bellies. Christs owne Ministerie, though the Prince and author of all our peace, bent it selfe most against the cheife teachers of that age, who sought glorie, and praise of men: and thus must his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Ministers tread in his holy steps. If Paul had not strongly opposed himselfe against many learned teachers, Act. 15.2. where had the salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of that age laid? Let men learne therefore to be wise hearted, and get knowledge whereby they may rather iudge of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, then take offence at the diuersitie of iudgements, and practises of Ministers. But if any one be sunke downe so deepe, that he voweth to beleeue none of them all: neither will follow any religion, till they be all agreed among themselues, to him I will say, that this rocke was laid to breake the necke of his soule vpon: and a fearefull signe it is, that Christ himselfe is to him a stone to stumble at. For came not Christ to make debate in the earth?<note place="margin">Matth. 10.34.</note> came he not to send fire, desiring nothing more then that it should be kindled? came not he with his fanne in his hand to diuide betweene the chaffe and the wheate; the which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be wholly seuered till the haruest?<note place="margin">Matth. 3.12.</note> And meanest thou to be a looker on till the wheate and chaffe become one: or hast thou well ridde thy selfe,<note place="margin">Act. 18.17.</note> by beeing till then iust of Gallio his religion, <hi>who cared nothing for these things?</hi> I assure thee who wilt looke on whilest other contend for the faith, thou shalt be a looker on too whilest other goe into heauen, and haue lesse to doe in that businesse then thou desirest, because thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siredst it not when thou mightest, yea when thou wast gratiously invited, and desired to enter.</p>
               <q>Which subuert whole houses.]</q>
               <p>In these words is contained the second dangerous effect of these false teachers, declared by two arguments. 1. by the instrumentall cause; namely, false doctrine: for they teach <hi>things which they ought not.</hi> 2. by the ende of it; for <hi>filthie lucres sake.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The danger appeareth in three things. 1. in that they <hi>subuert,</hi> that is, quite ouerturne the saluation of men. 2. they subuert <hi>houses</hi> in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18792:120"/>
number. 3. <hi>whole</hi> houses. The first of these sheweth that these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers not onely shake men in the foundation of religion, but vtterly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe them; and doe as a man who not onely beates downe a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe, or a bay, or the side of an house, but diggeth vp the foundation: or as one who not only loppeth a tree, or heweth it down by the ground, but diggeth it vp by the roots, and quite supplanteth it: so doe these de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers quite destroy the faith of men, and turne it vpside downe: that is, not onely lead men away from the simplicitie of the Gospel, but whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and altogether from euerie part of the sauing truth. Thus is the word vsed among the heathen, whereby they expresse such a raging of the sea, as casteth vp and causeth to floate that filth and mire which lay at the bottome. <hi>Quest.</hi> But how did they ouerturne mens faith and saluation? <hi>Ans.</hi> By teaching iustification by circumcision; that is, the works and rites of the lawe. But will some say, could this beeing but one point subuert all? I answer, that fundamentall truthes are such and so linked and knit together, as breake one, and many fall: yea, some are such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing denied, all of them fall to the ground. A man that pulleth downe an arch of the Church, endangereth the whole; but yet the Church may stand: but he cannot digge vp the lowest stones of the foundation, but all commeth to ruine. Of these the Apostle mentioneth two like the two pillars which Sampson pulling downe the whole house fell: the one that of the <hi>resurrection,</hi> which beeing denied, all preaching,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.14.</note> and all faith is in vaine: the other is this of seeking righteousnes elsewhere then in Christ, who is <hi>Iehovah our righteousnesse:</hi> for this makes <hi>grace no more grace,</hi> and Christ to haue <hi>died in vaine.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.21.</note> Whence by the way note the dangerous estate of such as liue and die essentiall members of the Church of Rome, who by their doctrine of merit, and iustification by works are subuerted, and plucked vp by the rootes, and turned of their saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But if this be so,<note place="margin">Whether a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be saued that erreth in a fundamentall point.</note> whether may a man be saued that erreth in a fundamentall point of religion, or in such a one as by consequent raseth the foundation?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> The things which all Christians are bound to beleeue may be reduced to two heads. The former are such principles as make the rule of faith, so neerely touching the matter of saluation, as that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be saued vnlesse he knowe and beleeue them: for all will confesse that he that must be ordinarily saued, must in some measure knowe the causes, the matter, the obiect, the manner, the end, and meanes of it. If God I say ordinarily saue him, he must knowe the platforme of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion. As for example: 1. <hi>God</hi> in vnitie of dietie, and trinitie of person: for vnlesse he knowe God in Iesus Christ, there is no life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. 2. <hi>himselfe</hi> in the guiltines, and vnder the curse of sinne; seeing
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18792:121"/>
Christ came to call none but sinners to repentance: and hunger after the meanes of deliuerance, for the waters of the well of life are giuen one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to such as thirst after them. 3. The <hi>meanes,</hi> as that without <hi>shedding of blood there is no remission of sinne,</hi> and consequenly that the Sonne of God must take the nature of man, suffer in that nature, pay the price, and beare the curse of sinne: whose powerfull victorie ouer sinne &amp; death manifested in his resurrection &amp; ascension vnto his father, applied by faith to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer, shall fully acquit &amp; discharge him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wrath at his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againe to iudgement. These things must be knowne, I speake not of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge, but so much as there must be an expresse beleefe of these things: for he that <hi>beleeueth not in the Sonne of God, shall not see life:</hi> and consequently in some sort what neede he hath of Christ, and what Christ hath done and suffered for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there are other truths which are consequents deduced from the former: and these are of two sorts. Some things are so clearely dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as by the neere dependance with the former, the consequent is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily seene. For example: that out of the Church is no saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that faith is ordinarily by the word preached, &amp;c. all which must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be expressely beleeued, on condition, if God make their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the former to appeare: For I doubt not but that God not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing them, many thousands are saued in the ignorance of verie many such truthes: but we may not hereon build our ignorance, who haue so many meanes of reuelation:<note place="margin">Aliud est non credere aliud nolle credere.</note> our vnbeleefe is not onely damnable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause beeing bound to beleeue we cannot, or doe not, but in that we will not, but refuse the meanes of knowledge and faith. The other kinde of deriued truthes are further remooued, and not so cleare: as concerning the rest of the fathers before Christ, the locall dissent of Christ into hell, &amp;c. such as these a man may without danger be ignorant in, yea and erre also, so it be without pertinacie and obstinacie.

And the reason hereof is, 1. because publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and directly, they dare not denie the Lord Iesus, nor his holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nor the truth plainly deliuered from that, for then the light would discouer them, so as the simplest could scarce lie open vnto them: and therefore they must first insinuate themselues, and then by addition, and sowing of their owne, both depraue and denie the truth. 2. The verie nature of error (beeing the child of darkenes) is to flie the light: and as the adulterer watcheth for the twilight, so doth he that adulterateth the truth.</p>

And surely truth will neuer flourish in the Church and in publike, till it be more heartily, and with better welcome entertained in families. We wish good lawes, and by Gods blessing many there are for the Church: but were there none to our hands, euery Christian should be a law to himselfe, and all that is within his gates. Let vs make good orders and obserue them in our families, and thus our houses shall become Churches.

The holy men laid not their loue aside in their sharpest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions: Isai charged the Iewes, that their <hi>faithfull citie was become an harlot,</hi> that the people were become <hi>murtherers,</hi> their Princes <hi>rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> and all of them the enemies of God,<note place="margin">Isa. 1.21.</note> of whom he would be eased and avenged: but what was Isay now their enemie? see cap. 24.16. how pitifully affected he was toward them, and his sorrow for them was such, as euen brought him into a consumption, <hi>my leanenes, my leanenes, wo is me for the trangressors haue sore offended.</hi> Ieremie telleth them, cap. 3.13. that they were rebellious against God, and that they scattered their wayes to strange gods vnder euerie greene tree<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and were disobedient children: and yet cap. 4.19. he so taketh their miserie to heart, as that he crieth out, <hi>oh my belly, my belly, I am pained at the verie heart, my heart is troubled within me, I can not be still.</hi> And when cap. 9.2. he had desired a place apart, that he might neuer come among them, they beeing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>adulterers, an assemblie of rebels, and proceeded daily from euill to worse</hi>; yet to shew that his soule abhorred them not, neither that he had cast them out of his affection, he tells them in cap. 13.17. that if <hi>they would not heare, his soule should weepe in secret, and his eies droppe downe teares for them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So for a Minister to charge a people with knowne and open sinnes, it is not euer a signe of malice, nor a sting of bitternesse,<note place="margin">Exhibete vos matres fovendo, patres corripi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo: extendite vbera, sed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducite verbera.</note> but rather a sweet wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of loue. Hardly can we perswade men of our loue in this case: nay, euen the Apostle himselfe who spake with ineuitable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was glad to vse many protestations, prefaces, and apologies, to perswade men of it: as, 1. Cor. 4.14. when he had told the Corinths plainly of their ingratitude, who suffered him to be hungrie, naked, reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp;c. is glad to adde a defence for himselfe, <hi>I write not these things to shame you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as my beloued children I admonish you.</hi> So when we deale plainly, and let men see themselues and their wayes, we cannot perswade them we loue them: but for our selues, our owne consciences must be our brasen wall, if we be not entertained and approoued in other mens: we must doe our dutie, and tell Israel his sinne, Ezec. 18. And although it would doe many good to see vs silenced, and stopped in the course of
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18792:125"/>
our diligence, yet would it doe them no good to see vs damned for our negligence towards them. Oh saith one, this preacher is euer speaking of me, he hath some spight at me: and therefore I cannot abide to heare him. Oh but whosoeuer thou art, learne to suffer the word of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reproofe, for it is a signe of an heart in the gall of bitternesse, to impute malice, and vncharitablenes to such Ministers as crie out against the knowne sinnes of it, and to account of preaching (as many doe) but rayling. Such a one was Ahab, who cried out of Eliah as his enemie, because he findeth out his sinne: such are the hearts of such brutish men, who will be at defiance with God, and the seruants of God christianly admonishing or reproouing them, and then they crie out, there is no loue in them: which is all one to say, that vnlesse we flatter them, and partake with them in their sinnes, there is no loue in vs. Iohn Baptist dealt rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with those that came to his baptisme, <hi>Oh generation of vipers:</hi> and yet who durst say, that that holy man hated them? and yet with vs it is no good diuinitie, if we couer not the sinnes that are as openly committed as Absolons, in the sight of all Israel: other men may and can speake of sinnes and impieties; and yet God must be dumbe; they can see them, but God must not: other men can openly speake of them in their houses, shops, fields, and markets, and yet we may not mention them for feare of forfeiting all our loue. But we must much more take vp that dutie which euerie priuate man is bound vnto: <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but plainely reprooue him, and suffer him not to sinne:</hi> Wee may not hate you so much, as not deale plainely with you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, note that howsoeuer the Apostle dealeth plainly, yet he dealeth wisely, and vseth a preface to cut off all the preiudice of the truth he deliuereth: and is a grace to be imitated of all Ministers, who ought prudently to temper their zeale with wisedome, so suppling and asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their reproofes, as they may appeare to proceede from loue. When the Apostle was to write of the reiection of the Iewes, and the calling of the Gentiles;<note place="margin">Rom 9.1.</note> least he should seeme to speak of any sinister affection, or from hard conceit of the Iewes, he cutteth off all such suspition, by a large preface, in which he attesteth by an oath, that he so embraced his countriemen the Iewes in the most inward affection of his loue, as he could haue beene contented to haue beene accursed for them: and in Rom. 10.1. beeing to deliuer the true cause of their reiection, which was the stablishing of an humane righteousnes, he beginneth with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation,<note place="margin">A minister must be wise in his plainnes.</note> that his hearts <hi>desire and prayer to God was, that Israel might be saued.</hi> And great reason is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Ministers should thus practise this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wisedome commended vnto them by Christ himselfe. 1. Because they are as sheepe among <hi>wolues,</hi> that is, satanicall instruments armed
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:18792:125"/>
with serpentine subtiltie, watching all aduantages to depraue their best actions, vndertaken with best deliberation, and on the best grounds. 2.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> In regard of the Gospel, which the aduersarie is readie to blaspheame, and smite, and wound through their sides. 3. In respect of those that are without, that they seeing the wisedome of God in the course of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> doctrine and liues, may thereby be wonne to the loue of the truth, Col. 4.3. Now this wisdome is not fleshly pollicie as maketh men idle lookers on, for feare of danger, but to walke circumspectly, still going on in the good way of life, and not rushing headlong, but discreetly looking to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie steppe: which Salomon calleth the <hi>pondering of the pathes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Let Ministers seeing they haue so many eies vpon them, pray for vnderstanding hearts, and seeing they naturally want this wisedome let them aske it of God, that it may as Salomon saith, <hi>make their faces to shine euery where:</hi> shewing wisedome as well as zeale in reproofes, cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, in speaking of euents in the Church, and Land: and the rather, seeing euen in Gods causes, we may not be too forward.<note place="margin">Hest. 4.11.</note> Good Hester in her warmest loue to her selfe and people who were Gods people, all of them sold to the sword, may not yet rashly step to Ahashuerosh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore she had considered of the rigour of the law, which was sure to be so much the more seuerely executed, by how much it was more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for the Kings safetie; also whether she was in fauour and grace, not hauing beene called of 30. daies: and especially she and her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had fasted and praied, and consulted with the Lord. Nay more, Peter must not rashly draw his sword, and strike to saue Christs own life: two worthy examples for our imitation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. People must also commend their Ministers to the Lords direction, and whosoeuer stand in good causes, that the Lord who is rich in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, would giue them wisedome in all things.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what kinde of Prophet was he, or how was he and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heathenish prophets distinguished from the true Prophets of God? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Prophets of God were of two sorts. First, such as were more properly so called, who beeing extraordinarily raised, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired by Gods spirit, did reueale some parts of the will of God, which he intended to doe in, and for his Church for time to come: such were Isay, Ieremie, and many other in the old Testament vntill Christ the cheife Prophet and accomplisher of all prophecies appeared; but verie few after. The second sort of true Prophets were such as onely did teach, and interpret the holy Scriptures; and ordinarily had not adioyned the foretelling of things to come, but vpon some speciall extraordinarie occasion: and of these were many both in the old and new Testament. In the old,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 19.20.</note> such were the companie of Prophets, among whom Saul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied: and the children and sonnes of the Prophets, who (as it is like) were such as studied, expounded, and more accuratly explaned the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Moses, and kept the doctrine deliuered by Moses vncorrupt in the Church, although the masters and those which were more eminent had both these gifts, such as Eliah, Elisha; and the sonnes of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets so farre as they were emploied and sent by these: as we reade, that the young Prophet knew not that Iehu was to be annointed King, till E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha told him.<note place="margin">2. king 9.1.</note> In the new Testament the Apostle bringeth all ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall and ecclesiasticall duties, of ecclesiasticall persons to, 1. Prophecie, 2. Ministerie, Rom. 12.7. the former of which is nothing but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a gift of teaching in the Church, applying sound doctrine out of the word to exhortation, edification, consolation, 1. Cor. 14.13. Both of these are truly called diuine Prophets: both of them beeing raised of God, gifted by God, dealt in the things of God, and endeauored to lead men vnto God.</p>
               <p>As for the other, such as were the oracles of the Gentiles, whether that of Apollo at Delphos: or of other groaues, caues, dennes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and woods very frequent amongst them;<note place="margin">Differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Prophets of God, and the Prophets of the Gentiles.</note> or else the southsayers, such as were Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis, the Sibills, and this Epimedes, these consent almost in nothing with the former, for they differ in all the causes. 1. Whereas the former spake by instinct of the holy Ghost, and consequently whatsoeuer they spake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> must needs come to passe, in that manner, and those circumstances in which it was deliuered, the which the Lord maketh a note of a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:18792:126"/>
These latter spake by instinct of Satan, who beeing a lying spirit from the beginning, was often a lying spirit in their mouthes, but that he couered his errors by speaking in likelihoods, and amphobologyes; and the things that came to passe, seldome came to passe as they were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the meanes whereby the Lord communicated his will, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> either more <hi>generall,</hi> or more <hi>speciall:</hi> the former was either <hi>vision</hi> to those that were awake; or <hi>dreame</hi> to them asleepe:<note place="margin">Numb. 12.6.</note> the latter was by word of mouth, or face to face. But the deuill vseth all manner of tooles as meanes to deceiue; all elements, fire, ayre, earth, water; so beasts, birds, starres, lottes, herbes, windes, and words, that looke how many kinds of creatures there be, so many kinds of diuination there are, so infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite is delusion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas the matter of the former are the great things of God, and of them the maine, the foretelling of Christ the Messias and Sauiour of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the world: the latter commonly dealt in things of men: as publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate euents, of peace, and warre, &amp;c. in which also the deuill himselfe could but gesse: but as for God and Christ, he shut their mouthes, vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that Christ should euen thus be heard of among the heathen. Or if (as may be obiected of the Sibyls) some of them did vtter some things concerning Christ, which Satan had snatched and stollen from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Moses, these were so disguised, and coloured, as the naturall face of that truth could neuer be beheld; nay euen themselues vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not the things they vttered; and therefore could not vtter them with purpose, thereby to make Christ knowne to the world, and much lesse to establish the true worship of God in Christ, as the true Prophets did. What other endes the deuill had in it, it were too long here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whereas the former receiued their reuelations into meeke and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> wise hearts, beeing gratious, and prudent, and not madde men: the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter neuer powred out their oracles, but when they were rapt into a trance or madnes; and knew not what they said or did. Whereby it appeareth, that they were meere instruments and organs of Satan, by whose tongues he spake; the resemblance whereof may be seene at this day in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniakes possessed by the deuill. If any here obiect,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> that Iohn was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished in spirit on the Lords day: and that the spirit also rushed on Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel, on Daniel; and so this was no difference betweene them. I answer,<note place="margin">Dan. 8.27.</note> that farre were these holy men from beeing meere passiue instruments, or as blocks and stones, as the other were: they were indeede meere men, and such as when Gods greatnes, and glorious maiestie was more then ordinarily manifest; were verie much affected, and almost swallowed vp
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18792:127"/>
of it; and almost rauished, and out of themselues, as Paul confessed of himselfe: but neither were they madde, nor sensles, nor foaming, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, nor ignorant what befell them; but with knowledge, faith, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, wisedome, and affection, receiued the things of God, which they were to deliuer againe afterward to the vse of the Church.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Whereas the former euer serued the vse of the Church, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to lead men to God, furthering them in faith and obedience: the latter onely serued the vanitie and curiositie of men: and although they could not well lead men further from God then they were, yet they the more detained them from seeking after the true God. Thus the difference plainly appeareth, which hath giuen good light to the vnderstanding of the place.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But whether did Epimenides vtter this as a prophecie? <hi>Ans.</hi> No, vnlesse we conceiue him as a Prophet in the generall acceptation of the word. For, 1. the deuill is not willing, except he gaine more by it, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> rebuke sinne, of which himselfe is the patron. 2. He speaketh not of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a thing to come, but of that which was present, and past. 3. He was not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> ignorant what he writ here, but by the light of nature, as other Poets did, taxed these vices which he had obserued very enormious. And hence we may obserue two instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The Gentiles had their Prophets, and Poets, such as was Epimenides,<note place="margin">The Gentiles had their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets so called to witnes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tie.</note> which were sufficient witnesses against their impietie. And neuer were any people so rude and barbarous, among whom God had not sufficient witnesses to condemne them. Which appeareth plainely thus. First, without themselues they had three things to condemne them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Their Philosophers, Poets, Orators, and wisemen, of whome what vice was it which was not brought into disgrace? what vertue was vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded? that a man may safely say of some of them, that they left vnto posteritie more clearenes,<note place="margin">So Bucer said of Seneca.</note> and prints of diuinitie, then all the bookes of the schoolemen, put together. 2. their <hi>prouerbs,</hi> and voice of men pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> against them, as this against the <hi>Cretians</hi> was a prouerbiall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. 3. <hi>The works of God,</hi> Rom. 1.20. Act. 14.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Secondly, within themselues they had two things. 1. <hi>Naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For Paul in Rom. 1.18. saith of the Gentiles, that they detained <hi>the truth of God in vnrighteousnes.</hi> Where by the truth of God, is not meant euery truth in generall, nor yet the truth of his written word: but that light which remaineth in the nature of man after the fall, called the <hi>lawe of nature,</hi> and the <hi>lawe of nations:</hi> which light they by their iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, impietie, profanenesse, and superstition did seeke to oppresse, and extinguish, and so detaine as a captiue in the darke dungeon of their hearts. And v. 31. he affirmeth of them, that <hi>they knewe the law of God
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18792:127"/>
by nature</hi>; that is, not the lawe written, but a certaine generall and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure knowledge, concerning God, and themselues, whereby they were conuinced of those generall notions; that there is one God; that this one God is to be worshipped, the which euen idolatrie it selfe prooueth; that this worship must rather be in spirit then bodily; that they might not doe to others, that which they would not suffer of others; that euerie one should haue his owne giuen him; that adulterie and vnchast lusts were to be avoided; these things they knewe, called <hi>the lawe of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But doe you ascribe the knowledge of God to the naturall man, are not many Scriptures against it? <hi>Ans.</hi> Seeing the Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributeth both knowledge and ignorance of God, to the naturall man, we shall vnderstand both the better by distinguishing the knowledge of God: which is 1. either naturall and generall, or 2. supernaturall and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed. The former is gotten and encreased by the light of nature, and things created: the latter is made knowne in the word: the former a man may haue, and yet vanish away in his imaginations, and be no better then a flat Atheist, without God in the world: the latter is neither idle nor vanishing, but forceth to glorifie God as God, by louing, fearing, invocating, and obeying him. The vse of the former is onely to make men excuseles in their iust damnation, Rom. 1.20. of the latter, to raise vp men to the sight and fruition of their saluation: both mentioned, Gal. 4.8, 9. The former the Scripture scarse vouchsafeth the name of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: and so denying knowledge to the naturall man, it speaketh of that supernaturall knowledge, which Salomon saith is too high for a foole; which onely deserueth the name of knowledge: 1. Cor. 2.17. <hi>The naturall man knoweth not the things of God, nor can knowe them because they are spiritually discerned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second thing which inwardly witnesseth against the naturall man is his <hi>naturall conscience,</hi> whereby euen the heathen not onely knew, but <hi>did the things of the law</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 2.14.</note> not that any of them could yeeld perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the lawe, by the strength of nature: but that without the helpe of the Lawe written, the Gentiles had a certaine kinde of discipline, whereby they were restrained from many notorious vices: for he saith not, that they were iust, but did certaine things of the lawe, proceeding hence, that with the light of some common notions concerning God, they had also a sense of his iustice, which was readie to return to them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works. Now both these, namely, naturall knowledge, and conscience, were still according to the working of their corruption, either more quicke and stirring in them, or more dull and deaded: and yet neuer insufficient to condemne them.</p>

For, 1. what a sure sentence of damnation doth euerie Minister of the Gospel, pronounce against the disobedient, who hauing not Satans but Gods Prophets, and the lawe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> written, and the Gospel added thereunto, and the daily ministerie, and yet many will not vouchsafe to heare the call of Christ, to his supper, and many that heare him runne another way?

We haue the daily beholding of Gods great workes in the world, and in the Church, which are documents of the admirable power, and wisedome of God: the daily fruition of his vndeserued mercies, the testimonies of his bountie and goodnesse, and thinke they to <hi>escape the iudgement of God, that despise the riches of his bountifulnes, and patience, and long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> not knowing that the bountifulnes of God should lead them to repentance? is not this to heape coales on their owne heads, which will burne to the bottome of hell? yea and to treasure vp wrath against the day of wrath? vnto which we may adde the workes of his iustice, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdening his iust displeasure against the vnrighteousnes of men; reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led both in the Scriptures and in other histories, yea and daily running into the eies of such, as prouoke their diligence to obserue the same. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We haue the light of blessed example, both of the Prophets, Apostles, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke, and aboue all, of the blessed Sonne of God, and other holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God in the Scripture: and in our owne age many iust Lots, who will be as a cloud of witnesses to condemne our wayes, and works of darkenesse.

And yet if men were so wilfull as to be blinde at all these, yet can they not (as many striue to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> doe) put out all naturall principles; but euen the light of naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conscience will wrap them vnder condemnation; and they shall not be able at the barre of Gods righteous iudgement to plead not guiltie, for euen their owne thoughts shall accuse them. 7. But the greatest condemnation of all is, that the light of grace is come, and yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> men loue darknes more then the light; In which regard it shall be easier for Sodome then many peoples and townes professing the Gospel; nay Publicans, and harlots shall enter before many Christians; yea the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that neuer heard of Christ, as soone as thousands baptized into the name of Christ: because they knew and did many things of the law, and not knowing the law, were a law to themselues; but numbers are sonnes of Belial, lawlesse persons that scorne both Law and Gospel; whom the Lord will prouoke and iudge by such a foolish people as the Heathen were. Pitifull is it to see the disorders of Christians, which would haue made the Heathens to haue blushed: if a man will not now sweare no small oathes, drinke his sences away, spend out his daies in idlenesse, and iollitie, in pride and riot, companie and gaming, such a one is cassiered out of all companie, he is a man fitter for a cloister then the common Christians of our age: the Heathens did not thus. Theirs were workes of darknes indeed, but both in themselues, and the doers; but now they are become actions of the nooneday, which the Heathen would haue bin ashamed of at midnight. Which plainely prooueth that the light was giuen and is, that many might become more blind, more obstinate, more hard hearted and impenitent against that great day of iudgement. Many will plead at that day, that they came to Church, heare the word as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did, and liued after it so neare as God would giue them grace. But answer will be made them, that though hereby they came to a further knowledge of God; yet God neuer came to take knowledge of them: for they desired not to know the waies of God but slipt in, or were by law, or for forme and fashion forced to Church; and then all their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring brought them such knowledge as not only made them more excuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, but liable to more stripes; but not to such as was effectuall to preuaile against their lusts, for they stil detained the truth in vnrighteosnes; that is,

In case of conuiction of error, whether in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, or manners. <hi>In doctrine,</hi> when any controuersall point is handled, well may we free the truth of noueltie, by shewing the consent of it with the ancient Church: for hereby, 1. the weake and new conuerts are more confirmed: 2. the calumnies of the aduersaries are cut off, who commonly boast that all antiquitie standeth for and with them. <hi>In man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> the conuiction is of 1. Christians: or, 2. Heathens. If of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, then such allegations may be vsed by way of exprobration, or sharpe reproofe;<note place="margin">Iulian forbad the Christians the reading of heathen Poets and Orators, least they shold alledge their authoritie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens. For, saith he, they thrust vs through with our owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> so the Lord himselfe sendeth his people to the Iles of Chittim, and Kedar, to see if any of the nations dealt so with their gods: yea to the oxe, asse, crane, storke, pismire, &amp;c. If we be to deale with Heathens or Atheists, who are not easily mooued with the authoritie of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; then can we conuince them no otherwise then by such testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their owne, which they make most account of; and so the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle dealing with Athenians, Epicures, Stoiks, &amp; Cretians, by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of <hi>Menander, Aratas, Epimenides,</hi> conuinced their wickednesse. Thus for the clearing of Gods glorie, and his truth, as Paul saith, <hi>all things
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:18792:129"/>
are ours:</hi> Scripture, art, nature, &amp;c. Now because there accreweth a great hurt to the Church by the abuse of this example,<note place="margin">Cautious in such allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> we must care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obserue some cautions in such allegations: I will name three.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas the former cases are not frequent, such allegations must be rare and sparing: As Paul in all his bookes, adding vnto his 14. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> (if that of the Hebrewes be his) his sermons and defences in the Acts of the Apostles, vsed only three short Aphorismes; neither out of the iust causes prealleadged. Neither did euer Moses, though learned in all the learning of the Egyptians, vse any; nor Abraham, nor Iob: nor Daniel mixed any of their Chaldean knowledge, nor any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Nor Christ, nor any other of the Apostles, but onely Paul the doctor of the Gentiles, who were better acquainted with Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then the Scriptures, before whom alone he vsed them, wounding them with their owne weapons.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These allegations must be vsed soberly, without affectation. Paul <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> himselfe teaching vs, that the right manner of preaching,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.17.</note> standeth part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in concealment of humane skil, &amp; partly in demonstration of the spirit. And hereof he rendreth two reasons: 1. Because the doctrine of the Gospel must sauour still of the crosse, be abiect, and despicable, and so resemble Christ himselfe the author of it, who neuer sought his owne glorie, but departed from it, for the saluation of his bodie. 2. Least the faith of beleeuers should be in the wisedome of men, and not in the power of God, that is, least men should ascribe that to humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and wisedome, and gifts of men, which is proper to the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of the Gospel. True it is, as the Apostle obserued, the more pompe, the lesse power, and the more earthen the vessels are knowne to be, the better is the treasure knowne to be heauenly.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They may not be vsed to prooue points of Doctrine, or manners: for the word is a sufficient, and sure ground for proofe of all such points; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> but rather illustrate, and giue a more euident declaration of the truth, and more clearely to reprooue, and conuince falsehood, and error. For to vse mens authoritie to prooue Gods truth, were to set vp a candle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the sunne: or as if a cryer of a proclamation signed by the Kings hand and seale, should say thus will the King haue it, and such and such of his guarde.</p>
               <p>These cautions quite ouerthrowe the common vse of such allegations at this day, wherein men are immoderate, yea infinite in euery sermon, vpon all occasions, and to euery purpose, and people. Hence it is that Arbanah, and Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rphar riuers of Damascus, are more frequented then all the waters of Israel: Fathers, Philosophers, and Poets, are lowde in many sermons, when the Prophets, Apostles, and the Sonne of God
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:18792:130"/>
himselfe is silent. And all this is laid vpon this one practise of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, and no other commandement or practise can be alleadged in all the Scripture but his. And therefore we will looke a little nearer vnto it, and search how farre the Apostle hath propounded himselfe a patterne for our imitation. And to omit that scruple, whether we may lawfully imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him, except we had such extraordinarie gifts as he had, and such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, as whereby he was able to make profane sentences holy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as we finding a profane sentence cannot but leaue it so. If we shall take libertie to vse them, as the Apostle did, I take it, no man can from thence directly conclude the lawfulnesse of that manner of preaching, which is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> taken vp by verie many. For, 1. If we vse them, as the Apostle did, they should neuer come in sermons in our Church-congregations,<note place="margin">Non in coetu ecclesiastico.</note> for he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vsed them but either in confere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, or disputations, or as here in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Epistle. 2. Neuer before Christians, who reiect not, but desire <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the testimonies of Scripture, for he did not but before the Gentiles, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Heathen, which refused the Scriptures. 3. Not often in one sermon, and in euery point, for he did verie seldome, onely thrice in many sermons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> disputations, and all his writings put together. 4. Neuer in points of doctrine, or manners for proofe, as inconsideratly they are, the Apostle neuer so detracted from the sufficiencie of the Scriptures. 5. Neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> with their names prefixed to get credit and authoritie, or for ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which euery good Christian see men doe: for so neuer did the Apostle. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. Not at all times, and in all places, nor euer in the Vniuersitie, as men most do: for at Corinth the Apostle is so farre from vsing them, that he verie sharply reprehendeth the practise there, 1. Cor. 1.17. For there was most danger of all. And thus we see how farre we may take liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or haue ground to imitate the Apostle in this practise.</p>
               <p>The allegations of men for their practise are either weak, or impertinent. As 1. their large discourses in praise of humane learning, wherin they fight with their owne shadowes, for want of other aduersaries. For who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeth it? doth he that praiseth gold, dispraise siluer? or doe not we acknowledge it a necessarie handmaid vnto diuinitie, but an Agar still, who if she presume to step into Sarahs place, must be cast out of doores. <hi>Obiect.</hi> None speake against them, but such as are ignorant, and not able. <hi>Answ.</hi> Not to speake of the loudest sound of emptiest ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, they are not in themselues spoken against; but seeing there may be no composition in the holy oyle; neither may the Lords feild be plowed with an oxe and an asse, nor sowne with diuerse seeds, we desire mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and restraint to the former rules, that the voice of God may sound in the Church, and not the voices of men. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it is lawfull for the Israelites to rob the Egyptians. <hi>Ans.</hi> But it is not lawfull to
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:18792:130"/>
make a calfe of those earings, and set it vp for a God. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But these adorne a Sermon. <hi>Answ.</hi> Oh that our eyes were so spirituall,<note place="margin">Augustine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that while he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the pride of his heart, he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures, and thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing to the eloquence and knowledge he found in the bookes of the heathen, as Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and others: but after he saw himselfe, he knew also that all humane elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence &amp; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

What an vnwise man were he that would not content himselfe with a Iewell of infinite price, all of gold, pearles, and precious stones, except he carrie it to the painter to paint it. Let Christs voice put forth it selfe, and his sheepe will heare it, and follow him. As for the persons alleadged, be they neuer so holy, or profound, they are sufficiently honoured in bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the friends of the bridgroome, though they be not the bridgroome himselfe: and for the persons alleadging them, let them remember that he is not praised in this busines, whom men commend, but he that is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of God. So much of the preface.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the <hi>Testimonie</hi> it selfe. Wherein the Poet chargeth his countrimen with three maine vices. 1. That they were giuen to lyes, and falsehood, <hi>The Cretians are alwaies lyars.</hi> 2. That they were of brutish and belluine condition, voide of the guidance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>euill beasts.</hi> 3.

               <p>For the first of these.

Coloss. 3.5.</note> stiled by the title, and comprehended vnder the name of <hi>truth,</hi> in their practise scarce expresse it as a part of that image? And yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christians are behind euen millions of the Heathen, who although they be commanded <hi>euery man to speak truth to his neighbour,</hi> yet shame they not to defend that they may lie, and forsweare too for the advantage of themselues and others: and therefore they say, that though they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like hurtfull lies, yet see they not but they may (as they do) lie in iest, or for the good of their neighbour, especially to saue his life; For this, say they, hurteth none, nor is against the law of charitie; and they find it commended to them in the practise of the <hi>Midwiues,</hi> to saue the male infants of the Hebrewes; of Rahab to saue the Spies; and Michol, and Ionathan to saue Dauid from Sauls furie; and in the doctrine and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of some of the Fathers, as <hi>Origen, Ierome,</hi> who in regard of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable ends, held these no sinnes.</p>
               <p>To all which in few words I answer, 1. That euery lie is hurtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in iest, or earnest, for euill or for good; because it is an enemie to truth, and against the ninth commandement. 2. For iesting or sporting lyes, the threatning is generall, Psal. 5.6. thou shalt destroie them that <hi>speake lyes:</hi> vntruthes may not be spoken, although they be not thought: and, Prov. 6. <hi>Thou shalt destroie the lying tongue:</hi> he excepteth not, if it be not in sport, or for a good ende. And many of the Heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues saw the sillines and follie of this shift: we reade of the Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians that they would not suffer their lawes to be gainsaid in iest; and yet the law of the Lord may be controlled, and gainsaied in iest of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.

Nay, we may not tell the least lie, for Gods greatest glorie, and much lesse for mans good. Iob 13.9.10. <hi>Will you make a lie for him, as one lyeth for a man; surely he will reprooue you.</hi> And if a lie would make to Gods glorie, yet he is not vnrighteous to leaue it vnpunished.

               </p>
               <p>And to helpe our selues in this dutie, meditate on these reasons. 1. All falshood and lyes are directly against God himselfe, who is truth it selfe: so as by them a man becommeth most vnlike vnto God, and most like to the deuill, who is the father and first founder of them. 2. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefore the lyer casteth himselfe into the gulfe of Gods displeasure, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as he hateth all the workes of the deuill, so hath he testified speciall hatred against this. A lying tongue is one of the sixe things which the Lord hateth, and is abhomination vnto him, Prou. 12.22. and therefore
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:18792:132"/>
doth with them as we do with the things we abhorre; either remooueth them out of sight, by barring them out of heauen: or destroyeth them, Psal. 5.6. 3. That although that be the greatest plague to haue the face <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of God set against them here, and to be cast from out of his face and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed presence of ioy hereafter, yet there are other inferiour euills not to be contemned, which wait at the heeles of this sinne. As, 1. that it maketh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the sinners of this suite iustly hatefull euen vnto men, as those who are the maine enemies vnto humane societie, which is vpheld by truth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> faithfulnes. 2. Such deceitfull and fraudulent persons are occasions of the multiplication of oathes, and periuries among men, for which the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> land mourneth. 3. In themselues it argueth, the want of Gods spirit in their hearts, who beeing the spirit of truth and light, cannot abide to dwell in a heart that is pleased, and delighted with nothing more then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> darkenes and falshood. 4. They loose iustly their owne voice and credit, and are worthie not to beleeued when they speake truth; and men must deale with them as with their father the deuill, whose workes they accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome themselues vnto, suspect euen the truth from them, and not receiue any as from them. Now if any receiue not this doctrine he is farre behind the heathen, who shall rise in iudgement to condemne him: if any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it as true, and yet make no bones of this odious sinne, besids that he is condemned of himselfe, let him knowe, that he shall not escape the sentence of him who will take account of euerie idle, much more of euerie lying and deceitfull word.</p>
               <q>Euill beasts,]</q>
               <p>This is the second imputation in this testimonie. Epimenides calleth the Cretians <hi>beasts</hi>; because of their bruitish conditions, and beastly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises: and <hi>euill</hi> beasts, because they are not like the creatures, who by their creation were ordained, and serued for the commodious, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vse of man: but such as since the fall rebelliously refuse the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of man, and will not be brought vnto tamenes and seruice: nay, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are either fierce and cruell against man, as Lyons, wolues, &amp;c. or els poisonfull, direfull, and venemous, as the serpent, crocodile, with such venemous beasts: both which sortes are truely called euill beasts, not that they are not good in their substance, or not verie good in their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but because they carrie on them, the cursed markes of mans rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against God, beeing thereby subiected vnto vanitie so farre, as in stead of that primarie vse and comfort from them, man hath iust cause in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessantly to feare, and often receiueth much euill by meanes of them. And what doth the Poet herein other, then that which the Scriptures are very frequent in? for when men degenerate, and by sinne put off the nature of man, both God and nature strippe them of the name of men, as vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:18792:132"/>
of it, because they rather resemble the bruit beasts shrowding many brutish qualities vnder the shape of men.<note place="margin">The Scripture calleth bruitish men by the name of beasts: why.</note> The Scripture speaketh expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sely that <hi>man beeing in honour, became like the bruit beasts which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wherein standeth this resemblance? <hi>Ans.</hi> By looking into the word of God we shall finde it to stand especially in three things. 1. In becomming without vnderstanding, and in all the things of God, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> (which holy Dauid in one case confessed) as <hi>ignorant as the verie bruit beast:</hi> so Ierimie,<note place="margin">Psal. 73.22.</note> 10.14. affirmeth that now euerie man <hi>is a beast in his owne knowledge:</hi> and Prou. 20.24. <hi>How can a man vnderstand his owne way?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Spiritus sanctus vnum nomen eis iure tribuit qui vnam rem agunt licet contratia spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> Now hereby who seeth not that hereby men loose the verie thing which maketh them men, and distinguish them from the bruites without vnderstanding? and that is the minde it selfe, whereby onely man was enabled both to see, and consider of the things he seeth: and seeing the mind without vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is as an eie without sight, therfore may he that is destitute of vnderstanding be as truely said to want his minde, as hee which lacketh his sight, is truely said to haue lost his eyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By giuing vp themselues to be <hi>ledde with sensualitie as the bruit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> beasts:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.12.</note> and this propertie the Apostle Peter ascribeth to naturall and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men. Neither can it be that this should not rise of the former: for when men are depriued of vnderstanding, iudgement, reason, as euerie naturall man is in the things of God, they must needes be ledde by other guides, of lusts, appetite, sense and sight, euen as the beasts are.<note place="margin">Impetu quoda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in sua obiecta.</note> For when the noble part of the minde (which should subiect the inferiour powers of the soule vnto it selfe, as also guide the motions and actions of men by deliberation, counsel, iudgement, and election) is deposed from his regencie; the sensitiue appetite which is common to man and beast, like a rebellious commons taketh the whole command, and carrieth the soule by a blind force vnto any bruitish lust, and to whatsoeuer is delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the senses. Notably doth the Prophet expresse this propertie in the wicked Iewes, saying, that <hi>like fedde horses euerie of them neighed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his neighbours wife.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 5.8.</note>

               <p n="3">3. By the practise of many beastly and bruitish properties. For what properties haue vnregenerate men, which are not more beseeming euill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and hurtfull beasts then men? 1.

If we consider naturall men in themselues, no beast is so vncleane and foule as they, whose filthie hearts are fit for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,

                  <hi>Beware of dogges.</hi> 3. Consider them in respect of their neighbour, no euill beast is so cruell and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as they: in regard of the former the Scriptures ascribe the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the deuill himselfe vnto them, calling them <hi>ramping and roaring lyons:</hi> such as Dauid and Christ himselfe had to doe withall, Psal. 22.13. such a one was Nero whom Paul had to doe withall: 2. Tim. 4.17. <hi>God deliuered me out of the mouth of the Lyon.</hi> And for their savagenes and greedines they are called dogges and wolues, Zeph. 3.3. <hi>Her Princes are as roaring lyons,</hi>

Now man beeing aboue all other borne a sociable creature, and to liue in societie with God and men in the familie, Church, and common-wealth, hath by his hostilitie against God, and enmitie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst man, after a sort put off the nature of man, and by such degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, of good right hath lost euen the name of man also.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Whence we learne, that such as are not ledde by reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,<note place="margin">Many men so degenerated as that they haue cut themselues from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of men.</note> nor by iudgement rightly enformed by the word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but followe their owne hearts lusts for their guide, haue cut themselues from the account of men, and as worthily lost the name as the nature of men: for they are become beasts in vnderstanding, beasts in sensualitie, beasts in brutish practises, beasts in Gods account, beasts in the reputation but of reasonable and heathenish men.

But now seeing my vnderstanding is restored vnto me againe, I will neuer hereafter carrie my selfe but like a man, not making my lusts, my lawe any longer, but reason shall be my guide; nay, nor that onely, but like a Christian man, I will by Gods grace suffer my self to be guided hence forth by renewed reason, yea, by the word and spirit of God.

That God who hath set vs in our callings, hath promised also to be with vs, to giue vs good successe in them, to helpe vs to beare out the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diousnes which sinne hath brought vpon our labour, to giue vs his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in these our waies, to feed and maintaine vs by the blessing of our labour,<note place="margin">Idle persons pouerties pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</note> in the house, in the field, in our stock and in our store, whereas pouertie arresteth the idle person: Prov. 28. the idle shall be filled with pouertie. And all this is to encourage vs to faithfulnes, and diligence in the duties of our callings. See Ioshua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.8. 2. Whereas all other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> liue vnto themselues, man was appointed to liue aswell to others as to himselfe; the Church, the countrie, the familie, the poore, euery man challengeth a part in euery man.<note place="margin">A proper em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleame of such a person as is here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> And therefore although some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures be all a bellie, as the crabfish who walketh with her teeth, yet a Christian man must be a hand to one, an eye to another, a foote to another, a shoulder to support another, he must not only consist of bellie

In this schoole of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the calling, a man performing duties for the Lords sake, hath daily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, and encrease of graces, such as faith, obedience, patience, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, constancie, truth, invocation, thanksgiuing: and hence are daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to take out further lessons for time to come, from the daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods goodnes for time past. 3. In this schoole we learne to be teachers of others, and in time come to be patternes vnto others, of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> right vse of the world, while our selues vse it euery day as not vsing it at all: and while we so play the good husbands, as that we keep our selues from beeing worldlings, not laying by our heauenly minds in the midst of our earthly busines: whereas the idle person that entereth not into this schoole, is out of Gods protection, and neuer out of Satans snares, his heart is like the feild of the sluggard ouergrown with thistles and weeds, his lusts so farre preuaile with him, that he is rather a spectacle of reproch, then a patterne for imitation; and if euer he had any good things in him, they are perrished for want of emploiment; for as the rust fretteth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used iron, and the mothes eate vnworne garments, so good things ar sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the heart of him that neglecteth the vsing of them. 4. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the danger of those that stand idle all day long, passing their dayes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> in all delights, one in one voluptuous lust, another in another: the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith of them all, that liuing in pleasure, they are dead while they liue: the soule of such a one is but as a carkase, his bodie as a coffin, he rotteth away in vnprofitablenes while he liueth, and as a standing poole putrifieth: the prouerb is true of such a man,<note place="margin">Habet animam pro sale.</note> his soule is but as salt to keep his bodie from stinking aboue gound. And thinke we they shall liue when they are dead, who are dead while they liue? no surely, but seeing they did not subiect themselues to the law of all mankind, Gen. 3.19. <hi>In the sweate of thy face shalt thou get thy bread:</hi> they shall neuer escape that other sentence; <hi>take the vnprofitable seruant, binde him hand and foote:</hi> his hands and feete were bound when I called him to walke and worke, now bind him hand and foote, and cast him into hell.</p>
               <p>Now for the latter of these vices reprehended in the latter word; it
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:18792:136"/>
is worth marking to obserue how aptly the Poet ioyneth them together (which seldome are disioyned) because the one of these is the gound of the other.<note place="margin">Idlenes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance are seldome dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned.</note> And as it is true in all sinnes which we say of euills, that one commeth not alone, for they are accompained still with their supporters; so these two sinnes are of such speciall acqaintance, that as we say of a paire of turtles, looke where one is, the other lightly is within lesse then, a coytes cast: so where the one of these is, it will not be hard to descry the other. If there be idlenes, there will be intemperance; and if intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, there must needs be idlenes. And therefore our Sauiour hath combined them as neare as the cause and effect, which cannot be sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; Luk. 21.34. Take heed least your hearts <hi>be oppressed with surfet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drunkennes, and so that day come on you vnawares:</hi> implying that intemperance oppresseth, and maketh the heart dull and heauie; and when the heart is so aggraued, the whole man is vnfit either for heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or earthly exercise. In like manner the combination of Sodoms sinnes sheweth the same truth. Ezech. 16.49. <hi>Pride, fulnesse of bread, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of idlenesse.</hi> And therefore seeing a man can neuer sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perswade diligence in the calling, till this intemperance be disswaded: it shall not be amisse in few words to speake of this sinne, and perswade the contrarie vertue,<note place="margin">Intemperance what.</note> for the preseruation of it. And because this kind of intemperance is restrained to the bellie, I describe it to be an <hi>inordinate appetite,</hi> or <hi>immoderate desire, and vse of meate and drinke:</hi> and this is, when a due meane is exceeded, either in the costly, and <hi>excessiue prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them for our selues or others; or in the two liberall, and <hi>exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue vse of them</hi> so prepared: a vice which is a speciall enemie to all good duties towards God or man; making men vnfit to the word of God ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to read or heare it, vnfit to pray, to meditate, to remember the works of God with praise and thanksgiuing: so as a man giuen vp to this sinne, is sunke downe in Atheisme, nay in Idolatrie, hauing no other God then his bellie, a more base idolatrie of many Christians, then euer was any of the Heathen, who would worship the sunne, moone, starres, and glistring mettals, but to haue worshipped the bellie and draught, they would haue abhorred. And for the duties of the particular calling, they must lie lea, the bones of such full bodies had rather be at rest; or to keepe them from sleep must rise vp to play, but altogether vnweldie to any more serious busines. And thus by this sinne men make themselues in stead of Gods Temples, Satans kitchins; filling their bodies with noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some lusts, and deadly deseases; their soules with a number of dangerous sinnes,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.10.</note> which <hi>shut them out of heauen:</hi> framing their liues liker to the bruit beasts then reasonable men, and in their deaths for most part no lesse bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish then in their liues.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:18792:136"/>Now for the better auoiding of this sinne, I will propound some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and after them some rules of direction. The reasons are three,<note place="margin">Reasons against intemperance.</note> 1. The Lord is liberall, but not prodigall of his creatures: and they are his, and not ours, but by his leaue: neither doth he euer giue leaue to vse them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to our owne hurt: as many riotous persons doe, who (with the glutton faring deliciously euerie day) in their feasting and banquetting, besides the wast of many excellent creatures of God, 1. loose their time. 2. spend their goods, which ought to haue beene otherwise employed. 3. neglect the duties of their generall calling of Christianitie, and omit the necessarie affaires of their particular course of life. 2. This is one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the practises of those that are <hi>in the night,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 13.13.</note> whereas we professe our selues to be of the day, and is a weed or rather an olde ragge which must be put off, before Christ can be put on. 3. The time calleth vs rather <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to fasting, weeping, and euerie worke of repentance, then to eating, drinking, chambring, &amp;c. For if we consider the workes of the Lord, we shall see his arme stretched out, and his hand reuenging among many other sinnes, euen this of the abuse of his creatures: and this with such lingring, lasting, and sharpe iudgements, so variable, and so generall, as hath not beene heard of in the dayes of our fathers: read Isai. 5.11. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides we see the afflictions of Ioseph, Amos. 6.6. the necessities of many of Gods deare seruants: the abundance of poore, their great want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, their miserable complaints, &amp;c. that woe shall befall him that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to eate, when so many of Gods children cannot get that they may eate to liue.</p>
               <p>Now the rules of direction,<note place="margin">Rules of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against intemperance.</note> are 1. to moderate excesse in preparation for our selues and others to knowe, that not aboundance but sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is the ornament of a table: a rule which seemeth to be dead with our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> forefathers, whose dishes for sort, number, price, and seruing out, were inferiour to our sauces, and yet to shew vs that man liueth not by bread, they were stronger, of more constant health, and of longer life, then we are. 2. To moderate excesse in the vse of meates and drinkes prepared, we must take out the Apostles lesson, 1. Cor. 10.31. <hi>Whether yee eate or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> drinke, or whatsoeuer ye doe, doe all to the glorie of God:</hi> the glorie of God must be our white to ayme at in all the actions of our life: of which none is so small, out of which the Lord challengeth not his owne glorie: and therefore as we liue not to our selues but vnto him, so we must not eate to our selues but vnto him; and this we doe, when by our eating and drinking, we fit our selues for his seruice and our owne duties, namely by keeping the bodie vnder, and dailie subduing it, rather then by pampe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and feeding it vp. 3. To containe thy selfe in compasse in both, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> still to hunger, and thirst after righteousnes, that is, after that meat
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18792:137"/>
which the Sonne of man shall giue; for the more thou hungrest after Christ, the lesse doest thou after these things: Rom. 13.14. <hi>Put on Christ, and take no care to fulfill the lusts of the flesh</hi>; Christ is the treasure vnto which the Christian heart must be lifted; he is the carkase vnto which our thoughts ought to flie; he is meate indeede, drinke indeede, bread of life, water of life; blessed is that soule that hungreth and thirsteth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, for it shall be satisfied; yea blessed is that hunger and thirst which is neuer but accompanied with a continuall feast.</p>

               <p>Whence, 1. note that euery truth beeing primarily from God, it must be receiued whosoeuer be the instrument &amp; teacher of it: for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle disdaineth not to borrow a part of the truth from this gracelesse and heathen man. Nay, there is not the basest of Gods creatures, into whose schoole we cannot sometimes profitably enter: for else would not the Lord haue sent vs to the oxe, the asse, the emmet, and much more can he who opened the mouth of Balaams asse to reprooue the madnes of his master, teach by weake and feeble, base and simple men, yea if he please by gentile and heathen men.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This taxeth the pride of many, who thinke themselues too good to learne of such whom they conceiue meaner or inferiour to themselues: such a pride possessed the Pharisies;<note place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>thou art altogether borne in sinne, and dost thou teach vs?</hi> But if they considered the wayes of God, they might see him stirring vp most base and simple men to teach the doctor, the Scribe, and the wise men of the world, that he may ashame them, and teach them to depresse their high thoughts: 1. Cor. 1.26. Bretrhen you see your calling, not many wise — but God hath chosen the weake of the world, 1. <hi>to confound mightie things:</hi> 2. <hi>that no flesh should reioyce,</hi> v. 29. Let this prouoke our diligence to knowe not so much by whom, as what the Lord teacheth, attending vnto the counsell of God, and not the condition of man whome he vseth; let him speake by neuer such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect persons if they bring the truth,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 3.18.</note> it is our part to <hi>become fooles that wee may be wise:</hi> and then are we such fooles, when we depart with all opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our owne wisedome, that we may be wise in God, what meanes so euer he pleaseth to vse: the Gospel teacheth vs that poore women and creeples could tell often tidings of Christ, when all the great clerks knew not of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This reprehendeth the waywardnesse of many, who not fancying
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:18792:137"/>
the persons of their teachers, refuse their doctrine though neuer so true and profitable. Would men deale thus in ciuill things? If fire should take a towne in the night, and the watchmen beeing all fallen asleepe, a stranger, nay a mans enemie should giue him warning that his house were on fire, were it safe for a man to rush at it, because his enemie telleth him so? No, neither would any be so vnwise: and if the truth in an heathen Poets mouth, be so entertained by the Apostle himselfe; much more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie diuine truth in the mouth of the meanest Minister of the Gospel. Let the vessell be neuer so earthen, the treasure is heauenly; let the foode be nourishable, hungrie Elias stands not vpon it, whether an Angel or a rauen serue it.</p>
               <p>Secondly note, that this <hi>testimonie beeing true,</hi> Titus might haue been discouraged, and occasioned hereby to haue meditated of his departure from them as an hopeles people; or to haue repined that the Apostle should place him among such a companie of beasts, rather then men.<note place="margin">Ministers must not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their dutie, though they be to deal with a bruitish and wretched people.</note> But yet Titus must, and doth with courage goe on in his worke among them, and plowe vp to the Lord, euen this stiffe ground. It is the lot of many gracious Ministers to be called and planted among rude, barbarous, and beastly people, such as these Cretians were, yea among viperous broods, who will reward their faithfull paines and trauell, in begetting them to God, with extremitie of wrong and violence, Ier. 26.8. and little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort finde they, vnlesse the Lord giue them a breathing time by the means of some Ahikam or other, v. 24. Now what must the Minister doe in this case? Surely, as he came not of his owne head, so now is he not at his owne hand to remooue himselfe at his pleasure. And if he should depart vpon this ground, he should perphaps meet with lesse comfort in leauing an vncomfortable people, then in staying amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. If God bid Ionas arise, and goe to Nineveh; but he will betake himselfe to a ministerie of more credit, and lesse labour; the Lord will teach him before he get to Tarshish, that he is not his owne man, and that no creature shall shelter him from trouble, whilest he flieth it as fast as he can. If Moses be called to speake to Pharaoh, he must not excuse the matter, saying, <hi>But they wil not beleeue me.</hi> The Lord is said to hold the Ministers in his hand,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.1.</note> and Christ the <hi>seauen starres in his right hand,</hi> Reu. 1. First, in regard of his disposition of them here and there at his pleasure. Secondly, of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of them in their labours. And some he sendeth, and all the hearte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning they haue of him before hand is, <hi>But they will not receiue thee,</hi> as Moses, and some of the Prophets: and that is not all, but they must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare browes of brasse; their shoulders to beare reproaches and wrongs, their backs for stripes, their feete for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>etters and stockes, yea, their necks for the verie blocke it selfe. In like manner Christ sending out his disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18792:138"/>
he forbidds them to possesse gold and siluer; and wisheth them to possesse patience, for they should stand more need of that then the other; and telleth them that if himselfe the green tree could not be spared, much lesse should they the drie branches: and that if the Lord and Master be called Belzebub, the seruant must not looke to be aboue his Master, and scape scotfree. And therefore Ministers called to such an vncomfortable condition, must imitate the Apostle Paul, who although he knewe that bands and imprisonment did abide him in euerie citie, yet forward he must, and prouoketh his owne readinesse and chearefulnes not onely to be bound, but to suffer also the paines of death, for the testimonie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he beareth: considering well, 1. That the disciples themselues sent from the side of Christ,<note place="margin">Legati à latere</note> must make account to be hated of all men for his names <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sake. 2. That although they see no great comfort or fruit of their worke <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> with men, <hi>yet their worke is with the Lord.</hi> 3. That the Lord Iesus fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling his death at Ierusalem, yet went foreward, and would not pittie himselfe for all Peters friendly counsel, but pittied his flocke, his bodie, his Church, more then himselfe: a worthie example for the practise of all his minsters. All which reprehendeth all those wandring Leuites, who like so many planets, or wandring starres, are euer shifting their places, and charges, and selling off their people vpon the least greiuances; but not without pretence and plea of sundrie inconueniences, sometimes of aire and habitation, sometimes of ill neighbourhood, sometimes the rudenes and churlishnes, somtimes the incapablenes, and vnprofitablenes of their people: but in all this, the sentence of the Apostle passeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously against them, vnto which their owne consciences cannot but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, that they seeke themselues, their bellie, their ease, their profits, but not the <hi>things of the Lord Iesus,</hi> nor the winning of the soules of men to God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is this testimonie true? How then are such a people as this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and honoured, to be among the first to whom the Gospel was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered? noting the wonderfull grace and free goodnes of God, not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at desert, merit, goodnes of nature, inclination of will, or any other forerunning prerogatiue: and is not his grace as free vnto vs as them? did he finde vs any whit better then them? were not we beasts in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, sensualitie, and course of our naturall liues, before he called and washed vs? truely might be said of vs, that our father <hi>was an Amorite, our mother an Hittite, our selues in our blood,</hi> the frame of our hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now from the former testimonie affirmed to be nothing but the truth it selfe, the Apostle inferreth that Titus not onely might safely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ought also to <hi>reprooue</hi> and checke the inhabitants of this Iland, which reproofe is enlarged, 1. by the adiunct or qualitie, <hi>sharpely,</hi> or as the word sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth to the quicke, for it is a metaphor taken from Surgeons, who cut and launch, and seare to the quicke, if the qualitie of the wound or sore so require, yea, and sometimes in desperate cases to cut off a dangerous limbe, or putrified member, which otherwise would perish the whole bodie: and no otherwise ought euerie spirituall Physitian to deale with the festered soares of the soules of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By the ende of this reproofe, <hi>that they may be sound in the faith.</hi> Faith signifieth, 1. that whereby we beleeue, namely the vertue or gift of faith. 2. That which we doe beleeue, namely, the doctrine of faith, that is, the doctrine of the Gospel, Gal. 1.22. Paul <hi>destroyed the faith,</hi> that is, the doctrine of faith, <hi>which he now preacheth.</hi> And thus is it here meant, because it is opposed to the <hi>Iewish fables,</hi> and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, in the next verse: and then the Apostle (following the former metaphor) wisheth the Ministers who are the Surgeons of soules, in all their launcing and cutting, to aime at the cure, that is, the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their patients, that is, their people; that beeing freed from their corrupt diseases, that is their errors, whether in iudgement or practise, they may be brought to sound health, that is soundnesse of faith and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere doctrine, cleauing only vnto God, and relying themselues only vpon the merit of the Lord Iesus for life and saluation. And yet in this expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I include also the vertue &amp; gift of faith, so farre as without it there can be no sound Christians, but I admit it not to be the thing properly meant as some doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> In the word <hi>wherefore</hi> note, that when the truth of a fact or sinne committed is certainly knowne,<note place="margin">No reproofe may be vngrou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

As though he had said, it is true, the people with whome thou art to deale are such and such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore thou maist sharpely reprooue them. And it is not euerie euidence which is a sufficient ground, no not for priuate reproofe, and much lesse for publike: but as our Apostle, 1. Cor. 5.1. It is <hi>certenly heard</hi> that there is fornication among you; and so descendeth to a sharpe reproofe: at the least there must be some credible information,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18792:139"/>
such as the same Apostle to the same Church of Corinth mentioneth; who vpon the report of the <hi>house of Cloe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.11.</note> sharpely reprooueth them for their contentions: for to that end he nameth his author, that they might not thinke, he would vpon suspition; or surmise of his owne, neither vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on suspected information from other, charge them so deepely: but from intelligence of those, against whom they could not well except. Paul stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reprehension of Peter, <hi>till he sawe that he went not the right way, and that he was to be blamed,</hi> Gal. 2.11.14. Zeale running before know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is euerie where a reproach, but here (besides that it marreth such a necessarie dutie, and hardeneth the person vniustly reprooued against a iust reproofe for time to come) it carrieth many blots with it.</p>

It argueth want of loue to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hastily reports against such as we professe freindship vnto; with whom a rent is made, where none was, nor needed to be: iustly taking themselues iniured, when they see themselues discredited in our hearts causlesly; or else their names not sufficiently tendred of vs. 3. It argueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> want of wisedom and great indiscretion, rashly to reprooue that, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of either the partie knoweth himselfe innocent, or else is done secretly: now that is secret to vs, which albiet it be knowne to others, yet is not sufficiently knowne to vs: the note of a foole (saith Salomon) <hi>is to beleeue euery thing</hi>; and of a slanderer <hi>to discouer secrets,</hi> Prov. 10.19.</p>

The former in Deut. 13.14. Thou shalt rather <hi>seeke and make search, and inquire diligently, and if it be true, and the thing certaine, then</hi> thou maist safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reprooue. 2. If thou canst not be certaine, then reprooue not but vpon supposition; thou canst not here say directly, as Nathan to Dauid, <hi>thou art the man.</hi> For such a plaine reproofe implieth the certaine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a sinne, which we must not suffer vpon our brother, Leuit. 19.17.</p>
               <q>Sharpely,]</q>
               <p>It will heare be demanded, what is this sharpe reproofe here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? <hi>Ans.</hi> To know it the better, we may consider it either in the person of euery Pastor, or that which is in the seuerall Churches. The former belonging to euery Pastor, standeth 1. in the enlargement of sinne knowne to be committed, that it may appeare vnmasked, and in it
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18792:139"/>
owne face, that thus it may appeare more ougly and odious both to the vnderstanding, and iudgement of the sinner. 2. In following it with the curse of the law, denouncing out of the word those plagues of God, which shall surely ouertake such a partie, if he faile of vnfained and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable repentance: that thus there may follow a renting of the heart, a breaking vp of the fallow ground, and (seeing one measure of sorrow fitteth not all sinnes) such a measure of sorrow in the soule of the sinner as the degree of the sinne deserueth. The latter kind of sharpe reproofe, is that whereby the Church seeketh to recall offenders. Neither is this that of the ciuill sword, but is spirituall, and respecteth the soule alone: and standeth in three things. 1. Admonition with denuntiation of iudgements. 2. In suspension from the Lords table. 3. In excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whereby the obstinate offender is giuen vp to Satan for the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of the flesh, and sauing of the spirit as by a desperate remedie. The error will not be great, to vnderstand either of these in the precept: but if either more then other, I encline rather to the former; namely that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus is here directed how to carie himselfe toward these vaine people through the course of his doctrine, rather then in exercising the censures of the Church; whereunto both the words before, and the verse follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seemeth to encline.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> According to the nature of sinnes, and sinners, we must set an edge vpon our reproofes, and sharpen them:<note place="margin">Euery reproofe must be tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the sin. Iude 22.</note> for all sinnes are not of one size, nor all sinners of one straine: but some sinnes are more enormious then other; and some sinners are more obstinate then other. Some sinnes are of ignorance, some of malice; some secret, some open; some sinners are as waxe to worke on, some are stonie and stifnecked; some haue here and there their freckles and frailties on them, others are spotted all ouer like the leopards, or like the Ethiopian, they neuer change their hew, no washing doth them good. Now we must wisely put a differnce betweene both. Compassion must be shewed vpon some, and others whom loue cannot allure, feare must force: some must be <hi>saued by loue,</hi> and some <hi>be pulled out of the fire:</hi> some sores need but a gentle leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, some a sharper drawer:<note place="margin">Iude 22.</note> some require but the pricke of a needle to open them, others a more painefull lancing, and cutting; and some a cutting off. <hi>Obiect.</hi> 2. Tim. 4.2. <hi>Reprooue with all long suffering,</hi> how can that stand with this precept of sharpe reproofe? <hi>Ans.</hi> Some which commit these two places together, would reconcile them againe by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the persons to whom the Apostle writ them: the one Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, who they say was seuere, &amp; austere, and therefore is exhorted to pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and meeknes: the other Titus, who was gentle and meek of nature, and therefore spurred vnto sharpnes, and seueritie. But the context ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth

Besides more mildnes was to be vsed with such as yet had not beleeued, then those who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing professed the faith in word, and yet departed from it againe: as the Galatians,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> and these Cretians with whome Paul was so sharp: and this difference also some of the auncient put between these two peoples of Ephesus,<note place="margin">Theodoret.</note> and Candy. But howsoeuer, the places are easily accorded: for euen to the worst much patience, and lenitie must be vsed, till it be dispised, and till it be cleare that no meeknes will serue to winne men: but then it is high time that seueritie should terrifie those, who by leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie would not be allured: according to the example of God himselfe, Rom. 2.4.</p>

Which appeareth in that the greatest ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie censure in the Church is not mortall, but medicinable. For as a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon cuts off armes and legges that the bodie and heart may be saued; so in this bodie, parts and members are cut off, that themselues may be saued as well as the whole bodie.

the one is an ordinarie censure, the other verie extraordinarie and rare: the one against those who may be freinds of the Church, the other only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst desperate enemies and open and obstinate Apostates, euen such as Iulian whom the Church iudgeth to haue sinned the sin against the holy Ghost, and therefore execrateth and accurseth. So as that place nothing impeacheth the truth of the doctrine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Much more ought Ministers in their sharpest rebukes, aime at the conuersion of men:<note place="margin">Ministers must not reprooue to disgrace me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s persons but mens sinnes.</note> what a sharpe reproofe was that of Peter to Simon Magus, Act. 8.21.25. <hi>Thy mony perish with thee, and thou art euen in the gall of bitternesse:</hi> and yet he addeth, <hi>repent therefore, and pray vnto the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> So is it the part of all Peters successors to whom the care of the Lords flock is committed, so to reprooue, not as those who would shame mens persons, but disgrace their sinnes; neither as insulting ouer mens euills, nor delighting in their falls, nor despayring of their rising; but as imitating good Surgions, who whilest they seare or cut, or cut off, still shew compassion, and gently entreate the patient, euer perswading him that this rough course will make to his health and soundnes. 2. While Ministers thus dispense Christian seueritie,<note place="margin">Hearers must not mistake their ministers in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofes.</note> in their reproofes and denunciation of iudgements, the bearers must not mistake them (as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe) and much lesse say vnto them, as Corah and his company to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and Aaron; <hi>yea take too much vpon you,</hi> or as the Egyptian to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>who made thee a iudge?</hi> who gaue you the keyes of heauen, to open and shut it vpon whom you please? when did God make you of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to foretell my damnation, &amp;c. conceiuing that in our menacies and threatning, we quite cut them off from all hope of mercie, and that we take vpon vs to shut the doore of grace vpon them, and to shorten the arme of the Lord that he cannot saue them. Whereas the truth is, while we thunder out damnation against the sinner (which verie many despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately rush into, while they auoid the mention of it in our mouthes) it is not that we despaire of your saluation, or would haue you so to doe; nor we doe not admonish you to shame you, but you must if you will be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the word we preach, conceiue with vs, that we desire your sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith: and therefore we deale with you, as with sickemen, who commonly will take nothing to doe them good, but what is forced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: which if you doe not, we are not in your hearts the Surgeons of your soules, but rather your executioners. 3. This reprehendeth those whose rebukes tend altogether to discourage godly courses in their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,<note place="margin">A fearfull thing to reprooue men for aiming at soundnes in the faith.</note> and bring them from soundnes in the faith, making heauie the hearts of them to whom the Lord speaketh peace. 2. Those that malitiously thunder their bolte of excommunication against those that professe Christ sincerely. Thus did the Iewes excommunicate whosoeuer durst
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:18792:141"/>
confesse Christ; as that blind man, Ioh. 9.34. so the Papists and others deale with such as stand with Iesus Christ; and especially that great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist the Pope, to testifie his malice and rage against Christ and his truth, striketh with the sentence of excommunication both Kings and people, whosoeuer receiue not his marke in their hands and foreheads.

And againe, such as are cast out of, and by such counsells, if they stand with Christ and for him, he present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taketh them vp and meeteth with them, as he did with the blind man, ver. 35. 3. Such also as wickedly profane this high and great censure, pronouncing this fearefull sentence either for trifles, seeing the Apostles neuer vsed it but against Apostates, incestuous persons, blasphemers, and great offenders, or else for malice, pollicie, mony, or any other end then to bring men to soundnes in the faith.</p>

Both Pastor and people must haue care and conscience,<note place="margin">No Christian must content himselfe with spirituall life, vnles it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with health and soundnes.</note> that they may become found in the faith, both in iudgement, which is here aimed at especially, as also in practise, of which the precept is giuen, 1. Tim. 5.7. <hi>These things command, that they may be blamelesse.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them must thinke it inough that in the spirituall life of grace they keepe life, and soule together, except this life be accompained with health and soundnes: for as in our bodily life we thinke it not inough that we liue, but we prize our health, and soundnes aboue all earthly things; skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he giue for his life: and yet of an vnhealthfull, languishing, and painfull life men are so wearie, as (with Iob) they would seeke for death as for treasures; so much more carefully ought we to preuent and remooue such spirituall diseases and infirmities of our soules, which hold vs vnder, that we cannot become the louely plants in the Lords house, euen fresh and well liking. And that we may be better acquainted with the doctrine and our dutie, it will not be vnprofitable to note the difference betweene a spirituall disease,<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all disease, and infirmitie.</note> and a spirituall infirmitie. An <hi>infirmitie</hi> is a rellike of sinne, subdued in the beleeuer, but still bewraying it selfe like the grudging of a vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed ague, whereby the child of God is prone to the practise of sinne, and is made heauie, and backward in performing spirituall duties. <hi>A disease,</hi> is the ordinarie preuailing of some sinne or sinnes against grace. I say not euery preuailing of sinne is a disease, for infirmities may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times preuaile, not only within the soule, but also without the bodie, as Noahs drunkennes, Lots incest, &amp;c. but that which is vsually preuailing for some time, and more frequent maketh a sicknes and disease in the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18792:142"/>
as in the bodie not euery distemper, or qualme, or headeach is a disease; but some distempered humor which hath beene longer on gathering, more tedious in affecting, and more dangerous in threating the very life of the patient. Now both these may be in a regenerate person, neither of them in the wicked: the former, because regeneration is indeed the roote and possibilitie of all graces, but not the act of them: the latter, because in the wicked is no grace at all, against which sinne striueth and grudgeth, none against which sinne can frequently preuaile, for all is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, all is rottennes and raigning sinne, as it is not in the weakest of the regenerate.</p>

To be carefull to get and keepe a good heart: see that the heart be sound, that is, vpright and sincere: for while a man is not heart-sicke, all other infirmities and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> diseases are not vnto death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, when the heart is well, watch it to keepe it well, carefully auoiding whatsoeuer would hinder or hurt the soundnes of it: and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, 1. False doctrine, which as poison speedily destroyeth the soule, whether it be Popish leauen, or libertine doctrines of some Protestants. 2. Wicked manners, which if they be in smaller things, are like those slippes and slidings, whereby men breake their armes or legges; or if in greater sinnes, are like those downe falls, which threaten the breaking of the necke of the soule, and a totall falling from soundnes in religion: both these must be shunned, because the least sinne breaketh or disioyneth something, and so hindreth Christian soundnes.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, be carefull to know &amp; vse the best meanes of spirituall health: and here those which are of daily vse are especially two. 1. To keepe a <hi>good diet,</hi> be constant in the word, Sacraments, prayer, keepe thy houres of publike and priuate exercises before the Lord; feede vpon the purest foode, euen vpon wholesome doctrine; not rising out of earth, but deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from heauen. 2. By <hi>spirituall physicke or surgerie,</hi> daily beate downe thy bodie, mortifie thy corruptions, subdue thy lusts and swelling affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, by applying the corrasiues of the lawe, and curse of it against the sinnes of thy soule: and then bind thy selfe vp with the lenitiues of the Gospell; and if thy owne skill faile thee, suffer thy selfe, if at any time thou be bruised or out of ioynt, although it be painfull for the time, by
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:18792:142"/>
Gods skilfull Surgeons to be handled, and set in ioynt, and so restored to soundnes againe.</p>
               <p>Now the reasons or motiues to the carefull vse of these meanes are fiue; 1. drawne from euerie mans necessitie,<note place="margin">Reasons to vse those meanes.</note> which is not so little as it is little felt and perceiued. The poore woman in the Gospel tyred for 12.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> yeares together with her issue of blood, spent all she had on Physitians to cure her of her griefe, and the reason was, because she felt the paine and tediousnes of it: but we who cannot weare out one weeke nor one day in bodily griefe, without many complaints, can carrie many bloodie issues of sinne in our soules, euen from our cradles to our graues, and complaine of no griefe, no paine, and so neuer seeke for cure: nay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we deeme our selues sound men, we refuse cure when it is offered. We reade in the Gospell of a number of people who followed and floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked after Christ, for the cure of their bodily maladies and griefes, and the casting of deuills out of their bodies: but of verie fewe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of their spirituall diseases and issues, or of the blindnes, and deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and lamenes of their soules; or cryed to haue their sinnes, the works of the deuill cast out of their soules. And yet is there no necessitie hereof, because men see it not? 1. Consider how many we haue who conceiue that they are sound Christians, and say they beleeue in Christ (they thank God) and they hope to be saued by Christ as soone as the best: and yet the life of Christ (much lesse foundnesse of soule) was neuer in them, yea nothing else but raigning sinne: if to be daily drunke, and to be sound stakes on the alebench, to sweare, to lie, deceiue, boast, contend, quarrell, contemne the word and Christian practises, and men, will make sound Christians, we neede not goe farre to seeke such sound men. 2. Of such as are Christians, and of the number of beleeuers, how are many crazy and ouergrowne with bad and vicious humors? some of couetousnesse, some of licentiousnes, some of idlenes, and some worse then these. The creple that lay at the poole of Bethesda, eight and thirtie yeares had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more neede of putting into the poole then they: that should a man looke wholly vpon some, and not vpon others with them, our congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would seeme rather spirituall spittles, then the Temples of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. 3. How had the best need of that counsel giuen to the Church of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis? Reu. 3.2. <hi>Be awake, and strengthen the things which remaine, and are readie to die, for I haue not found thy workes perfect</hi> or sound <hi>before God:</hi> for the truth is, such a generall consumption of grace possesseth the most; that were the bodies of many so farre wasted and spent as their soules are, from that which hath beene in them, long could they not look to remaine in the land of the liuing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is the soundnes of faith which the Lord is delighted in:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:18792:143"/>
for neuters and no bodies, fish nor flesh, hote nor cold, he cannot digest but speweth them out of his mouth: halfe Christians he accounteth no Christians: and therefore be altogether a Christian, or thou art neuer a whit. What, a Christian at Church, and a companion at home? a bible in thy hands at Church, and presently a paire of cardes or dice at home? here in the companie of Saints, and there of deuills incarnate? here of them that feare an oath,<note place="margin">Isa. 66.17.</note> and there of them that cannot speake one sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence without an oath for the preface? the Lord noteth thee for rotten at the core, and stampeth thee for a counterfeit, although thou beest ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so cunningly washt ouer.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this maketh all our duties chearefully vndertaken, consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly performed, and mercifully accepted, it cloatheth all our actions with seeming and sutable affections: if they be exercises of repentance, with godly humilitie; if duties of loue, with Christian compassion and chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, without which, they were rather as carkases without soules, then the fruits of sound and sauing faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, this soundnes carrieth assured comfort with it both in life and death: many are the trialls and temptations of Gods children by the deuill and his instruments, and through many afflictions are the Saints passed to their glorie: the least of which were able quite to ouerturne them, if they had not this sound proppe to leane vpon, to which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made that the gates of hell shall not preuaile against it. Againe, infinite are the frailties and weakenesses of Gods children, yea not onely in their declinings, but in theit best duties in which they are drawne the nearest vnto God; the which would vtterly disheart them, were it not that they knewe, that is not perfection, but sinceritie, and a sound endeauour vnto it which is their reioycing here belowe. Hezekiah in a sore brunt hauing the sentence of death denounced against him, as it seemed out of Gods displeasure, for he wanted issue, had nothing to comfort him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he was a king, but onely that he had walked in vprightnes before the Lord: shewing vs that with this soundnes of heart possessing Christ, and walking worthie of him, we may with boldnes meete the Lord in iudgement, yea then when heauen and earth shall be shaken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, on the contrarie what horrors of their fearefull apostacie, haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> many carried to their graues? the cause of whose withering was euen want of moysture and soundnesse at the roote; and most iustly, seeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the deare Saints of God haue tasted the bitter fruit of smaller decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and that by improuidence, out of which they haue not beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered without shame and sorrowe: as in Dauid, Peter, Noah, &amp;c. If any yet thinke this doctrine more then needeth, let him further consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:18792:143"/>
1. That the day of triall may not be farre off, euen our day of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, by particular iudgement, or death. 2. The generall iudgement cannot be farre off, when only such shall be pronounced blessed, in whose spirits are found no guile. 3. That he may shrowdly suspect himselfe to be an hypocrite, who herein differeth from a sound Christian, that the one can be content to be called on, the other is vnsound at the heart, and cannnot endure to be gaged.</p>

                  <hi>Ver. 14.</hi> And not taking heed to Iewish fables, and commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men, that turne away from the truth.</q>
               <p>As the Phisitian or Surgeon hauing cured some disease, or sore at his departure, forewarneth his patient of such meates, and meanes, as may bring the same, or worse euills vpon them: so dealeth the Apostle, who hauing prescribed a course, by meanes of which this corrupt and rude people, should be brought to soundnesse in the faith, he chargeth, that whereas they had beene formerly addicted to lies, and fables, which had beene the occasions, and feeders of their vnsoundnes, and spirituall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases; yet now they should no longer attend to such <hi>fables</hi> and <hi>comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of men,</hi> which otherwise will be as powerfull as euer to preuaile against them, to <hi>the turning of them away from the truth,</hi> the which is now preached among them. 1. the meaning. 2. the doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iewish fables.</hi> Although all fables in matter of religion be to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, yet especially he mentioneth these of the Iewes, because they were most dangerous of all. 1. Because they directly opposed themselues, as ouerthrowers of the whole doctrine of the Gospel, and the merit of Christ. 2. They were perswaded vnder most strong pretenses, for they came as from Gods owne mouth, and from his owne people, from such as were borne vnder the law; so as they were vrged as things of surest ground, and strongest authoritie from God himself, and his greatest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Moses. But what were these <hi>fables? Ans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iewish fables what.</note> Vnder this head may be comprehended all the false glosses, and false interpretations of the law of Moses, vrging the externall, and literall, but not the internall and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall meaning of the law:<note place="margin">Non legem sed legis minutias vrgebant.</note> for which corruption Christ challengeth the Iewish teachers, Matth. 5.6. and 7. chapters. 2. All their fabulous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention in their Talmud, such as that concerning the comming of the Messiah, and the great feast at his comming: and of the fruitfulnes of the earth, which at that time shall bring forth in stead of eares of corne, loues of bread; and a number such, of which Paul saith, they are for number <hi>infinite,</hi> and for vse, <hi>vnprofitable.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.4.</note> 3. But the context in the verse fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, pointeth vs to expound them of some other then these: namely, of all those doctrines of the Iewes which concerned the legall, and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall obseruation of daies, meates, drinks, garments, washings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:18792:144"/>
and peoples: for the Iewes taught that the same difference remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be obserued still as Moses from the Lord commanded it: so as yet some meates were common, and some cleane; some daies were more holy then others; so garments and persons much more lay open to legal pollution by issues, touchings, &amp;c. whereas the appearing of Christ procured finall freedome from all such impuritie, so as according to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vision, Act. 10. no man, no thing is to be called polluted or vncleane. <hi>Quest.</hi> But why doth the Apostle call such doctrines fables, seeing 1. they were from God, 2. necessarily imposed vpon Gods owne people in paine of death and cutting off from his people in case of contempt,<note place="margin">Why so called.</note> yea or omission: 3. they included in them that euangelicall truth wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both they and we are saued?<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet for all this he tearmeth them so. 1. Because euen these legall institutions of God himselfe, when they were at the best, were but actuall <hi>Apologies,</hi> or shadowes of things to come; carying a shew, or figure of truth, but not the bodie, not the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> truth it selfe: to the same effect saith Paul, Gal. 4.24. that they were <hi>Allegories,</hi>

                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> that is, beeing the things that they were, signified the things <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that they were not. 2. Because those constitutions although they had their times and seasons, yet now were they dated: and now to teach or vrge them was as vaine, as void of ground out of Scripture, as voide of profit, as void of truth, as if they had taught the most vaine fictions, and vnprofitable falsehoods that men could possibly devise. And hence looke as if a man should relate to vs a narration, not only of suspected, but of knowne vntruth: as for example, that such a man with whom we haue eate, drunke, conuersed, but whom we know to be dead and haue seene buried, were aliue againe: and not only so, but of his perfect strength and state as euer he was; might not we be more diffident then Thomas was, and in good forme of speach say, that he told vs a fable? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so if a Iew shall affirme the life of the ceremonies of the law, which we know to be dead, rotten, and buried so long since in the graue of Christ, although they once had a truth, yet now this is but false and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous: or else if a Iew should come and vrge (as they doe) that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie Isay 7. <hi>Behold a virgin shall conceiue, &amp;c.</hi> as a thing which they still expect the accomplishment of; is it not euident that he leaneth vnto a Iewish lie and fable? for that which was once absolutely necessarie to be beleeued vnto saluation, is now become so false, as that he that beleeueth it, is sure to be damned.</p>

               <p>These words if they be taken by way of exposition of the former, adde something to the more full answer of the former question, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that those ordinances of which we speake, the which while they

stood in force, and till the fulnes of time was come, were the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God; now the truth beeing reuealed, cease so to be, and are become the meere commandements of men. But yet I take it some difference is to be put betweene these two, namely this, that by comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of men, are more properly meant (not those which were diuine ordinances) but humane constitutions, and traditions thrust by the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish teachers vpon the Church, to be obserued with like deuotion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious respect, as if they were the very commandements of God: such as those our Sauiour found and left the Church of the Iewes pestered with, and opposeth them to diuine ordinances, Matth. 15.9. <hi>In vaine they worship mee, teaching for doctrines mens precepts.</hi> Which that we may a little better conceiue, it is not amisse to note, that the Iewes haue, and doe affirme that Moses receiued the law from God, either by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was of things more obscure, more breife, and difficult; or else by word of mouth, and that was of things more large, seruing for the interpretation of that law written: and for this latter sake (say they) was it that he staied 40. daies in the mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> for else in one houre he might haue receiued the tables in which the law was written: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they themselues were at leasure to number the lawes written by Moses, and gaue in the number of the affirmatiue to be 248. so many as there are members in a mans bodie, and the negatiue 365. so many as there be daies in a yeare, to betoken that the Lord requireth the through obseruation of them with all the strength, and that all their daies: which numbers added together were burthens sufficient for many euen to read ouer; yet laid they innumerable, and more intollerable traditionarie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts on the people, which they say Moses receiued by word of mouth from God, and left them to Ioshuah: who deliuered them to the seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie elders, they to the former Prophets, these to the latter, from them to the great Synagogue, from whom they were preserued to the wise men returning from the Babylonish captiuitie, and so from generation, to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration euen to this day: to write these explications, say they, is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by God, abusing that text, Prou. 4.21. but they are kept in the heart of some wise men at this day.

For the Apostle would here note a iudgement of God vpon such persons as were addicted vnto fables and humane precepts: the which iudgement, is a wofull and heauie stroake of Gods wrath, whether a man estrange himselfe from it before, or after he haue receiued it much more. For what a plague is it for a man, to hate the truth, and in it God the author of it, who is truth it selfe; the light of comfort, and direction of it, as also the happie fruit of it, which is saluation; seeing all they are damned <hi>that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receiue not the loue of the truth, whereby they might be saued?</hi>

For seeing if the Sonne set vs not free, Ioh. 8.32. we remaine in bondage vnder sinne, and damnation, and are eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day drawing to execution (in the meane time as condemned persons beeing reserued in bolts and chaines till the time of execution:) Now in these bands of death, the Prince of peace our Lord Iesus offreth a grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pardon, the partie offended seeketh to the delinquent, entreateth and wooeth him to accept of a pardon procured by his own blood, and sealed by his death: Now wretched men cannot abide neither the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, nor the messengers: but in contempt tread vnder their feet that blood wherewith they should be sanctified, and scorne the Princes cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency: shall not the very consciences of these men in the Lords iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment accuse themselues as worthy of ten thousand deaths? yes surely, and shall iustifie the Lords righteousnes, when he shall bring vpon them that great <hi>condemnation</hi> of a great part of the world: who the light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, and shining on their faces, yet loued darknes rather then light.

Did euer the world abound as at this day, with Worldlings, Libertines, Atheists, Newters, and Epicures? and was yet the truth euer more glorious and shining then at this day?

The which what argueth it either in one or other, but that the former would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hold their wonte, which hath beene generally to change, and turne their religion with the times, as though the truth to saluation were not the same, but variable and alterable as the times are: and that the latter haue in no small measure turned themselues from that truth, in the which they haue formerly found much more sweetnes then now they do: &amp; that delusion hath possessed both; the one in whole, the other in great part? <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it is not thus with vs, we come to heare the truth, and loue it, and hope to hold it vnto the end? <hi>Ans.</hi> Yet this detracteth not from that truth laid downe: For 1. how many will not grant the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel their presence, their bodies, their eares? no man will gainsay but that these are turned away; or if any should, the pitifull, ignorance, and the fruits of it would conuince it. 2. How many be there which heare, and yet in their iudgements intertaine not the truth? and these are thus farre worse then the Iewes themselues, who could acknowledge that Christ taught the way of God truly. Men will not beleeue that the way to heauen is so straite, as we out of the word of God describe it; nor that God is so rigorously iust, as to cast away those that meane well: nor so straite laced, as to exact the forfeyt of euery offence: neither that can

And thus by Gods iudgement vpon the infidelitie of men, themselues can lay blocks inough in the way to stumble at the truth, and desperatly breake the necks of their soules vpon that verie rock, which was laid for the rising and saluation of the righteous. 3. At how many hands doth the truth go away reproched, yea hated, and persecuted? Gods graces are derided, Gods children scoffed and mocked, by those who are borne after the flesh, Gal. 4.29. And why doth Caine hate and kill his brother? because <hi>his deedes were good, and his owne euill.</hi> And why are Christians, yea Christ himselfe mocked? <hi>euen for this confidence in his God,</hi> Psalm. 22.8. But here euery man blesseth himselfe, and God forbid that men that professe Christ, or that we who are ordinarie hearers of his word, should be iustly ranked in this number. Yet euen of vs, how few are there whom the truth hath set free from lusts, and seruice of some sinne or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Many of vs indeed haue gone farre in the contemplation of this truth; but our minds, and soules are no more altered, and changed, then if we had read or heard some humane Histories, affecting vs for the time, but leauing vs where they found vs at first. How few of vs are san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by this truth, and daily proceed on to encrease in sanctification by meane of it? which that it is the scope of it, Christs petition teacheth, Ioh. 17.17. Nay how many of our hearers detaine this truth in vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse? that is, while they heare, learne, and can remember much of it; yet in their courses are as vaine and vngodly as euer before. Which plainely argueth a forsaking of the truth vpon the plaine feild, making such persons more liable to moe, and more fearefull strokes of God: who receiuing the truth into their eares, vnderstandings, and iudgements, but turne away their affections from it, yea turne from it in their practise, in that they hate to be reformed by it. And if we haue not in great part turned away from the truth: where is our former courage, and resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it? may not the Lord iustly complaine of vs as he did once of his owne people? <hi>they haue no courage for the truth.</hi> Many of vs durst bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter haue beene seene in Christian exercises then now we dare; we could better beare a rebuke for our profession then now we can: we did more take to heart the dammage of the truth, then now we do: we did take more paines for it, we could be at more cost for it, we could be more

For example: if we loue it for the prosperitie of it, times of persecutions will make vs fall off, with Demas. If we hold it because we would hold our temporalties, the losse of it will be light in comparison of losse of goods, dignities, countrie, world, libertie, and life, the least of these will the heart fasten vpon, although with the losse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the truth, and with it of saluation also. 2. Practise so much of it as thou knowest, and the more thou practisest, the more thou knowest, and the more thou knowest thus,<note place="margin">Change of hart and life goeth with all sauing knowledge.</note> the more thou louest, and the surer dost thou bind it vpon thy selfe: and this is the surest hold, Ioh. 7.17. when as in religion, faith and good conscience are ioyned together: for such as thy conscience is, such shalt thou be found in religion; without which, heare euery houre a sermon, read ouer the Bible as often as he did, who gloried that he had read the text and glosse also fourteene times ouer,<note place="margin">Alfonsus king of Aragon.</note> all this knowledge will not lift thee vp to heauen. 3. Call no ground of this diuine truth into question, suspect not that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which thou canst not reach, but accuse thine owne weakenes and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: our first parents yeelding at the first onset of Satan, to call into question the truth of God, were turned away from all that image of God, which stood in truth and holines. 4. Beware of indifferencie in Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> matters: many thinke it good wisedome and pollicie to be on the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hand, and as waxe fit to take all formes, and the print of any religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but the truth is, that such persons as are not rooted and stablished in the truth, when windes, and stormes arise, or the euill day approach, they shall not be able to stand; but as they haue beene long tottering, so their fall shall be great.</p>

                  <hi>To the pure, all things are pure,</hi>] In this former branch of the verse, three generall points are to be considered. 1. Who are meant by <hi>pure</hi> persons. 2. How all things are pure or impure. 3. How all things are pure to the pure.</p>
               <p>To answer the first question,<note place="margin">Who are pure persons.</note> we must finde out what puritie both for kinde and degree is here meant. All puritie is either in the fountaine, or thence deriued. The former is the most simple, perfect, and immeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble puritie in the creator: the latter is some darke image, and shadowe of the former in the creature, according to the measure of it, so long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding with it as it cleaueth vnto him, or he vnto it. The former is not meant, but the latter which is of reasonable creatures, either angels or men, differing indeede in degree according to their capacitie: but not herein, that before the fall of either, it was a puritie mutable in them both. But to drawe to our Apostles subiect, this puritie is not now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered in the Angels, but in man: Neither is it that puritie which we had in our innocencie: for though then we were purer then the Nazarites of Ierusalem, who were <hi>purer then the snowe, and whiter then the milke:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lam. 4.7.8.</note> yet

by our captiuitie vnder sinne, <hi>our visage is become blacker then a coale:</hi> But a puritie of an other qualitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such a one as is renewed vpon vs, by the Lords beholding vs, &amp; cleauing vnto vs, &amp; not that shining &amp; spotles pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which we had while we were able to behold him, &amp; cleaue vnto him. This puritie then is not set in vs by nature, but made ours by grace; and beeing the puritie of our Mediator, is imputed vnto so many, as shal stand righteous in the sight of God the Father. The persons therfore here called <hi>pure,</hi> are such as by <hi>faith,</hi> are set into Christ, by whose blood they are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, and by whose spirit through the meanes of the <hi>word,</hi> that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall seede of regeneration, they are sanctified and reserued vnto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting. And hence to both these is the purifying and cleansing of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ascribed in the Scriptures. 1. Faith not onely as a hand laieth hold on all Christs righteousnesse, to make the sinner stand iust before God; but inwardly by little and little <hi>purifieth the heart,</hi>

Thus the Heathen were accustomed before they eate or drunke, to offer some part thereof to their gods; which was another cause why Daniel craued that he might not be defiled with that meate, as is well gathered out of cap. 5.4. and from such meate the Apostle wisheth all Christians to abstaine, 1. Cor. 8.10. Hither are to be referred all Popish separations of daies, and meats, and their consecrations of water, salt, crosses, palmes, to driue away deuils: all their vowes also, pilgrimages, orders, single life, wilfull pouertie, watchings, fastings, whippings, in all which they place opinion of holines and merit: adde hereunto all superstitious rellikes, and monuments, which wheresoeuer are filthy and polluted. 2.

Thus Paul preached Christ a stumbling blocke, and scandall to Iewe and Gentile: and Daniel prayeth to his God, although the king and all the countrie raged against him. This offence is Pharisaicall, taken, but not giuen. Now for scandall giuen, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now to remooue all this impuritie, we must haue a proportionall puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie purchased by Iesus Christ.

               <p>Now from this second point we may note sundrie worthie lessons, which I will onely propound, and not stand vpon them, because I will hasten to the third and principall point of all.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">God hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen some part of his i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage vpon all his creatures.</note>1. Seeing all things were pure in their creation, we may herein as in a glasse behold the puritie of God in all his creatures, admiring that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his which bewraied it selfe euen in the meanest of them: yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoking our selues, to loue, reuerence, and feare before him, the image of whose goodnesse shineth out not onely in angels and men; but euen in the silly worme and flie, yea in the liueles creatures themselues. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hence we may gather our owne dutie towards the creatures, namely 1. reuerently meditate and speake of them. 2. purely to vse them. 3. mercifully to deale with them: all which we shall the easier doe, if we can spie out some part of Gods image in them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <note place="margin">All the hurt of man from the creatures is first from himselfe.</note>2. Consider our miserie, and the wofull fruit of our sinne, which hath debarred vs from all comfort in heauen and earth, from God or any of his creatures: sinne hath wrapped vs vnder condemnation, hath set God and his creatures as hosts and armies against vs, hath made nothing ours but hell and damnation; so as if we meete with any euill from any of the creatures through the venome, poison, or noysomnes of the particular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, or by any other accident, we are not so much to condemne the creature, but our owne sinnes: for they were either not so made, or had not beene hurtfull at all to man, but by his owne sinne, the poison of which hath poisoned their natures, so that by them mans sinne is either iustly punished, or himselfe righteously exercised. Now then seeing our owne sinne hath subiected the creatures of God (otherwise so comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and sweete helpes vnto our liues) vnto such vanitie, we haue great cause to abhorre our sinnes for euer, yea, and our selues for them, rather then drinke in iniquitie as the fish doth water. The sweetest sinnes would carrie a bitter tang, if we would but remember what sweete comfort of the creatures we haue forfeited for them.<note place="margin">Not restored to our former right in the creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with their Creator.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The restitution of vs to our former right is onely from our Lord Iesus Christ, and our first right is recouered to vs on this manner. First, as we were at oddes with the Creator, and consequently with the creature;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18792:153"/>
euen so first we are reconciled vnto God through Christ, and then to the creatures: for when Christ (who is our peace) hath wrought our peace with God, he bringeth backe our peace: both the inward peace of our owne consciences, which before could doe nothing but accuse and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie; as also peace with others, friends and enemies, yea euen with the <hi>beast of the field, and the stone in the wall:</hi> and euerie thing striketh a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of peace with him who hath entred into league with the creator of it. If any man then would haue any right in any creature he vseth, he must not hold it by the broken title in the first Adam, but by a recouered and newe purchase in the second Adam, who is the Lord of glorie blessed for euer.</p>
               <p>The third generall point is; <hi>How all things are pure to the pure? Ans.</hi> That we may rightly and properly conceiue the Apostles meaning, we must knowe, 1. That the vniuersall particle, <hi>all</hi> things] admitteth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, and may not be extended beyond the Apostles intendment, who speaketh onely of such things as are not forbidden by the law of God, or nature: or rather onely of things of an indifferent nature, which in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues are neither commanded nor forbidden, and neither good nor euill in their substance and nature, but are to be vsed or not vsed according to the circumstances and occasions of them: such things as these are, meat, drinke, apparell, recreation, sleepe, marriage, single life, riches, pouertie, bondage, freedome, &amp;c. And it may not seeme strange thus to restraine this generall proposition; seeing we haue it thus limited in sundrie other places, 1. Cor. 6.4. <hi>all things are lawfull, but not profitable:</hi> and cap. 10.23. <hi>all things are lawfull for me, but not expedient:</hi> Rom. 14.20. <hi>all things indeede are pure, but destroy not for meats, &amp;c.</hi> 2. By <hi>pure</hi> is meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but that all such things are free now to be vsed in good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without scruple, by meanes of our Christian libertie. And 3. in that he addeth to <hi>the pure,</hi> he sheweth how we come to haue title in this libertie, euen by becomming beleeuers, and getting our hearts purified by faith. In one word <hi>all</hi> indifferent <hi>things, are pure,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Note well.</note> and free to be vsed of the <hi>pure,</hi> and beleeuing person, with this one condition; so they <hi>bee purely and rightly vsed.</hi> The which point leadeth vs to demand and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer a great question worthie to be with iudgement determined, as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of verie great vse thorough the whole life of a Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> How may things indifferent which in their nature are pure to the beleeuer, become so vnto him in their vse?<note place="margin">How the pure may vse any thing purely.</note> or how may he rightly and purely vse them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Then doth the beleeuer vse them purely when he is lead vnto, and moderated in the vse of them by these three vertues. 1. <hi>faith.</hi> 2. <hi>loue.</hi> 3. <hi>sobrietie.</hi> The first of which looketh vp vnto God: the second
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:18792:154"/>
looketh downeward vnto man: the third respecteth the beleeuer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; none of all which must be offended and preiudiced in and by the vse of them. The first looketh to the lawfulnes of the thing to be vsed: the second to the profitablenesse: the third to the due proportion for the manner and measure.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vsed in faith.</note>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> When doe we vse them in <hi>faith? Answ.</hi> 1. When they are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed both by warrant and leaue from God: our warrant is from Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> word: our leaue is obtained by prayer before, and thanksgiuing after: for euerie creature <hi>of God is good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.4, 5.</note> 
                  <hi>thus sanctified by the word and prayer.</hi> The word giueth vs warrant that the creature is made free and lawfull for vs to vse with good conscience; not onely by the word of creation in the beginning; but since by that word which assureth that in Christ <hi>all things are pure to the pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But how can the word warrant in these things which are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commanded nor forbidden in it, as to eate this or that meate, put on this or that garment, &amp;c. <hi>Ans.</hi> We must haue a word, if not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding, yet permitting the vse of them, for euery one must <hi>be fully perswaded in his minde:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14.5.14.</note> and although <hi>nothing is impure in it selfe, yet is it to him that thinketh it so.</hi> 2. Although we haue not particular pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, prescribing the particulars of this kind, yet haue we a generall word freeing them from legall commonnes and vncleannes: not only in this and many other texts, but especially in Act. 10. in Peters vision. 3. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we haue not a seuerall precept for euery particular commanding, yet haue we direction in the word by generall rules of restraint; the tast of which shall after be giuen. Againe, we vse them by faith when we vse them by <hi>leaue</hi> obtained through prayer (which also implieth a word to ground it selfe vpon) whereby we both entreate an holy vse of all these outward things: as also lift vp our hearts in thanksgiuing for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our libertie in them, and Gods blessing of them vnto vs. <hi>Secondly,</hi> then we vse them in faith, when through the whole vse of them, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound before vs the glorie of God: ayming directly hereat, that he may haue the honour of them, whose we and they are, and by whose leaue we reape the comfort of them: 1. Cor. 10.3. <hi>Whether yee eate or drinke, or whatsoeuer yee doe, doe all to the glorie of God</hi>; men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that they neede not thinke on God, but in the Church, or in their priuate family-worship, and so banish him from their tables, and ciuill actions, but most of all from their recreations and sports, here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mention of God is vnsauorie and vnseasonable: but that word of the Apostle, <hi>whatsoeuer ye doe,</hi> and <hi>do all</hi> to the glorie of God, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another lesson: namely, that there is no action wherein it is lawfull to dishonour, no not to depart or forget God, and the glorie due vnto
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:18792:154"/>
him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When by the naturall or ciuill vse of them, faith rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it selfe to some spirituall meditation: as for example: in the vse of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> bread, stirring vp the heart to hunger after, and feed vpon Christ: in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on our clothes, to meditate of putting on the Lord Iesus Christ as a garment: in putting them off, of the casting off the old man with his lusts: In vndertaking a iourney, conceiuing the life as a pilgrimage; in returning home to thinke of our rest in heauen: in our marriages to conceiue our selues the spouses of Christ, and such like: in which we see an euident worke of faith, lifting vp the heart from earthly to heauenly things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Things indifferent must be vsed <hi>in loue:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vsed in Loue, when.</note> for Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the vse of outward things, must giue place to charitie. And then are they so vsed, 1. when <hi>without the offence,</hi> 2. when to the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of others. First, <hi>without offence:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 14 20.</note> for it <hi>is euill to him that eateth with offence:</hi> and Paul would <hi>neuer eate meate, before he would offend.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8.13.</note> Hence followeth it, that we may not offend either <hi>priuate,</hi> or <hi>publike</hi> persons. Of priuate men, some are of weake consciences; and these must be borne vp and yeelded vnto for good, rather then destroied by our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: the Apostle became <hi>all things to all such persons:</hi> and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe would not quench a smoaking flaxe. Some other are obstinate, stiffe, yea and malitious, from whom we must challenge our Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. If men be carping Pharisies, or wilfull Papists, the counsell is, <hi>Let them alone:</hi> nay more,<note place="margin">Matth. 15.24.</note> so pretious must our libertie so dearely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased be vnto vs, as we may not neglect it, or dissemble it before such as are taught, and should be stronger, although they be brethren; for this was Peters case, for which he was iustly reprehended, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himselfe from the Gentiles, to pleasure the Iewes,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.11.</note> gaue them who had beene taught the contrarie, occasion to conceiue of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as vncleane still. This whole truth is confirmed by Pauls practise, who would and did permit Timothie to be circumcised in regard of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and weake beleeuers among the Iewes, Act. 16.3. but would not suffer Titus, so to be, Gal. 2.3. partly because he would not offend the godly; and partly because he would challenge Christian libertie against those obstinate and malitious aduersaries, who had almost ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned all the labours of the Apostle in that Church of Galatia, by vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging circumcision as a thing of absolute necessitie vnto saluation. Here is ministred a direct answer to that question, whether recusant Papists are to be compelled to Church, because it is an offence vnto them.<note place="margin">Papists must be compelled to come to church notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it offend them: and why.</note> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to I answer, 1. that this is not a case of indifferencie, but necessarie that they come into the pure worship of God: and therefore it must be effected, either by entreatie, or compulsion. 2. Were it indifferent,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:18792:155"/>
yet were they not to be festered in their error, because they refuse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and are not weake, but wilfull. 3. Neither are they thus compelled to beleeue, but to vse the right meanes of faith. 4. Good Iosias <hi>made a couenant with the Lord,</hi> and caused <hi>all his people to stand vnto it,</hi> 2. Chro. 34.32.</p>
               <p>Now as we may not offend our priuate brethren, so much lesse the publike Magistrate, who hath power giuen him of God to limit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine our ouercommon vse of these things by wholesome lawes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things indifferent, which lawes we are bound in conscience to obey: for then their indifferencie ceaseth not in regard of themselues, but of that law restraining them. And here sundrie questions may be further demanded: As, 1. <hi>Whether</hi> a man may with a safe conscience eate flesh at times prohibited by the Magistrate? <hi>Answ.</hi> In this one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance direction is giuen euen in all the other things of this kinde, as concerning daies, garments, &amp;c. therefore I say, that to eate or doe any other thing against a law, is one thing: and to doe otherwise then the law commands in these things, is another: the former common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 1. hindreth the end of the law: 2. contemneth the authoritie of the law maker: 3. hath no iust cause in it selfe: 4. careth not for the offence of others: this is alwaies a sinne against God, and a breach of the fifth commandement: but otherwise, the former cautions duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, I see not how it is a sinne in conscience to eate besides the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But can any Magistrate make a law to binde the conscience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, but yet we must obey their wholesome lawes <hi>for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake</hi>; which conscience is bound not by the law of the Magistrate, but by Gods law, which bindeth to obedience of the Magistrates lawes in all lawfull and honest things; so Paul, Rom. 13.5. subiecteth not the conscience to the lawes of men, but to Gods ordinance, inforcing obedience to such humane lawes as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 3. But how stand we to the libertie, wherein Christ hath set vs free, if we suffer the Magistrate to curb vs of it? <hi>Answ.</hi> Wel inough, seeing the Magistrate medleth not with the libertie in conscience pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Christ:<note place="margin">Gal. 5 1.</note> for then we might not yeeld a whit, but stand on our right: but reseruing that as whole and entire as he found it, he onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth the ouercommon vse of that libertie for example. The lawes which prohibit this or that meate, beeing ciuill, and made in respect of ciuill and politike order, for the common good of men, are externall, and the obseruation of them is a ciuill obedience, and in it selfe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no worship of God, vnto which the outward man is bound directly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a word vnderstand, we must consider in euery indifferent thing two things: 1. a <hi>libertie</hi> to vse them; 2. the <hi>vse</hi> of that libertie, which two differ as much as meat set vpon the table, and the eating of it. The liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is in the conscience; the vse is an outward thing: the former no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates law medleth with, nor can restraine: but in the latter, his law is a binder. And thus we shut the doore against all Popish ecclesiasticall lawes and canons, concerning fasts, feasts, daies, garments, and infinite other traditions, which they vrge as things necessarie to saluation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly binding the conscience: yea as meritorious, and leading to a state of perfection: whereas indeed they directly fight against Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie; yea many of them against the morall law it selfe. Let them plead (as they doe) that to the greater authoritie more subiection is due, and therefore they must be much more obeyed in their ecclesiasticall consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, then the Magistrate in his ciuill. I answer, when they haue proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued their charter out of the word, whereby they may make lawes, which must be obeyed for conscience sake, as the ciuill Magistrate may, we will subscribe vnto them. In the meane time we haue learned, that seeing the Church hath power only to ordaine constitutions for orders sake; no man is further bound to them, but only so farre as he may auoid scandall of others, or further the publique good intended by that constitution. But what if the Magistrate giue life to ecclesiasticall constitutions of the Church: whether then doe they become such lawes, as bind the conscience? <hi>Answ.</hi> The Magistrate giueth no greater power to the Church to make lawes, then Christ hath giuen; if he make his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure knowne, that he by his power will see order kept, it is the part of euery good subiect and Christian, to obey him cheerefully.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To vse out libertie in loue, we must not onely not cast back our brethren, but <hi>edifie</hi> them, and bring them forward in godlinesse:<note place="margin">Things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent must be vsed to further our selues and others in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines.</note> 1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Cor. 6.12. <hi>all things must profit:</hi> 1. Cor. 10.23. all things are lawfull, but all <hi>things edifie not:</hi> And the generall rule of all indifferent things is, <hi>Let all things be done to edification:</hi> and Rom. 15.1, 2. Let euerie man please his neighbour to <hi>edification,</hi> euen as Christ pleased not himselfe, but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Whatsoeuer then it is of this ranke, which either would weaken, or not edifie our brother, be it neuer so lawfull, neuer so profitable to our selues, neuer so powerfully by earthly authoritie enioyned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who are not borne to themselues, but vnto Christ, vnto his Church, and vnto the fellowe members, must not dare to meddle with it; seeing the higher commandement of God, bindeth to giue no offence, neither to Iew nor Gentile, nor to the Church of God. And herein let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Daniels example for our imitation, who to many might seeme not only too strict, but verie vnwise for so small a thing as he stood vpon
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:18792:156"/>
to forgoe the Kings fauour and his owne aduancement; yet because he could not vse his libertie in the Kings meat without the offence of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and others, he would not doe the least euill for the greatest good: it was not frowardnesse in him, nor disobedience to the King; but conscience and obedience to God, which made him keepe himselfe pure from it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, although we vse things indifferent in <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>loue,</hi> and yet forget <hi>sobrietie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Things indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent vsed in Sobriety, when.</note> we impure them vnto our selues. Then we vse them in sobrietie, 1. when we vse them as helpes in our callings generall and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> speciall. The former, when in the vse of meates, drinkes, apparell, sleepe, recreation, riches, &amp;c. we still preserue in vs a fitnesse vnto the duties of pietie, and Gods worship. The latter, when we exceede not our abilitie, but square and stint our selues in them according to the most sober of our age, degree, condition, and trade of life. And both of them, when no vse of these is any hinderance to any dutie of the first and second Table; so as we neither be drunke with the pleasures of them; nor oppressed and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> made heauie by them, and so the day come on vs vnawares. 2. When in regard of our affections we haue the command of these things, and not they of vs: 1. Cor. 6.12. <hi>all things are lawfull for me, but I will not be brought vnder the power of any thing.</hi> The cheife point of Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is, to vse the creature as not vsing it, reioyce in it as not reioycing: to buy as not buying,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.30.</note> to haue a wife as not hauing one: to vse things a while rather then to enioy them, and much lesse to be enioyed of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Now to drawe this doctrine into our best vse: it will be worth our inquirie to consider how grieuously men offend against al these rules, in which that men may better take notice of their continuall failings I will stand somewhat the longer, and manifest how men impure these things.<note place="margin">To vse a thing purely, 1. a man must sanctifie himselfe.</note> 1. in generall. 2. in speciall, and both according to the former rules. In generall, men impurelie vse them two wayes. 1. in not sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>persons.</hi> 2. in not sanctifying the <hi>creatures.</hi> For the former: vnsanctified <hi>persons</hi> and vnbeleeuers, receiue the creatures and comfort of them, onely as the fruits of Gods generall prouidence and power, whereby he sustaineth all the creatures, the bruit beasts, the sensles crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, nay the verie substances of the deuills themselues: but not as the gifts of God become in Christ a prouident Father: nor as tokens of his speciall loue as towards his children. And therefore although the wicked man and cruell oppressor beare himselfe vpon the loue of God, because all things succeede with him, and he thriueth in his designes, yet in truth he hath no more cause then the deuil himselfe hath, because he is the God of the world, and Prince of the aire, mightily preuailing against the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of disobedience: for these are so farre from beeing speciall loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:18792:156"/>
that they are signes of a fearefull future wrath, because by them they haue thrust and heaped vp the measure of their condemnation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>creature</hi> not sanctified by the word and prayer,<note place="margin">2. He must san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the word &amp; praier</note> is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purely vsed: and therefore generall is the sinne of the most, who profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and brutishly receiue them without prayer and thanksgiuing, by which both the creator and the creature is blessed. The former obtaineth a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, which is the applying of the goodnesse of the creature to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, without which we may haue bread, and want the staffe of it, put on cloathes and not be warme: get riches but want the fruition, earne wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and incomes, but put them in a broken bagge: be diligent in our callings, but not thriue by them: for this blessing and comfort of the creature, commeth meerely and more immediatly from the band of God: how is it not then most meete, that we should begge it at his hands? This would the Lord teach, when he commandeth his people to sanctifie their verie <hi>houses</hi> and dwellings: so in Abrahams seruant, and Paul who pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for prosperous iourneys, Act. 25.5.<note place="margin">Deut. 20.5.</note> The like ought we to doe in all our recreations: and hauing receiued our comfort from any thing, we must turne vs to the other part of our prayer, which is thanksgiuing, not onely for enioying the creature, but that we haue it by vertue of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: neither onely for the vse, but for the right and holy vse of it, which is the portion but of a fewe. The two precepts of the Apostle are worthy our continuall meditation and practise; <hi>Pray continually,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Thess. 5 17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>In all things giue thankes.</hi> How many are so farre from this, as that they either cannot, or are ashamed to pray and praise God for their liberall prouision in meate and drinke? a man cannot imagine the bruitishnesse of numbers of men, and perhaps reputed Christians in this behalfe, who no more lift vp their hearts or hands vnto the Lord, then the bruit beasts themselues, which deuoure the food, but cannot consider that they are fedde by some other thing without the foode it selfe: such persons as little conceiue that in Adam all the creatures and the right in them was lost: so as there is no right left in them, but by leaue from God through Iesus Christ: as little doe they depend vpon God for his blessing, which is the staffe of their liues; but rather in the midst of Gods mercie, they grow vp into securitie and forgetfulnes of him, yea lift vp their heeles against him, and corrupt themselues in the things they vse, giuing vp themselues vnto intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, idlenes, filthie lusts, speaches, and actions,<note place="margin">Reasons proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought not to vse any of Gods creatures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaue and thanksgiuing.</note> and all because God is not at their tables, but is driuen thence. Now that I may convince this generall sinne to be an high kinde of impietie, and not so indifferent as many account it; I will vse some reasons, to shewe that no man ought to presume without turning to God to vse any of his creatures.</p>
               <p>For first, whose are the heauens and earth, and the furniture of them?<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

And for the latter, we haue the contrarie practise in the Church, both of the olde and newe Testament. The poore maids of Ramah Zophim could tell Saul that the people would eate no meate,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 9.13.</note> till Samuell the Prophet was come and blessed the sacrifice; which was no mentall, but a blessing of the meate by word of mouth: nay Christ in his family though he was the heire of all things, neuer are meate, but first gaue thankes; yea he had a forme of grace and thanksgiuing, which was verie well knowne to the disciples, Luk. 24.35. Paul in the shippe would not eate bread, but first gaue <hi>thankes in the presence of them all:</hi> and how iust a thing is it,<note place="margin">Act. 27.35.</note> that that mouth which openeth it selfe to the receiuing of the creatures, should open it selfe in the praise of the giuer? which who so neglecteth, besides that he sinneth against a speciall commandement, Deut. 8.10. <hi>when thou hast eaten, and filled thy selfe, thou shalt blesse the Lord thy God:</hi> he doth as a man, who sitteth downe and taketh his dinner in an inne, and goeth away without paying the inholder his due;<note place="margin">Beza homil. 10. hist. resurr.</note> which euerie one will say is a shamefull part. And as there be many who so grossely forget God and themselues: so those faile also that formally blesse their tables, because it is a fashion, and they must doe it at least by one of their boyes, and then the table is formally blessed: when as prayer and praise for other daily comforts as necessarie are neglected; as for conueniencie of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and habition, garments, rest, and safetie, health, comforts of the calling, recreations, &amp;c. for i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">3. Sobrietie.</note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They faile against the rule of sobrietie. 1. Who watch not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ouer their hearts, but in eating and drinking, make themselues heauie, and vnfit to all good duties both spirituall, &amp; the outward duties of their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> callings. 2. That watch not ouer their <hi>affections,</hi> but set them on meat and drinke, putting themselues vnder the power of these, but keepe not their owne power ouer them. As many cannot be without the pot at the elbow, and drinke for drinkes sake, and eate not for strength but for appetite. And hence men and women deuise new waies of stirring vp their appetite both to eate and drinke; a greiuous sinne, which argueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> nothing more then at the destruction of the creature. 3. Those who watch not their abillitie, but breake out into superfluitie and excesse, not only beyond the call of nature, but their owne calling, abillitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life; disabling themselues not only from the duties of loue, and mercie; but also of equitie and iustice, that men with whom they deale cannot get their owne in any good sort out of their hands. The Romans had a law that euery man should suppe openly: the intention of which was partly to testifie their sobrietie, and partly to restraine excesse: were such a law in force amongst vs, we should see many poore men, whose persons and estate, sparing would well beseeme, prodigally consuming that which ought to be reserued, either for the discharge of debts, or the comfort of wife and children in time <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to come. 4. Those who watch not ouer their practise, but corrupt themselues in the vse of the creatures: as drunken persons; and those who goe beyond these, namely such as watch and delight to make o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers drunke; a fearefull sinne, so frequent as the most thinke they can scarce testifie their affection; or are short in their entertainement vnlesse
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:18792:158"/>
they make their freind drunke. This wicked custome it seemeth had gotten footing among the Persians; which was the occasion of that law that none should <hi>compell another to drinke aboue</hi> that himselfe would:<note place="margin">Ester 1.</note> the like whereof were a disgrace to make, but a greater shame not to be kept of Christians: the Heathen King shall condemne a number of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, who would not haue his house a schoole of intemperance, nor any one to drinke but according to his thirst and appetite.</p>
               <p>Secondy, in <hi>apparell</hi> these rules are transgressed. The first. 1. When men or women weare strange fashions and guises:<note place="margin">Apparell not vsed in 1. Faith.</note> seeing the rule of the word for attire, is the presidence of the wise, graue, and godly, of that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> degree we liue in: Phil. 4.9. whatsoeuer things are <hi>pure, honest, of good report, &amp;c.</hi> those things must we doe: and the threatning is, that God will <hi>visit all such as weare strange attire:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeph. 1.9.</note> and yet where can we cast our eyes, and not see numbers whose bodies were they so monstrous, and of as many fashions as their apparell is, they would soone be cast out of the companie and account of men? but whatsoeuer their bodies be, their minds appeare monstrous, filled with vaine and idle conceits, causing them most wastfully spende their time, and goods: and all to shew (<hi>not the hidden man of the heart</hi>) but that lightnesse, vanitie, want on and dishonest disposition, which wageth battaile not against Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie only but euen ciuillitie, and humanitie it selfe: some wearing their apparell not to couer their nakednes, the right end for which the Lord instituted it: but as hauing put off all shame to discouer their nakednes further then a man of any modestie and ciuill behauiour would be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to looke vpon: others so devising and wearing their clothes as if they were willing to put themselues into a frame, wherein they cannot only not turne themselues to any busines, but are scarse at libertie to feed themselues; but as the picture in a frame or table is wholly mooued or else neuer a whit, so many women especially are so fitted in their frames, as the whole frame must be remooued before they can mooue any part about any profitable labour or busines: and so are fit for nothing but as pictures in tables to be looked vpon. Sure I am, the vertuous woman was neuer thus attyred: Prov. 30. 2. Those transgresse the first rule, who by their apparell confound the sexes.<note place="margin">Deut. 22 5.</note> The <hi>man may not weare the womans <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> apparell, nor the woman the mans:</hi> then which nothing is more common in maskes and plaies, euen hereby most iustly condemned.</p>

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:18792:159"/>
that God doth so: whereas the <hi>rich and poore meete, God made them both:</hi> he accepteth not the person of the rich, nor contemneth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the poore: and of the two, the broken soule is the delight of his eye.

When men wast them in pride, prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> gaming, vncleanenes, or any other vnchristian course: for they are not Lords of them but stewards, which must be called to a reckoning: which when we come to make vp, what comfort will it be to giue in, as many can doe no other? so much weekely spent at the tauerne; so much at cards and dice; so much in the bowling close or alley; so much in some one ruff more then needed; so much perhaps in compassing my filthy lust, and euery of these draw deepe: and when the Lord shall aske, yea but how much vpon the poore, vpon the Ministerie, vpon godly vses? oh here thou wast able to doe nothing at all. Oh wretched man, looke to the matter betime, thy selfe would take no such bills of thy seruants, but thou wouldst turne them away: and canst thou look for any other but that the Lord should turne thee out of his doores? 3.

                  </gap> the word of God in the Scriptures is holy, as God himselfe is; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> therefore it is a fearefull sinne to iest in the phrases of Scriptures, and so
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:18792:160"/>
to take the name of God in vaine. 2. The iudgements of God are no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fit matters to sport our selues withall, whether in man or beast. When we see a naturall foole plaie the foole, or madde men in their frantike fits, this defect in them is a fearefull fruit of sinne, a matter of mourning, and not of laughter: they that keepe fooles onely to solace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by their follie, haue no warrant so to doe: of all the pleasures lawfull or vnlawfull, that Salomon tried his heart withall, we read of no such; it is no lawfull recreation: but for other better ends it is fit such poore creatures should be kept. And for that most generall iudgement of God, the enmitie of the creatures, the principall vse we ought to make thereof, is the acknowledging of that fearefull brand of mans sinne deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imprinted in the poore creatures; the serious consideration whereof, duly applied, must needes rather breake then delight a mans heart. Yet euen of this enmitie and pursuit of some kinds of the creatures, there may be another lawfull vse by way of recreation, delight, and exercise, as espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in hunting, hauking, and such like disports, vsed with moderation, and without needlesse tormenting of silly beasts. But none that hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christianitie, or naturall affections, can take delight in the cruell murthering,<note place="margin">Throwing at cocks an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane sport.</note> or painfull tormenting of any dumb creature. Alas, sinnefull man, hast thou not brought euill enough vpon the innocent creature, without such reioycing and triumphing ouer that bondage which thy impietie hath imposed vpon those creatures, which in their kind obey and serue the Creator farre better then thou? God setteth his good crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture before thee, that in it thou mightest behold his loue, mercie, proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and power towards thee, and not that thou shouldest shew cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and hard-heartednes vnto it. A note of a good man is to be mercifull to his beast: but this practise is one of the cruell mercies of the wicked: how can such recreation stand with the feare of God? how is such reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing mingled with trembling?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">It is no safe medling with edge tooles.</note>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Neither may we plaie with sin: for that is no indifferent thing neither. As when we see a man giuen ouer to drunkennes, this spectacle is indeed no matter of laughter or merriment, but of sorrow &amp; lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Gods image should be so foully defaced. Neither must the feare of God euer be laid aside, especially in our recreations, wherein we are so soone ouertaken.<note place="margin">Prov. 26.18.</note> Salomon maketh it a note of a foole, that is, a wicked man, <hi>to make a pastime of sinne:</hi> and againe, he casteth <hi>firebrands, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, and deadly things, and saith, am I not in sport?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second rule of loue is neglected, 1. when any of our recreations <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> tend to the hurt of man:<note place="margin">2.

When by
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:18792:160"/>
our recreations, we loose our patience, meeknesse, and loue, and rage, and scorne, and quarrell with them that therein crosse vs: nay with the sacred name of God himselfe, or with the vaine name of lucke or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; as gamesters are neuer so zealous in Gods matters, as in their own gaine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are not vsed in sobrietie;<note place="margin">3. Sobrietie.</note> 1. when men make a calling of their recreation, and haue no other, or no such hold to maintaine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them. 2. when men so powre out their hearts to pleasure, as that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hinder better duties in the calling publicke or priuate; for recreations should fit vs to duties: and here especially is reprooued that ordinarie vice whereby men shew themselues louers of pleasures more then of God, namely,<note place="margin">A good heart prizeth the word aboue the gold of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phir, and no treasure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it. Prov. 3.17.</note> when for their pleasure or recreation men omit the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Sabbath; yea further, when men sit at plaie day and night, longer then they would willingly for much mony be bound to any good thing; whereby they wast their substance, neglect their callings, loose their good names, and go vnder the names of gamesters, dicers, &amp;c. in the meane time who is at home to guid and order, to pray, and teach the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: oh this is a strange voice to a gamester.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how men faile in these particulars, to which many more might be added, whereby they draw much sinne vpon themselues in the vse of their most lawfull liberties.</p>
               <p>Now therefore shall it not be amisse to adde a fewe generall rules or counsels, by the obseruation of which,<note place="margin">Rules of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the vse of al things. A man will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue ouer earthly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures till he see better.</note> a heart desirous to please God in all things shall be able to avoide all these wandrings, and turne it selfe to the comfortable vse of all these things, wherein Satan hideth so many snares. As, 1. Labour for a pure eie, and all the bodie shall be bright and lightsome; such an eie as may see Iesus Christ with his merits; for till then, outward things cannot but be much and great in our eyes. 2. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> once thou seest Christ and his merits, set thy affections on nothing else,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> loue nothing, meruaile at nothing, desire nothing, but either Christ, or for Christ: nothing that is outward must be desired for it selfe, neither v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but so farre as it maketh to the chiefe marke: yea and more or lesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued or refused, as each of them are more or lesse valuable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Much lesse maist thou rest in any thing, which thou canst see here belowe where thou art but a stranger; for the things thou canst see are but as shadows to the things thou seest not, but oughtest most to affect; and sometimes they appeare to be the things they are not, and vanish away with the vse, and hasten vnto nothing. Now what follie were it to set them vp or equall them, and much more to preferre them before Christ, as if they were things that could make a man happie or vnhappie? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are in themselues neither good nor euill, but so farre as they lead
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:18792:161"/>
vnto or from Christ. And what more proper cause can we giue, why men so corrupt themselues in outward things, then this, that they make there a stoppe and resting place, whence they should make a steppe to climbe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> further towards heauen. 3. Iudge thy selfe and others not by abundance of outward things, no not if thou couldest passe Midas or Craesus in wealth, for thou art hereby but more bound, laden, and entangled, but by thine or their portion in Christ: that man hath gotten abundantly, that with his content in Christ, can manfully despise these outward things: he wanteth nothing that wanteth not faith: for what can he want who pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth Christ, in whom is all things? thinke then with thy selfe; Is Christ mine, or I his? then I shall be prouided for sufficiently, for he shall not want to whom Christ hath promised that nothing shall be wanting: hee cannot hunger and thirst, who hath once tasted of this bread &amp; water of life: he can neuer be found naked, who hath put on Iesus Christ: he can want no pleasure, who possesseth him at whose right hand are pleasures for euermore. I will therefore make Christ my foode, my raiment, my riches, my recreation, and reioyce that my lines are fallen so well: as for other things if I can haue them with him, and vse them for him, so it is: but if not, all shall goe before the pearle, naked Christ is wealth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. A second vse of this doctrine, that <hi>all things are pure to the pure,</hi> is to take notice what a priuiledge beleeuers haue obtained by Christ, that to them all things beeing pure, they may without scruple of conscience vse their libertie in any indifferent thing, so it be vsed aright: because that lawe of commandements which stood in ordinances is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated through the flesh of Christ,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.15.</note> that bondage which beleeuers were put vnder before Christs appearing,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.25. Coloss. 2.14.</note> lasteth now no longer <hi>seeing faith is come,</hi> the impotent and beggerly <hi>rudiments are vanished, and taken out of the way:</hi> the hand-writing by which they subscribed to their owne guiltinesse and condemnation, and that so often as they vsed the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the lawe, is <hi>fastened vnto the crosse.</hi> Nay more, sinne which robbed vs of all, is spoyled, the powers and principallities to which our sinne deliuered vs are vanquished, Sathan, hell, death, deuills, and all hostilitie are gloriously led captiue, and triumphed ouer, that we might see our full victorie, by our captaine and head of our profession: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thus set vs into the freedome of sonnes, and thereby giuen vs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue to all the priuiledges of heauen it selfe, which are constant and not fading; can he grudge vs, and not giue vs much more right to the creatures which are but corruptible. Oh how should this vrge vs to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the pretious gift of faith, which as a chiefe instrument sealeth vp to the soule possessing it, all the former priuiledges of the Saints: it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:18792:161"/>
with boldnes into the presence of God, it reacheth Christ in whom the Father is well pleased, it restoreth our right in the most common benefits, euen to the ayre which we breath in, it maketh prayers to bee heard, the word to be profitable; almes and workes of mercie to be comfortable: whereas without it a curse followeth, the vse of all blessings, all seruices are reiected, thy prayers are abhominable who turnest thy eare from hearing the lawe; thy hearing and reading the word, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and hearing of the sentence of thy owne condemnation: thou giuest almes of that which is none of thine owne; all thy paines and labour is but to get thee to hel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ô therfore seeing such are the prerogatiues of a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer; get faith into thy soule, which is the onely purchase of them: with great summes of money these freedoms cannot be obtained, only the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuer is free borne. Which if it be so, what a wofull thing is it, that so fewe prize these priuiledges as they ought; so fewe care for the gift of faith offered in the preaching of the word, by which alone they can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pure to the creatures, and the creatures vnto them; yea they pure to all things, and all things vnto them: by woefull experience we finde the truth of that of the Apostle, <hi>all men haue not faith</hi>; nay it is a gift, and giuen but to a verie fewe: for there are but a fewe freemen in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in comparison of the rest: and yet fewer benchers then freemen, as the Saints are; a fewe counsellers in a state, as beleeuers are; and yet better were it to be no man then no beleeuer. And in the second place, when by much labour and meanes, we haue obtained these freedomes, we must be as carefull to maintaine them: for otherwise we loose most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious things purchased with the pretious blood of the Sonne of God: the commandement is to stand <hi>fast in the libertie</hi> in which Christ hath set vs free: we must suffer no cauiller to infringe our charter, nor bind vs where Christ hath loosed vs. If the Lord haue pronounced <hi>all things,</hi> that is, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, pure</hi> &amp; free <hi>to the pure</hi> beleeuer, let a Popish spirit come &amp; boast of his vowe of voluntarie pouertie, of single life, of abstinence from flesh, &amp;c. we haue learned otherwise from this Scripture,<note place="margin">A wonder that to men so pure as they by their positions would be, so many sorts of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures should be impure, as meats, mariage, daies, &amp;c.</note> that not onely all estates, bondage or libertie, riches or pouertie, marriage or single life, are alike vnto God: but also that all creatures are sanctified to the sanctified receiuer; and consequently that all their vowes, besides that they are out of the power of him that voweth, doe nothing else but reuoke and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Christian libertie. And lastly, we are to testifie our thankefulnes for such liberties purchased; especially by abhorring the wickednesse of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, which bringeth vpon men a more detestable bondage then that of Egypt: 1. by binding them to seeke for righteousnes, and iustification before God by the workes of the lawe. 2. by impos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Thus much of the former branch of this 15. verse.</p>
               <q>But vnto them that are defiled and vnbeleeuing, is nothing pure, but euen their mindes and consciences are defiled.]</q>
               <p>This opposition sheweth the truth of the exposition of the former words: for as by the pure were meant the regenerate and beleeuers; so by the impure person the Apostle affirmeth that he meaneth the vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and vnbeleeuer, who wanting faith whereby he might partake with Christ and all his benefits, whose righteousnesse and innocencie is the onely lauer of the Church, by which also he might haue his heart within him purified in part, and his outward conuersation cleansed from dead workes wherein he walketh: he is no better then a leper in Gods eyes, ouerspread with naturall corruption, and outwardly spotted and speckled like the leopard, and in regard of the whole man like a blackea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moore who cannot change his hewe: for such an impuritie is here ascti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the vnbeleeuer, as not onely outwardly runneth vpon him; but such a one as hath taken and corrupted both the inferiour and the most supreame and excellent faculties of his soule, euen his <hi>minde,</hi> and his <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</hi> By the <hi>minde</hi> is meant the whole vnderstanding part of the soule; which beeing the eie of the soule carrieth with it <hi>reason, iudgement,</hi> and <hi>election.</hi> The pollution of which is to be taken vp with darkenes and blindnes, 1. Cor. 2.14. to be filled with <hi>vanitie,</hi> Eph. 4.17. with <hi>flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi> Colos. 2.18. in so much as all the naturall wisedome of man is <hi>fleshlie</hi> and <hi>deuillish.</hi> By conscience is meant that facultie of the soule, which by applying particular things iudged of and done,<note place="margin">Iam. 3.15.</note> doth determine them either with or against them: which depending vpon the former, must necessarily be ledde into the errors of it, no otherwise then one blind man is ledde by an other into a ditch. The pollution of it is, when it is either <hi>idle</hi> or <hi>ill occupied</hi>; the former, when it is sleepie, sensles, or feared, doing nothing at all, neither accusing, nor excusing: the latter, when it doth both these, but neither of them as it ought; but accuseth where it should excuse, and excuse where it ought to accuse. Now both these being thus polluted, let the vnbeleeuer turne himselfe to any thing in generall without himselfe (as all things in generall fall vnder the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) or turne him to any particular thought, word, action, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himselfe (which onely the conscience hath to doe with) in all these he is polluted, so as nothing to him can be pure. So as we must here
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:18792:162"/>
conceiue of an absolute impuritie ascribed to the vnbeleeuer (which is the onely difference in the opposition) for whereas puritie was in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer branch attributed to the beleeuer in some respect onely: for 1. the best are encombred with originall sinne. 2. but in part, and not fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate. 3. ouertaken not seldome with actuall transgression, which may and doth make them still crie out with Dauid, <hi>Lord create a cleane heart within me.</hi> This impuritie is absolutely, and without any restraint ascribed to vnbeleeuers and vnconuerted men. And in this branch also the Apostle bendeth himselfe against the error of the Iewish teachers: who were verie strict and curious least they should be outwardly by this or that meate, day, garment, or otherwise be defiled: for he would haue them conceiue that he spake of no such thing: neither were these the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects wherein their impuritie did so much consist: but in such a thing as stucke nearer them then any outward thing, yea, then their verie skinnes, euen in vnbeleefe, and consequently in such a power of sinne in their hearts as made all things, though in their nature and institution neuer so good, yet vnto them, and in their vse, no otherwise vncleane, then a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie vessell corrupteth the sweetest wines that can be powred into it. And therefore would he haue these ceremonie-masters to turne their eyes into themselues, and looke into their inside, and then they shall see themselues bootelesly to employ al their paines in keeping themselues from outward pollution, so long as they carrie that within them, which defileth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing they meddle withall.

From this argument the Apostle prooueth the same thing, Hebr. 4.12. the word of God <hi>is liuely, and mightie in operation,</hi> and deuideth, and cutteth a sunder <hi>the soule and spirit:</hi> that is, it work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not only vpon the inferiour faculties which are lesse pure, but vpon the purest and most supreame part of the soule called the spirit, and the minde; and by Paul, <hi>the spirit of the minde:</hi> for nothing is so secret in the soule, but it lyeth vnder the stroke of the word,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.23.</note> which pearceth as farre as the eye of the author of it, to whom all things are naked and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, vers. 13. No Anotomist can by cutting vp one part of the bodie after another, so manifestly discouer to the eye the seuerall parts of man, as doth the word and the spirit therein discouer and reprooue the most inward thoughts: such a light carrieth with it, as chaseth away the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the soule,<note place="margin">1.

bringeth him to the sight of his sinne, and to breake out into the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement and confession of the truth, saying, <hi>God is there indeed.</hi> Now nothing but the word can tell a man his thoughts, nothing else can pronounce sentence according to that which is in the heart: and therefore cannot but come out from God, whose only priuiledge it is, to search the hearts which he hath made.</p>

This alone is that two edged sword in the mouth of Christ,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.16.</note> whereby he gets the victorie: as Dauid said of Goliahs, so more truely may we say of this, <hi>there is no sword to this:</hi> Philosophy, Poetrie, and profane things are too blunt to peirce the spirit, too weake to conuert soules; too dull to giue sinne and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption deadly blowes, or deaths wounds.

The minde which as a

Is the mind and conscience, and all things impure to the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and hath his will any more priuiledge then the other? how er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious then is that doctrine of the Church of Rome, and the schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who teach that mans free will to good is not altogether lost, but much weakened in spirituall motions; that it can dispose and prepare it selfe to grace; and that it coworketh with the grace of God in the verie first beginnings of grace? Whereas the Scripture teacheth, that man is so farre from his owne helpe in his recouerie, that he resisteth it, and figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth against it till the Lord mightily subdue him, as he did Paul on his way to Damascus. The first degree or preparation to the cure, is the knowledge of the disease, but the naturall man will not be brought to acknowledge and confesse his estate: Psal. 14.3. there is <hi>no man that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth his way:</hi> our Apostle hath elsewhere also ruled this case, 2.

               <p>The Apostle proceeding in the proofe of that which he had said, that nothing was cleane to the vnbeleeuer, whose cheife faculties were pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, bringeth in this proofe by way of answer to a secret obiection; for some might say, But see you not that many whom you thus condemne, are men professing religion, both teachers and others; such as speake well of God, of Christ, and discourse exceeding well concerning out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward righteousnes, and sanctimonie of life, and therefore they seeme not to be so iustly, or at least too rigorously taxed. Notwithstanding all which, the Apostle concludeth against them, that they were no better then he had said. For let it be granted, that both the vrgers, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of such laws and traditions giuen by men, should still pretend pietie and seruice of God; and should cloke all their ceremonies, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions vnder pretence of deuotion; yet herein Paul espieth only the fruit of their corruption, and that is gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite by.</note>The second point are the characters of an hypocrite. The first of the fowre is in these words, <hi>They professe they knowe God.</hi> The hypocrite is a great professor of religion, and hence commeth to be answerable to his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> name, in seeming to be, and sustaining the person that he is not: as a clowne or knaue on a stage plaieth the part of a noble,<note place="margin">A forme of godlines.</note> or king, but is well knowne to be the next remooue from a rogue: so these fellowes whom the Apostle noteth, haue often in their mouthes the name of God and of Christ; the title of the Chuch, and pretend great knowledge of God, and cunning in the Scriptures, and other Ecclesiasticall writings; yea further, make a great shewe of faith and pietie, and if bare profession would lead to heauen, these could not be the least or last there. And to make this a little more plaine, an hypocrite can carrie himselfe so leuell, and euen in his course, as no man shall be able outwardly to accuse him, or impute any thing vnto him, no more then the disciples could accuse Iudas, when euerie man said, Master, is it I? but none of them said, master is it Iudas? Obserue him in his religion, you shall heare him crying vnto God,<note place="margin">Hos. 8.2.</note> and saying, <hi>my God, I knowe thee,</hi> challenging God for his God, and thrusting himselfe vnder him as one of his people and holy ones: many shall crie Lord, Lord, saith Christ, and shall professe the knowledge of him, to whom he shall professe that he <hi>neuer knewe them</hi> for his. You shall see him outrunning all that is required at his hands, he will bring many oblations not of sheepe, and small beasts, but many oxen, and not in one place as God requireth, but in many, yea in so many as the altars shall exceede the number of the cities: you shall see him cleaue to the Church, heare, pray, nay heare gladly as Herod, pray boldly as the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.20.</note> and receiue often the <hi>seede with ioy,</hi> and yet be bad ground. Looke to his outward carriage, he will not faile in the practise of iust dealing; he will abstaine from most sinnes, as other men; he will cling to good mens companie; be pragmaticall and busie in performing many sightly duties; he will be readie to plucke out his eyes for good Ministers (as the Galatians for Paul) and yet afterward fall quite from his doctrine. You would verily thinke him to be a sheepe of Christ, and so himselfe may happily take himselfe to be the child of God, and in all this ledde by the motions of the good spirit of God; whereas not a fewe vncleane spirits breath in him. <hi>Ob.</hi> Alas will some here say, what am I better then such a man as you speake of? what am I other then an hypocrite if this man
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:18792:168"/>
may be one? I see my selfe come behind such as these, and so haue lost a great deale of paines, of hopes. <hi>Ans.</hi> As Christ said to the young man vaunting of keeping all the lawes of God from his youth, <hi>one thing is yet wanting,</hi> so it is to this man, which if thou hast, thou as farre excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest him as light doth darkenes, though thou wantest a great deale of his appearance: What this is, the next note sheweth.</p>
               <p>The second note is in these words, <hi>But indeede they denie him:</hi> that is, all the religion of an hypocrite is onely an outward profession separated <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from the inward sinceritie of the heart.<note place="margin">A denying of the power of it.</note> All that we haue spoken of him is but a liueles forme of godlinesse, in which the <hi>power of it is denied,</hi> 2. Tim. 3.5. Men may be said to denie a thing three wayes: 1. with the tongue. 2. with the heart; thus the Atheist denieth God,<note place="margin">Non solum in falsis verbis, sed in simulatis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium est. Item. Christianum se dicere &amp; opera Christi non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mendaciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est. Ambr. serm. à dominica de Abrah.</note> Psal. 24.1. 3. with the life or actions, which is here properlie meant. For aske the tongues and words of these men concerning their courses, all wil appeare to be fish whole, but aske their liues, and you shall heare their workes (which are farre more euident witnesses with or against a man, then his words) speake otherwise. Or grant they doe many glorious workes to the eie, yet euen herein after a sort God is denied, in that they are lame, and indeede carkases of good actions, without any soule to quicken the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; all is externall, and in such workes they may be verie busie, but spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they performe nothing. Thus Christ chargeth the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies with hypocrisie, in that they outwardly appeared righteous, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly were like the graues full of putrifaction and rottennes. And if narrowly we examine the most glorious appearances of this kind of men, we shall out of the Sriptures more euidently see the light of this truth, which teach vs that there is a generation that draw neere God with their lippes, but their hearts are farre remooued from him,<note place="margin">Ier. 12.</note> so as though he be neere their mouthes, he is farre from their raines: they can come with <hi>sheepe and oxen</hi> to seeke the Lord, Hos. 5.6. but not with faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in their hearts, and therefore <hi>shall they finde him?</hi> If God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in outward sacrifices, they would giue him many a one, but that sacrifice of an humble and contrite spirit, which is his delight they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from him. Hence is all their righteousnesse compared to a <hi>morning dewe,</hi> which maketh shewe as if it would water and moisten the heart of the earth, but it onely standeth a little vpon the face or crust of it, and the sunne rising, it presently vanisheth away. If they cleaue to the Church for a while, they do not with full purpose of heart cleaue vnto the Lord. If they abstaine from euill, it is more in regard of man then of God, or their care is but to cut off the wash boughs of sin, but they leaue the bole &amp; stumpe standing, to stoppe the courses of more shamefull and grosse sinnes, but not to damme vp the fountaine. If they doe any good, they
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:18792:169"/>
are drawne to it not for the loue of God directly, but for some wordly respect; and the ende is rather feare, fauour, praise of men, then the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of God, as Ananias. If they humble themselues before God, it is for <hi>corne and oyle.</hi> If they howle vpon the beds of their sorrowes, it is for their sickenes, and not for their sinne, affecting deliuerance but not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. If they worship, yet wish they there were no God to worshippe, as Herod pretended to worship Christ, but intended to kill him. If they thrust themselues into the companie of good men, it is not to better themselues, but to credit their actions: they can desire them to pray for them, as Pharaoh, Simon Magus, but cannot pray for themselues. If they professe religion, it is not for religions sake, but some other thing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying it;<note place="margin">Hose. 10.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Ephraim is as an heifer that delighteth to thresh,</hi> because trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the corne, the oxe must not be musled, but eate at his pleasure, but could not away <hi>with plowing,</hi> the yoke was too heauie, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie too light: so some outward commoditie prouoketh the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite to professe religion, but he cannot abide to plowe vp his heart. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das will carrie Christs bagge till he can gaine more by him. Thus turne the hypocrite any way, he will be found swan-like, which of all foules hath the whitest feathers, but the blackest flesh vnder them; except wee shall fitlier compare them (with Christ) to the foxe, who hath this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, that his skinne is better then his flesh: a shewe he hath of godlines, but wanteth the power; he hath a name that he liueth, but is indeede dead: seeing the whole life of religion consisteth in inward renouation of heart and sanctimonie of life, both which is wanting vnto him whose sinne lyeth vnder a cloake, and liueth in his soule as in a closet, from which the hypocrite will not be parted.</p>

The word giueth vs to discouer two vices in these titular Christians: 1. infidelitie, 2. rebellion, or in one word, the want of the obedience of faith. True it is they make a great shew of <hi>faith,</hi> but the Apostle distinguisheth of faith;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.5.</note> one kind is <hi>fained,</hi> another is <hi>vnfained:</hi> the former may be ioyned with much knowledge, much talke of pietie, but neuer with a pure heart and good conscience, as the latter.

Thess. 3.2. Heb. 3.12. And although hypocrites, which taking on them the names of Christians, make a great shew of holinesse in externall seruice, in some ceremonies or wilworship, that a man would meruaile that the Scripture
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:18792:169"/>
should ascribe rebellion vnto them; yet looking nearer vnto their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, it will appeare no better. For in all that obedience of theirs, which they make such account of, they depart from the word, if not in whole, yet in some part, yea in such a part as maketh it rebellion (which cannot properly be said of the imperfect obedience of Gods children, whose best actions cannot abide the triall of the law) for besides that the best of their obedience is wanting in that which the word requireth, not beeing fruits of faith, whereby only they become acceptable; euen in doing that which God commandeth, they become rebellious, and that either by adding something of their owne; as Iehu whose fact (though commanded, and much commended yet) was such a rebellion as caused the Lord not many yeares after to <hi>visit all the blood of Iizreel vpon his house,</hi> yea made the <hi>whole kingdome of Israel to cease.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hose. 1.4.</note> Or else by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting something from the word, to which yet they seeme to giue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute obedience: as Saul, who although he obeyed the word, and made his boast of doing the commandement, yet because he did not all the word, is charged of rebellion, 1. Sam. 15.13. This consideration meeteth with the excuses of such whited toomes, who scorne to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led rebells, because they heare the word, and yeeld something vnto it: they belong to God, and will serue him so neere as he giueth them leaue, but yet some lusts may not be left, some sweet morsell shall be held vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tongue, and they cannot endure such a continuall martyrdome as mortification is: But those (we see) are not onely rebellious who stand out, and openly belch out blasphemies against God and his word; such as say, we will not haue this man to rule ouer vs: come let vs cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his cords from vs, the word of the Lord spoken by thee Ieremie we will not doe: but those also who secretly in their course depart from the word, with pretence of obedience, such as take the word into their mouthes, <hi>but hate to be reformed.</hi>

If these be the notes, and this the estate of an hypocrite,<note place="margin">Thou canst hardly know an other to be an hypocrite.</note> then must it needs be very hard to know who is an hypocrite, because it is a lurking sinne, and so masked as there is litle, yea often no outward difference betweene the sound, and vnsound; and consequently it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be verie dangerous, to lay this imputation vpon any man till the time, least we iudge our brethren rashly, and condemne the iust, which is as odious a sinne as the iustifying of the wicked. And this is rather to be noted, because it is become so rise a practise to range euery professor vnder this title, and marke him with this blacke cole of hypocrisie. But as it is true that an hypocrite must be a professor, so is it false that euery professor must be an hypocrite. And as for all other notes here obserued or elsewhere in Scripture, they are such as whereby the owne heart of a man, and his owne spirit within himselfe may iudge of himselfe, rather then the heart or eye of another man. Many are so like vnto the deuill, that they make no bones of accusing the godly (as Satan did Iob) of hypocrisie, beeing led by that same spirit which is an accuser of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but not by the spirit of God, which is the spirit of loue, which thinketh no euill, but hopeth all things, euen the best of the worst: <hi>which is not iudging,</hi> neither dare it enter into the counsell of God, nor
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:18792:171"/>
iudge the person <hi>of another mans seruant,</hi> who standeth or falleth to his owne Lord: which is so farre from carping at, or misconstruing things well done in appearance, as that maketh the best, and giueth most fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable construction of things and actions, which are in appearance euill; as well knowing that the searching of the heart belongeth to the maker of it; and that no man can know with what intention, vpon what grounds or causes this or that is done by another. And much lesse yet doth that spirit of Christ, which vseth not to <hi>quench smoaking flaxe,</hi> but cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euen good shewes, as in the young man, discourage better procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, by deeming those who exercise themselues most diligently in the courses prescribed by the word, the most worthy to be abhorred of God and man. And yet where can a man goe, but he shall meete with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that beareth rule in the word, which conceiueth not, speaketh not so bitterly against whooremongers, theeues, drunkards, &amp;c. as against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sound hearted professors of Christ, and of his truth? thus with the wicked Iewes, preferring Barrabas before Christ himselfe. Oh that men knew what they did, and then would they not thus crucifie the Lord of glorie in his seruants, who will fearefully reuenge such indignitie done against them. When Dauid sent his seruants to Hanun to visit him, and he euill entreated them, vsing them as spies, and not as visitors sent from a freind, how hotly doth Dauid prosecute the reuenge of their wrongs? he destroied seauen hundred charrets, and slew fortie thousand horsemen beside the forte,<note place="margin">2. king. 10.</note> insomuch as he forced other Kings to make peace with him: how much more will the Lord, more powerfull, more tender ouer his seruants, reuenge their abuse, both in a better seruice employed, and in higher degree disgraced?</p>

To follow then the resemblance a litle: 1. Doe we not see base fellowes plaie, and act the Kings part, and take on them as though they were so indeed, for an howre or two, and yet are glad to hang them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> vpon the sleeue of some noble or meaner man for protection? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so a number of Christians by profession in the sight of all men, as vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a stage seeme to be Kings ouer their lusts, and commanders ouer their sinnefull affections; whereas indeed they are but vessells and seruants to some one sinne or other. Secondly, as on the stage, beggarly and meane fellowes beare themselues as nobles or rich states; or act Midas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or Craesus part, whereas they are scarce able to paie for the roome they plaie in, till they haue gathered it: euen so many professors seeme to be rich in graces, encreased with goods, and stand need of nothing; and yet indeed like the Angel of the Church of Laodicia are wretched, mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, poore, blind, and naked. Thirdly, as on the stage, cowardly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes take vp armes, as though they were captaines of great valour; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> seeme to fight one with another, and yet doe but dally; euen so many professors seeme to be captaines, and fight with much rusling against sin and vngodly courses; yet indeed they are but in iest, sinne need not feare to receiue a deaths wound from them; it is safe inough in the house of a friend. Fourthly, as on the stage, very varlots and shifters plaie the parts, and sustaine for the time the persons and names of honest men; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> so many professors seeme to be honest, yea religious men, but are indeed voluptuous, giuen vp to the vncleane lusts of their hearts, haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of tauarnes or whorehouses, and though they ioyne in publike to good exercises, yet cold inough is their loue vnto them; oh how tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous is one howre spent in Gods seruice, in comparison of a whole day, yea and put the night to it, consumed in any one sinneful pastime or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? and though they seeme freindly to the freinds of religion, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them as Ioab did Amasa, saluting them as brethren to their face; yet their hearts are not with them, but are deuising with one floute or other behind their backs to dismisse them: and for the enemies of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion whom they would seeme to hate, they are most freindly vnto them, their hearts, their hands, their persons goe with them; if they call them to be agents or abetters in any vngodly practises, as wicked Ahab did good Iehoshaphat, their answer is readie, <hi>I am as thou art,</hi>

                  <hi>my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses:</hi> I and mine are yours to command in any such seruices of sinne. But to leaue the resemblance and come to a more speciall application of this examination. 1. There is neuer a one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:18792:172"/>
who professeth not that the <hi>eyes of God are pure,</hi> beholding all things, trying the hearts and raines: we all professe that his waies are iust, that he cannot abide to behold iniquitie, neither can doe otherwise then punish sinne wheresoeuer he findeth it: and yet in our practise we renounce all this profession, for we can sinne in the darke, as if the darknes, and the day were not both alike vnto him: if we can auoid mans eye we are cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Nay we liue profanely in his sight, and against his iustice we flatter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> our selues with promises of peace. 2. We professe that God is <hi>our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and therein acknowledge not onely his general prouidence ouer all things, disposing, nourishing, and preseruing all liuing creatures; but his particular prouidence towards our selues: But yet indeed we denie him so to be; for euery man spendeth out himselfe in shifting and shuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling for himselfe, as if he had no father in heauen to care for him, which is the practise of a meere worldling. Others depend not on him for their maintenance, but leane on the broken reed of their owne labour, wit, cunning, diligence: many moe vpon vnlawfull, and indirect means of gaine, by extortion, vsurie, deceite, false waights, and measures. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers when the least iniurie is offered them, murmur for the present, and laie vp for time to come reuenge, and mallice, as though there were no God to order their matters, or to commit vengeance vnto. Thus God is professed a father, <hi>but where is his honour</hi>? Others will haue God their Father, but cannot abide his children: others professe they feare him as a Father, but come to their deeds, they feare man much more then God: for let a man threaten, especially hauing power, they quake and crouch; but let God threaten, they bristle as if they would bid him battell.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. We professe that <hi>God is faithfull,</hi> true of his word, and his word the truth it selfe; and yet hardly are we brought to beleeue God on his word, or further then we see him: his promises stay not our hearts, but when we haue him in our hands: his threatnings terrifie vs not, but when we haue them in our eyes: the Pastor may pipe, but people follow no dance: let such call backe what they haue said, as hauing said too much, except they would beleeue more.</p>

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:18792:172"/>
For 1. who doth not professe of himselfe, that he loueth God with all his heart, and it were pitie else that he should liue? and yet indeed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> most desire no communion, nor fellowship with him in his word and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, nor in their owne prayers: thinke not of him; speake not of him but in others: the most measure their loue by their priuate gaine, so long they loue him as they gaine by him, like the Scribe that would follow Christ euery where till he heard that Christ had not where to hide his head, then we heare no more of him, Matth. 8. 2. We all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> euen by our comming to the word, as the people to Moses, <hi>speake thou to vs from God, and we will doe whatsoeuer the Lord commandeth vs by thee:</hi> and so professe subiection to Christ as to our Lord: but with the Scribes, many of <hi>vs say and doe not:</hi> or like the younger brother who said to his father, <hi>he would goe worke in the</hi> vineyard, <hi>but did not.</hi> And many of vs may fitly heare that sharp rebuke of Christ, <hi>Why call yee me Master,</hi> why professe you your selues Christians, <hi>and doe not the things that I speake</hi>? doe any seruants so deale with their master, and not be turned out of doores? 3. Who professeth not that he serueth God, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> (he hopeth) acceptable inough? he commeth to Church, he heareth what is said, he receiueth the Sacraments, and prayeth with the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. But follow this man home, doth he and his house serue the Lord? doth he read, instruct, pray there? hath he a little Church in his house? oh no, he hopeth God will beare with him, he is not booklearned, or he hath a calling, he can find no time, nor ability for such matters: now haue we found the man we sought for, no practise of pietie at home, none abroad: no substance of religion at home, it is but a shadow abroad. 4. Lastly we all wil boldly say with Peter, we will neuer denie Christ, no we <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> will die with him rather: and yet we will part from nothing for him; we will not leaue our lusts for him, much lesse our liues: and as we will doe nothing for him, so we will suffer as little, scarse a word of reproach for his sake, much lesse a blow, &amp; least of all the stroke of death; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seeing we cannot denie our selues for him, we cannot but denie him, whatsoeuer we boldly vtter to the contrarie.</p>
               <p>Thus might we examine euerie particular through the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in euerie branch of them discouer in our selues such manifest fruits of hypocrisie as these be: in which regard, let vs challenge our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull hearts, and sift them well, and we cannot but finde seaven abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations in them, euery one making vs more odious to God then other. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But I hope I am no such man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I cannot by these notes discerne my selfe to be an hypocrite. <hi>Answ.</hi> Yet maist thou be one, and receiue thy portion with them. For there be two sorts of hypocrites. 1. such as knowe themselues so to be, they knowe they dissemble in the things they
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:18792:173"/>
speake and doe, such were the Pharisies who did all things <hi>to be seene of men,</hi> these haue a cloud of witnesses against them: for besides God, their owne words shall be their iudges,<note place="margin">Two sorts of hypocrites.</note> their workes shall accuse them, and their hearts and consciences shall be as a thousand witnesses against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. others knowe not themselues to be hypocrites, but thinke themselues sound enough, as that Pharisie, Luk. 18. who thanked God, that he was not as other men: and Simon Magus, Act. 8. who beleeued Phillips words, was baptized, wondred at the things done by the Apostles, and yet had no part nor portion in them, because his heart was not right with God, and yet he thought that he had. And so is it with many, who think that because their consciences sleepe, or are brawned with some raigning sinne, that they are sound, when they shall one day finde the Lord grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their consciences, with whom such righteousnes as exceedeth not the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisies will not goe for pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It behooueth vs then to take vp the Apostles counsell, <hi>Take heed brethren least there be at any time in any of you an euill heart of vnbeleefe, causing you to depart</hi> (while yee seeme to approach vnto him) <hi>from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God:</hi> and on the contrarie, to labour to expresse the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse daily, that in the last of our daies we may reape the sweete fruite of it, when we shall be glad that we haue had no part with hypocrites.

There is also as great difference in their sufferings: the former, if they should worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffer as euill doers, they shall not want mediators, and moderators: the latter, in suffering for well doing, are in their iust defence like Paul, who in his answering <hi>had no man to assist him, but all forsooke him.</hi> Here now is a triall,<note place="margin">2.

Cor. 2.2. Secondly, that is wholesome doctrine in regard of the worke or effect, which maketh the soules of men sound and thriuing: for it is a borrowed speach from the food, or physicke of the bodie to the soule, which is the word of God here called againe <hi>doctrine:</hi> and elsewhere the <hi>food</hi> and <hi>bread</hi> of life; and Ministers <hi>Pastors</hi> and <hi>feeders.</hi> Now this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine worketh mens soules to soundnesse two wayes. 1. by drawing vs out of our spirituall diseases, not onely inward, as of ignorance, error, hypocrisie, &amp;c. but outward also, as those maine sinnes reckoned vp, 1.

this end of his calling? <hi>Answ.</hi> Hereunto two things are required: 1. abilitie,<note place="margin">What things are requisite to an able Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</note> 2. affection: both which prouoke diligence, and faithfull abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, 1. of learning, 2. of iudgement. For the former: he must be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to feed with wholesome doctrine. We will not put forth our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to nurses whose brests want milke, vnlesse we would starue them; so the Lord neuer committeth his children to drie nurses, though often in iudgement he leaue, and permit them vnto spirituall famine. Seeing therefore the Preists lips should preserue knowledge, and the Pastors breasts should be like Iosephs granaries, stored with all prouision against the time of famine; let all idle, and idoll Ministers that thrust themselues in for Pastors, and can onely feed themselues, consider of their danger betimes, least too late repentance cause them to know what it is to starue the Lords people, and murther so many soules, the meanest of which the whole world cannot counteruaile. For the latter, he must be of able iudgement, and wisedome, to know the nature, and constitution of his people, the state of his flock; whether they be of weake or strong sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maks, and so whether they need milke or stronger meate. 2. He must be able like a skilfull cooke, to know how to season the food he deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; he is not presently fit to be a cooke, that can put on a white apron, or conforme in a ceremonie; but as he must be a man of skill in his qualitie, so must he be a man of a good tast, and haue experience of that he prepareth for others, wisely deliuering points not onely profitable for the persons present, but things also proper to the present occasions, and be fitting occurrences. 3. He must not onely know when his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision is well seasoned, but also when it is seasonable: like a good ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who altereth the dyet of the house, according as the seuerall sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons seuerally furnish the market: for as euery one must haue his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so must he haue it in due season: a word in time to him that is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, is a fruit of a learned tongue, and to feed the impenitent with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is wisedome, seeing an humble soule is broken with threatning, &amp; a secure heart is h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note place="margin">Three things must be deare to a Minister: 1.

Which must looke three wayes at once; 1. to God, 2. to man. 3. to the truth. The glorie of God must be prized aboue all things, which will make him speake onely for God, and he that speaketh onely for God, cannot but be wholesomely conuersant in his word, Ioh. 7.18. For loue of Gods glorie effecteth two things, both concurring to wholesome doctrine. 1. conceiuement of humane wisedome: 2. demonstration of the spirit, 1. Cor. 2.4. that is, a secret power and authoritie of the spirit, going with his word, enlightning with his owne other mens vnderstandings, and heating by
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:18792:175"/>
his owne other mens affections: this made a graue Diuine of ours say, that euery true Minister hath after a sort a fierie tongue giuen him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this affection of loue, must be extended to his people: Paul loued his countrimen, and this stirred vp his heartie desire, <hi>that Israel might be saued.</hi> The mother seeing her child in danger,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.1.</note> is carefull out of her loue to prouide any cordiall or restoratiue that may be gotten to doe it good; the prosperitie of the child, is the ioy of the mother; so the profit of the people is the Pastors <hi>crowne of reioysing,</hi> 2. Cor. 3.1. Thirdly, vnto the <hi>truth it selfe:</hi> he must affect to <hi>know nothing,</hi> and this will cause him to affect to deliuer nothing <hi>but Christ, and him crucified:</hi> this sincere milke of the word, maketh Gods children to thriue and prosper, whereas the vnwholesome milke mingled with error, or puddle water of mens deuises, bringeth sickenesse, diseases, and consumption into their soules.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Let all Ministers, who haue a care of profiting their people, and so furthering their owne account, acquaint them with this whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some doctrine, fetched out of the pure fountaines of the Scriptures, and rightly deuide it vnto them, as workemen that need not be ashamed. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what vanitie is it, out of opinion of wit or reading, to seeke out strange speculations among the starres, to search out genealogies, pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to dote about fables, to set himselfe to tie hard knots onely to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie them againe (as the dogge leaueth soft meat to gnaw vpon bones) to mingle the word with the leauen of traditions? what a dangerous thing is it, to heale the hurt of Gods people with sweete words, or to handle the word either deceitfully, or deliuer it phantastically, with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seemely and rude, or affected words of humane wisedome &amp; eloquence? all this may puffe vp the soules of men for a time, as though they were wholesomely fed, but indeed Paul sheweth the proper worke of them, that they breed diseases, and ingender strife, rather then godly edifying: and when the fire commeth that shall trie euery mans worke, his worke shall burne, let him scape if he can, who though he teach no false do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, yet if he build haie and chaff vpon the foundation; for he hath not stood in Gods counsell: read the curse denounced against false Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. Ier. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hearers are hence taught sundrie duties.

some sentence of Scripture (which yet they least care for) but it must be turkist, and mishapen out of his natiue simplicitie, like cattell forsaking the greene pastures to broose vpon leaues and boughes. These nice hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are like the daintie gentelwomen of our times, who scorning stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dishes on their tables, which are the wholesome, fit, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nourishment, set them at the low end of the table; and themselues onely glorying in their art and cookerie, feed vpon forced dishes, and cookt conceits, though the ground in comparison be not better then a bootshanke, as we vse to say; and the sauce trebling the cost of the meat it selfe. How good a sauce were hunger now to such persons, and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maks, who in their fulnesse despise an honie combe? This Athenian hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, is the cause of Athenian preaching, and the diseases running vpon such hearers sheweth the curse of God on them, who with contempt of the Mannah from heauen, wish the onyons, garlicke, and flesh of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt: these things they haue vpon their desire, and with them more then they desire, for they rot euen between their teeth.</p>

Hence is it that we heare so many complaints: oh, saith one, he seeketh not the good will of his hearers, nor casteth to please them: he is of a tarte and bitter spirit; he seeketh to wound and gall, but he healeth nor suppleth not. But what preacheth he, whether any errors, or the pure doctrine of God? No, say they, we cannot except against his doctrine: True: for they neuer trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themselues, so farre as to examine it by the word, or themselues by it. But then say I, is it the word of God thou hearest, and the truth by thy owne confession? why dost thou then not tremble at that word? see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euery word of God is good, pure, wholsome, though it cannot be denied but that some part of it is more seasonable at one time then at another. Others alleadge, oh he is no scholler in comparison, but a plaine man, and a nouice to such and such. But can none but the greatest clarkes deliuer wholesome doctrine, or was plaine preaching for Saint Paul alone,<note place="margin">Neuer examine a ministerie by the pompe but by the power.</note> and such as he? surely the world is greatly altered since his time, it cannot skill of his preaching: who beeing the greatest scholler
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:18792:176"/>
of all the Apostles, was the most fearefull to make the least shew of it. Well, he is truely learned that hath learned Christ; and can teach him to another: although the voice be still and humble, yet may the Lord passe by in it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as he is not in all the boistrous sermons of proud men.</p>
               <p>Others can receiue no doctrine from such a one as hath expressed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie in some weaknes, or want; or is not altogether to their owne liking, nor of their owne size. Some cannot abide to heare the so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Puritane: others are as farre wide on the other hand, they can get no good, nor will stirre out of their doores to heare him that can buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle himselfe to the times: thus some hold to Paul, some to Apollos, some to Cephas, but none to Christ. Here is examination of the persons of men, but not of the doctrine of God, which by both may be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely, and truely taught: or if either of them should erre, haue we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from hearing them? are we not rather to trie the spirits, and try all things, that we may hold our selues to that which is good? We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our selues, while we looke to be taught by Angels or Saints; Gods ordinance is, that we should be taught by men, subiect to the same infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities with vs; weake men, and sinnefull men must vnder God raise vs to strength of grace; that our faith may not be ascribed to men or meanes, but that the mightie power of God might appeare in mans in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie. But in one word, to remooue all the pretended causes of not receiuing the wholsome word; turne thine eye inward, and thou shalt see the fault in thy selfe: for as if a man abstaine meale after meale from meate, and he doth not, nor cannot be perswaded to eate wholesome meate, it is plaine hee is a sicke man, his stomake is gone, if hee hold on he is hastening to death; so it is with him who refuseth the wholesome foode of his soule, some sore deadly disease hath seased vpon him. If this food seeme tart or bitter, it is not corrupted, but thy tast: thy spirituall ague causeth thee to deeme honie bitter. If thou loathest that meate which thou hast sometime liked, the meate is the same, but thou art not the same; if thou art wearie of the doctrine of mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which sometimes thou affectedst, suspect thy selfe: the case is with thee as with some children, who for noueltie were willing to go to schoole, but beeing held hard, some growe wearie of their Master, and would exchange him with another; but no cooke could make this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine rellish thy tast, till it with thy selfe be altered.</p>

Many complaine that they heare many good things, but yet they stay not with them, but are soone forgotten; &amp; hence may begin to conceiue that the meate was faultie, either not inough, but rawe, or too cold, or otherwise; but let them knowe assuredly that the fault was in their owne cold stomacks, which wanted zeale and loue to the truth to warme them; for we easily forget not the things we loue: or else some sinne like the predominance of a bad humor hath ouercharged them, which must be purged by renewing repentance; which beeing done, wisedome requireth that men doe for their soules, as they doe for their bodies; in which if the meate stay not till it be digested, or because al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be digested it staieth not neither; howsoeuer a man returneh to his meate againe: euen so repaire thou vnto thy ordinarie meales againe, heare preparedly, and thou shalt at least renewe thy strength againe: and if thou findest thy stomacke weake still, looke as men of weake stomacks before meat prepare them with some warme thing, and after close them vp againe with some preserue or other: so must thou with prayer and reading prepare and warme thy affection before, and close vp thy sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke with prayer and meditation after: by the former, the spirit is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, which bringeth things to the remembrance: by the latter, things are held as a mans owne, being as strong vinegar to the nose, to hold that in which otherwise would be presently cast vp againe.</p>

It is true that all vertues in generall are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as all vices in generall are forbidden to all persons, of what sexe or estate soeuer: yet there be some speciall vertues, which are more shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ornaments in some age and condition then others: as in young men staidnesse and discretion, are speciall beauties; but are not (if wanting) such blemishes in their yeares, as in olde men, because of their obseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and experience.

Examples of this practise we meete with all euerie where in the Epistles. Paul in diuerse of his Epistles, as to the Colossians, but especially to the Ephesians, describeth in particular the duties of wiues, husbands, children, fathers, seruants, masters: see chap. 5.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ioh. 2.12. where he giueth his reasons, why he writeth to fathers, to babes, to old men, and to yong men. Besides these examples, are sundrie waightie reasons to enforce the doctrine: As first, the faithfulnesse of a wise steward herein appeareth, namely, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributing to euerie one of his Masters family, their <hi>owne portion</hi> of meat in due season, Luk. 12.42. Secondly, to this purpose is the word fitted, to make euerie man readie and absolute to euerie good worke, and thus the wisedome of God is made to shine to all eyes, who can behold such a perfect rule of direction in faith and manners. Thirdly, well knewe our Apostle with other the men of God, that generall doctrines (though neuer so wholesome) little preuaile, are but cold, and touch not men to the quicke, without particular application to their seuerall necessities: till Peter come to say; <hi>you haue crucified</hi> the Lord of glorie, we read of no pricking of their hearts.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This dutie requireth also a man of vnderstanding, an Ezra, a prompt scribe, a learned tongue; not any bare reader, no nor euery preacher attaineth to this high point of wisedome; not bosome sermons, nor euery learned discourse reacheth vnto it. If he must be a learned Physitian, that must first finde out the disease, and then apply a fit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to the same: he must be much more learned then he, and one acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with more rare secrets of simples that growe from heauen, who can here minister to euerie soule according to the estate of it, which is farre more hidde then that of the bodie; as to the wearie soule a seasonable word; and to the secure heart, the iust weight of terror and threatening. Besides, who seeth not that this verie dutie requireth no flatterers, no selfe-seekers, no time seruers? but men of courage, bold through God to apply his word to all conditions of men, high as well as lowe, rich as poore, not healing the hurt of great ones with sweete words, nor respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting persons no more then the Lord himselfe doth, whose word it is; but binding euen kings in chains, and nobles in fetters, as Nathan did Dauid, <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> For if the word hath plainely described euerie mans dutie, then the dispensers of it must faithfully deliuer out the same.</p>

deliuered in the ministerie, be they old or young, rich or poore, one or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, must yeeld obedience vnto it. For seeing the Scripture is furnished to teach all men all their duties, and the ministerie ordained by God to discouer the wisedome of God; olde men must not disdaine to sit downe at Christs feete; nor young men to learne how to redresse their waies; nor the rich to become rich in God, nor the poore to become poore in spirit, nor the master to acknowledge a master in heauen, nor the seruant to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the seruant of Christ. 2.

Whereas many thinke that those sinnes are least to be striuen against,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which are incident to the age or sexe: and that we lay intollerable yokes on youth, which must haue the swinge: and for olde men because their age carrieth them to teastinesse and frowardnes, therefore they may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be forborne; these may hence see their error: neither is this any other then to strengthen the hands of sinners, and a giuing of scope to natural corruption. If men indeede were so humbled as that they were readie to despaire, because they cannot ouercome such corruptions, then might we say, that no temptation hath befallen them but such as goeth ouer the common nature; but otherwise to plead for any libertie in excusing sinne, is an hardening of the heart, and a backe by as to repentance.</p>

Ioh. 2.13. For Gods schoole is as well for olde as for young, in which men are not onely to be initiated in the principles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but also to be lead forward vnto perfection of wisedome: and seeing no man can attaine in this life vnto perfection, therefore euerie

Thirdly, whereas old men are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with relations of idle antiquities, and things formerly passed as long as they can recall, the holy Ghost recalleth them from such vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spending their time: and sheweth them that Christ and his doctrine both of them beeing from the <hi>beginning,</hi>

By which meanes how might the younger be prouoked to take vp into their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and practise the loue of the truth and the feare of God? how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly might they helpe forward the ministerie in all sorts? whereas it is the greatest stoppe it findeth, and the greatest toyle we meete with to bring old men to leaue their old courses; who are like drawn vessels, in whom is nothing left, but lees and dregges of ignorance, loosenesse, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, in which with other old courses, they are determined euen to rot away. What a number of olde men be there, who are but children, not in yeares, but in vnderstanding, in knowledge, in experience of the things of God; in respect of which, we cannot say they are twise children, for in truth they were neuer other, they neuer came out of this their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and childishnes. The exhortation is more necessarie, then it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly taken for: when as we may meete with some old men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men towards 60. yeares, if not aboue, of whom one cannot tell that euer he heard of Christ: an other cannot tell whether Christ be in heauen or in earth: a third cannot be perswaded that he is a sinner: all which I speake of my owne experience and triall; and yet these liue in our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian commonwealth, and perhaps vnder preaching Ministers, in whome is farre lesse sence of God and religion, then in the verie heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. Oh, but these you wil say are outcast people, and the vilest of men, and they are but fewe. But what a great sinne and shame is it, that any should be so suffered to liue out of all ranke of Christianitie, in dayes of
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:18792:180"/>
such grace and knowledge? But there are an other sort to which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and millions cleaue, that are scarse one good steppe before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and these are such as make a shewe of knowledge, and often fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the meanes, and by often sitting in this sunne are a little outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coloured: but yet cannot giue a reason of the faith that is in them, to their owne or others comfort, no more then the former. Vrge them, they can tell you they meane well, and haue good hearts; but indeede they know not what they meane, and <hi>without knowledge,</hi> saith Salomon, <hi>the minde is not good:</hi> the which ignorance is so much the more damable, by how much it is wilfull and affected: Ioh. 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and spoken, they had had no sinne: but now haue they no cloake for their sinne.</hi>

                  <hi>Sober,</hi>] Now the things which the elder sort must learne, are not so much handled as named: and they are of two sorts, the former which beseeme them as they are old men: and these are three, the first of which is <hi>sobrietie,</hi> or watchfulnes, which properly respecteth things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, as meate, drinke, &amp;c. the two latter respect their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: the former of which is <hi>grauitie</hi> or honestie, which requireth seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines in the outward habit, speach, gesture, manners, and behauiour: the latter is <hi>wisedome,</hi> or discretion, which restraineth the more inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscences, lusts, and desires of the heart. The second sort of vertues are such as are commended vnto them, as they are ancient Christians, and these be three also; 1. soundnes in faith, whereby duties are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably performed towards God. 2. soundnes in loue, which looketh to all the duties of the second table. 3. soundnes in patience, which is as salt to season and preserue both, without which they could not but quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waxe weary of well doing. Thus ought old men to be qualified, not only as those who haue attained to ripenes in yeares, but as such who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so haue striuen to some ripenes in Christianitie, expressed in the practise of these three vertues.</p>
               <p>In the first precept of sobrietie, older persons are enioyned to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the immoderate vse of meate and drinke especially, and in the vse of these (wine and strong drinke especially) to moderate themselues within the confines, and precincts of sobrietie.

                  <hi>for honour is vnseemely for a foole,</hi> Prov. 26.1. 2. They are to instruct and admonish others of their dutie, and of their faylings; and thus ought to become <hi>eyes to the blinde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 25.15.21.</note> 
                  <hi>and feete to the lame:</hi> and the younger sort are to <hi>heare</hi> and <hi>waite,</hi> holding <hi>their tongue at their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell.</hi> Now let the aduise, admonition, or counsell be neuer so iust, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, experienced; yet it cannot chuse but loose all the authoritie, and credit of it, if the conuersation of a man be vaine, light, youthfull, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way vnseemely: so as they who faile from this precept, disable them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from performance of so necessarie a dutie. 3. Too common a thing it is in our corruption, to lessen in our hearts the due reckoning and estimation of the aged, who haue passed their prime, and (as we falsely say) their best daies; the prouerb is true, we adore the sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, but contemne it setting. Hence Salomon obserued, (as we also may behold) all the liuing with the second child: that is, the Prince ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, which was to raigne after his fathers decease; or in great fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, the heires and yong masters, who are duly obserued and flattered by all the seruants. Now if the older sort would prouide against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of that age, it must be by such a seemely grauitie, as may dash light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes euen with the presence: so did Iob, 29.8. <hi>The young men saw me, and hid themselues, the aged arose and stood vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which consideration, as it teacheth how to reteine the honour and crowne of age: so also when men faile of that due regard their yeares seeme to call for; that they are not (as most old men do) to laie all the blame vpon the insolencie of youth, as not trained to better man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: but to examine how their owne footesteps haue beene directed: and whether they haue not let fall the crown of their age, which is the grace and grauitie of it: and in a word, wherein and how farre, they
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:18792:181"/>
haue failed. The Heathen could say, that the way to Honours Temple, laie by Vertues house: and it is iust with the Lord, that with the vile should be reproach, so as the base often rise vp against the honourable, and children can scorne the aged, in whose words, behauiours, and actions, any vnseemely lightnesse hath bewrayed and discouered it selfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Discreete,</hi>] or moderate. The vertue was formerly required in the Minister, cap. 1.7. and after in women, cap. 2.4. and in young men,<note place="margin">Moderation of lusts and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is a most seemely grace in an old man.</note> vers. 6. which word, because it principally intendeth a moderation of all fleshly concupiscences, and desires; as also extendeth it selfe to all the parts of the life, requiring that all the affections, speaches, and actions, be caried leuell, not according to the strength of will, or passion; but according to the rule of prudence; both in forbearing that which is euill, and vnseemely; as also in chusing and practising that which is good and decent: therefore the older sort especially should become sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular patterns, &amp; examples of moderation; both in the subduing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguishing all rebellious motions, affections, pastimes, and perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as also in preseruing in them a wise and vigilant care, that their mindes may be kept in such temper, as becommeth sobrietie, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianitie: and these not of ordinarie men, but such as may bewtifie this age, which euen of it selfe is in part disposed hereunto: as that holy man obserued, <hi>among the ancient is wisedome, and in the length of daies,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Vnchast desires are foule spottes in euerie age, but in olde age most of all. How monstrous were it for olde men to watch the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, to haue eyes full of adulterie, to haue their mouthes filled with foule and rotten communication, to be drunke with wine vnto excesse? how exceeding odious were these things in them, aboue younger per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons? who if they should fall into such misdemeanours, some more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses might be pretended? for they might be forced by headstrength of passion, and perturbation, but these seeme rather to force themselues, and sinne of election, as such who willingly leaue not such sinnes as haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most left them; nay who rather strengthen their mindes to such lusts, as to which their bodies are broken and decaied: and thrust themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of such lewde Masters, from whome a man would haue thought, they should long before haue parted as free men. 2. Olde age is an age which ought to be dedicated to the minde, meditation, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; ought to be taken vp with more seemely delights and desires, euen such as are spirituall and heauenly; ought to watch against such lusts as presse downe, that the aged man may serue the Lord with more libertie and cherefulnes, and intend the straightning of all reckonings between
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:18792:182"/>
God and them, and so the finishing vp of their saluation with feare and trembling; for if euerie Christian ought to haue his conuersation in heauen, much more such as haue one foote in the graue, and hasten vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This precept iustly reprehendeth many of our elder sort, whose bones seeme still to possesse the sinnes of their youth; as if they were minded not to lay downe their lusts, but in the same graue where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues meane to lie; without all care of beautifying their gray haires with this grace of discreete moderation; but in all their words and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours remaine as vaine, light, foolish, without sauour of grace, as euer they were in their warmest blood; that euen as all the dregges are setled in the bottome of a vessell, so their courses are filled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>estinesse, hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and vnaduised frowardnes: their conuersation blotted with base couetousnesse, as if they were to liue ouer their yeares againe, their minds no lesse bending towards the earth then their bodies; and though they can scarse goe vp and down in the world, yet for most part are they more drowned in wordly affaires, then when they were in their most constant estate. In a word, blackeamoores were they young, and now their skins are not changed, the crimson tincture of their sinne cannot yet be wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor they in their age breake through the snares wherewith Satan held them in their youth; but the sinner of an hundreth yeare olde goeth on to punishment. And here let none thinke, that any dotage or passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affections may be excused by reason of the age, nay rather euery such breaking out is here doubled, for an olde man especially should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creete, and the discretion of a man moderateth all passions. Let <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zillai</hi> be an example to all olde men,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sound in faith,</hi>] Now followe those three vertues which are requisite in olde men, as they are auncient Christians. The first of which is <hi>sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of faith,</hi> in which three things are to be considered. 1. What sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of faith is. 2. Why it is commended in speciall to olde men, seeing euerie Christian must haue it. 3. The dutie which hence is to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>For the first: Soundnesse of faith standeth in two things. 1. when faith is sound in the qualitie,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.5. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> that is, sincere, not deceitfull, not hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. 2. when it is sound in the degree of it, not a shaking reede, but growne vp from the infancie vnto some strength and stature. Now vnto both these is required that faith be sound,<note place="margin">Soundnes of faith standeth in 4. things.</note> 1. in the ground of it. 2. in the obiect. 3. in the worke of it. 4. in the fruits issuing from it: in any of which if it faile it is vnsound, vnlasting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:18792:182"/>First, the <hi>ground</hi> of sound faith, is a sufficient measure of knowledge of the things of God reuealed in the word, in a sound and incorrupted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> iudgement: for so the Apostle affirmeth,<note place="margin">Ground.</note> Rom. 10.14. that for the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of faith, there must be the interpreting and deliuering of doctrine out of the word, and an attentiue hearing and vnderstanding of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by after a sort the sonne of man is lifted vp that we may beleeue, Ioh. 3.14. Now euerie degree of knowledge and measure of vnderstanding, is not a sufficient ground of sound faith; but such a measure as is able to discerne betweene things that differ: for how can children in knowledge be grown men in the faith? or how can any come to that ripe age of faith here meant, but such as through long custome, haue their senses exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to discerne both good and euill?<note place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> This must be then such a knowledge as enableth a man both to maintaine the truth, and convince the gainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and so hold his owne comfort by distinct, and particular, yea some depth of knowledge; without which so farre he shall be from soundnes, as that he shall be dangerously carried with euerie winde of doctrine. There is a <hi>fulnesse of knowledge,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 15.14.</note> which the Apostle commendeth in the Romanes, and this is a notable fit ground for this soundnesse of faith. Hence it followeth, that all that implicite faith of the laie Papists, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp in an idle fancie without knowledge, is vnsound and vngrounded: for can any but a Papist, beleeue he knowes not what?</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>obiect</hi> of a sound faith more generall, is the whole word of God, from which faith can no more be seuered,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> then the beames <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from the sunne: but more specially the porper obiect is the couenant of grace in Christ: yea Christ himselfe, together with all his merits; and all the promises of mercie freely propounded in the Gospel; which is therefore called <hi>the word of faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10.8.</note> Hence all Popish faith is here proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued againe vnsound, because it is corrupt in the obiect: leaning it selfe in stead of the word, vpon canons, councells, traditions, vnwritten de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees: as also expecting saluation without the free couenant of grace, by the merit of workes; whereas in iustification before God, all workes, all boasting, are excluded, Rom. 3.27. and 4.24.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>worke</hi> of a sound faith is twofold. 1. <hi>assent.</hi> 2. <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The former is a certeine and firme <hi>assent,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Worke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> whereby we set a seale vnto all the promises of the Gospel, as most sure and certaine; holding e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen an Angel accursed that should bring any other doctrine: and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>sure the profession of our hope without wauering in full assurance</hi> of vnderstanding. For faith is no opinion or fancie,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> but hath in it a certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie arising from the stedfastnes of the promise, and word of God. Hence are all such exhortations, as that, 1. Cor. 16.13. <hi>Stand fast in the faith.</hi> The latter worke of faith is <hi>application,</hi> whereby a man not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:18792:183"/>
assenteth that all the couenant of grace is true in it selfe, but also that it is true vnto him; who therefore resteth and leaneth vpon it for his owne saluation, beeing assured so vndoubtedly at one time or other of his saluation, as if he were alreadie gathered vp among the Saints. And this hand thus laying on Christ vnto righteousnes, and applying Christ with his merits vnto ones selfe in particular to saluation, is the forme of faith, or rather faith it selfe formed, and not any workes or charitie, as Papists fondly dreame. And that this certaintie is of the nature of sound faith appeareth, because that modest, but graceles vncertaintie and doubting of the Popish doctrine, is opposed vnto faith, and made a fruit of vnbeleefe, Matth. 14.31. <hi>Oh thou of little faith, why doubtedst thou?</hi> of Abraham is said, Rom. 4. that <hi>he doubted not,</hi> nor reasoned with himselfe, but was strengthned in faith, beeing <hi>fully assured.</hi> And what other reason is giuen, why the inheritance was not giuen by the law, which was impossible to be kept: but by the promises of grace, but that the promise <hi>might be sure to all the seede</hi>? Rom. 4.16. Or how could our peace with God continue our comfort, or last with vs, if we had no assurance of it, but still doubted of his loue?</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore alwaies take notice of this especiall worke of sound faith, which maketh the heart able to say with Iob, <hi>I know my Redeemer liueth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note> and with Paul, <hi>who died for me, and gaue himselfe for mee.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must the godly refuse to subscribe to the truth of this doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neuer finde such constant and full assurance, which is not moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with some doubting, and sometime exceedingly ouercast with grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings of vnbeleefe, for by this reason they might aswell conclude that they neuer had faith: and it is no meruaile if faith and doubting be in one man, seeing they rise from two diuerse, yea contrarie principles, which cannot but be found in the best, euen spirit and flesh. If thou lookest by the eye of flesh, thou canst not but doubt of the truth of the promises, at least to thy selfe, in whom so little good appeareth: but o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the eye of thy faith, which at length seeth clearely the saluation of God, chaseth away clouds of doubts and distrust, and giueth glorie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. As he therefore that would deeme the orbe of the sunne to be greater then the earth, must deny his sence and yeeld to reason: so must the beleeuer renounce both sence and reason, and liue by his faith.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>fruits</hi> of a sound faith are, 1. <hi>Inward:</hi> and these are all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the parts of renewed holines in the soule,<note place="margin">Fruits.</note> which cannot but accompany it: 2. Pet. 1.5.6. Ioyne with <hi>faith vertue, &amp;c.</hi> for it worketh a through change in the whole man, by <hi>purifying the heart,</hi> inspiring a new spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life, raysing from dead workes, and causing to grow vp in holines
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:18792:183"/>
and in the feare of God. It is as the heat in the bodie, the fountaine of life and heate, and as the roote of a tree, affording life, sappe, and quickning of grace to all the the parts of obedience, without which it is impossible to please God in any thing. 2. <hi>Outward:</hi> such as are the true loue of God and man. For as it maketh vs the sonnes of God, so it causeth vs to carie our selues as children, desirous to please our Father in all things, to performe vnto him all the parts of his worship publike, and priuate, to loue his word, to confesse his truth, though with the losse of our liues, to thinke of him, to speake of him, to delight in his presence and fellowship, and giue vp our selues wholly to obey him in his commandements and corrections. Againe, it maketh vs to loue Gods image in our brethren, and out of this loue issueth a desire and endeauour to helpe them heauenward, and care to performe all other offices of loue towards their outward man, their persons, their liues, their goods, their names, &amp;c. These are the blessed fruits of that faith which is vnfained, 1. Tim. 1.5. which <hi>worketh by loue,</hi> Gal. 5.6. And thus haue we shewed the first point, wherein the nature of sound faith standeth.</p>
               <p>The second point is,<note place="margin">Soundnes of faith especially required of old men. Why.</note> why soundnes of faith is required rather of old men, beeing a grace which euery one, young aswell as old, must striue vnto? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Because they haue had the vse of the word longer, and therefore their profit should be answerable to their meanes; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is this assurance and soundnes of faith attained at the first, but ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vpon a grounded knowledge, which for most part is not to be found in the younger sort. Secondly, old men, which ought to be auncients <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in profession, and so haue more experience of Gods waies and working, should shew forth the power of faith vnto others: and therein become as cleare patternes and presidents vnto them, and therefore whereas a lesser measure may be accepted in the younger; yet for these to yeeld to doubting, to wauer in the truth, to be corrupt in iudgement, to sticke in extremitie, or faint in affliction, is a greater sinne and more hatefull vnto God, who more seuerely correcteth it in old men, who should be leaders vnto others, yea although they be deare otherwise vnto him. Moses himselfe, if by doubting he shall dishonour God, shall be barred the good land for it. Thirdly, their age and experience in all meetings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> must haue the honour and place of speach, when the younger sort must either sit silent, or with Elihu speake in their turne when they haue done: of them the younger expect solution of doubts, and difficulties, counsell in cases of conscience, and wise aduise out of their experience. Now if they should be tainted with false opinions and dotages, or shake as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eeds in the doctrine of faith and truth, they cannot but become hurtfull, and vnprofitable vnto such, whose eyes are vpon them, when they see
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:18792:184" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them as inconstant in the faith, and as subiect to wauer and reele as the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, who in comparison are but newly planted. 4. Their bodies &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man waxeth weak, and beginneth to faile, and therefore they had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> more need labour for strength and soundnes in the inner man; which is a reason not to be neglected, as presently we shall see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> All these reasons are direct against such as plead, that their years comming on them, they cannot conceiue, nor learne, nor remember, nor profit in religion as they are vrged in the ministerie; their sences inward and outward serue them not, their vigour and quicknes is gone: but it is good for them to consider the hand of God vpon Zacharie, Luk. 1. 18. for making his age a meanes to weaken his faith, though in a farre more difficult case. Doth not our Apostle here vrge it as a cheife argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that because they are old, therefore they must the rather be furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with grace of knowledge, memorie, zeale, faith, loue, and patience? and shall it goe for a good plea, that because they are old, therefore they shall be excused, if they cannot attaine vnto these, nor greatly force af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them? what a shame was it for Nicodemus beeing an auncient and Ruler in Israel, to be ignorant in the point of regeneration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ reprooued him, Ioh. 3. And that was the sinne of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,<note place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note> when <hi>as for their time</hi> they ought to haue bin teachers, they were to seek in the principles of religion; and were babes needing milke; such is the sinne of babish old men, olde in yeares, children in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>

The wiseman wisheth timly to prepare against the inconueniences of old age, with the remembrance of God in the youth:<note place="margin">Eccles. 12.1.</note> how much more should olde men in the midst of their ruines and decaies, by this meanes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire and fortifie themselues?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. It is made a note of a true member of the Church, to be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>more fresh, flourishing, and fruitfull in his age: when other men lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, decay, and are daily enfeebled, these trees of righteousnesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue new vigour and strength, not to flourish onely, but to be more fruitfull then euer. And whereas amongst men, those that see olde and decrepite age for want of naturall heate and moisture shriule and die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; yet euen these same beeing true members of the Church, hauing once the life of the Sonne of God breathed into their soules, are neuer
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:18792:184"/>
afterwards destitute of radicall heate and moysture: but renew their age as the eagle, and with their daies their strength. For Christ is that Sunne of righteousnesse, who once rising vpon a soule, is so farre from setting againe, that he is still rising euen vnto the perfect day of it; and therefore necessarily supplieth it with moysture and heate of grace. And the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is, that those that <hi>waite vpon the Lord, shall renew their strength,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 40.31.</note> 
                  <hi>they shall lift vp their wings, as the Eagles, they shall runne and not be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they shall walke and not waxe fainte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The comfort of old age dependeth hereupon, the tedious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and diseased daies of which, whosoeuer would comfortably passe, they must prouide themselues of this supplie. For who is it, that can say he hath pleasure in those daies, when for the darknes and miserie of them, the sunne, and the moone, and the starres seeme to fall from heauen; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom Christ the Sunne of righteousnesse hath not risen; and vnto whose heart that <hi>bright morning starre</hi> hath not discouered his bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? the least beame and glims of whose sauing grace,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.28.</note> farre surpasseth the sunne in his strength. What comfort can be to him, whose strong men that keepe the house, that is, whose armes tremble for weaknes, and whose thighs bow themselues as too weake to beare the weight of the bodie; vnlesse the Lords arme and right hand become his strength, and as a staffe to leane vpon? as he was to Dauid, 2. Sam. 22.19. What ioy remaineth vnto him, whose age hath worne away most of his senses; that now hath his eyes dim, as Isaaks; that with Barzillai he cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne between good and bad: he hath no tast in that he eateth and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, he cannot heare any more the voice of singing men and women? vnlesse he hath attained the eyes of faith, to see God in Christ, and so with Simeon he can behold his saluation; vnlesse he find rellish and tast in the bread of life, vnlesse he can heare the sweet note of Gods spirit consenting with his owne, that he is Gods child, together with that sweet harmony of a good conscience kept before God and men in all things, which is heauenly musick vpon earth? In a word, what solace or reioysing can be to him, who hath one foote in the graue, that seeth death so neere him, daily threatning him, and no way to escape him; vnlesse herein also the spirit sustaine his infirmitie, by assuring him that Christ is his life, who hath bereaued that serpent of his sting, poyson, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome; so as he shall doe him no more harme then helpe him towards his happines?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, why should not we thus prouide against that rainie day, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> furnish our selues against the euill of it? seeing the heathen were by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture taught to prouide for themselues such props of their age, as they thought would most bestead them, both for their vtilitie and delight?
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:18792:185"/>
there is no man that finding his eyes decaying, needeth to be vrged to prouide spectacles: nor he whose loynes faile him, to prepare him a staffe to leane vpon: and much more should grace teach euery Christian, that when with Dauid, through age or otherwise, he findeth his flesh fayling him, and his heart also, then to make the Lord his hope, and his portion for euer.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the recompence of this dutie is beyond all our thoughts: seeing the blindnes of the bodie is made vp by the vision of the Lord Iesus, and God the father appeased in him; bodily weakenesse supplyed by spirituall strength, corporal death abated, yea exchanged with heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life: all which not onely quell the feare of death approaching, but euen whet the desire of it: For if Simeon seeing Christ in his armes, praieth for his peaceable departure: If Moses seeing the land of Canaan from the toppe of mount Nebo, could willingly submit himselfe to die: If the three famous Patriarchs,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.13.</note> who neuer sawe the promises accomplished to their owne persons, but a farre off promised to their posterities, could willingly die in faith: how much more shall they be able to wish their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, who by the eye of the faith shall behold that heauenly Canaan, and that celestiall Ierusalem, of which the other were but darke sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> This doctrine cries shame vpon many old men, that are as weake or weaker in soule then they be in bodie, farre more blind, more stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, euery way more sensles, more dead: they perceiue their faces and eyes looke drooping to the earth, and yet their spirits neuer a whit more lifted vp vnto heauen: they see the world forsaking them as not able to cherish them any longer; and yet cannot they be drawne to forsake the world: they cannot but behold the earth casting them off it, and making a way fot the next age their posteritie; and yet they cast care away, and neuer prouide themselues of a continued citie. The eie of their bodie seeth how they are growne into yeares, and striken in age; but the eye of their mindes see not the gray haires here and there vpon them, no more then <hi>Eprhaims did.</hi> Euerie man can see and say they are come euen to the period of their dayes, and yet no man can say, they are come to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of any true grace. Thus although multitude of yeares should teach wisedome, vnderstanding, faith, application; yet may young Elihu truely obiect, to the reproach not of a fewe; that olde age is not alwaies wise. Further vrging of this point, although carried further in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, I purposely omit. The Lord graunt all of vs whome it concerneth to learne thus much as is said.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In loue,</hi>] This second vertue beseeming the elder sort not onely as olde men, but auncient Christians, is brotherly loue, which casteth eie
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:18792:185"/>
vnto all the duties of the second table, as faith principally to the duties of the former; and most fitly ioined with faith, as being the inseparable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of it, and such a marke as freeth it from imputation of deadnesse or vnsoundnesse. Which vertue is inioyned euerie Christian olde or young; both because it is the <hi>newe commandement of</hi> Christ:<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.34. 1. Ioh. 3.23.</note> as also a note of a Christian and true disciple of Christ, Ioh. 13.35. and is besides the bond of vpright dealing in humane societie, without which men were little better then wolues or wilde beasts. But it is here rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to elder men, who in this vertue, as in the former, and following graces, must be more <hi>at the last, then at the first:</hi> and in whome this grace of loue must be proportionable vnto their faith:<note place="margin">Rev. 2.19.</note> for this may not be an infant, if the former be of riper age; but according to the proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and growth of faith, must <hi>loue abound.</hi> And it must be obserued, that our Apostle requireth not the vertue simply, or in remisse degree, or small measure; but <hi>soundnesse in loue,</hi> in such a degree and measure as that age seemeth of it selfe to call for.</p>
               <p>Now if we would knowe wherein the soundnesse of loue consisteth,<note place="margin">Soundnes of loue standeth in 5. things.</note> it is then sound when it hath soundnesse, 1. in the ground. 2. order. 3. seate. 4. worke. 5. durance of it.</p>
               <p>First, the true ground of all the loue of the creature,<note place="margin">1. The ground.</note> is the loue of the Creator; all the loue of man must issue from the loue of God, and all duties of the second table must be performed in the first: neither ought any creature to be loued so farre as it is an enemie and hatefull to God the creator: Psal. 139. <hi>I hate the wicked,</hi> that is, so farre as wicked, namly, their practises, not their persons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it must be sound in the order:<note place="margin">2. The order.</note> which will appeare in two rules. 1. it must be in the greatest measure where is most grace, and shew it selfe most friendly and louing to them that loue, and are the friends of God. It must <hi>doe good vnto all, but especially the houshold of faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> The Apostle commending the loue of the Ephesians, which for the soundnes of it he sawe was praise worthie, he hence approoueth it, that it was <hi>to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all Saints:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 1.15.</note> and hence the Apostle Iohn gathereth a note that we are translated from death to life, <hi>if we loue the brethren.</hi> And herein we haue God himselfe going before vs in example, who respected the poore widowe of Sarepta aboue all Israel.</p>
               <p>Now we shall descend fitly to this dutie by these staires. 1. by louing God simply for himselfe. 2. Christ as man, the beloued of God, &amp; the head of his Church. 3. the Church it selfe, the bodie of Christ receiuing of his fulnes grace for grace: and 4. the particular members must rise vp higher in our affections, as the Lord hath highlier honoured them with grace, and more expressely renewed his image vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:18792:186"/>The second rule for the right order of sound loue is, that it must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne at home, but may not there determine: the rule of the loue of our neighbour, Christ hath made the loue of our selues, and as we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for our owne good first, and that according to the wisedome which the word teacheth; first seeking the kingdome, the pearle, the treasure for our soules, and then these outward things for our outward man; euen so are we to deriue this loue in this manner vnto the soules and bodies of others, according as they are nearer vs, or further off in the degrees of grace and nature. And here respect must be had, 1. to those of our own house, as to whom we are tyed either by the bond of marriage, who bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one with vs, haue right to the same affection wherewith we loue our selues; or of neere blood, as parents, children, or of dutie, as seruants: he that careth not for these, is worse then an infidel, and hath denied the faith. 2. He that careth for none but these is little better, for if loue bee sound within, it will be working outwardly. As 1. to such as are tyed by any bond of blood, or alliance, euen without the family. 2. to such as are in a perpetuall contract of friendship with vs, as was betweene Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid and Ionathan, 2. Sam. 18.1. and Christ had one who aboue the rest, was called the disciple <hi>whom Iesus loued.</hi> 3. it must proceed on to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers as men, and as those that may be heires of the same grace of life with vs, yea to the poore as well as to <hi>the rich,</hi> Iam. 2.8, 9. nay more, to our enemies, Matth. 5.44. <hi>Loue your enemies:</hi> these are the degrees of sound loue.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this loue must be sound in the <hi>seate</hi> of it, and that must be the heart;<note place="margin">3. In the seat.</note> Rom. 12.9. <hi>Let loue be without dissimulation:</hi> it must not be hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critall, from the teeth outward or fawning, but loue must come from a <hi>pure heart:</hi> 1. Ioh. 3.18. <hi>Let vs not loue in word and tongue, but in deede and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4. In the work.</note>Fourthly, it must be sound in the <hi>worke</hi> or action of it. 1. in preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the euill of the brethren, not <hi>suffering men to sinne.</hi> 2. in procuring their good. The Apostle would haue experience of the naturalnesse of the loue of the Corinths in their bountie and liberalitie towards the Saints in want.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.8. Iames.</note> For if any haue this worlds good, and shutteth his compassion from his brothers neede, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5. In the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note>Fiftly, it must be sound in the <hi>durance</hi> and lasting of it, Prou. 17.17. <hi>A friend loueth at all times:</hi> and here trie the soundnesse by these notes. 1. If in a milde and iust reprehension it breaketh not off. 2. If it hold in aduersitie,<note place="margin">Charitas quae deseri potest nunquam vera fuit. August. ad Iulianum co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitem.</note> 
                  <hi>a brother is made for aduersitie,</hi> see Act. 11.29. 3. If it hold then when iniurie is offered, and occasions of breaking off, by vnkindnesse or hard measure: 1. Cor. 13.5. <hi>Loue is not prouoked to anger,</hi> but <hi>suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:18792:186"/>
all things.</hi> In these two latter it resembleth Gods loue, which is both constant, and closest to a man in the day of his trouble, neither taketh it the forfeit of our daily prouocations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> By all this triall, both olde and young may see how farre they are from soundnesse in this grace, contenting themselues euen with a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of it: for the most of mens loue is grounded either vpon receite or hope of benefit, or vpon flesh and fleshly respects, and is not begunne in nor for God, nor knit by the spirit of God: the least part of it is set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Saints that are vpon earth excelling in vertue: it generally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth it selfe in selfe louing, and selfe seeking, not seeking the things of others, as well as their owne; or not seeking and louing the soules of men, as well as their bodies; or respecting persons, and not embracing the poore as well as the rich; or not blessing their enemies as well as their friends: the most loue of men is a lip-loue, a semblance, a counterfeit, and fruitlesse loue, diuorsed from inward heartie affection: or else a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing and flitting loue, flinching in aduersitie when most neede is; and readie vpon the least occasion to be ouercome with euill, and changed into bitter hatred: this crazie loue euerie where argueth a riuen and crackt faith; such counterfeit loue is the daughter of counterfeit faith, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundnes of loue is a sure token of vnsoundnes of faith, and halting in religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In patience:</hi>] This third ornament of Christian old age, is fitly by the spirit of God added to the two former, as the preseruatiue of both: most requisite vnto all Christians. For seeing this vertue is nothing else, <hi>but a willing and constant suffering of hard and painefull things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Patience ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Christian.</note> 
                  <hi>for Christianitie and honesties sake:</hi> and further, that affliction followeth the faithfull, who studie to testifie their loue of God in the loue of man, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as the shadow followeth the bodie: necessarily must he that would hold out in Christianitie, get this grace to beare off such calamities, as follow vpon the keeping of faith and good conscience. 2. No man can haue either of the former that wanteth this, for these three vertues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are like the three graces which goe hand in hand, the former leading the latter, and this last laying hold on both the former: so as if any man would trie the soundnes of the former, he cannot better do it then by the sequele of the latter: the soundnes of faith discouereth it selfe in the soundnes of loue, and the soundnes of loue, in a sound patience: for as sound faith is louing, so sound loue is patient, <hi>and endureth all things,</hi> 1. Cor. 13. 3. Euery Christian must after a speciall manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble God herein, who is a God of patience, yea patience it selfe. 4. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Christian must not onely possesse his soule by it;<note place="margin">Heb. 12.12. and 10.35.</note> but by <hi>faith and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> patience inherit all the promises of God:</hi> vpholding himselfe in his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:18792:187"/>
as the net is vpheld by the corke from sinking.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Specially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to old men. Why.</note>But it is here especially commended to the practise of old men, for sundrie reasons. 1. Because they of themselues are inclined to froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> waywardnes, and are hard to please: and beeing compassed with so many infirmities as they be (the age it selfe beeing a continuall disease) were they not supported by Christian patience, they might easily fall from their ground, giue place to the grudgings of murmuring against God, impatience of their weake and wearie condition, and so staine their profession, and make their liues more burthensome to themselues and others then they need: and therefore they are forewarned, that when their bodies grow impotent, their minds must not be suffered to grow impatient, but by the strength of this grace to represse such impotencie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Because beeing thus incident to many weaknesses, whereby they might disparage their age and profession, they must put on patience to heare Christian aduise, admonition, and reprehension: and not as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of old men is, to storme and be enraged when they are put in mind of their weaknesses. 3. Because that age seeing it selfe broken and cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is very willing to enioy peace and quiet, and consequently for most part readie inough to decline the crosse and persecution for the professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Persecution the ancient armes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.</note> which indeed is the glorious armes of a Christian: it was therefore a very seasonable exhortation, especially in those troublesome times, to old professors, and auncient beleeuers, to prouide themselues of patience, that so they might not shrinke away in time of triall, to the preiudice of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> profession of Christ. 4. Because they by reason of their longer exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and experience, which is presumed in their age, should be well seene and practised in this grace: so as in their own troubles, they should not be discomfited, but say to themselues: well, this must be no newes to me, I haue seene a number of Gods children afflicted, and I haue seene what end God hath giuen them; nay I haue not onely obserued his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and seasonable deliuerance of others, but my selfe haue swumme out of many deeps: and sure I am, I shall not sinke in this: nay rather I ought to lift vp the hands of others that hang down, and strengthen their weak knees, as one able to comfort others in affliction, by the comforts <hi>wherewith my selfe haue beene comforted of God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.1.</note>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Soundnes of patience in 3. things.</note>Now for the soundnes of this grace here also vrged, it standeth especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in three things: 1. in a sure <hi>ground:</hi> 2. in sound <hi>fruites:</hi> 3. in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>induring of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The right ground of all sound patience, is God himselfe. And this is so,<note place="margin">1. in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.</note> when in any affliction either immediatly from God for triall or chastisment, or more mediate by man or other creatures Gods instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the eye of faith turneth it selfe vpward, and causeth the afflicted
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:18792:187"/>
soule to runne vnder the hand that smiteth: and is (as the hebrew phrase is) <hi>silent vnto God:</hi> Examples of both these we haue in Dauid, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting with Gods owne hand in his soule and bodie, <hi>held his tongue, and said nothing:</hi> and the reason is rendred, <hi>because thou didst it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 39 9.</note> and in that great affliction brought vpon him by Shemei,<note place="margin">2. Sam. 16.10.</note> he would not reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon Shemei, because the <hi>Lord had bidden Shemei curse Dauid.</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah receiuing a heauy sentence from God, said, the <hi>word of the Lord was good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the sound fruits of patience are many, I will reckon fiue,<note place="margin">2. Fruits fiue.</note> which are the chiefe. 1. To entertaine crosses alike, and one kind of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> affliction as equally as another, not thinking it strange to fall into <hi>diuerse temptations,</hi> nor taking it to be in our owne power to chuse our owne rodds: for the Lord cureth not all maladies with one plaister, neither tryeth the same man alwaies with the same triall. The sundrie kinds of trialls of the Apostles, and how equally and patiently they carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues through them, see 2. Cor. 6.4.5. our Sauiours counsell aymed hereat; aduising his followers <hi>to take vp his crosse daily:</hi> that is, to make account of, expect, and forecast one crosse or other; and when they come, though they come euery day, nay sundry in euery day, they must be taken vp, and cherefully and Christianly borne.</p>
               <p>The second fruit of sound pacience, is <hi>cheerefulnesse</hi> in affliction: Heb.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 10.39. the Saints suffered <hi>with ioy the spoyling of their goods:</hi> Iames exhorteth the Saints to count it <hi>exceeding ioy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iam. 1.2.</note> when they fell into sundry temptations: and how Paul tooke pleasure in <hi>infirmities, reproaches, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities, persecutions,</hi> and <hi>anguish</hi> for Christ, see 2. Cor. 12.10. If it be here asked, whether this be not too Stoicall a precept for Christians, who are commanded to weepe with them that weep, and take to heart publike, priuate, and personall calamities? I answer, no Christian may be sensles in affliction, neither can any affliction for the present be ioyous but grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous: and yet these two are not contrarie, to mourne, and yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in affliction; because they are not both attributed to the same part, nor to the same cause: weepe we may according to the flesh, which is humbled; and reioyce at the same time in the spirit, by Gods spirit sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in affliction: Againe, weep we may for the miserie considered in it selfe, and on our selues; and yet at the same time reioyce in the sweet fruit and euent of it, both in regard of <hi>God,</hi> which is his glorie, and <hi>our selues,</hi> namely, the <hi>quiet fruite of righteousnesse.</hi> So the Apostles, Heb. 12.11. and Iames 1. my brethren, <hi>count it exceeding ioy—knowing that the trying of your faith, &amp;c.</hi> that is, if ye cannot reioyce in the sence of affliction, yet you may in the vse of it, because it maketh to the triall of your faith, and encrease of your graces. As the husbandman all his
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:18792:188"/>
plowing and sowing time, he hath nothing but his labour for his paines, he goeth our weeping, but carrieth with him a precious seed; his reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing lyeth in the fruits of his field and trauell;<note place="margin">Psal. 126.5.</note> in that he is sure he shall bring in his sheaues with ioy: and although he soweth in teares, yet he reapeth in ioy.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third fruit of sound patience, is <hi>thankefulnesse</hi> in affliction, 1. Thess. 5.18.<note place="margin">Iob 1.21.</note> 
                  <hi>In all things giue thankes.</hi> Iobs practise is recommended in Scripture for our imitation, who blessed the Lord as well in taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as in giuing. We easily yeeld thankes to God for good things, and therefore we ought for afflictions, the which the Lord seeth to be good for his children, and maketh them often both see and say so much, as Dauid, Psal. 119. <hi>It is good for me that I was afflicted, that I might learne, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The fourth fruit, is the expectation of Gods deliuerance: 2. Sam. 16.12. <hi>It may be the Lord will looke on mine affliction, and doe me good this day</hi>; not making doubt (for neither did Dauid in generall) but constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cleauing to the promise,<note place="margin">Psal. 50.</note>

                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> In that wholesome doctrine must be taught and applyed vnto women as well as men; note that no woman cannot without danger of damnation despise or neglect the ministerie of the word: they beeing as straightly bound vnto the meanes of saluation, and the Apostle taketh double paines to teach them their duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. As saluation is one to all, so is there but one way to all: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as women must haue their names <hi>written in the booke of life,</hi> as well as men,<note place="margin">Philip. 4.3.</note> that is, in the booke of Gods election to life; so must they be also <hi>added vnto the Church</hi> as well as men;<note place="margin">Act. 2.47.</note> seeing none are saued, who are not added vnto the Church. Now this addition to the Church standeth not onely in an outward profession of the Gospel, by which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the visible Church: for the foolish virgins made a great shewe for a time, but in vnfained conuersion and sanctification, whereby they are added vnto the invisible Church. True it is, that women must be ioyned vnto the people of God, and therefore must participate, 1. in the <hi>word,</hi> which must be preached to euerie creature. Paul preached to a <hi>company of women,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 16.13.</note> among whom Lydia was conuerted. 2. in the Sacraments, and be both admitted into the Church by <hi>baptisme,</hi> as Cornelius, the Iaylor, and all their housholds: as also strengthned in the Church by the Lords Supper, in which they must remember the Lords death vntill he come. But all this is not inough, yea nothing at all vnlesse they be first knit vnto God himselfe; the bond of which coniunction is faith wrought in the heart by meanes of the word, and working in heart and life by loue to God and men. If then women must beleeue to saluation aswell as men;<note place="margin">34.</note> the Iaylor and all <hi>his houshold beleeued in God:</hi> nay if women must <hi>continue in faith</hi> to which saluation is tyed, and not to bearing of children;<note place="margin">1. Tim. 2.15.</note> then surely for women to despise the ministerie, which is the meanes of beginning, and continuing in faith, loue, and holinesse, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fearefully to despise fellowship with God, and life euerlasting. Secondly, women must walke in as straight waies to heauen as men: sinne is as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in Eue as in Adam; vnder the same lawe are they borne, by the same lawe are they to be ruled in this life, and iudged in the life to come: the same pretious promises of life are made vnto them; the same preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous faith must lay hold vpon them; the same spirit must inhabitat them; the same graces which accompanie saluation, must beautifie them. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men must worship God as well as men: Lydia, Act. 16.14. must feare God, Act. 17.4. the <hi>chiefe women not a fewe,</hi> must be disciples full of

But if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> any had thus rebuked her, would Christ haue recanted that which he had <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> affirmed of her, that she had chosen the better part; and if Martha had done so too, would Christ haue said that she had failed in the due regard of one thing, which was more necessarie then all that busines which shee encombred her selfe withall. 3.

               <p>Now we come to the behauiour of the elder women, which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth not in speciall prosecute, but in general would haue it wholly squared by this one rule, namely,<note place="margin">A generall rule for the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der women is, that it be such as becommeth holines.</note> whether it be such <hi>as becommeth holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:</hi> that is, whether it be a witnesse of the holynes of the heart, and such as adorneth the holy profession of Christ. Wherein we must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1. That euerie Christian must take out the same lesson here read, and that the holy Ghost knowing all our diseases, directeth this counsell to elder women especially, that they might come to take knowledge of an excessiuely proud disposition in themselues, to offend against this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, and the other particulars, farre aboue others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Apostle holdeth it not sufficient for women out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and abroad, or for a start or fit, as in the Church, market, or other places of meeting, to take vp a shewe of holy or demure behauiour, which many doe, who in priuate can be lasciuious, loose, and wanton enough: but by the word an inward habite,<note place="margin">

For by this word Phisitians properly expresse a constant state of bodie or health, or a sound constitution; which from them is here translated to the minde, to betoken that a Christian woman is still one and the same, and her holy behauiour the same, as well at one time, as an other; in one place as an other, still bounding her selfe in all her carriage within the limits of holynesse; neither doth she force her selfe hereunto, but it freely issueth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an inward principle, which is an habit of holines.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

By aggrauating through vehemencie of words,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> facts, or speaches which may receiue a fauourable construction.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this sinne of false accusing, may be committed as well in <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, we may commit this sinne aswell by others, as our selues; and that either in beeing agents or patients in it. The former, by subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning false accusers and witnesses, as the Iewes did against Christ in the matter of his death and resurrection;<note place="margin">Act. 6.11.</note> as also against Steuen his first Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. The latter, by receiuing false accusation: for as if there were no receiuers, there would be no theeues; so would there be no informers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and our commandement is,<note place="margin">Prou. 25.23. and 17.4.</note> to driue away with an angrie countenance the slandring tongue, as the North wind driueth away the raine. Now all these sinnes, with all other of this kind, must be auoided of euery man and woman, who would not be of that generation of monsters, which the wise man speaketh of,<note place="margin">Prou. 30. Psal. 59.7.</note> who in stead of tongues haue swords in their mouthes. And let euery Christian consider, that expresse charge of God, Leuit. 19.16. <hi>Thou shalt not walke about with tales among thy people:</hi> and 2. that whispering and backbiting, are reckned vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the sinnes of those that are giuen vp to a reprobate sence, Rom. 1.29.<note place="margin">This precept specially dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for sundry causes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But especially is this precept directed to <hi>women,</hi> because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of their sex aboue men hereunto: for the holy Ghost well
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:18792:192"/>
knowing our constitutions, most aptly armeth vs there where we lie most open and naked: hence women are forbidden <hi>to goe from house to house,</hi>

Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> much hurteth the younger women, whom by their vaine iangling, and busie babling, they corrupt or poison, and occasionally robbe and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue them of their vaile of modestie, shamefastnes, and silence. 3. It is a great disgrace for their age, especially if they professe religion, that they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> who should be matrons and patterns of peaceablenes and amiable carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, should become firebrands, incendiaries of families and societies: yea the Deuills gunpowder &amp; <hi>fire</hi> too, to blow vp a <hi>whole world of wickednes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The rules to auoid this sinne are: 1. Looke to thine owne calling,<note place="margin">Iam. 3. Rules to auoid false accusing.</note> and the necessarie duties of it, that so following thine owne plow, thou maist haue no leysure to entermeddle in other mens affaires: busie-bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and pratlers are ioyned by the Apostle. 2. Beware of enuie, which is still hatching and inuenting euill: the saying is true, <hi>malice neuer spake <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> well,</hi> but is suspitious, and deprauing the best persons and practises, and is one of the greatest enemies of truth, in which Gods image cheifely consisteth. 3. Learne to esteeme the good name of thy brother, the next thing to his life: considering the truth of that homely speach, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> he that wanteth a good name, is halfe hanged: and there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that those who would haue their names tendred by others, should tender the good names of others; doing as they would be done vnto, which is the golden rule of all equitie. 4. In receiuing reports, excuse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> parties absent as farre as well we can: as also facts done, so farre as they may be well interpreted: &amp; where we cannot so do, to aduise the repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to looke well vnto, and consider himselfe.</p>

                  <hi>to that he is in bondage.</hi> And the reasons why the Apostle directed this precept vnto old women,<note place="margin">Drunkennes in old women most hatefull. Reasons.</note> seeme to be these.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not vnlike but that the women of those times, as they had like meetings vpon their necessarie and womanly occasions: so had they the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> like practises as now are in request in them: as much idle and busie chat, not a fewe needles drinkings and gossepings, wherein they much excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that to which their condition, or nature, and much lesse grace, called them vnto. The which meetings although some of them are necessarie, yet for women to be addicted vnto them, or excessiue in them in vnwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable speaches, drinkings, meriments, &amp;c. sauoureth of darkenes, of the flesh, and is farre from beseeming women that professe the feare of God, and obedience or subiection to the word of God, which condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>drinkings</hi> as well as drunkennes,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4.4.</note> which are fruits of an vnregenerate estate. And thus the Apostle by this precept backeth the former, the due obseruance of which would cut off much false accusing in such meetings; and in the neglect of it, it is impossible but that the tongue will be wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king without his owne hedge, and wandring beyond the pale of it. The prouerbe is true:<note place="margin">In vino veritas.</note> what euer is in, must out in the cups. Agreeable to that holy prouerb of Salomon:<note place="margin">Prou. 23.</note> to whom are contentions? to whome are stroakes, and wounds without cause? euen to those that stay long at the wine: teaching vs, that the hands and tongues also of such lash on, strike <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> &amp; spare not, no not their dearest friends. 2. The moderation of the elder women should be an example to the yonger, as the next words import, &amp; an hedge to containe them in compasse, from whom otherwise in such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> meetings some lightnesse might breake out. 3. For a matron to make shipwracke of shamefastnes, modestie, sobrietie, grauitie, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer else may be the grace of that sexe, and age, by giuing place to this one inordinate desire, what a grieuous sinne were it? how many sinnes attend it? euen so many as there be fearefull fruits and effects of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes:
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:18792:193"/>
as wandring eyes, lustfull lookes, tongues speaking lewd things, gestures, and actions, more seemely for bruit beasts then either women or Christians. 4. Besides the more publike scandall, if we consider the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate damage of this sinne in women, we shall finde the Apostle had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sufficient to condemne it in them. For whereas the Lord hath laide this dutie on the wise woman, to build vp her house, to regard the wayes of her familie, so as her diligence and labour should (if not much increase) yet at least preserue and saue that portion of maintenance her husband bringeth in, accordingly as his heart trusteth in her: this one sinne strips her of all fitnesse to gouerne the family, which for her goeth at sixes and seauens (as we say) it wasteth and consumeth the substance both priuate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at home, and by calling in companions from abroad: and thus she sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wrongeth her family for the present, lodeth her husband with debts and dangers, and depriueth her children of that comfort which was meete should be reserued and laid vp for them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Out of the word we may further note the follie of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature,<note place="margin">A note of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to yeld our selues ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to the creatures or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to serue vs.</note> making vs readie to yeeld our selues slaues and seruants to the creatures, which by Gods institution and ordinance should serue vs. And we yeeld vp our selues seruants vnto them diuerse wayes: as 1. in the immoderate desire of getting them vnto vs; when men men will be rich, and hasten so to be, when they will fare deliciously, goe sumptuously,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> dwell stately,<note place="margin">Meanes of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selues vnder their seruice.</note> which to compasse they will become base seruants to any man, any sinne, or any drudgerie for a time. 2. When in holding them, the mindes and affections of men dwell in the delight of them, as when the abundance, varietie, goodnesse, sweetnesse, and pleasure of meates,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> drinkes, pastime, merie companie, gorgeous apparell, faire buildings, drawe downe the heart, make it drunke with sensualitie, and forgetfull of God. Thus the Lord chargeth his people: <hi>when thou wast in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speritie thou saidst, I will not heare: this hath beene thy manner from thy youth:</hi> for now the heart is held as in chaines, and hath it not in the power to turne it selfe to any other truer delight. 3. When a man hath it not in his power to forsake or part with them: when of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> all that he is owner of, he is not the master of any small part to employ to any good vse, or in any worke of Christian charitie and liberalitie. And numbers are such base drudges to their wealth, as they will as soone part with their vnprofitable liues, as in the forgoing of a small and trifling commoditie, testifie any fruit of faith and thankefulnesse to God the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or of loue and mercie vnto men, whom he hath made receiuers: but they wast away their daies, and vanish away themselues as though they were not, in adding and increasing of wealth by any meanes, as if they were borne to make their heires happie by their owne going to the deuil,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:18792:194"/>
as the common speach is. 4. When they are as fetters and clogges from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the performance of good duties, vnfitting men to the duties of their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and speciall calling, whereunto they were ordained to make vs fit and seruiceable. Thus men loose their libertie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> To resolue of the practise of these precepts. 1. To vse the world as not vsing it, neither growing proud in the smiles, nor too much depressed in the frowning of it. 2. So to take our parts of our lawfull li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.12.</note> as that we be neuer brought <hi>vnder the power of any thing:</hi> vnder the pretence of libertie in the creatures, we may not become slauish vnto them, but carrie an equall minde both to want and abound. 3. To avoid all occasions whereby vnawares we might be drawne vnder their power, as <hi>looking at the wine in the cup,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prou. 23.31.</note> for hereby thirst will follow drunkennes; so of daintinesse, softnes, riotous and spend thrift companie, for by such meanes and examples, the heart becomes wholly diuorced from God, and glewed vnto the creatures.</p>
               <q>But teachers of honest things,]</q>
               <p>It will be here asked, how standeth this with that in 1. Tim. 1.2.11. <hi>Let the woman learne,</hi> and <hi>I permit not a woman to teach. Answ.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle there speaketh of the order and comlines of publike ecclesiasticall assemblies, wherein they were not allowed to take vpon them any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or function of teaching, for the reasons propounded, which are three. 1. From their condition, which is to be obedient vnto man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in mens presence must not vsurpe the authoritie of teachers, but content themselues with the place of schollers, in all mixt assemblies of men and women. 2. Their function, which is to serue men: for Adam was first created, and Eue for Adam; and not to exercise any function o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them. 3. From the weakenes of their sexe, which lieth more open to Satans seducement; for <hi>Adam was not deceiued first,</hi> but Eue. It is not fit that any such function of teaching should be committed vnto them; seeing Eue in innocencie taking vpon her to teach Adam, was so easily preuailed against: and the Apostle expresseth this his owne sense, 1. Cor. 14.34. where from the same ground of the womans subiection vnto man, he saith, <hi>let your women keepe silence in the Churches.</hi> As for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Deborah, and Huldas, who were Prophetesses in the Church, they beeing extraordinarie, make nothing against this rule of Paul, nor for that Pepuzian heresie, for womens teaching in the Church, nor that Popish heresie of midwiues baptizing of infants in case of necessitie, as they call it. Neither doth this place written by the same spirit and penne crosse the former, seeing it speaketh of priuate teaching and instructing the family at home, especially her children and maidseruants; so the text it selfe seemeth to restrain them, pointing them out their auditors; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:18792:194"/>
                  <hi>young women</hi> in the next verse; and the lectures they are to fit vnto them; the most or all of which are priuate duties, and the ende to make the younger women wise vnto all godly conuersation; namely, both those within the family, and those that are without, so farre forth as they shal be occasionally called to instruct them, both by Christian speach and example. Now that this dutie belongeth vnto matrons, it will appeare, if we consider them, 1. as Christian women. 2. as superiours in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
               <p>For the former:<note place="margin">A dutie enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian woman to call on others to her godly course.</note> it is not sufficient that a Christian woman liue vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and vnblameably in her selfe, vnlesse she also endeauour to driue or drawe the younger women to the like godly course. For 1. euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian must gather with Christ, and he or she that gathereth not scattereth: whence are all those exhortations, <hi>thou beeing conuerted, strengthen thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> brethren: obserue one an other, admonish,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and prouoke one another to loue and good workes.</hi> 2. The rule of speach for all Christians is, that for the matter it be good, that is, of good things: and for the vse, that it tend to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> edifie: and who but elder Christian women should proceede in this duty? 3. From the obseruation of this rule, the godly are described to be such,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as <hi>whose lips feede many,</hi> and they speake pleasant words, which are health to the bones, and sweetenes to the soule, their tongues are <hi>trees of life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 37.30.</note> 
                  <hi>vtter wisedome, talke of iudgement,</hi> of high matters, &amp;c. And that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should not thinke that they are exempted from all this qualification of their speach, Salomon ascribeth it in speciall to a vertuous woman, that she openeth her mouth with wisedome, and the law of grace is vnder her lips; answerable to this text, which requireth that she be a teacher of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest things.</p>
               <p>As for the latter, this dutie of teaching honest things, belongeth vnto them as gouernours of their family: wherein Salomons mother is a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble president, who instructed her sonne, <hi>what my sonne? and what the sonne of my wombe? &amp;c.</hi> and Timothies mother, and grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> who acquainted him with <hi>the Scriptures from a child:</hi> and what else pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued these, but rare men, full of grace and pietie?</p>
               <p>

Out of the first of which, we learne,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> What must be the fruit of the elder womens carriage and speach; namely the making of the younger wise,<note place="margin">The fruit of the elder wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens holy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in the yonger.</note> in the generall wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of godlines and honestie. Euery practise, and euery speach of theirs, ought to be either a precept or example of wholsome instruction, Prov. 31.6. The vertuous woman <hi>openeth her mouth in wisedome:</hi> the fruit of her lips yeeldeth instruction, and her life is a shining lampe: which doctrine as it is cleare both here, and elsewhere in the Scriptures; so is it of exceeding profitable vse. 1. To older women, to teach them warines in all their words, and behauiours, and looke to their carriage both abroad and at home, as well within their owne houses, as the house of God, whose eyes are euery where beholding the good and the badde; euen in the denne with Daniel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the dungeon with Ioseph: that they may walke wisely euen in the midst of their houses; so setting themselues coppies of religious conuersation to those ouer whom they are set: fasting, praying, reading, instructing in priuate;<note place="margin">Priuate duties more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull.</note> in which pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate duties they shall meete perhappes with much more comfort, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though publike duties be more powerfull: that in all common actions also of life, they may bring them to this touch, whether they will instruct others in wisedome or no. By which triall (if vnpartiall) not a few shall find their behauiours and speaches fitted to traine the younger sort to prattle, and plaie the busie bodies, to scoffe, to quip, raile, heartburne their betters: to instruct them to become as bold in behauiour, as soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; to court it like curtezans; and at the best to fill their heads with old fables, and follies; which corrupt minds, and breed to more vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines: whereas they ought in these yeares to account all that time of their life lost, wherein the younger sort gathereth not some vertue or good from them. And although this lesson especially be directed to el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der women, yet is it profitably to be extended vnto all Christians, of what sex or age soeuer: euery of whom ought to sanctifie their speaches, and actions by the word, and by prayer, if euer they would attaine this high point of Christianitie, of becomming shining lights, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the glorie and kingdome of God, aswell in others as in themselues:

               <p n="2">2. Whereas it is commonly, but inconsideratly, thought to be only a ministeriall dutie, to make men and women wise vnto saluation; we see hence the contrarie, that it belongeth not only to other men, but euen to women also, but with this difference and reseruation, that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry and Ministers are appointed the ordinarie, principall, and publike meanes of begetting and preseruing men and women vnto God; but this more priuate and common instruction is appointed for the encrease, and strengthning in that grace giuen. Againe, the Minister like a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster builder, is to laie the foundation: and the rest of the people are like labourers, bring filling to the worke, and house of God, and may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his precepts and directions: and therefore <hi>Iude</hi> exhorteth the Saints, <hi>to edifie one another in their most holy faith.</hi> Let not women therefore be ashamed thus to labour with the Ministers in the Gospel, no more then those holy women which laboured with Paul:<note place="margin">Philip. 4.3.</note> nay rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a good note, that <hi>their names are written in the booke of life:</hi> let them be incouraged vnto this holy precedencie, and testification of Christianitie in euery word, action, and behauiour: neither let them make daintie, fearing that in these corrupted daies, none will be hastie to follow their right ordered steppes; for seeing this is the ordinance of God, appointed to this end and vse, it shall prosper to the same purpose in such as whom the Lord hath any delight in, to build them vp further; when they shall heare the gracious speaches of their lippes, and see the grace of their liues; and as for others, let them at their perill neglect their owne duties, yet shall it not be without vse in them also, as not without comfort to their owne soules in the day of the Lord.</p>
               <q>That they loue their husbands,]</q>
               <p>Now our Apostle teacheth younger women, how they should carie themselues in their familes, and propoundeth many marriage vertues, which ought to discouer themselues in all women, called vnto that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and in younger women are speciall ornaments; whose loue, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie, chastitie, humilitie, and subiection, should be as the vailes of their heads, and as the chaine and garland of their necks.

or can a woman <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Tim. 3.1.</note> 2. The best nature of all if it be not extinguished as in the former, yet is greatly corrupted, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> can produce nothing pleasing to God: and therefore hath the Lord bound women to this affection of loue, by a surer and straighter bond then that of corrupted nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hauing by his owne commandement laid it vpon them as a calling to walke in; that the performance of it might be an obedience of faith, and not a worke of naturall instinct, a dutie of conscience as well as of affection. 3. Though the ground of this affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be nature, which can teach a woman to loue her husband, &amp; children; yet nature cannot teach either the right manner, or measure of this loue; this is left to be ordered by the word. Nature can loue naturally, that is, fleshly and corruptly, but not holily. Nature either commeth short, or exceedeth the due measure of loue: from whence are kindled the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles and flames of suspitions, ielousies betweene husband and wife; and much miscarriage betweene parents and children, when parents in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducating of children separate faith and loue, both which the Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, 1. Tim. 2.15. But the word both ruleth, manageth, and raung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this affection in such confines, as cause it to be euerie way louely, as alwaies to be lasting.</p>
               <p>For the former of these, that a woman <hi>should loue her husband,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Why women should loue their husbands. Reasons.</note> yea embrace him with such a loue as surpasseth all other, euen to the forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of her owne people, her fathers house, yea her owne selfe in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of him; besides the commandement of God, there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. 1. The commandement is often repeated in the booke of God,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and is enlarged and inforced, in Ep. 5.22.24. where the wife is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to loue &amp; embrace her husband, as the <hi>Church doth Christ himselfe:</hi> how is that? look in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> through all which holy song, the church neuer speaketh of Christ, but breaketh into the expressing of her most feruent loue; neuer mentioneth him without the titles bewraying her most entire and inward loue; calling him her loue, her welbeloued, him whom her soule loued, him who was more then other welbeloueds, the chiefe of tenne thousand: him who could not be out of her sight, but she was sicke of loue after him: here is a glasse set before all women, and a direction how to esteeme of their husbands.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reasons are sundrie: I will onely note three. First, because of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:18792:197"/>
that straight vnion betweene them, they beeing no more two but one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and <hi>one</hi> in diuerse regards. 1. In respect of the <hi>womans originall:</hi> the Lord consulting to build vp Adam a fit helpe to ioyne in marriage with him,<note place="margin">They twain are one in 5. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</note> did not thinke good in his wisedome to frame her of any matter di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse from Adam himselfe, but tooke a part of himselfe to make her of; not of his head, as if she should be a superiour, nor of his feet, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an vnderling, not of his hand, as to be a meere seruant, but of one of his ribbes, to lay her againe in his owne bosome: hereby signifying to Adam, that his wife was no other then a peice of himselfe, and that he was to embrace her as a branch springing from himselfe, and shee him as her roote and stocke, receiuing vnder God her originall, life, and beeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it selfe from him. 2. They two are one in all <hi>lawe of God and man</hi>; God making the match in heauen, and finishing it betweene them by men on earth, pronounceth that they are no more twaine but one flesh: and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes account them but one person. Now shall God, and all other men account them but one, and shall themselues by beeing diuided in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> remaine two? 3. They are one by their <hi>mutuall consent,</hi> nay, deliberate choise and election; and by the consent of such as it belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to weight and obserue whether God gaue the one to the other: and also by their publike promise and couenant before God and his congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation;<note place="margin">Prou. 2.17.</note> and therefore ought to preserue this bond of vnitie, and be farre <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> from forsaking <hi>the couenant of their God.</hi> 4. One <hi>actually,</hi> by comming into one family,<note place="margin">Except the wife will hate her owne flesh she must loue her husband.</note> one manner of liuing for bed and board: participating in welfare or woe, but especially by becomming one bodie, and one flesh as Moses speaketh. 5. One by <hi>propagation,</hi> both of them (through Gods blessing) affoarding one common matter, for the bringing of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> children, which are the principall pawnes of their loue. From all which I conclude the first reason, that if euerie man loue humanitie in euery man, if one countriman can loue another, although otherwise strangers; if neighbour can loue neighbour, because he is so: if kindred can affect their kindred, although further off: how should such a bond as this (which herein passeth all the other, that it onely can make two one in person, and not onely one in affection as the other) be preserued inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on both parts for their mutuall comfort? and this is the verie reason of the spirit of God, Mal. 2.15. <hi>God made but one,</hi> and why, not because he wanted spirit to haue inspired a world of wiues for Adam; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he respected an holy seede: inferring the same conclusion which is as strong in the one sexe as the other; wherefore let <hi>no man transgresse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the wife of his youth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, this affection of loue is due to the husband from the wife, as he is the head and foundation of the family, and vpholder of it: and
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:18792:197"/>
consequently in speciall sort the <hi>vaile of her eyes,</hi> her protector and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from all those who would offer her wrong:<note place="margin">Gen. 20.16. Ruth 3.9. Isa 4.1.</note> and as he <hi>spreads his wing ouer her,</hi> so she hath betaken her selfe to be <hi>called by his name,</hi> she partaketh of all his honour and aduancement, of his gaines and income: and could not raise her selfe,<note place="margin">The husband &amp; wife are yoake-fellowes and ioynt compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ioy or sorrow.</note> but (as a vine) creepe disgracefully as on the ground, were she no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by him propped and suported: in all which regards and many moe, it is as little as he can expect, or she performe in way of thankefulnesse, to embrace him with such tendernesse of loue and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection, as neuer findeth it selfe sufficiently satisfied with requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the loue of the husband is a notable preseruatiue of Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> worship in the family, without which praiers must needs be interrupted; as also of her owne peace and comfort of her life, of his and her chastitie and purenes of bodie and of spirit. It is noted of Isaac,<note place="margin">Gen. 24.</note> that <hi>he loued Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beccah</hi> dearely, and this was a speciall preseruatiue, that he fell <hi>not to</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamie, or concubines, as the most of the Patriarks did: and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, the want of loue to ones proper companion, whether man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, is the first breach of the couenant, and bringeth into the bosome of some stranger, to the ruine of the whole family. In a word, let this affection be wanting, all other duties will either be not performed, or els for fashion, or for a while, but not constantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To reprooue many women, who thinke it enough that they looke well to their houshold affaires, and so become good huswiues, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they take litle more delight in their husbands then in other men, against whom they can soone breake into sullennesse, anger, and wrath, and shewe such distemper as if they were borne in some angrie houre: whereas they ought to possesse inwardly an honest and proper delight in them, and outwardly shewe and expresse it, that the husband may requite their loue with loue proportionable backe againe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas many which loue their husbands doe it sinnefully and immeasurably,<note place="margin">Rules for the right louing of the husband.</note> it is meete to lay vp some rules for the wel doing of such a dutie. 1. To begin loue not as the most at the man, or in the flesh; but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in God and for God; acknowledging the necessitie of the dutie, because God hath commanded it: for if it be of conscience, it will be lasting, it will suffer nothing against God, and will encounter against all occasions, which would worke change of affection. Secondly, loue his soule first <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and principally, both hindring sinne in him, as Pilates wife although an heathen woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wished her husband to haue nothing to do against Christ as also in wisedom prouoking him to good duties, whether publik in the assemblies, or priuate in the family, as reading, prayer, catechising, and such like; watching her seasons, and best aduantages vnto both these:
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:18792:198"/>
contarie to the practise of many Iesabels, who though there be no neede to spurre free horses, yet are powerfull enough to perswade and worke them to vngodlines.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, this loue must be testified to his outward estate and person. 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> In her cheerefull behauiour at all times, out of sicknesse or other afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which call vnto humilitie and mourning, which opposeth it selfe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ordinarie sullennes of a number. 2. In her wise obseruing his dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and inclination, that she may in all things frame her selfe to please him, so farre as without sinne she may; in wise passing by, and couering his infirmities, and bearing his burthen: the discouerie of which vnto others, and taking vantage of which against himselfe, were both to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease her selfe, and vncouer her owne nakednes: and further, in a wise pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of his displeasure, not growing impatient by his impatience, but rather by meeknes of spirit cast milke into his flame, and be as Dauids <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> harpe to appease Sauls furie. 3. In her carefull diligence to prepare him outward comforts in sicknes and health, and that in due season: wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Iesabell comforted her husband in his sicknesse, Ieroboams wife as wicked as he and she were, yet sought out for his health: see the same dutie in a better patterne of Rebecca,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> who prouided for <hi>Isaak such meate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as hee loued.</hi> 4. In warie circumspection, if God giue her to see more then her husband, with the least preiudice towards him, to turne away, and hinder whatsoeuer would be dangerous to their good estate, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> welfare; thus Abigail saued Nabal, and Micol Dauid. 5. In louing, and to her abilitie, liberall entertainement of her husbands kindred and freinds, as Ruth did to the freinds of her dead husband.</p>
               <p>In these things standeth the true loue of the wife towards the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, all which she oweth him, be he a foole, a froward Nabal, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer else; nothing can loose her from these duties which dissolueth not the marriage bond.</p>
               <p>Now although this text speaketh nothing expressely of the husbands dutie, yet may not the husband thinke himselfe lawles, or to expect the payment of these duties, and liue as he list. For not only other places of our Apostle bind him as straite as this doth the wife; but euen this place secretly putteth him in minde of his dutie, both because he is the fountaine of all marriage duties (as of marriage it selfe) as also in that all these offices of loue in the wife, should be a consequent of his loue, yea a thankfull returne of loue for loue; for so is the loue of the Church towards Christ. We will therefore in few words shew (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not so directly laid downe in the text) wherein the husbands loue must bewray it selfe towards his wife,<note place="margin">Husbands duty towards his wife: wherein.</note> that so he may the more iustly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> require the duties from her.

               <q>That they loue their children,]</q>
               <p>These words commendeth not vnto mothers a bare affection of loue towards their children, wherein many are excessiue, and too to foolishly with the ape kill and spoile many of their young ones, with their ouer-kind clasping and cockering of them; but he requireth some maine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue to be performed towards them, wherein mothers must walke as in the cheife duties of their speciall calling; neither are the most of these duties so proper to them, as that the husband hath no stroke in them; but are commended to women the rather, because while children
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:18792:199"/>
be young, it is their proper employment, to be about them, and among them within the house, whilest the fathers occasions for most part call him abroad.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The office of true motherly loue.</note>The first of these duties of motherly loue, is to <hi>nurse</hi> her child her selfe, except health and strength suffer not, or else some iust and weighty cause, which in the court of conscience will be warranted, do hinder. A <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> dutie howsoeuer vnnaturally neglected by many of the richer sort (for this disease of drie breasts is somewhat a kin to the gowte, for the one is of rich men, the other of rich women; neither of the poore ones for most part) yet it is most kindly in the mother, most prosperous to the babe, and the refusall of it very preiudiciall to both: besides, if nature in euery bruit beast cannot crie lowd inough in some mothers eares, grace in the presidents of the godliest women we euer heard of, calleth for it. Sarah hauing a promise of a sonne,<note place="margin">Gen. 21.7.</note> said, <hi>who would haue thought that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Sarah should haue giuen sucke:</hi> it was taken for granted in those daies, that she that bare a child, should also giue it sucke, and so did Sarah al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though her age might iustly haue required dispensation.

Let women consider seriously not onely how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, but how vngodly a practise it is, without iust ground, on idle pretenses to depart from the steppes of these holy women, thrusting forth their children sometimes to such, as by whose negligence they are brought short home; and sometimes (which is worse) to such who ought neither to giue milke, nor yet liue by the law of God, I meane such as by dishonestie haue filled their breasts: but to whomsoeuer, they come short of that loue which euen the bruite creatures cary to their young.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, seeing the vnreasonable creatures can and doe performe this office of loue, there must needs be more required in the loue of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers toward their children: the second dutie therefore of motherly loue is, by <hi>instruction</hi> to frame them vp to godlines: and this two waies, 1. By deliuering them precepts of pietie, so soone as they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them, that if it were possible they might sucke in with the milke, principles of grace and godlinesse.

                  <hi>Discreete,</hi>] or temperate. A vertue before required both in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, cap. 1.8. and in elder men, cap. 2.2. and now in younger women, beeing a grace requisite for all estates, ages, sexes, and conditions of life: requiring that the raines of affections be subiected vnto reason, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by iudgement, not suffering a thought to be entertained and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the minde which is not first warranted in the word: without which if the raines be slacked but a little,<note place="margin">A discreet ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull grace in a yong woman.</note> the minde is suddenly vanquished, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and lead captiue of manifold lusts. This grace then is the watchman and moderator of the mind, keeping and guarding it from pleasures alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnlawfull, and in lawful curbing and cutting off excesse and abuse. It watcheth also ouer the affections of the heart, and actions of the life, resisting all light behauiour, all childish carriage, all vnquiet and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some passions, such as are suspitions, ielousies, which are the fewels and firebrands of much mischeife, and the distempers of flashing anger, rage, &amp; vniust vexation. It suffereth not vndutifulnes to the husband, vnnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralnes towards the children, vnmercifulnes towards seruants, vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in her owne duties, vnthankefull medling with other folkes affaires. It is a procurer and preseruatiue of many graces, a bond of her owne, and others peace, a setler of the comfort of her life, an ornament of her head, and of her house; which once let her be disrobed of, she may bid farwell to her families welfare; for let any vile affection beare sway but for a little while, as of anger, impatience, excessiue griefe, intemperance, or any such, how is the whole house in a kind of tumult? which as a Common wealth in the commotion and rising of some one rebel, cannot be composed and setled till the rebel be subdued; which they finde too true, who in their match were left vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, to make choise of such as wanted then, and yet haue not attained with the feare of God the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of this vertue.</p>
               <p>Now then seeing this vertue is so necessarie for all parts of life, that it ought neuer to be wanting, many wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who want not many good parts of nature and grace, may yet see hence their error, who conceiue that if they be generally well reputed of, both for their religious and honest

course, and can in good manner please their husbands in the administring of the family; that then they may be dispensed with in some predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, indiscreete, and intemperate affecton, especially if it be more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate: as now and then in extraordinarie vnquietnesse and bitternes, not seldome in some bitter roote of couetousnesse, drawing on iniustice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their husbands, perhaps to breake out into some prodigall and idle expense another way; in lashing out libertie of speech against some that cannot answer for themselues, in becomming for some dayes the greatest strangers at home, &amp;c. all this while thinking that these things, if seldom, will stand well enough with religion: but they are to knowe that all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons wisedom could not reconcile two things so abhorring together, <hi>the giuing of the heart vnto wine,</hi> or any one lust,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.4.</note> and the <hi>leading of it in wisedome:</hi> and it will prooue starke vanitie to make triall of it after him: neither can it be other then the shuffling out of a religious course for man or woman, to giue way to any one inordinate lust. More of this vertue see in the places forenoted.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chast,</hi>] or pure. The Apostle by permitting the three former vertues, hath made way vnto this fourth, which is a fruit of them, issuing from the loue of their husband and children, and from tending and watching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst inordinate affections. And this puritie or chastitie is not that of the virgin or single estate; but it is a marriage vertue, the keeper of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage faith, and may thus be described. It is a puritie both of soule and bodie, in regard of vnchast lusts, abandoning all vnlawfull and strange pleasures: which description is wholly couched and abridged in 1. Cor. 7.34. where the Apostle calleth it, the <hi>holynesse of bodie and spirit:</hi> of <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> when it is either not tempted to vncleannes, or beeing tempted yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, or yeelding is recouered by repentance: of <hi>body</hi> also, when it neither exciteth, nor beeing incited executeth not vncleannes. Now how equall and reasonable is it, that women, especially such as haue the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of marriage against impuritie, in whome the want of it is more sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and dangerous,<note place="margin">Chastitie of mariage vrged by reasons.</note> should be prouoked to the preseruing of such a sweet grace as this is.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> if we consider how the Lord approoueth and vrgeth it. 1. By his commandement, 1. Thess. 4.3. <hi>this is the will of God, that ye should ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> from fornication, and euerie one possesse his vessell:</hi> that is, his body,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> which is the instrument of the soule, and containing it as in a vessell in <hi>holynesse and honour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In that the Lord here interposeth himselfe; and though many hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and wiues thinke of nothing but a mutuall stipulation betweene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> themselues, yet the Lord challengeth the couenant to be made to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as it proceeded first from himselfe:<note place="margin">Prou. 2.17.</note> so as she that <hi>forsaketh the guide
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:18792:201"/>
of her youth, forgetteth the couenant of her God,</hi> that is, of marriage, of which God is the author, and whose name was or ought to haue beene invocated in the match making.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In that the Lord professeth that he narrowly watcheth, and cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> seeth when this couenant is broken, that although the fact be done in the darke, and neuer so charily and cautelously, yet day and darkenesse are alike vnto him. If the husband see it not, nor any eie of flesh, yet the Lords eie findeth it out, and will set it in the cleare light before men and angels. This is made a reason of the precept, Prou. 5.15.17.20.21. for <hi>the wayes of man are before the eies of the Lord.</hi> Ioseph might haue sinned secretly enough, but that his eie was happily lifted vp toward this pure eie of God, which cannot abide to behold such iniquitie.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. In that he declareth that he watcheth the sinner of this kinde to bring destruction vpon his bodie and soule, to shut him out of heauen, and to roote him as a loathsome weede out of the earth. The <hi>former</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, Prou. 5.22. the sinner of this suite <hi>destroyeth his owne soule,</hi> 1. Cor. 6. no fornicator <hi>shall inherit the kingdome of heauen:</hi> Reuel. 21. no vncleane thing shall enter within the <hi>gates of</hi> the citie, but shall bee kept without with dogges, enchanters, and lyers. The <hi>latter,</hi> seeing the law of God is, that the <hi>adulterer, and adultresse should die,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not haue the land defiled, nor the guiltie person to liue as an eyesore vnto the innocent: nay more, if a man were deceiued in the qualitie of the person, he hath taken to wife, thinking to find her a maid, but he findeth her virginitie bruised, and another man hath hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled her,<note place="margin">Deut. 22.21.</note> it is lawfull for him to put her away, and the Magistrate to put her to death, as an adultresse. Further, how strictly the Lord watched o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer this sinne, appeareth by that law, Numb. 5.21. If the husband were but ielous, whether iustly or iniustly, himselfe was accounted guiltie, if he did not bring her to triall; and this triall was not to be made by man, but was Gods owne triall by the bitter cursed water, by which himselfe from heauen, would reuenge so greiuous a sinne, against so holy an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution as marriage is. And in comparison the word of God, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this sinne farre more wicked, then some of those which mens lawes punish with death: we thinke theft a great sinne, because it bringeth malefactors to the gallowes, and so it is, but not comparable to this: for Salomon himselfe by comparing these two sinnes,<note place="margin">Prou. 6.30.</note> putteth them almost out of comparison; a theefe steales for hunger to saue his life, but he that committeth adulterie sinneth against his owne life: the former is not alwaies to be despised, but this is neuer to be spared: the former may make satisfaction, by restitution of the thing, and fowre fold for the sinne, the latter can make no restitution at all: the satisfaction of the
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:18792:201"/>
theefe may be accepted of the owner, or if he cannot satisfie with all the substance of his house, yet his necessitie may plead for him, and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pittie: but here, as no satisfaction can be made, so if it could, it could neuer be accepted; the owner, that is, the husband is enraged, he will not spare, he will not beare the sight of any ransome, although the gifts be augmented.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if we consider how vile and odious the sinne is: 1. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> of humane societie. 2. of the parties offending. 3. of Gods curse vpon the offence. 1. For the first, this is a sinne directly corrupting the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fountaine of honest, ciuill, and godly life, which is the inuiolable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of Gods ordinance of marriage, whereby alone he intended to raise vp to himselfe an holy seed: and for the three societies, what an infamie is it to the <hi>Church,</hi> to be thought an assembly of harlots, which ought to be the Lords holy ones, the vndefiled doues of Iesus Christ? what a confusion bringeth it in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monwealth,</hi> to haue bastard broods inheriting? whereas the Lord would not haue them come within his congregation to the tenth generation: what an iniurie to the <hi>familie,</hi> to bring in vnlawfull and vsurping heires?</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the parties offending. 1. Whereas all other sinnes are <hi>without the bodie, this is against the bodie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.18.</note> the bodie is not onely an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as in other sinnes, but the obiect against which the sinne is done, and not any one part of it, but the whole is violenced. 2. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all other sinnes may be perpetrated and done by one partie, this win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth two into the sinne; and therefore be it that one of them heartily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of it, yet cannot that partie be assured of the true repentance of the other, whom he drew with him into the same: so it cannot but lie for euer as a heauie load vpon the conscience, both in that respect; as also that he hath beene so exceeding seruiceable to the deuill, not comming alone, but bringing companie with him to hell, out of the case of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance. 3. There is an high sinne against the price of Christs blood, wherewith these bodies were bought to be members of Christ, which now are become the members of an harlot; and horrible sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by which Christs owne is taken out of his hands, and giuen vp to the seruice of the deuil: and that bodie which was made to glorifie God vpon earth, and after death shall rise out of the graue, and be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented before Christ to iudgement, hath dishonoured God, dishonoured it selfe, and prepared it selfe to receiue according to the vncleane workes of it, the sentence which shall be pronounced against the vessels prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto destruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the curse of God followeth this sinne: 1. in the soule of the sinner, Heb. 13. <hi>Whooremongers and adulterers God will iudge: him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <pb n="388" facs="tcp:18792:202"/>
that destroieth the Temple of God, will God destroie.</hi> 2. In his bodie, Prov. 5.11. he shall mourne, hauing consumed <hi>his flesh and bodie.</hi> 3. In his name: which precious thing is irrecouerably lost, ver. 9. 4. In his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: it bringeth him to a <hi>bit of bread,</hi> Prov. 6.26. it is a fire which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth all his substance, Iob. 31.12. The prodigall sonne spent all he had on harlots. 5. In their bastard brood: we neuer read that euer any of them came to good, saue onely Iephthe: and yet what a number of men be there, that care not to make their first borne bastards? By these two considerations, the sinne of impurity is sufficiently descried to be most hatefull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Marriage is no abolisher of chastitie, for then the Scripture would not haue enioyned the same person both to loue her husband and children, and also to be chast, against all Popish doctrine to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 2. Let euery woman preserue this puritie of bodie and spirit; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery way expressing it in a modest countenance, as Rebecca was abashed at the presence of Isaack, in a shamefast eye, in a chaste eare, not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining impure communication; in a pure tongue, by graue and holy speach exempt from lightnes,<note place="margin">Means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing this chastitie.</note> and rottennes. <hi>Quest.</hi> How may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue it? <hi>Answ.</hi> The best meanes of preseruing chastitie, are these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> because from the heart issue adulteries, get a pure heart to be the ground of it, make the inside cleane first, actions will not be cut off first; but first become a beleeuer, let the soule become a pure spouse of Christ, loue him, and cleaue to him, this is a good beginning. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> preserue in thy soule the feare of God. Eccles. 7.28. <hi>He that is good before God,</hi> shall be preserued: this is no goodnes of nature, of education, no learning but Gods learning can preserue a man or woman: Prov. 2.8.16. <hi>If knowledge enter into the soule, thou shalt auoid her snares:</hi> turne thy eye vpon Gods presence who seeth thee; and wouldst thou then commit that, from which in the presence of a child of fiue yeare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> old, thou would abstaine? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> loue thy husband as formerly thou wast enioyned, it is not so much the hauing, as the louing of an husband, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that is a fence of chastitie. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> auoid occasions of wantonnes. As, 1. Idlenesse, one of Sodoms sinnes, standing puddles purrifie; walke diligently in the duties of thy calling, least Satan find thee as Dauid on his gallerie. 2. Intemperance and delicacie in meate and drinke, the more fewell the greater flame, especially beware of accustoming thy selfe to wine, and strong drinke, for they are <hi>mockers:</hi> Auoid intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in sleepe, in apparell: let thy dyet be sober, and thy sleepe seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, so as thy bodie may rather be beaten downe and kept vnder by fasting and watching, which are fit medicines to tame the bodie. 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid much companie, and the sight of persons which may become snares,
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:18792:202"/>
as Ioseph went and kept out of his Mistris presence; death often entreth by the windowes of the bodie,<note place="margin">Melius vincitur fugiendo quam oppugnando.

Consider thy calling of a Christian, and profession <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of Christianitie, by both which thou art <hi>called vnto holines,</hi> and not to liue in bruitish lusts, as the Heathen did,<note place="margin">1.

Applie the word the sword of the spirit, a speciall part of Christian armour, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> such places of it as directly encounter against it. 5. Flie to God by prayer, and if thou beest strongly assaulted, make the matter knowne to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> God: for the best way for a woman thus sollicited, to be rid of the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is to tell her husband.</p>
               <q>Keeping at home,]</q>
               <p>As chastitie is the maine marriage dutie,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> and the <hi>vndefiled bedde</hi> the honour of it, in like manner doth our Apostle bring it in like some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Ladie, who is not seene abroad without her attendance, some making way before her, and some safeguarding behind her, euen so here all the marriage duties going before it, made way for it, and all these that follow, are the preseruatiues thereof, all of them beeing such seruants as by their cognisance may be knowne to belong to such a mistresse. And of them all, the holy Ghost thought this of <hi>home-keeping,</hi> fittest to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at her heeles, for house keeping is indeed chastities best keeper.<note place="margin">Housekeeping is chastities best keeper.</note> Not that a woman is neuer to be found without her house ouer her head; for many necessarie and iust occasions call her often abroad, namely, 1. as a Christian, the publike duties of pietie and Gods worship; as also more priuate duties of loue, and workes of mercie in visiting and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the sicke and poore. 2. As a wife, both with her husband when he shall require her; and without him for the necessarie prouision of the houshold, and such like. But the thing here condemned, is the affection of gadding at any or all houres, with disposition of hearing or telling newes, or affecting meriments, companie, expense or excesse, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the owne house rather a prison then an home, and so easily for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking it without iust occasion. And iustly is this course condemned:<note place="margin">That women should keepe their owne houses. Reasons.</note> for,</p>
               <p n="1">1. This is a forsaking and flying for the time out of the calling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they ought to abide, for their calling is commonly within doores, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> keepe the houshold in good order: and therefore for them to wander
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:18792:203"/>
from their owne place, is as if a bird <hi>should wander from her owne neast.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Prou. 27.8.</note> this were the high way to become busie bodies: for what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> more weighty matters call them out of their calling, but to prattle of persons and actions which concerne them not? Whence the Apostle, 1. Tim. 5.13. coupleth these two together, they are <hi>idle, and busie bodies:</hi> which if any wonder how they can be reconciled, thus they are easily: those that are idle in their owne duties, are most busie bodies in other mens; and these busie bodies haue two speciall markes to be knowne by to themselues and others, namely, their open eares, and their loose <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> tongues. Thirdly, the holy Ghost maketh this a note of an whoorish woman,<note place="margin">The wife by keeping at home auoideth both suspition of euills, Prou. 7.11.</note> she is euerie where but where she should be, sometime gadding in the streets with Thamar, somtimes in the fields with Dinah, sometimes without at her doore, somtimes at her stal, but <hi>her feet cannot abide in her house:</hi> and if against her will her bodie be within doores, her heart, and senses will be without: Iesabel must be gazing out of the windowe: whereas if the angell aske where Sarah is, answer will be made, she is in her tent;<note place="margin">As also occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> and the daughters of Sarah will be in their tents, not in the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes, nor stragling so farre abroad but that their husbands can readily <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> answer where they be. Fourthly, what desperate and vnauoideable euils doe they (and iustly) lay themselues open vnto, who make no bones of violating this commandement of God? how doth Satan watch all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to take them, when they are out of their wayes? and how easily doth he preuaile against them, when they haue pluckt themselues from vnder Gods protection? Dinah was no sooner assaulted then ouercome in her wandring; and Eue no sooner absent from Adam then set vpon, and no sooner set vpon, then vanquished; euen so women easily forsaking their owne stations, are giuen ouer for most part, if not so farre as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet in their meriments and meetings, so far to forget themselues by vnchristian speeches and actions, as they haue good cause to ende with sighs and teares.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Wherein this goodnes of a woman is most conuersant.</note>
                  <hi>Good,</hi>] Goodnes is a vertue which is sometimes in generall opposed to all that inward malice, which lurketh in the nature of men and women, wherein the whole troupe of vertues are included: hereof speaketh the Apostle, Eph. 5.9. the fruit of the spirit is in <hi>all goodnesse.</hi> And euen this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is required in women both to bridle that natiue corruption which is so headstrong within; as also to beautifie them outwardly, so as others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding them, may say of them as Paul did of the Romans, <hi>I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that ye are filled with goodnesse:</hi>

And this I take (not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the other) to be here meant especially, as a most comfortable and sweete vertue; without which that holy institution of marriage would prooue no better then an heauie burthen and molestation.</p>
               <q>Subiect vnto their husbands,]</q>
               <p>Marriage in it selfe, although it be neither vertue nor vice,<note place="margin">Women must be subiect to their husbands, Why.</note> but a thing indifferent, yet is it a shoppe of either, according as are the qualities and practises of persons in this condition: and therefore this is the seauenth marriage vertue, prescribed vnto the younger women: whereof there is great reason and necessitie. First, if we consider the lawe of creation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> written by Gods owne finger in the hearts of men, vsed in all nations, and enacted by the naturall light of heathens in the publike lawes, that the wife should be subiect vnto her owne husband, or as the words of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hashuerosh his law runne, <hi>that euerie man should beare rule in his owne house.</hi> This is one reason of our Apostle,<note place="margin">Est. 1.20.22.</note> 1. Tim. 2.3. <hi>Adam was first created and then Eue,</hi> and therefore Adam must be superiour: to which if it be <hi>obiected,</hi> that therefore the birds and beasts should be preferred before both, because they were created before either: the <hi>Answer</hi> is, that there is not the same reason, because the Apostle speaketh of the same kind, and not of diuers. 2. The Apostle prooueth not Adams superioritie so much from the order, as from the ende of creation of the woman; which was to be an helper and comfort vnto him. Now in reason, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer serueth to any ende, is lesse then the ende to which it serueth: but Eue was made for Adam, and not Adam for Eue, yea she was made of him, and not be of her,<note place="margin">Mans superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie was no part of the wiues punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> and therefore euen in innocencie was shee subiect vnto Adam; though then without griefe and molestation, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward came in by sinne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> consider Gods lawe and institution after the fall: Gen. 3.16.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:18792:204"/>
                  <hi>Thy desire shall be vnto him, and he shall rule ouer thee:</hi> as if he had said, seeing thou canst not rule thy selfe, meete it is that now especially, since thy sinne hath set thee out of order, that thou shouldst be put vnder the rule and power of an other: yea although this subiection be not so libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, sweete, and free as before the fall, but ioyned with sorrowe and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, yea although often thou vndergoe vnequall commands: and this also is the Apostles reason, <hi>Adam was not first seduced but Eue:</hi> and therefore her honour was first lost, and a lesse liberall subiection was bound vpon her so much more surely.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the husband is the <hi>head of the wife, as Christ is of his Church:</hi> and therefore as the members are subiect to the head without reasoning,<note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> so should the wife be vnto her husband: he prouideth for all, answeareth for all, defendeth all as the head: and doth not he best deserue the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence? hath not nature giuen the highest place and prerogatiue vnto the head, and were it not most vnnaturall, that the wife by seeking for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie and rule ouer her husband, should set the head vnder the feet? And further, by this superioritie he becommeth the <hi>image of God</hi> vnto his wife, and his lawfull commandements haue a stampe of God set vpon the thing commanded; and therefore she must signifie that she hath a feeling of him in her heart, as the image of Gods maiestie, glorie, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie; through her whole behauiour in a meeke and quiet spirit, shewing her selfe the glorie of the man, respecting his authoritie as the Lords, his will as the Lords in right and lawfull commands: against which if she rebell, shee riseth vp against the Lord himselfe.</p>
               <p>In these regards especially the Apostle concludeth this dutie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, Col. 3.18. <hi>wiues be subiect to your husbands,</hi> that is, yeeld your selues vnto the will, direction, and discretion of your husbands: for <hi>it is meete,</hi> or comely, namely, in regard 1. of the law of nature: 2. of Gods institution after the fall: 3. the husbands headship: and 4. womanly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie. Neither is it onely meete, but so necessarie, as where it is not performed, it cannot be but the family should be laid open to ruine and downefall: no otherwise then if the feete should refuse to goe, the eye to looke, the hands to take the things which the head commandeth, the whole man must needes perish. All which considerations, take away all the friuolous obiections of women for exemption from this so naturall and necessarie a dutie.<note place="margin">Obiections to beare off the duties friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</note> Some plead, they are yoked to foolish Naballs: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are matched to such as neuer consider their paines and kindnesse, and not meeting with that kind and thankefull retribution from their husband which they expect, take themselues freed from such strict ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruance: others could loue their husbands passing well, were it not for such or such a bad qualitie: and others are tyed to frampoll or conceited
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:18792:204"/>
persons, and so drawe conclusions both of their vnfitnesse to gouerne, and the inconueniences of their owne subiection. But against all these reasonings, which are so vnreasonable, as that they directly fight with Gods ordinance, and that order which he hath put in nature, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth nor of such exceptions: here is a cannon of batterie: Thou must and maist before thy marriage consider, whether he be a wise man or a foole, but after thou must knowe he is thy husband, which if he be, thou must be subiect, ouer whome (be it that he be a foole, and thou wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then he) thou maist affect no rule, but knowing still thy place, by thy goodnesse, wisedome, counsell, and perswasion, if it may be, preuent his or thy hurt, as Abigail did. As for his vnworthinesse, whatsoeuer it may be in thine eies, yet the Lord depriueth him not of his worthinesse to rule ouer thee, who hast entred into the marriage league with him. And for his vnfitnesse, he cannot be so vnfit to gouerne thee, as thou art to gouerne him, who wert taken to be an helpe, and not an head vnto him; and a monstrous thing were it in nature, for the feete to direct the head.</p>
               <p>But that women should obey their husbands, none are so rude,<note place="margin">Wherein must wiues be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</note> as not in generall to acknowledge: but come to particulars, as 1. wherein, 2. the manner how, there growes some question. The former the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle answereth, Eph. 5.24. Wiues be subiect <hi>in all things:</hi> that is, in all lawfull and bonest things: in all which, there must be a departure from their owne wills, if a contrarie commandement proceed from the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, yea euen in those things which may seeme to be her peculiar for the gouernment and keeping of his house, whether in his absence or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, she must administer according to his minde, and direction. For so the members of the bodie are subiect to the head, each doth his owne dutie, yet all by the appointment of the head, mooue or rest themselues. And thus the Church dispenseth to the sonnes of God, the children of the Church, all necessaries for their direction, consolation, and saluation; but yet by the prescript and order of Christ the head, and not any thing without his appointment: and no more is the wife to administer (no not in the absence of her husband) against, or contrarie to his minde. Looke vp to the heauens, and verie nature will teach this lesson; while the sunne is absent, the moone takes vpon her, gouerneth the heauens, and shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth aboue all the starres, but yet not without the borrowing of all this light from the sunne, if Philosophie teach vs truely; but when the sunne is present, she giueth place, contracteth her light, and reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him after a sort by vayling her face at his presence, vpon whom she wholly dependeth: and thus should it be with the wife, when the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band presenteth himselfe, whether in person, or in his commandement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:18792:205"/>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Whether the wife may dispose of goods without her husband consent to good vses?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is no question but she may. 1. of any goods before marriage excepted. 2. of those her husband giueth her after marriage: for these also are proper goods, and not common. 3. If she haue gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall consent, when his heart trusteth in her, and referreth in generall things to her discretion. 4. If she haue implicit consent, when her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band knoweth she giueth, and holdeth his peace. 5. In extreame necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for often the case suffereth not to expect his consent. 6. In the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnesse of the husband to gouerne, as suppose he be striken with frensie, and madnes; for then the disposing of things is deuolued vpon her. 7. In his longer absence, as suppose he be a souldier, marchant, or seafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man. 8. Of that she can well saue of her husbands allowance; or procure by her labour aboue that her husband enioyneth. 9. That she getteth naughtily, she ought to dispose it to the owners, or to the poore, though he should forbid her; because neither she nor he hath right thereunto. The Casuists adde other cases which are more questionable. But the question is of such goods as are common between them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she may dispose of them to any vse without his consent. And the common answer is negatiue, and sundrie reasons propounded. Which as I will not conclude against, so neither can I wholly assent vnto, for these reasons, which I propound to be further considered of.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas one cheife ground of that opinion is, that the wife hath no more but <hi>vse</hi> of her husbands goods: I take it she hath also a right and interest in them. For marriage, which maketh the person of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the wiues, maketh his goods much more; so that as she hath not vse only, but right and power of his bodie; so also hath she not only an vse, but a right and possession in his goods. Againe, if she haue onely vse of them, wherein is her preferment aboue the children and seruants, who haue vse of them aswell as she. Further, the husband is bound to impart and make his wealth common with his wife, as Christ imparted his heart blood vpon the Church, which the Church hath a state and interest in: the which interest for any to debarre the Church of, were to withhold her from her right.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the wife is as necessarily bound by God to shew mercie as well as the husband;<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> the precept is generall, <hi>to doe good forget not, and to distribute.</hi> She must therefore exercise her faith in the practise of good workes as well as he, though her husband forbid her, whom she is to obey only in the Lord: what if he should command her not to heare the word, praie, and goe to Church, or the like: and the case is not vnlike, seeing mercie is more acceptable then sacrifice, and euery way as necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:18792:205"/>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> It will be here said, that we may not doe euill to doe good withall; or giue of that which is not our owne. <hi>Answ.</hi> It is the question whether it be euill or no. And she giueth of that which she hath right and state in euen to dispose, but in no other vse then in workes of mercie, as present need requireth, and that with wisedome and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so as she neither impouerish her husband, weaken his estate, nor wrong her own familie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we haue examples of godly women: for to let passe the fact of Abigail,<note place="margin">Calv. in 1. Sam. homil. 90.</note> that was (as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> saith) extraordinarie, in that God did inwardly and specially direct her in that strait; and the case was of present necessitie to saue the liues of the whole family: and further her husband Nabal, was not only froward but drunke all that daie, and not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted withall, 1. Sam. 25.16.36.<note place="margin">Luk. 8.3.</note> The examples of Ioanna the wife of Cuza, and Susanna, and many other godly women, were not so extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, who ministred to Christ of their substance: to say here they had the consent of their husbands, is but to insist in the question without proofe; and it is most probable, their husbands were not so forward, especially Cuza, who was Herods steward, in likelihood was of Herods mind. Most expressely Salomon saith of euery vertuous woman, that she stretcheth out her hand to the poore, Prov. 31.20.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the most learned deciders of cases among the Papists, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and determine that the wife in this case may do that which the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ought to do, but will not: as if she know much of his goods ill got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, which ought to be restored, she may giue more liberally: whereby so farre as she can, she laboureth to heale his error; and witholdeth Gods iudgement from her selfe, in participating in his goods.</p>
               <p>It is obiected, that the vowe of the wife may not stand without her husbands consent, at least implicite, and therefore she may not dispose of inferiour things without it. To which may be answered, that this is a ruled case by expresse commandement, not deniable by any, as the other is not. Besides, it is an vnlike case, seeing vowes are voluntarie, and in the power or choise of the vower, to vowe or not to vowe; but so are not works of mercie, which are commanded, and necessarie duties.</p>
               <p>It is alleadged, that partners may doe nothing without mutuall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. But that is answered, because here steppeth in a superiour power, to which both of them must stoope, euen a commandement of mercie, and charitie, to the wife, as well as the husband, and includeth that the wife must haue wherewithall to be charitable as well as the husband.</p>
               <p>It is alleadged, that her desire must be subiect vnto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; he shall rule: but all such allegations drawne from his headship and authoritie, stand onely in indifferent and ciuill things, which a mercifull and necessarie
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:18792:206"/>
releefe is not: for we say that she is in a ciuill manner subiected vnto him, and to his power, and may not dispose of any part of his goods at her pleasure to any ciuill vse; as to giue away to her friends, to spend vpon other other outward vses. But yet is she not after such a seruile manner put vnder his power, as that vpon no occasion whatsoeuer, shee may not dispose of any part of the goods, which by the right of marriage are common betweene them.</p>
               <p>It is further alleadged, that the Shunamite did not entertaine the Prophet,<note place="margin">2. king. 4.9.</note> but first she asked her husband. I answer, it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendable part for the wife to seeke her husbands consent in euerie thing; but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, where such consent cannot be had: besides, one thing it is to giue a mercifull releefe; and an other for the wife to bring a man into the house to diet and lodge him; which this woman might not doe, without the consent of the husband; for though there was a mercifull releefe of the Prophet of God in it, yet there was more it beeing a mixt action, in one part of which the husband must haue a chiefe stroake.</p>
               <p>It is further alleadged, that by ciuill lawes the wife may neither let, nor sell, nor borrow without her husband, and therefore neither may she giue. I answer, these are ciuill actions, wherein the husband as the head must giue direction: but mercifully to giue an almes, is a religious action: besides, the lawes state the wife in a great part of the husbands goods and lands, and prouideth by giuing her a ioynture, or her thirds, that the husband may not depriue her of her right therein: neither by lawe can a man sell his lands simply, vnlesse the wife will giue vp her thirds, which plainly stateth her in a right vnto the goods and lands aboue the seruants and children: the deniall of which, as I said at first, is the maine ground of the former opinion.</p>
               <p>Other obiections I haue met with not worth the answering, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will not stand longer vpon this question, leauing it to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red further of, crauing that wiues would be carefull in subiection to God and their husbands, not to stretch these grounds beyond the rules and ends propounded.</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> And here commeth another question to be resolued, whether the husband may beate his wife, to force her vnto this subiection? <hi>Ans.</hi> It seemeth no,<note place="margin">Husbands may not beat their wiues.</note> although some of reckoning be of the other opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For, 1. there is no word or example for it in Scripture. 2.

Where thou canst not beare (prouiding that offence by all possible good meanes be auoided, and publike peace not interrupted) the next remedie is the Magistrate: but between husband and wife, both tyrannicall rule, and compulsiue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ought to be banished. Contrarie to this free subiection, is the common vice of wiues, which is to be proud, as Vashti, not enduring the gouernment of husbands; but by vncomely gestures and vnshame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast lookes, and sometime by hote and bitter answers, bewray the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes of their spirits, when once their owne wills are crossed: farre are they from that meeknes and quietnesse of spirit, which Peter prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, as the most comely attire for women; who ought scarce to giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <q>That the word of God be not euill spoken of.]</q>
               <p>These words containe a generall reason, inforcing the necessarie prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of all the former duties.

And whereas the word is blasphemed, either by the words or deeds of professors, the second is here aimed at: our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle concluding that then the doctrine of the Gospel is blasphemed, when the life of the professor is not tuned vnto that doctrine.

Such is the malice of the deuill, and his instruments, that hating God himselfe, they turne whatsoeuer they can, against God and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his truth, which is a light discouering their darkenes. Hence doe they not so much maligne the person of a poore professor, who perhaps neuer made nor medled with them, as the light and truth shining in him; yea let God touch one of their familiars, and call him out of such a poisoned companie, that person is presently hated and despised for the truth, which if he did not now hold out, they would loue and embrace as formerly they did: and consequently a professor by his error, calleth not so much disgrace and malice against his owne person, as against the truth: for let any but a professor sinne, the more would the sinners of the world loue them as their owne; but if any such offend, or steppe awry, easily shall a man perceiue where the bile is, oh (say they) this is a goodly profession indeede, which giueth them leaue to doe this or that, and exclaime as though the profession were not of God, because the professors shewe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> themselues to be but men. Secondly, the Lord imputeth this sinne not so much to them who doe blaspheme the truth, who are the actors of this sinne, as they who are the moouers and occasioners of the same: Ezech. 36.20. <hi>when they entred among the heathen, they polluted my name:</hi> that is, the heathen diligently watched the words and behauiours of my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because they beare my name, and came as it were out of my schoole; but my people beeing not so carefull of my name which was called vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> blasphemed it, iustly causing others so to do. Although therfore men may conceiue that by their bare profession they endanger themselues, yet indeede the dishonour returneth vpon God and his Gospel: euen as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid might thinke that he onely sinned against Vriah, Bathshebe, and his owne soule, yet the Lord telleth him that his sinne was yet more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> infectious, in that he had made Gods enemies to blaspheme. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what a iust disgrace is it for the profession of Christ, to haue such hangbyes, as whose liues speake, that either they knowe not, or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not, or affect not, or neglect, yea despise that doctrine by which they expect saluation.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Let euery professor examine his life whether it bring honour or discredit to the Gospel,<note place="margin">Matth. 5 16. 2.

No meruaile then is it that the Lord is so ielous in the sinnes
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:18792:207"/>
of such men who come neere him, and in whome he looketh to be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; that although he forgiue their sinne wherein they dishonour his name, yet for the maintenance of his glorie, he will visit it in the eyes of men, with the rods of men; whereof we haue a pregnant example euen in Dauid himselfe, 2. Sam. 12.14. And whosoeuer they be who belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to God, hath iustly giuen aduantage to the aduersarie, it will sit neer him, and gnawe his heart euen when the sinne is forgiuen, yea trouble and afflict his soule more then all the afflictions which can besides be laid vpon him.

Isa. 52.5. he could not endure his enemies the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, but would bring his people from among them, because in their try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph ouer them, they blasphemed his name. 2.

               </p>
               <p>Againe, if thou considerest thy selfe, 1. as a professor, then art thou set vpon a scaffold, many eyes are vpon thee, and after a more publike <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> manner thou standest or fallest vnto many others, and not to thy selfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. 2.

be drunke, ouergrowne with couetousnesse, riot, be loose and filthie in speach, impure or vncleane in action, it is their guise, it were no discredit to the Gospel in comparison, for they are strangers and straglers from the Church: but for a professor to be couetous, wrangling, sitting with drunkards, &amp;c. oh this is a stayning of their whole house. And therefore we may with Dauid wish, that either there were no such Sauls, or that they might liue and die obscurely, that their waies might neuer be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at Gath, nor their courses published in Askelon, that no vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised might reioyce at their falls, nor any Papist finde such advantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our doctrine of free iustification by faith alone in any professor, who in practise will be prophane as Esau was. A great argument it is to keepe many wretches from hainous attempts, least they staine their blood and blemish the house of their fathers; how much more should euerie Christian rising out of the most honourable blood that euer the sun saw, beware of accounting this blood profane?</p>

               <p>This worthie doctrine may not be passed without particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the seuerall estates and degrees of men.

Dissimulation is spunne with a fine thread, vpon the loome of an hypocriticall heart; but the web of it is like the Gentlewomans cobweb lawne, which is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for shew then vse.

Such as these who are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then bryars, I would aduise to keepe them in the wast, and come not within Gods garden, which is no place for them, nor within the pale of Christian profession, for the Lord will not hold them guiltlesse who thus take his name in vaine, and the axe and the fire will meete them, if they stand in the grounds of this good husbandman. Thirdly, in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> thing more regard Gods name then thine owne: as one that art taught to praie for the hallowing of Gods name, before forgiuenesse of thy sinne, or thine owne saluation: a man carefully auoideth the branding of his name: he will redeeme and rescue his name if it be hazzarded with all that he is worth, and much more should we doe Gods. Fourthly, tender thine owne credit, not for selfeloue, but for the loue of God; a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> good thing it is to keepe the heart cleane, but so to stand vpon the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the heart, as not regarding the fame that goeth vpon him, is a great sinne: for a good name, especially in a professor, is a very precious oyntment.

                  <note place="margin">Young men must order their waies by the word.</note>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Out of the first point we are taught, that young men must looke to their waies and conteine themselues in their duties, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of whose courses the Lord taketh as good notice as of others. For, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. here the Minister is giuen in charge, to teach them as well as others. Peter must feed lambs, as well as sheepe, and they beeing a great part of the Church, must honour God in their places, as well as the auncient in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> theirs. 2. If the Pastors and teachers haue the ouersight of them, and must as well watch ouer their soules, as others, then must they also for this cause obey them,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> and be submitted vnto them. 3. If the word be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> directed vnto them, as well as others, they as well as others must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by it. But Iohn writeth as well to young men, as the older, and to children,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.</note> aswell as fathers. Salomon aduiseth the young man, <hi>to remember his creator in the daies of his youth:</hi> &amp; Dauid, <hi>to redresse his waies accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine reprehendeth a common error in the world: for generally men thinke that religion and attendance vnto the word, is for old age;<note place="margin">Experience wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth vs to strike on the iron while it is hote: straight a tree while it is a twigge: worke waxe while it is soft: and heale a sore while it is greene.</note> but as for youth, it must sow the wild oates, it must haue his course; young men must settle themselues in the world, and ground their estate first, for other matters they haue day inough before them to mind them in: and from this first error proceeds a worse, that the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this age for most part, is but promises without practise, and those promises but hypocrisies without any soundnesse. But all this is but the wisedome of the flesh, euen sensuall and deuillish, cleane contrarie to Gods wisedome, which vrgeth the young man, if euer he would be set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in a good estate, to found it in the remembrance of God: and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the question how a mans life should be rightly ordered, propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it in the <hi>person</hi> of the young man, because that is indeed the age of right reformation. For settle the soule vpon his lees of sinnefull lusts, custome in sinning prooueth another nature, and in continuance becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnchangeable, and incorrigible. Let a man through his youth set his face against heauen, and blaspheme the religion of God, it shall be as hard for a blackmoore to chang his skin, or the leopard his spottes, as for such a one who hath beene accustomed to euill,<note place="margin">Ier. 13.23.</note> to learne to do well: for the curse is commonly passed against them, who haue beene so long fruitles,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.8.</note> 
                  <hi>neuer more fruit grow vpon thee:</hi> and what other can the ground that bringeth nothing but thornes and bryers expect, but that the end of it should be to be burned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Let this be a motiue vnto all young men, to looke betime to
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:18792:210"/>
the ordering of their waies, and if God call timely, as he did young Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, earely in the morning, beware of running another way, but with him answer, speake Lord, thy seruant heareth: and the better either to perswade them to the obedience of this precept, or else to leaue them the more excuseles in the departure from their dutie, I will 1. by some rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons inforce the dutie:<note place="margin">Reasons to mooue young men to looke timely to their waies.</note> and 2. prescribe some meanes for the more happy practise of the same.</p>
               <p>For the former. First, that age is the haruest and summer, in which whosoeuer sleepeth, is the <hi>sonne of confusion,</hi> but he <hi>that gathereth, is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the child of wisedome.</hi> It is with grace as it is with grafts,<note place="margin">Prou. 10.5.</note> there must be a time of insetting, and a time of outgrowing, and both these must be seasonable, before fruit can be expected: the seed must be sowne in youth, that must come vp in age, nip a blossome in the spring, and where is the hope of autumne? We can conclude that a man borne to nothing, if he idle out his youth, and applie his hands to nothing, is so farre from like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of proouing a rich man; that he cannot escape ragged clothing, (as Salomon speaketh) but needs must hee beare a wallet, and die a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: and how is it that we want wisedome accordingly to conclude, that where Sathan can make youth vnprofitable, little good, nay much spirituall beggarie may be expected, in all other ages through the life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, another reason the Apostle Iohn vseth, <hi>I write vnto you young men, because yee are strong:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 2.14.</note> young men are called out to beare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the heat of the day, because they are in their strength, and are chiefe champions either for good or euill. If then their strength be spent in the practises of pietie and religion, such workes are so much the more excellent, because they are performed with more courage, zeale, strength, and resolution. But if vnto any vice they powre out their strength, or stand the patronage of any sinne, their actions are so much more sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and outragious, by how much they are more violent; wherein although for the time they may reioyce, yet let them know that they shall come vnto iudgement, at what time they must be counteable for all their strength, and the imployment also of it. Againe, in regard of this strength, they are most fit for the spirituall combate: <hi>strength is for warre,</hi> saith Rabsachie, and therefore if they could not heretofore be Preists vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this seruice, yet let them now serue as voluntaries vnder the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Iesus Christ, then any longer abide vnder the colours of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for young men to be early graced, is a beutifull sight in the eyes of God and his children: it filled Paul with ioy to remember <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothies</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> timely faith:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.4, 5.</note> When Christ saw but some ciuill vertues in a <hi>young
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:18792:211"/>
man</hi> (otherwise bewraying many great corruptions) so louely were they vnto him,<note place="margin">Mark. 10.21.</note> that it is said, <hi>he loued him:</hi> When children crie Hosanna, what a great prouocation of the elder sort is it, of which the Lord will make great vse to their shame and conuincement: that as it was a sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rebuke to the Israelites, when Christ said of the Cananite, <hi>surely I haue not found so great faith in Israel:</hi> so shall the elder sort be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, when he shall say, surely I haue not found so great faith, zeale, knowledge, obedience in rulers, fathers, masters, as in prentizes, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, children. Or as he prouoked the Pharisies, <hi>Iohn came in the way of righteousnesse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 21.32.</note> 
                  <hi>and yee beleeued not, the Publicans and harlots beleeued him,</hi> and yet when you saw that, you neither beleeued, nor repented of your vnbeleefe, verely, I say vnto you, that Publicans and harlots shall enter into heauen before you: so shall it be said; The elder sort receiued not the word, but many of the younger sort were diligent hearers; and when the elder saw this, yet repented they not to beleeue it: verily the younger shall be gathered into heauen before the elder, who without timely repentance, shall neuer come there.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, young men had need call their waies to remembrance, that their consciences may haue peace in the testimonie thereof, when they are older: for the vanities of youth vexe the heart many yeares after. Dauid praied against the sinnes of his youth,<note place="margin">Psal. 25.</note> not without a bitter sence and sting of them. It was the voice of Ephraim, Ier. 31.19. <hi>I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed, yea confounded, because I did beare the reproach of my youth:</hi> God may now in thy youth suffer thee for want of knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, to be senceles of thy most grosse sinnes, as Iosephs brethren were; but afterwards if thou belongest vnto him, he will waken thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and make the thought of them as bitter as euer the practise of them was pleasant, when they shall fill thee with trouble of conscience, and make thee call great things into question; yea bring thee not onely to doubt of thy effectuall calling to grace, but almost to despaire of thy saluation, especially if thy sinnes of youth by long continuance be grown into customes, and can hardly therefore be subdued, euen then when thou art conuerted. Wouldest thou be fenced now against all these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terclappes? Now is the time wherein thou maist preuent such afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Nay more, thou maist by drawing neere vnto the Lord, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his yoke in thy youth, laie the foundations of thy comfort in any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affliction, during the daies of thy pilgrimage, as Iob did: the one &amp; thirtieth Chapter of whose booke containeth nothing but a gathering vp of himselfe vnto his comforts, and hopes, through the recalling vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to minde, the innocencie and vprightnesse of the former part of his life: As Hezekiah also did, who when sentence of death had passed from the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:18792:211"/>
mouth of God and his Prophet against him; had no such hold of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort elsewhere, then in calling to mind the innocencie of his life, a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he was in couenant with God, and might looke to see the goodnes of the Lord in the land of the liuing, <hi>Remember Lord,</hi>

                  <hi>how I haue walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for the helpes furthering this dutie.<note place="margin">Helps to the former dutie. Prou. 22.13.</note> 1. Young men must take notice of that great bundle of follie, which is naturally bound vp in their hearts, the corruption of that age beeing such, as needeth not any occasion without it selfe, to cast it downe. 2. That the meanes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it, is the <hi>studie of the Scriptures,</hi> vnto the rules whereof they must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> haue regard, and not to the examples of men.<note place="margin">Psal. 119.9.</note> 3. That if they will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> needs be giuen to imitation, then must they imitate not the most, but the best of that age: such as was young Daniel,<note place="margin">It was a great commendation of Origen, that like another Timothie he learned the Scriptures of a child Euseb. lib. 6. cap 3.</note> who in tender yeares was able to vtter knowledge, Dan. 1.4. young <hi>Samuel,</hi> who so soone as he is weaned, must stand before the Lord, 1. Sam. 1. young <hi>Iosiah,</hi> who at eight yeare old walked vprightly, 2. King. 21. young <hi>Timothy,</hi> who knew the Scriptures of a child; yea of Christ himselfe, who increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in wisedome as in stature; so as at twelue yeares olde he was able to confound the Doctors, and great Rabbies of the Iewes. 4. That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the discouragements they shall meete withall from men, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that they are too forward, soone ripe, and young Saints, &amp;c. they must oppose the Lords good pleasure, who requireth firstlings, first fruites, first borne of man and beast; the first moneth, yea and first day of that moneth, for the celebrating of the passeouer: and delighteth in whole and fat offerings, not in the lame, leane, and blind sacrifices which his soule abhorreth; for of all the sonnes of men, the Lord neuer tooke such pleasure, as in such who were sanctified euen from the wombe. Some of the learned call men to the timely seruice of God, from the allusion of Moses rodde, Exod. 3. and Isaies vision, cap. 9. both of the almond tree, because of all trees that soonest putteth forth her blossomes: how sound that collection is, I will not stand to enquire, onely this is true, that such as would be trees of righteousnesse, and knowne to be of the Lords planting, laden (especially in their age) with the fruites of the spirit, must with the almond tree, timely budde and blossome, and beare, that their whole liues may be a fruitfull course, whereby God may be glorified, and themselues receiue in the ende a more full consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The second point in the verse is, The <hi>manner of teaching</hi> young men, <hi>Exhort young men:</hi> so, 1. Tim. 5.1. <hi>Exhort</hi> old men as fathers, <hi>and young men as brethren.</hi> The scope of the Ministerie is, to draw all men to dutie, and beeing ordained of God out of his singular loue for the
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:18792:212"/>
winning of men, all the duties of it must be performed in such louing manner, as that men may be rather wonne and drawne, then forced ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto; yea euen young men, who for most part are headlesse and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest from dutie, must by the spirit of meeknesse be restored and reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The Pastor must sometimes entreat, where he may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> The Pastor is not alwaies to vrge and vse his authoritie, but sometimes he must lay it downe, and in some cases where he may by the word command, he must rather choose to entreate. Paul in all his epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles seldome commandeth out of his authoritie (although Apostolicall, &amp; aboue the authoritie of ordinarie ministers) but euer almost perswaded &amp; entreated out of his loue. Thus he dealeth with <hi>Philemon</hi> for the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of Onesimus, <hi>Though I haue much libertie to command, yet I rather beseech thee,</hi> ver. 8. For might not he haue commanded a Christian, to remit an iniurie, and receiue a Christian seruant vpon his repentance? and yet he besought him so to doe.<note place="margin">Magis docendo quam iubendo, monendo quam minando. Aug. epist. 64.</note> And thus although we want not power to command men vpon their owne perill, and so fasten Christian duties vpon them; yet we rather <hi>entreate men to be reconciled vnto God:</hi> yea we are to <hi>beseech and exhort</hi> men in the Lord Iesus, that they encrease more and more, &amp;c. 1. Thess. 4.1. And the Scriptures are so delighted with this manner of teaching by exhortation, that the speciall worke of the ministerie is called by this name, Act. 13.15. the men of Antioch came to Paul and Barnabas, and said, If ye haue any <hi>word of exhortation</hi> say on: and yet this word of exhortation was a sermon which they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to heare preached againe the next Sabbath. We heard cap. 1.9. that the Minister must therefore hold fast wholesome doctrine, that he may be <hi>able to exhort,</hi> as though this were all he had to doe.</p>
               <p>But here must be great wisedome and circumspection vsed; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Minister is often to turne his power into prayers, and threats into entreaties, yet must be beware that he so lay not downe his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as that the word loose any, but abide still a word of power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; obseruing wisely to this purpose these two rules. 1. So to exhort as that the consciences of men may conclude, that euen there where he perswadeth and entreateth, he hath power to command and terrifie, though in his loue he lay downe that power for the present. 2. That he doe not there exercise lenitie, where the case requireth seueritie, nor mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse when the case requireth the worke of seruent zeale. As, <hi>first,</hi> where sinne waxeth bold, the Minister must put on boldnesse. If a calfe stand before Moses, it is a case wherein the mildest man vpon the earth, must forget his meekenesse, and cloath himselfe with zeale for the glorie of God. Sometimes the Minister is to deliuer the word as it were in a soft and still voice; and sometimes he must change his coppie, and lift vp his
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:18792:212"/>
voice like a trumpet, to shewe Iudah his sinne, and the people of God their transgression. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when admonition and exhortation will not serue to cut off sinne, but there is rather a reioycing in it. Here Paul himselfe will put on his authoritie, 1. Cor. 5.2. &amp; 13. <hi>put away from you that wicked man. Thirdly,</hi> when the ministerie is, or is like to be drawne into contempt, then especially must it put on power, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. This was the practise of the Apostles, who were forced often (part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the low estimation of the simple and ignorant, who esteemed of the preaching of the Gospel but as foolishnes; and partly by the maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous oppositions of the false Apostles, who depraued their ministerie as weake and vnlearned) to be long in the challenging of their calling, power, and authoritie: see 2. Cor. 10.2.8. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Ministers must labour wisely to discerne betweene persons and actions, as Ioseph did betweene the persons and causes of Pharaohs butler and baker, and speake differently to the tractable and stubborne: children and seruants must not be dealt with alike. Christ spake not to the Priests and people alike: nor Iohn Baptist to the Iewes and Scribes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: nor Paul to the Galatians and Ephesians alike: but Gods mouth must separate the pretious from the vile:<note place="margin">Iude 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Compassion must be had vpon some,</hi> but not all, others must with feare be pulled out of the fire; neither may the Publican and Pharisie looke for the same sentence and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 2. Whereas men cannot endure preachers, who leaue exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to thunder out damnation; let them know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if their sinnes be growne bold as an harlot, and the word of meeknes cannot preuaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, we must then come with a rodde, and not the spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: otherwise as Christ was most meek in his life and doctrine, so should his Ministers be also.</p>
               <p>The third point in the verse, is the vertue commended to the practise of young men, and that is, the grace of sobrieeie, which moderateth the <hi>minde</hi> in the lusts and affections in generall: and is not to be restrained to that outward sobrietie, which is opposed to intemperance in meat and drinke: for it is taken for graunted, that intemperance must be nipt in the head, and broken in the shell, before it be hatched and outwardly produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the life. This appeareth, 2. Tim. 2.22. where Paul in other words prescribeth the same dutie vnto Timothie, <hi>flie the lusts of youth:</hi> not meaning thereby such vncleannes and lasciuious filthinesse where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with gracelesse young men were carried away, for Timothie was now of such grauitie as befitted an Euangelist, but he would preuent in him all that violent course and carriage of affections, vnto which that hotter age is more propense; not fearing that Timothie would breake out into filthy vncleannes of lusts so much, as least his youth should carrie him to rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

                  <note place="margin">Meanes of practise.</note>Now the meanes to attaine this vertue. <hi>First,</hi> beginne at the heart, <hi>be sober minded,</hi> get an humble heart, which will frame to an humble carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in behauiour, speech, apparell: for the smalnesse of a man in his own eyes crosseth those ouerweenings, and ouerdeemings of youth, whereby
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:18792:213"/>
they thinke they knowe more, can doe more, and better then the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; it will make them suspect all their counsells, which if Rhehobams young men had done, they had preuented that great rent of the kingdom at that time: it will make them sit silent before the elder, and suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be lead by their experience. <hi>Secondly,</hi> consider that these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> lusts are great sinnes, though they neuer breake out into externall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which naturall men see not so to be, and therefore not seeing the vglinesse and bitternes of them, cannot come to detest them. And this is the reason, that they are swallowed lightly and carelesly of the most, and men take entire acquaintance with them, because Sathan and our owne corruption haue caused vs to tast little else then the apparant sweetnesse of them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because Dauid taketh it for graunted, that these fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> lusts must be cleansed by the word, thou must be subiected vnto the word, which as pure water washeth the soule from such impure lusts: and this is when the spirit by meanes of the word rippeth vp the secrets of a mans heart, discouereth the loathsomenesse of such ghests as haue taken vp the roome, causeth him to flie them, and himselfe for them, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth some newe strength to purge this filthie stie and vncleane cage of his, by mortifying his flesh and the lusts of it: with the word therefore ioyne effectuall prayer, for the powerfull working of the spirit, Psal. 51.10.11. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> fence thy selfe with the feare of God, that beeing once <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> washed, thou maist not returne againe to foolishnesse; the feare of God onely is a welspring of life, to make a man auoide the snares of death. It kept Ioseph a young man from sinning against God, bridled Dauid from hurting Saul when it was in his power; restrained Ionathan from selfe loue, 1. Sam. 20.13, 14. To the same purpose maketh that counsel of the Apostle, 2. Tim. 2.22. <hi>flie the lusts of youth:</hi> Timothie might aske how should I be able, the answer followeth, <hi>followe after righteousnesse, &amp;c.</hi> that is, get to thee such vertues as may be speciall preseruatiues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, among the which the feare of God is most excellent, for beeing the beginning of wisdome, it teacheth wisedome to looke vnto, and order the heart, in the first risings and motions of any lust. <hi>Fifthly,</hi>

               </q>
               <p>Hauing propounded the seuerall precepts fitted to all ages of men and women, the last whereof was vnto young men, our Apostle here inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a precept vnto Titus himselfe: whence it is probably gathered, that <hi>Titus</hi> was now a young man, as <hi>Timothie</hi> also was, in the same office of an Euangelist:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.12.</note> and beeing a Minister, in him he closely againe institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth euery Minister, notwithstanding he hath beene most ample in that argument; as though Ministers could neuer sufficiently be instructed. In these two verses, we will consider two things, 1. a precept: 2. an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of it. The precept is, That Titus <hi>shew himselfe an example to</hi> others: for as all the persons formerly taught, so more especially the last sort, namely young men for the slipperines of their age, need the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of good example aswell as good doctrine and counsell. And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation is enlarged, by setting downe wherein Titus must become an example: which is done, <hi>First,</hi> more generally, <hi>In all things</hi>; we read it, <hi>aboue all things:</hi> others <hi>aboue all men:</hi> which readings may be true, and grounds of good instruction, but I take the first aptest to the place. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by a more particular enumeration of shining vertues: as, 1. <hi>vncorrupt doctrine:</hi> 2. good life fruitfull in <hi>good workes:</hi> and these not one or two, or now and then in good moods, but there must be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant trading in them throughout a <hi>graue</hi> and <hi>pure</hi> conuersation. 3. there must be ioyned gratious speaches and <hi>words</hi>; for I take it fitliest interpreted of priuate communication, described by two necessarie adiuncts:<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> 1. it must be wholesome, 2. <hi>vnblameable,</hi> or not liable to <hi>reproofe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inforcement of the precept, is taken from the end or fruit of it, which is twofold, 1. <hi>shame,</hi> 2. <hi>silence</hi> to the <hi>withstanders,</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers. And thus the generall scope of the verses is, as if he had more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, That this thy doctrine, O <hi>Titus,</hi> thus aptly applied to all sorts of men, may carrie more weight and authoritie with it; see thou that (considering thou art set in a more eminent place, and clearer sunne, and hast all eyes beholding and prying into thee) thou shew thy selfe a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and expresse type wherein men may behold all these graces shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in thine owne life: let them looke in thy glasse, and see the liuely image of a graue and pure conuersation, which may allure them to the loue of the doctrine which thou teachest; let them heare from thy mouth in thy priuate conferences and speach, nothing but what may worke them to soundnesse; at the least, keepe thou such a watch ouer thy tongue, as that nothing passe thee which may be reprehended: and hence will it come to passe, that although thou hast many maliciously minded men, seeking by all meanes to oppose thy doctrine and life; and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:18792:214"/>
to destroie the one by the other, these shall either be put to silence, and haue nothing to say: or if they take boldnesse to speake any thing, it beeing vniust, the shame shall be remooued from thee, and fall iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon themselues; and all the reproach shall returne home to their owne doores.</p>
               <p>In the precept I will briefly note one or two things, because all the particulars of it haue beene handled in the former Chapter. In generall therefore obserue, that</p>
               <p>

                     <p>Concent of good life and good doctrine make a sweete harmonie in a Minister.</p>
                     <p>The priest might not come to the temple without the sound of his bells.</p>
                  </note> as the latter may be a strong eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the former, and both of them exemplarie to his people in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuate. First, there must be <hi>doctrine,</hi> else let his life be neuer so good, it is a dumbe shewe, <hi>should not the sheepheard feede the flocke,</hi> saith the Lord? the first thing in that strait charge to Timothie, <hi>is to preach the word, to be instant in season, out of season:</hi> herein is the Minister a debter vnto God, 1. Cor. 9.16. a necessitie is laid vpon me, and woe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me if I preach not the Gospel: a debter also vnto his people, Rom. 1.14. and therefore as much as in him lyeth, he must make conscience of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging this debt.</p>
               <p>And this consideration by the way, may put ignorant and dumbe ministers in minde of their wofull estate, in that they want these letters of orders, whereby the Apostle prooueth himselfe to be a Minister of God: 2. Cor. 6.7. among other notes whereby he iustifieth himselfe to be an approoued Minister of God, this is one, that he carried <hi>the word of truth.</hi> And againe, it stoppeth the mouthes of many ignorant people, that plead strongly against themselues in the want of a preaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: We are well enough, we haue an honest and peaceable man, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not preach indeede, but he liues as well, and doth as much good as if he preached, we would not change him for the best preacher of them all. But where is this harmonie of doctrine and life in such a one? know we not, that the best liues of the best men, are but seruants and attendants to their doctrine, and like the miracles of Christ, which serued to prepare, confirme, prouoke, and condemne, but conuerted not the beholders? this is the worke of the Gospel in the ministerie of it, which is the power of God to the saluation of euerie beleeuer. Was it euer heard that a dumbe Minister by his life conuerted a soule to God? and what is his life, but a liuing out of a lawfull calling? an iniurious robbing men of their goods, which he before God hath no right vnto? and a cruell murthering of their soules for want of knowledge? And if the question were made to me, whether good doctrine or good life might better be spared in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, I should answer readily, that to preach well, and liue ill, were farre
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:18792:215"/>
better, and more eligible, then to liue honestly, and not to preach, seeing the former bringeth ruine vpon himselfe alone, this latter both vpon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as there must be good doctrine, so there must be good life too, for a Minister may not thinke he hath done enough, when he hath taught others, if himselfe yet remaine vntaught: like some statue which pointeth the way to passengers, but it selfe standeth a stocke still and mooues not: but he must first be a good man, and then teach others so to be. In the old Testament, the Priest must first be cleansed himselfe, and then cleanse others: first wash himselfe, and then sprinkle others, first sanctifie himselfe, and then others: so in the new, we must first become lights our selues, and then enlighten others, first approach neere God our selues, and then bring others before him: for this is the propertie of a good sheepheard, to goe before his sheepe, that they may followe him. But all this while we may not thinke that the authoritie of the word stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the good or bad life of men, which hath a better bottome of his owne to stand vpon, but yet it is a further seale of the truth of it vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the simple, and that sundrie wayes, which I will not stand vpon.</p>
               <p>These two make a sweete harmonie, especially within a mans owne conscience, when he can appeale vnto his fellow-ministers, as Paul to Timothie,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.10.</note> and say, <hi>you haue fully knowne my doctrine, my manner of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing, &amp;c.</hi> and vnto the consciences of Gods people, calling them to witnesse <hi>both of his painfull preaching,</hi> 1. Thess. 2.9. as also of his holy and vnblameable behauiour, vers. 10. yea euen vnto Gods tribunall, with much comfort at the ende of his dayes, as Paul did, Act. 20.19.20.26. Which two as they must conspire, so the minister is to be an example in both, 1. Tim. 4.12. be an example in <hi>word, conuersation,</hi> &amp;c. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were as lights vpon hills, as starres in the heauens. Pastors are called to be <hi>patternes to their flockes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 5 3.</note> the great Pastor of the sheepe our Lord Iesus, set himselfe a coppie vnto all Christians, both in holy doctrine, and in blessed example of life.<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.15.</note> Great is the force of godly example, especially in the Pastor, both to the beleeuer, to prouoke him, and to the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, either to bring him to a liking of the religion of God, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him, who hath both seen &amp; heard, &amp; yet hath not beleeued; euen as Noah condemned the old world by making of the Arke: which are the reasons, why the Lord hath euer scattered some of his children here and there, a saint or two euen in Neroes house, a Lot in Sodome; and as a lilly riseth vp sometimes among thornes, so doe the sonnes of God in the midst of a froward generation, that they might shine as purer lights in the darkenes of the world round about them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. These are true notes to discerne a true Minister by pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:18792:215"/>
and holy life. If you consult with a Papist, he will decypher you one of his Priests, by his mitre, crosyer staffe, copes, and other garments; by his oyntings, shauings, &amp;c. which indeede are markes of the beast: but not a word of life and doctrine, whence we know them to be theeues not entring in by the doore, but by the window, to robbe and steale. 2. This requireth the presence and residence of the minister with his flocke; for if hee be ordinarily absent, how can he be an example vnto them? Thirdly, it proclaimeth woe vpon them, who by contrarie practise to their preaching, giue occasion of stumbling to the people, as Elies sonnes did: better it were that such had neuer beene borne, then so to strengthen the hands of sinners, besides that by his owne mouth he shall be iudged. Fourthly, it stirreth vp the men of God to care of their liues:<note place="margin">Reasons to stir vp the men of God to care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their liues.</note> to which we in this calling might be mooued by sundrie other strong reasons. 1. We stand before God, and therefore we must put off our shooes, wash and cleanse our selues. Ier. 15.19. <hi>If thou turne, thou shalt stand before <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> mee.</hi> 2. We shall be better enabled to our duties, both because God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>teacheth his secrets to his seruants the Prophets:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Amos 3.7.</note> as also the doctrine shal be more acceptable, and lesse excepted against. Herod heard Iohn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was a good man. 3. We else pull the sinnes of many vpon vs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and harden a number in the same sinnes; the wicked Iewes could alleadge the Priests examples for their Idolatrie, Ier. 44.17. and Ioh. 7.48. <hi>Doe any of the Rulers and Pharisies beleeue in him?</hi> 4. He that diuorceth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> godly life from pure doctrine, <hi>shall be the least,</hi> that is, haue no place <hi>in the kingdome of heauen.</hi> Fifthly, it teacheth all hearers to take benefite by the examples of their teachers, who labour faithfully in the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them: for must we studie to shew our selues examples in vaine? Philip. 3.17. <hi>Brethren, be followers of me:</hi> and 4.9. <hi>The things which yee haue heard and seene in me, those things doe.</hi> Heb. 13.7. Remember them <hi>that haue the ouersight of you, whose faith follow, considering what hath beene the end of their conuersation.</hi> The examples of the godly are called a <hi>cloud of witnesses,</hi> to put vs in minde,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here we must be put in mind to go one step beyond ordinarie: for many cast their eyes vpon the examples of their Ministers, to spie if they can obtaine some libertie to the flesh, through their frailtie: but if they cannot, the most thinke it sufficient that they can commend them for good men, and goe no further: whereas they ought to be transformed into the pattern, not only of our doctrine, but euen of our liues so farre as

To beware of sinne, in regard of God, and of conscience, and not onely in regard of men: the conscience must hate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sinne, because God hateth it, and not because men will crie out against some sinnes. And this will bring a man to obey God in all things, euen in one commandement, as well as another: which he must doe that must liue without reproofe, for he must hate <hi>all the waies of falsehood.</hi> Notable is that place to this purpose, Psal. 119.6. <hi>Then shall not I be confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when I haue respect to all thy commandements.</hi> 2.

Whence we may note three points. First, that no Minister be he neuer so iust, and faithfull in his Ministerie, of neuer such sanctitie and holinesse of life, but he shall meete with opposites and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers. 2. That their qualitie is to seek nothing more then how to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen their mouths against them. 3.

The case is clearer then needeth proofe. How the Prophets were entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, our Sauiour sheweth by that speach to the Iewes, <hi>which of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue not your Fathers persecuted, and slaine?</hi> Moses was often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted by all the people, and before he shall goe scot-free, his owne bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and sister shall withstand him; and as he was <hi>resisted by Iannes and Iambres,</hi> so in all ages to the end <hi>men of corrupt mindes,</hi>

If it was thus to the greene tree, we shall need seeke no further what was done to the drie, but rather to enquire into the reason hereof, and that is this; so long as there is a Deuil, darknes, and death in mens soules, so long will there be resistance vnto God, his light, and life, in whomsoeuer it is: the Deuil not only suggesting, but working effectually in the hearts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and naturall men, to withstand Gods worke, as Sanballat and Tobiah vsed all meanes to hinder the building of Ierusalem: and so do his instruments, <hi>the spirits of Deuils, goe about the world</hi> to prouoke men vnto warre against Christ, and his little flock.<note place="margin">Rev. 16.14.</note> Those spirits of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils are gracelesse and wicked men, carried by deuillish motion and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence against Christ and his kingdome: and the battaile betweene Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael and his Angels, and the Deuil and his angels,<note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note> shall not cease <hi>till time be no more.</hi>

It went cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant in court and countrie, that <hi>Elias troubled all Israel:</hi> Amaziah accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Amos to the king, that the land <hi>is not able to beare all his words:</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orrephes not onely withstood the Apostle Iohn, but <hi>pratled against him. Quest.</hi> But what is the reason of all this, haue they any cause giuen them? <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason is partly positiue in themselues, &amp; partly negatiue in the other. In themselues, 1. the malice of their heart is such, as cannot but continually out of the abundance thereof, set their tongues a worke: the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> fire within sendeth out such smoake abroad. 2. With this malice is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned exceeding pride and swelling, which mooueth them to seeke the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of themselues, although with the fall of others, and make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of others as a ladder for themselues to climbe by: for this ende did the false Apostles account of Christs Apostles, as <hi>the filth and offscou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:18792:218"/>
of the world,</hi> that is, most base and abiect persons. 3. With this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and pride is ioyned exceeding subtiltie and pollicie in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.13.</note> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> well knowe they, that they haue gotten euer more conquest by the stroaks of their tongues then of their hands, and seldome haue they failed of their purposes. For 1. hauing a notable facultie to insinuate into great mens fauours, as Rehum and Shimsai, they would not hinder <hi>the kings tribute,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezr. 4.13.14.</note> 
                  <hi>nor see the kings dishonour:</hi> they make no bones of letting fall two or three vntruthes in a fewe lines to the king; for what hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had it beene to the kings tribute, what impeachment of his honour to haue builded the Temple, and established Gods true worship in Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem? but thus got they their purpose by insinuation and lyes, which by their owne force they could not doe. 2. As they can coyne of their own, so they haue a notable dexteritie to depraue euen innocencie it selfe. Is it not wonderfull that the famous harbenger of Christ, then whome in his time a greater was not borne of women: no nor yet Christ himselfe, could so carrie themselues, but that the one must needes be counted a demoniake,<note place="margin">Luk. 7.33.34.</note> and the other a glutton, drunkard, and friend of sinners? Who then can looke to escape? and if they hereby obtaine not their whole purpose, yet loose they not all, hauing learned that cursed rule of Machiauel,<note place="margin">Calumniare au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacter saltem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid haerebit.</note> that if they speake their pleasure, some ill conceit will sticke in the mindes of men, which will be worth their labour. Now the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue reason in good men themselues, why their withstanders speake euill of them, is set downe, 1. Pet. 4.4. <hi>Because yee runne not with them to the same excesse of riot, therefore speake they euill of you:</hi> dissimilitude of manners causeth the vngodly by all meanes banish the faithfull out of the world, they may seeke a newe world for themselues to liue in if they will: if they should walke in such courses as the Apostle Peter reckoneth vp in the 3. verse of the cited chapter, and in such a blacke darkenesse, as did not reprehend theirs, they could well enough giue them the right hand of fellowship, but if men will be so precise, as that the high way cannot hold them; they cannot away with such singularitie.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Take here a note of a false religion, which commonly is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by bitternes of word, writing, rayling, and reproaches: consider here the Popish writers dealing with Protestants, putting off euen huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie it selfe, and all but the image of the deuill, which standeth in malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lying and accusing of the brethren. The heate also and bitternesse of the Germaine diuines, beeing farre aboue that which becommeth bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, maketh not vnto, but against the goodnes of their causes. Oh that we could all remember, that Christs kingdome is peaceable, himselfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structeth with all meekenesse, perswadeth, intreateth, seldome threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and neuer was his voice heard in the streets: the spirit descending
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:18792:218"/>
vpon him like a doue, sheweth how farre he was from bitternes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. 2. This inseparable qualitie of withstanders sheweth, that to speake euill of professors, is to withstand the truth: so is the boldnesse of such, who taxe Ministers discountenancing sinne as too bold, to whom sinne may be bold enough before it meete with an angrie countenance from them. In a word therefore, let vs take vp that vse which Christ rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of this doctrine, <hi>Let wisedome be iustified of all her children.</hi>

Because they watch occasions to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So out of their malice we shall draw our owne good: and thus it shall be true which the heathen saide, that the enemie often hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth lesse, and profiteth more then many friends. 3. What a glorie is it for a Christian, thus to slaughter enuie it selfe? to keepe shut that mouth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that would faine open it selfe against him? to make him be cloathed with his own shame, who sought to bring shame vpon him and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession? when a wretch cannot so put off his forehead as to accuse him whom he abhorreth, no more then he can the sunne of darknes when it shineth, yea when the Prince of the world commeth to sift such a member of Christ, yet he findeth nothing iustly to vpbraide him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all?</p>

               <p>After that our Apostle hath at large described such Christian duties, as must be vrged vpon free persons of all sexes, and ages; Now he commeth to such as are required in those that be in seruile condition, and estate. And in these two verses propoundeth two points: 1. He pointeth them to such vertues, as especially befit them: 1. He inforceth them with a reason drawne from the end of them; namely the adorning of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The <hi>vertues</hi> are fowre: 1. <hi>subiection:</hi> 2. <hi>pleasing of their masters in all things:</hi> 3. <hi>silence,</hi> propounded in the opposite of it, <hi>not answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againe.</hi> 4. <hi>faithfulnesse,</hi> illustrated by the contrarie, <hi>not pickers.</hi> The <hi>enforcement</hi> is in the last words, that euen they may become orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto the Gospel, which by a periphrasis is called the doctrine of Christ, or God our Sauiour: &amp; thus must they be, not in some or few, but <hi>all things,</hi> that is, in all their speaches, actions, and behauiours. The whole sence of the verses together is this, And now, oh Titus, hauing applied thy doctrine vnto other estates, at length cast downe thine eyes vpon them that are of inferiour condition: for they beeing members of the Church, aswell as any of the former, thou must fit and serue out vnto them also their portion, wherein thou must exhort them, that they be willingly submitted and subiected vnto the power, and vnder the will of their masters; yea what euer their masters be, let them be vnbeleeuers, vnmercifull, froward, yet let them cast to please them in all things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God their Masters master is not displeased. And although themselues be religious and called vnto Christ, yet let them acknowledge their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and neuer aduance, or embolden themselues to returne vndutifull answers vnto their masters or mistresses, as the manner of many is. Let them not vse any vnfaithfulnesse, but all good fidelitie, which is the cheefe vertue of a seruant, and that in euery thing which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the same; and especially let then beware of one point of vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, namely, the secret purloyning, and filching the least profit of their masters, to turne to their owne or other vses, without their masters priuitie. And if all this while they serue such hard masters, as returne them small thanke, or other retribution for their faithfull seruice; yet this shall they do, they shall bewtifie the doctrine of the Gospel which they professe, and in commending it, they shall get thanks of God, who will
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:18792:219"/>
not dismisse them without a plentifull reward.</p>
               <p>The first and proper dutie of euery seruant, is <hi>subiection,</hi>

Which standeth, 1. in an inward reuerencing in heart the image of God in his superioritie. This reuerent subiection of the heart, the Lord in his owne example requireth in all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his seruants: Mal. 1.6. <hi>If I be a master, where is my feare?</hi> and is the first dutie of that commandement, <hi>honour thy father and mother:</hi> the Apostle, Eph. 6.5. calleth for <hi>feare and trembling</hi> from seruants toward their masters. 2.

And the same Apostle mentioneth both in the Ephesians, and Colossians, <hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily masters,</hi> to shew, that so farre as the soule is not hurt, nor the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science wounded, the rule of the seruants obedience is not his owne, but his masters will, be it irkesome, difficult, wearisome: Luk. 17.7. the wearie and toyled seruant, may not come out of the field to ease and refresh himselfe at his pleasure, but waite still vpon the hand of his master, and sit downe, and eate at his masters appointment, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as that parable teacheth. 3.

and his Master appeased with him.</p>
               <p>Hence we note, that religion and the doctrine of the Gospel, freeth no man from any dutie, but rather fasteneth it vpon him; the Apostle saith not, that seruants beeing now brought to the faith, are no longer to be commanded by their masters, but by Christ; but writeth to them not as free, but as seruants still, and inforceth their subiection, euen to vnbeleeuing masters: and elsewhere writing vnto masters, he forbiddeth them not to exercise rule and dominion ouer their seruants, but only tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth them after what manner to weld their authoritie. And indeed this is a point which occasioned much trouble in the Apostles daies, both vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to masters, and seruants: for they hearing of a libertie purchased by Christ to beleeuers in him, they presently begunne to cast vp all, and would not serue any longer, especially vnbeleeuing masters, but would be at their owne hands; against which conceit the Apostles, Paul, Peter, Iohn, much laboured, still recalling seruants to their former subiection and obedience.</p>

For 1. euery subiection is not against the law of pure nature: who can denie but that in innocencie there was a politike subiection, of the wife to the husband, the children to the parents: and this was no fruit of sinne, although the tediousnesse and painefulnes of it came in by the fall. 2. Christ hath purchased a libertie for soule and bodie, but we must be content with the first fruits of it here in this world, and those are the spirituall libertie we haue from Satan, sinne, and condemnation, which shall bring on that perfect freedome we expect in heauen, when we shall not only be freed from the power of sinne (as here) but euen from all molestation of it; and not only set free from the euil of seruitude (as here we are by Christ) bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In Christ all are one indeed, but in regard, 1. of the spirituall and inward man, 2. of the meanes of leading men to happinesse: but in respect of the outward man, they abide master and seruants still, Prince and people still, bond and free still, noble and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble still. Paul hauing conuerted Onesimus a runnagate seruant, kept him not with him at Rome, because he was called, nor freed him from the seruice of his master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but sent him to Philemon againe, who although he must in regard of the faith, account him a brother, yet his outward condition was to be a seruant still. 4. <hi>We must be no longer the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of men,</hi> namely, in respect of the inner man, and the conscience,
<pb facs="tcp:18792:220"/>
which in seruants is as free from men, as in Masters, no master can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that, for it is onely to be commanded by God: but the Apostle speaketh not of bodily seruice to men, neither is there any word which belongeth to the doctrine of faith, that is a maintainer of any licentious libertie; nay religion teacheth them, that as Christ hath set them free, so also that they shall not vse that libertie, as a cloake of maliciousnesse and licentiousnesse; but carrie themselues the rather as becommeth the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, and the freemen of Iesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. If this be so, let Masters haue a care, if they would haue ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants subiect vnto them, to choose such as are religious, and frame to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion such as they haue chosen: that knowing what it is to be subiect to their master in heauen, conscience may compell them to be subiect vnto their earthly masters also. Wouldest thou haue thy seruant to please thee in all things? worke him to please God in all things. Wouldest thou finde him faithfull vnto thee? see then that he be a Ioseph, who will not sinne and be vnfaithfull to the Lord. Wouldst thou haue him a profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble seruant to thee? see he be an Onesimus, and then howsoeuer in times past he was neuer so vnprofitable, yet now will he become profitable to thee and others. Many masters feele the iust smart of vndutifull, vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, vnprofitable servants, to the ruine often of themselues and their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milyes, because they haue no care of their choise, nor to frame them to godlinesse, and prof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. This meeteth with the sinne of many seruants, who lift vp their hearts aboue the estate of subiection, and in their hearts despise the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or place of their gouernours, and so the ordinance of God, yea the image of Gods authoritie shining in them; by reuersing the condition of all subiection, which is to stoope vnder the wills of superiours: for they must haue wills of their owne, crossing not the vnequall (which yet they ought not) but the most lawfull commandements of their Masters. And as for sustaining rebukes and correction, they were neuer trained vp vnto it in their youth, and now beeing elder cannot brooke it, but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times murmure, sometimes resist, sometimes reuenge. Whereas this should be the resolution of all religious seruants: I see the word enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me, beeing a seruant, to <hi>account my Master worthie all honour,</hi>

<pb n="426" facs="tcp:18792:221"/>
my part is patiently to endure the same; it may seeme vniust often and vndeserued, if I might be my owne iudge, when indeede it is not: but were I sure it were so, be it farre from me to take the staff by the end, but I will submit my selfe to the Lords yoke, who hath commanded me to be subiect, not to the good and courteous onely, but to the froward, if I be hereto called; and herein I will imitate my Lord Iesus, who taking vpon him the forme of a seruant, when he was wronged, committed all vnto him that iudgeth righteously,<note place="margin">see 1. Pet. 2.18.</note> so I will only say, the Lord looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it and iudge it. And now if any seruant make light account of these things, the day is comming when he shall finde what it is to rise vp in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion against the ordinances of the Lord.</p>
               <p>The second vertue required of seruants towards their Masters is, that they please <hi>them in all things.</hi>

For this is the priuiledge of a master, to haue his seruant deuoted vnto his pleasure and will, for the attempting of any businesse, the continuance in it, and the vnbending of him from it: and when the seruant hath done all he can, it was but debt and dutie,<note place="margin">Luk. 17.9.</note> and no thankes are due to him from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Matth. 8.9. <hi>I am also a man in authoritie, and I say to one goe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe, these outward things must be lawfull or indifferent,<note place="margin">Non adoratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis equalitate, sed seruirutis fidelitate.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Let no seruant thinke it a sufficient warrant, presently to doe a thing hand ouer head, because he is so commanded by his Master, and by God commanded also to please him in all things: but he must looke to the chiefe power, to which his masters is but subordinate, which if it command any thing crossing the former, that saying hath place, <hi>whether it be meete to obey God or man, iudge you:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 4.5.</note> and besides whatsoeuer is not of faith in the agent, be it neuer so indifferent in it selfe, it is sin.

The thing then here condemned, is that too ordinarie a sinne of seruants, when as they either priuatly mutter and grudge against the commandements and corrections of their masters and mistresses, or else more openly thwart and contradict them; yea by crooked and snarling words, prouoke their indignation iustly against them: by all which, they manifest that they haue no feeling of the ordinance of God, no conscience of Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, seated in the person of their master, no wisedome to suffer and forbeare, no not for their owne peace sake, nor respect of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, which forbiddeth in them all muttering and vndutifull

For if it be not lawfull to iniurie a stranger, much lesse one who is so neere vnto vs: euery man will say, it is more capitall to smite the master then a stranger. Nay, the Lord lesse endureth it in a child toward the father, or a seruant toward the master, then in one stranger toward another. And it is sure that he that maketh no consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of robbing them, maketh lesse (were it not for feare of law) of rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing strangers: so saith Salomon, Prov. 28.24. <hi>Hee that robbeth his father and mother, and saith it is no sinne, is a companion of a destroyer</hi>; that is, will easily ioyne with open robbers, to spoile others of their goods also. Besides, to say it is but a small thing, and my master is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther better nor worse for it, the truth is, thou that wilt crack thy consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:18792:223"/>
for a small trifle, wilt not greatly straine if Achans more goodly wedge come in thy way; he that is vnfaithfull in the lesser, will be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull in the greater; serue the deuil for a pennie, thou wilt be more seruiceable for a pound, and augment thy labours, as he doth his wages. And whether it hurt thy Master or no, that is not the question, it hurts thine owne soule, by transgressing the commandement, and incurring the curse of it.</p>
               <p>Further, whereas some seruants may truely say, that their masters are hard and straite, and requite their seruice scarce with food and rayment, yet giueth this no leaue to pilfer the least commoditie from him; and what were this else, then to fall into the hands of an harder master, into the hands of sinne and Satan? nay rather as Iacob went through an hard seruice of aboue 20. yeares, through summers droughts, and winters frosts,<note place="margin">Gen. 30.33.</note> yet in the end he professeth that his righteousnesse should answer for him, and that nothing miscaried vnder his hand, but he made it good: so should seruants in their yeares so iustly carrie themselues, as in the end of their tearme, they may also say, let God make my righteousnesse answer for me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Iacob in that place delt not so iustly, but rather cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Laban, in helping himselfe to his right, by laying the straked rods in the sheepes watring troughes: whence it may seeme that a seruant may right his owne wrongs, and supplie out of his masters goods, his owne wants. <hi>Answ.</hi> But farre was it from Iacob to vse therein any deceit, who would not so boldly haue inuocated the name of God to such a wicked purpose: besides, what he did was by Gods authoritie, yea and direction,<note place="margin">Gen. 31.20.</note> who to helpe him to his right by dreame (as himselfe profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth) reuealed vnto him such a naturall meanes, as in all likelihood he was ignorant of before: neither was it Iacobs intention, by cunning to conueie to himselfe any of his vncles goods; but onely in such meanes as God had appointed, expected a blessing from time to come. Besides, what can this make to any secret conueiance of their Masters goods, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here was a plaine contract and bargaine, betweene him and Laban? from all which, seeing the counsell was diuine, the meanes naturall, the contract open and plaine, and the end, that by the blessing of God he might come by his right, Iacob is freed from the imputation of vsing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill craft, and out of good conscience professed that his righteousnesse should answer for him.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let euery seruant consider not only what his master depriueth him of, but withall what he committeth vnto him; he hyreth him to be true, and not a theefe: he crediteth, and putteth him in trust with his goods, and sometimes with his whole estate, which he would not doe to
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:18792:223"/>
a theefe. Now to deceiue such as trust him so farre, is against all humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. For a man to take a purse by the high way, to steale sheepe, to break an house, is a notable point of the euery in it selfe, and in our account: but none betrusteth such a fellow, no man looketh for any better from him, no man is deceiued in him; but a strong theefe is he, that is vntrusty to him that trusteth him, and relieth vpon his fidelitie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Let this admonish seruants to beware of such vnrighteous waies, as are too common and vsuall: some purloyning from their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to diuert to their owne vses, some to riot away, some to plaie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, some to giue away; in which courses some are so traded, as that much better were it for many masters to trust to a <hi>broken tooth, or a sly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding foote,</hi> then to put any confidence in them.<note place="margin">Prov. 25.19.</note> But fearefull is that sentence against them, 1. Thess. 4.6. <hi>God is the auenger of all such things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, such masters as are toyled and iniured by the vnfaithfulnes of their seruants, haue great cause to examine their owne waies in former daies, and say to their owne hearts, haue I beene vnfaithfull to my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and haue I made no restitution? seeing I should haue repaied a fifth part more then that I was vniust in; that is all confiscate, and by Gods iust iudgement may carrie much more with it, yea and bring a curse on all the rest: see Levit. 6.4.5. Thus ought the vnrighteousnes of seruants, to force masters to righteous dealing.</p>
               <q>But shewing all good faithfulnesse,</q>
               <p>Here the Apostle extendeth the former precept, and in this forme of words affirmatiuely propoundeth it, requiring at the hands of seruants faithfulnesse not onely in regard of their Masters goods, but in all other respects wherein a seruant ought to be helpefull to his Master. In the former respect, he must not onely not wast his Masters goods, with the vnfaithfull steward; but he must carefully so farre as in him lieth encrease them: it is noted a propertie of the euill seruant, that he encreased not his Masters talent: he is not accused for decreasing it, but he put it not forth to his masters aduantage.

                  <note place="margin">Motiues to the dutie.</note>Now to incite seruants to all good faithfulnesse, hauing shewed the principall things wherein it consisteth. Let them consider, 1. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of blessing made to faithfulnesse, Prou. 28.20. <hi>the faithfull person <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> shall abound with blessing.</hi> 2. He that is faithfull in little, paueth a way for himselfe to become ruler of much, if God see it good for him. 3. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> curse of vnfaithfull dealing: which layeth open a man to the plagues of God, which enter into the house of the vniust person: yea often whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth him with his owne rodde: bringing often vpon such as haue beene vnfaithfull seruants, by meanes of vnfaithfull seruants, pouertie, and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:18792:224"/>
want, or worse things, that their sinne might returne vpon them with much more bitternesse. 4. That a good meanes to learne rightly to vse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> our owne portion of goods, is by the carefulll vse of other mens, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into our hands. For he that wretchedly rioteth and squandreth his masters goods, for most part is giuen ouer by Gods iudgement to bee a waster of his owne. And here taketh place that speach of Christ, <hi>If you be vnfaithfull in an other mans goods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16.12.</note> 
                  <hi>who shall giue you that which is your owne?</hi> teaching, that he that is vnfaithfull to an other, seldome is faithful in his owne affaires.</p>
               <q>That they may adorne the doctrine of God our Sauiour in all things.</q>
               <p>First, for the meaning. The doctrine of the Gospel,<note place="margin">The Gospel called the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, Why.</note> is called the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ. 1. Because he is the argument and subiect of it: whence some of the Euangelists beginne their writing thus, <hi>The beginning of the Gospel of Iesus Christ:</hi> and the Apostle Paul beginneth his writing with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his setting apart to <hi>preach the Gospel of God concerning his Sonne:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mark. 1.1. Rom. 1.1.</note> for Christ Iesus deliuered to death for sinne, and raised again for iustification, is the whole matter. Whence Paul calleth it, the <hi>word of the crosse,</hi> not onely because the crosse followed it,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.18.</note> but also in that it is the doctrine of Christ crucified.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because he is the first and chiefe messenger and publisher of it, who in Paradise promised that the seede of the woman should breake the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> head: and none but the sonne,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.18.</note> who came from the bosome of the father, could reueale, and shewe the fauourable face of his father vnto vs: who also in fulnesse of time, to shewe himselfe the cheife doctor of his Church, came in his own person, and went about preaching and teaching this doctrine of the kingdome.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whosoeuer haue beene the teachers and publishers of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine from the beginning, either by word or writing (not excepting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Prophets and Apostles themselues) or shall be vnto the ende; they all do it by commandement from him, yea himselfe preacheth in them, and in vs. Thus the Apostle saith, Eph. 2.17. that Christ came and preached peace to them that were farre off, that is, to the Gentiles in the persons of his Apostles; for otherwise in his owne person, as he was not sent, so he preached not but to the lost sheepe of the house of Israel. And therefore although Paul sometimes call it <hi>his Gospel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> and speaking of other Apostles also, <hi>our Gospel,</hi> yet must it be meant onely in regard that they were the publishers, but not the authors of it, for that is Christ himselfe.<note place="margin">&amp; chap. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. As it proceedeth from him, so it tendeth wholly vnto him, and leadeth beleeuers to see and partake both of his grace and glorie shining in the same.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="434" facs="tcp:18792:225"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ is called <hi>God our Sauiour,</hi> 1. To prooue his owne di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, not onely in expresse tearmes beeing called <hi>God</hi>; but also by the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite agreeing onely to a diuine nature, <hi>our Sauiour.</hi> 2. To imply our owne miserie, whose infinite wretchednesse onely God could remooue, and whose infinite good none but God could restore. 3. And especially in regard of this doctrine; 1. to confirme the diuinitie of the same, it beeing a <hi>doctrine of God,</hi> and a doctrine of saluation proceeding from <hi>our Sauiour.</hi> 2. To enforce the dutie towards it: namely that seeing the author of it is God, the matter diuine, the effect saluation, meet it is that such a sauing doctrine, a doctrine of such tidings, should be beautified and adorned.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Doctrine of God adorned two waies.</note>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this doctrine is adorned, when it is made bewtifull and loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto men, and this by two things in the professors of it. 1. By an honest and vnblameable conuersation; for carnall men commonly esteem <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of the Doctrine by the life, and the profession by the practise of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessor. Hence the Apostle would haue Christians so compose all their actions,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.12.</note> as whosoeuer should see their good workes, might be mooued to glorifie God. And this appeareth more clearely in the contrarie: for when the worke answereth not to the word, it causeth the name of God to be blasphemed among vnbeleeuers:<note place="margin">Rom. 2.23.</note> and <hi>to glorie in the law,</hi> yet <hi>brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the law, is a great dishonour to God.</hi> 2. By Gods blessing which is promised and is attending such walking, whereby euen strangers to the Church, are forced to beginne to like of the profession; for Gods blessing vpon his people, is not onely profitable to themselues, but tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the saluation of many others. We read of many of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people, that when they saw the great aduancement of Hester, and Mordecay,<note place="margin">Hest. 8.17.</note> 
                  <hi>they became Iewes.</hi> And when the Egyptians saw the great workes that God did for his people among them, it is said, <hi>that many of them ioyned themselues to the Israelites.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12.38.</note> So we read in the Ecclesiasticall storie, that when <hi>Licinius</hi> was ouercome by <hi>Constantine,</hi> and the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions ceased, which had almost for 300. yeares together wasted the Church, how innumerable of them, who before had worshipped their idols, were contented to be receiued into the Church. On the contrarie, the Gospel is dishonoured, when the Lord is forced to iudge and correct the abuse of his name, in the professors of it; Ezech. 36.20. <hi>When they,</hi> that is, the Israelites, <hi>entred among the Heathen they polluted my name, when they said of them, these are the people of the Lord, and are gone out of his Land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Seruants adorne the Gospel, when professing it, they by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming all faithfull seruice to their masters in and for God, seeke and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the blessing of God, in the condition of life wherein he hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:18792:225"/>
them: whereas the casting off of the yoake in beleeuing seruants, would make men conceiue, that God, whose name they professe, were the author of confusion, and not of order, and that the Gospol were an enemie to ciuill and humane right. For what is more right and equall, then for masters to enioy their seruants, as they do the other parts of their goods? and bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er might a man misse a great part of his goods, then the person, and labour of his seruant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> The meanest Christian in his place, may and ought to bring glorie vnto the Gospel.<note place="margin">The meanest Christian may and must bring glorie to the Gospel.</note> These seruants were sould and bought like beasts in smithfeild; yet must such poore creatures by their faithfulnesse, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and conscience, decke and bewtifie the Gospel, which euen by their liues receiueth either honour, or discredit. In the Tabernacles buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery man must bring lesse or more. The Lord esteemeth not of men by the places they hold, but by their carriage in them. A poore wise child or seruant here, is better then an old foolish King. In a word, no man is called to the truth, but on condition to shew forth <hi>the vertues of him that hath called him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Let seruants, who for most part, leaue the care of religion to others, consider of this priuiledge, which the basenesse of their calling cannot depriue them of. As in euery nation, so in euery calling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life, he that feareth God, and worketh righteousnes, is accepted of him: yea, the poorest soule called to partake of the liberties of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and freedome in grace, is also called to this glorie, that he is one who adorneth the Gospel. Which consideration, may both comfort and encourage poore despised Christians in good waies, and prouoke them by expressing Christianitie in their whole course, to shew their cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance, and manifest to what house and family they belong. 2. How much more doe those in higher place, set vp for many eyes to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either credit, or discredit the Gospel: and yet we may say of our age, as Christ of his, <hi>the poore receiue the Gospel:</hi> and this doctrine is much more beholding to seruants then masters, to inferiours then supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours. 3. Masters must vse meanes, that their seruants may adorne the Gospel, and not with the Egyptians, looke only for taskes, and busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to be done, but neuer exhort them to sacrifice. And yet more wretched are some Masters, who when their seruants entreate to goe and worship in the Church, doe therefore euill entreate them, as those that are too idle.</p>

               </q>
               <p>In these words, our Apostle layeth downe a generall reason, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and enforcing all the former precepts; and it is drawne from the end of our redemption, which calleth all sorts of men out of their vaine conuersation, vnto a profitable and religious course amongst men. <hi>Grace hath appeared to all men,</hi> euen the basest, aswell to seruants as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, to slaues as superiours, to one sort as another, that all sorts of men might by new life, and obedience walke answerable thereunto.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Grace,</hi> is meant the doctrine of the Gospel, called Act. 20.32. <hi>The word of grace:</hi> so Iude, 4. <hi>Turne the grace of God into wantonnesse.</hi> Because, 1. it is a gift of grace. 2. it teacheth that remission of sinnes, and life euerlasting, are obtained only by the meere grace of God in Christ. 3. it is a meane vnder God, to bring beleeuers to the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this grace, through remission of sinnes by his blood.</p>
               <p>This grace is described, 1. by the <hi>adiuncts,</hi> 2. by the <hi>ends</hi> of it. The adiuncts are two: first, the light and cleare euidence of it in the present manner of propounding; in the word <hi>appeared,</hi> which in the Greeke signifieth a shining out in greater brightnesse then euer before: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rising vp of the sunne of righteousnes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, the greatest part of the world was in darknes; and where most light was in the Goshen of the Church, it was but in shadowes and obscuritie; but now a light is sprung vp to them that were in darknes, the doctrine of grace is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously preached to all the world.</p>
               <p>The second adiunct, is that <hi>saluation,</hi> which this grace bringeth, and goeth with this light: for it is the <hi>power of God to saluation.</hi> And this is amplified by the subiect, <hi>all men:</hi> that is, <hi>mankind,</hi> or all conditions of men, seruants aswell as masters, bond as free, poore as rich, women as men, young as old, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ends</hi> of the appearing of grace are two: the <hi>former</hi> is nearer, namely, to become our schoolmaster or <hi>teacher</hi> in <hi>this present world.</hi> And it teacheth two lessons. 1. What we must forbeare and auoid, 1. <hi>vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,</hi> 2. worldly lusts. Secondly, what we must incline vnto, 1. sobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie, 2. righteousnesse, 3. pietie. And this we must doe in this present life, 1. That others may witnesse with vs our faith to be vnfained, for true godlinesse must not be hid onely in the heart, but visible also to the eie of man; both that it may be an acceptable testimonie to the truth, as also for direction to some, and conuiction of others. 2. Because this present world is our nonage time, wherein we must be schooled to these lessons;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:18792:226"/>
which time if it be neglected, there is no time hereafter alloted to learne them in. The latter ende is further remooued, and concerneth the life to come; namely, the fruition of our <hi>hope,</hi> that is by Metonimy, our glorie hoped for, in the appearing of Christ the <hi>mightie God,</hi> which that it may be a spurre to our more godly course, we are willed to expect. So that the briefe scope and summe of the words is, as though he had thus plainly spoken: There is great reason, O Titus, that thou shouldest thus vrge all sorts of persons, young and olde, men and women, bond and free, vnto such seueral duties and vertues, as may most beautifie their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession; because that blessed doctrine of grace, offring saluation freely not onely to Masters, but euen to seruants, hath more brightly shined out in these last, then euer before in former ages: and like a schoolemaster instructeth, that we should both denie vngodlines and vnlawfull lusts, as also that we should moderate our owne affections with sobrietie, exercise righteousnesse towards others, and in regard of God, practise the power of that religion which we professe: and further vrgeth vs with thirsting desire to expect and long after that heauenly blessednesse and immortall glorie now onely possessed by hope, but which shall be fully assured vs, when Iesus Christ that great God and our Sauiour shall appeare the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time to our full redemption.</p>
               <q>For the grace of God]</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Although the doctrine of the Churches of the olde and newe Testament be the verie selfe same, in regard 1. of the author, who is God. 2. substance and matter, which is perfect righteousnes required in both. 3. scope and ende, to the iustification of a sinner before God; yet are there diuerse accidentall differences betweene them, which that we may the better vnderstand, both the offices, and the benefits by Christ, are meet to be knowne: some of them we shall note out of these words as we shall come vnto them. The first difference is,<note place="margin">1. difference betweene the Law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</note> in that the Gospel is called grace, which word the Lawe acknowledgeth not: nay these two are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, to be vnder the lawe, and to be vnder grace. To be vnder the law, is not to be vnder it as a rule of life, for so all beleeuers on earth, yea the Saints and Angels in heauen are vnder it; but to be vnder the yoke of it, which neither we nor our fathers were able to beare. For to omit the least part of the yoake, standing in the obseruation of 1. many, 2. costly, 3. laborious, 4. burdensome ceremonies, what a killing letter is the law, which commandeth inward and perfect righteousnesse, for nature and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and that in our owne persons? which promiseth life vpon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther condition but of workes? <hi>doe this, and liue</hi>; and these must be such as must be framed according to that perfect light and holinesse of nature, in which we were created: which wrappeth vs vnder the curse of sinne,
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:18792:227"/>
and infolds vs in the iustice of God, without shewing any mercie at all? What a yoke is it that is euer galling vs for sinne, partly shewing it, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (not as a cause indeede, but occasionally) increasing it, it beeing the <hi>strength of sinne?</hi> 1. Cor. 15.56.</p>
               <p>Now to be vnder grace, is to be freed from all this bondage; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from those <hi>elements</hi> and <hi>rudiments of the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.20. We are not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law in 4. respects.</note> but especially, 1. When the yoake of personall obedience to iustification, is by grace tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated from beleeuers, to the person of Christ our suretie, so that he do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the lawe, we might liue by it. 2. When duties are not vrged accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to our perfect estate of creation, but according to the present mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of grace receiued; not according to full and perfect righteousnesse, but according to the sinceritie and truth of the heart, although from weake and imperfect faith and loue: not as meriting any thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as testifying the truth of our conuersion: in all which, the Lord of his grace accepteth the will, for the deed done. 3. When the most heauie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> curse of the Law is remooued from our weake shoulders, and laid vpon the backe of Iesus Christ, euen as his obedience is translated vnto vs: and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thus there is <hi>no condemnation to those that are in him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.1.</note> 4. When the strength of the lawe is abated, so as beleeuers may send it to Christ for performance; for it cannot vexe vs as before the ministerie of grace it could; which is an other law, namely of <hi>faith,</hi> to which we are bound, the which not onely can command as the former, but also giue grace and power to obey and performe in some acceptable sort the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this is the doctrine of grace, which we are made partakers of.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Euerie Christian ought to take vp that exhortation, 2. Cor. 6.1. <hi>We beseech you that you receiue not the grace of God in vaine:</hi> not that the sauing graces of faith and loue, &amp;c. may be receiued and lost a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, which is the Popish collection from the place, which speaketh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the doctrine of grace and faith, which may be receiued in vaine, and is of all such hypocrites who neuer knewe what neede they stood of this grace: and therefore some receiue it into their eares, not into their hearts: into their profession, not into their practise; into their lippes and tongues but neuer into the loue, ioy, and other affections of their hearts. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as could they see the glorie of this ministration, they would exceede that people in their acclamation and crie,<note place="margin">Zach 4.6. How a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may know that he receiueth the grace of God in truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; not in vaine.</note> grace, grace vnto it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may a man knowe whether he receiue this grace in vaine or no? <hi>Answ.</hi> By these notes. 1. Whosoeuer receiueth this grace in truth, he receiueth together with the commandement, a power which enableth him in an acceptable performance of it; for howsoeuer the law <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> is a dead letter,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3 6.</note> yet the Gospel beleeued, is a <hi>quickening spirit,</hi> the words
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:18792:227"/>
of it are <hi>spirit and life,</hi> in conferring the spirit of life, whereby the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing soule is quickened in the wayes of righteousnesse. The first thing then to be examined is, whether the Gospel be in <hi>word or in power:</hi> for if it beget onely to a forme and outward profession of pietie and religion,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 1.5.</note> it is receiued in vaine.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As he receiueth a power, so doth he also a will to obey the precept of the Gospel: he is not now constrained so much by the bond of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> law to obey God, but the Sonne hauing set him free from such compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he becommeth a lawe vnto himselfe, and of loue and a free heart, (if there were no law nor curse) he seeketh to please God: the gracious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the spirit bendeth his heart to delight in the lawe, concerning the inner man, and this maketh the yoake easie, and the commandement not grieuous. The next thing then to be examined is, whether thou serue God <hi>in the newenes of the spirit, or oldnes of the letter:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.6.</note> by vertue of the spirit renewing the soule, and so working the will, and not by the compulsiue power of the lawe; if thou findest not this change and work of grace in thy will, which carrieth euer a readinesse with it to obey God in all his commandements, thou hast receiued this grace in vaine: for Gods people are a willing and free people, and bring free will offrings, their hearts incourage them, and their spirits make them willing, euen there where often power and strength faileth them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whosoeuer is not stirred vp to thankfulnesse of heart and life for his free righteousnesse by the only merit of Christ, neuer as yet knew <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> what this grace meant in truth; for let a man receiue but a small benefit of his freind, looke how he is affected vnto it, and prizeth it, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth he testifie his thankfulnes to the giuer: shall we be thankfull to a mortall man (suppose a Prince) that sheweth vs a little grace aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in some fauourable speach, countenance, or other benefit; and can the Lord power all his grace into an heart which prizing it can possibly be vnthankfull? and where this thankfulnesse is, it will make a man in his heart to loue God, to feare before him, to reuerence his name and his ordinances, to affect his house, his children, his houshold seruants, and much more his tokens of speciall loue, namely, his graces in his owne or other mens soules. In his life it will make him beware of all sinne, which may prouoke so gracious a God to displeasure, yea &amp; striue in the subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all sinne: for grace will not stand with the regiment of sinne, nor sinne cannot raigne in him that is vnder grace: to conclude, it maketh him fruitfull in all weldoing, which well beseemeth the spirit which he hath receiued: for can either such grace as this deserue lesse? or can grace which fitteth her owne habitation frame the heart it taketh vp to lesse then the endeauour in all these? The further application of these notes I
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:18792:228"/>
will forbeare, and come to the other instructions.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Is the doctrine of the Gospel a doctrine of grace; then vse carefully the meanes to haue thy part in it; for hereby only thou art vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yoked from the curse and tyrannie of the law, from Gods consuming wrath and iustice, and all the feareful fruits of his displeasure; hereby only thou commest to see God in Christ accepting thy person, and with thy person thy workes: sparing thy weaknes euen as a man spares his sonne that serueth him; entertaining willingnesse where there wanteth strength, and endeauour where there is no power; remitting thy own vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; imputing the righteousnesse of his owne sonne; and beginning to frame such an image in thy soule, as tendeth to a more happy conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then euer thou hadst in thy purest innocencie.

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Call others to partake of it, be speaking of it, tell men what God hath done for thy soule; thou canst not but wish all men conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if thy selfe beest. A righteous man here cannot eate his morsells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone; Christian loue is like fire, which warmeth whosoeuer stand about it; one brand will kindle another, and iron (saith Salomon) sharpneth iron, so one conuerted man will strengthen the brethren: Andrew wil call Simon, and Philip will call Nathaniel, and the beleeuer wisheth all Gods people to be like himselfe, except his sinnes.</p>

If Christ were liuing againe vpon earth, his bowels would earne in compassion to see so many people as sheepe scattered without a shepheard.

               <q>Bringing saluation.]</q>
               <p>This doctrine is a sauing doctrine, and word of saluation to those that were wandring in the pathes of death. Act. 11.14. the Angel wishing Cornelius to send for Peter, affirmeth, that he shall speake to him words
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:18792:228"/>
whereby <hi>he and all his house should be saued.</hi> Whence it is called the word of life, Act. 5.20. Goe, preach to the people <hi>all the words of this life:</hi> and the word of <hi>eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 6.68. because God hath ordained it to this purpose, that whosoeuer is brought to the faith by it, shall eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally liue thereby.</p>
               <p>And here is another difference between the doctrine of the law and Gospel, the which two the Apostle comparing together,<note place="margin">2. difference betweene the law and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</note> he calleth the law, <hi>a killing letter,</hi> and the ministrie of it, <hi>a ministrie of condemnation, and the ministration of death:</hi> but the Gospel he calleth a <hi>quickning spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the ministrie of the spirit,</hi> and the ministration of righteousnesse. <hi>Obiect.</hi> Psal. 19.7. The law of God conuerteth the soule. <hi>Answ.</hi> But there the law in a more generall acceptation of the word, comprehendeth the whole doctrine of the couenant of life and saluation, as it is also Psal. 1.1. <hi>Blessed is the man that meditateth in the law:</hi> that is, the word <hi>of God day and night.</hi> But in this straiter sence, the law is no instrumentall cause of faith, repentance, or any grace; it only woundeth a man, and prepareth him to conuersion, but conuerteth none; it gendereth to bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and bindeth him that looketh for iustification by it, in the conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sinne, and deserued damnation, and there leaueth him in death: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this doctrine of grace, is the conuerting and quickning word, reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that God through his Christ is become either pleased, or placable with vs; till which time we cannot but either lie in a slauish feare and the smarting twitches of our consciences, or else desperately giue ouer all; but when by the Gospel we perceiue the readinesse of our heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to receiue them that returne, then we resolue to seek vnto his grace, to become his, and to loue him who loued vs first. So as the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer can readie answer the Apostles interrogatorie, <hi>Tell mee, receiued yee the spirit, by the workes of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</hi> by <hi>workes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 3.2.</note> is meant the doctrine of iustification by the workes of the law; and by the <hi>hearing of faith,</hi> is meant the doctrine of the Gospel: hearing bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put for the thing heard, and faith, for the doctrine beleeued: they can now answer, that it is the Gospel, that gendreth vnto life, which is the instrument of the spirit, both for the beginning, and confirming of regeneration and salvation, and that the lawe is no cause (though an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion) of Gods grace, shewing onely the necessitie of some other righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, then that in a mans selfe; but not putting a man so prepared into the possession of it, which the Gospel onely can doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. If only the doctrine of grace bring saluation, then doth no do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of workes bring it, or vnto it, neither in whole or in part.<note place="margin">No doctrine of works can now bring saluation.</note> But the whole chaine of our saluation sheweth, that we are <hi>saued by grace onely:</hi> 1. Our <hi>election,</hi> Rom. 11.5. <hi>At this time there is a remnant according to
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:18792:229"/>
the election of grace.</hi> But it may be of grace and foreseene workes too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Apostle setteth himselfe to preuent this obiection in the next words, <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more of workes, or else were grace no more grace; but if it be of workes, it is no more of grace, or else were workes no more workes.</hi> 2. Our <hi>calling,</hi> 2. Tim. 1.9. <hi>We are called with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace.</hi> 3. Our <hi>faith,</hi> Philip. 1.29. <hi>It is giuen you to beleeue:</hi> and <hi>faith is the gift of God.</hi> 4. Our <hi>iustification,</hi> Rom. 3.24. <hi>We are iustified freely by his grace.</hi> 5. Our <hi>sanctification,</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are his workemanship created vnto good workes, which he ordained that we should walke in them.</hi> 6. Our <hi>perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in grace</hi> is by grace, Ier. 32.40. <hi>I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall neuer depart from me.</hi> 7. <hi>Eternall life is the free gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23.</p>
               <p>Againe, if our saluation were either depending vpon our hand, or held in our owne hands, more easily might we loose it, then when we were in our innocencie; gold were no sooner taken out of little childrens hands, who minde to play with it rather then to lay it vp, then our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort out of our owne: but our securitie is, that our cheife treasure is not laid vp in such a weake cottage, but our life is hid in heauen, in the free grace and vnchangeable loue of God: that now, 1. false Prophets can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly seduce the elect, Matth. 24.24. 2. though many apostates fall backe, yet Gods foundation abides sure, 2. Tim. 2.19. where Gods election is compared to a great building laid vpon a firme foundation, which may be shaken but neuer ouerthrowne. 3. though our sinnes like so many billows, would growe ouer our heads and drowne vs, yet this grace is sufficient for vs, and vpholds vs that we sleepe not in death. 4. though tribulations may threaten to separate vs, yet this grace by them driues vs nearer himselfe; and draweth him nearer vnto vs, according to that gracious promise, that in sixe troubles he will be with vs, and in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen he will not forsake vs.</p>
               <p>What meane then the enemies of this grace of God the Papists to seeke for any part of their iustification and saluation in merits and works: whereas if we consider the beginning of all our good, which they call the first iustification; the Lord is found of vs who sought him not, his skirts couered vs when our father was an Amorite, our mother an Hittite, and we in our blood. And for the encrease of our good, which is that second iustification which they dreame of, and is indeede nothing else but the increase of our sanctification, he beginneth and perfecteth, he is the author and finisher of our faith, <hi>by which we stand,</hi> and hold on vnto saluation:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.24.</note> 1. Cor. 1.8. who shall <hi>confirme you to the ende, that yee may be blamelesse in the day of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. If this be a doctrine bringing saluation, then must we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as we would saluation it selfe:<note place="margin">Embrace the doctrine of grace as thou wouldest salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it selfe.</note> there is no man but would lay hold on saluation, yet no man almost claspeth hold on the Gospel to make it his portion: many a one can make it his talke, and his pretence, but scarse any maketh it his portion, by yeelding himselfe to be cast into the mould of it. Now for the right entertaining of it, two things are required. 1. To acknowledge that this word of saluation, is by God sent vnto vs as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the speciall token of his loue. This Paul vrgeth on the Iewes his hearers, Act. 13.26. <hi>men and brethren —to you is the word of saluation sent:</hi> this the Iewes knewe well enough, but Paul would haue them acknowledge the benefit, which a verie fewe at this day doe. 2. To be thankefull for such a mercie, not onely by accounting their feete beautifull, that are the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> bringers of such tidings, but by <hi>holding forth this word of saluation,</hi> as we are commanded, Phil. 2.16. And this is done, 1. by beleeuing it in the heart to iustification. 2. by professing it with the mouth to saluation. 3. by teaching and propagating it to others by holy speach and example: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd thus onely it becomes vnto vs as it is in it selfe, a sweete sauour of life vnto life. And this dutie is rather to be thought vpon, because this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine although it be in it owne nature a word bringing saluation, yet may it by accident through our default become (though not a cause) an occasion of destruction, and a sauour of death vnto death; and what a wofull thing were it so to sinne against the Gospell, as it should become (working according to the nature of the subiect) a killing letter vnto vs? how fearefull a sinne were it to turne this grace into wantonnes, or to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect and yet much more despise so great saluation? seeing this is to sinne against the neerest and immediate word of saluation: and if those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped not vengeance who despised the word spoken by angels; much lesse shall such as despise the word vttered by the Sonne himselfe.<note place="margin">Heb. 2.3.</note> Many men when they see the lawe broken, especially those precepts wherein humane societie is more disturbed, as by theft, murther, adulterie, periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, &amp;c. oh these sinnes cannot be brooked for the foulenesse and detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of them: but yet the same men liue in a greater sinne then any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all these, and see it not; namely, the neglect or contempt of saluation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Gospel, which is more dishonourable vnto God, and much more preiudiciall to his owne soule. Let the Iewes be our glasse herein, in whom the Lord suffered many contempts of his lawe, and yet neuer vtterly cast them off: but no sooner almost had they refused this corner stone, but he scattered them into all windes, and would haue no more to doe with them vnto this day. Let other famous Churches of Corinth, Ephesus, Galatia, Colossus, Thessalonica, the seauen flourishing Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in lesser Asia, to whom Iohn<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> writ his Epistles in the reuelation, teach
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:18792:230"/>
vs, that neuer did any Church wilfully refuse this grace, but ere long God gaue them ouer into the hands of Christs greatest enemies: and so of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons it will be true, that whosoeuer loue not blessing, the curse of God shall befall them, and runne into their bowels like water.</p>
               <q>To all men,]</q>
               <p>These words may be expounded, 1. without exception; and then it must be conceiued by way of <hi>publication</hi> or manifestation of this grace, which in the generall promises of the Gospel is published and offered to all, excepting none, <hi>whosoeuer beleeueth shall be saued.</hi> 2. with restraint, when this grace bringeth saluation by way of <hi>exhibition,</hi> not offring on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but conferring the same. And the restraints are two. 1. it bringeth saluation to <hi>all men,</hi> namely, that are elected and saued: for whosoeuer are saued, must passe by this doore, and come to the knowledge of the truth: neither can this be thought strange of him, who considereth that the Scriptures acknowledge such a generalitie, yea a <hi>world</hi> of the elect onely. God was in Christ <hi>reconciling the world vnto himselfe,</hi> that is, the beleeuers who onely are reconciled: and Christ is the lambe that takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinnes of the world, that is, of his elect: see also Ioh. 14.31. 2. It bringeth saluation to <hi>all men</hi>; that is, all kinds and conditions of men, not to euerie particular or singular of the kinds, but to all the sorts and kinds of men, to seruants as well as masters, to Gentile as well as Iew, to poore as rich. Thus is it said that God would haue <hi>all men</hi> saued, that is, of all sorts of men some: so Christ healed <hi>all diseases,</hi> that is, all kinds of diseases; and the Pharisies tithed <hi>all hearbs,</hi> that is, all kinds; for they tooke not euerie particular hearb for tithe, but tooke the tenths of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kinde, and not the tenth of euery hearb.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3. difference betweene the Law &amp; Gospel.</note>And hence we note a third difference betweene the Law and Gospel. That doctrine of the law brought not saluation, no not by way of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation to all men; no nor yet to all sorts and conditions of men; that was a more restrictiue doctrine to the Iewes only: and in that couenant was alwaies a difference held, and a wall of partition was set vp between Iew and Gentile, and betweene people and people. Before the flood were the sonnes of God, and the sonnes of men. After the flood, before the law, there was the promised seed, and the seed of the flesh; the sonnes of the freewoman, and of the bond woman: after the law before Christ, was held the distinction of Iew and Gentile: with the former God made his couenant, them he tooke into his teaching, and passed by the other: to these pertained the adoption, the glorie, the couenant, the giuing of the law,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.4.</note> the seruice of God, the oracles, the promises; these had his Temple, his Prophets ordinarie and extraordinarie. This difference Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid implied, Psal. 147. <hi>Hee sheweth his word vnto Iacob, his statutes and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:18792:230"/>
iudgements vnto Israel, he dealt not so with euery nation, neither haue they knowne his waies.</hi> But now in this last age of the world, this couenant of grace and life at least, for propounding, is made common to all people: now euery man is inuited vnto repentance,<note place="margin">Act. 17 30.</note> the partition wall is broken downe, the vaile is rent, and the mysterie <hi>which was kept secret from the beginning of the world, is published to all nations,</hi> Rom. 16.26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This place thus rightly interpreted, yeeldeth no patronage to that deuise of Vniuersall election,<note place="margin">Vniuersall ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction can not be drawn from this place.</note> which they draw from the vniuersall vocation of men to the knowledge of the Gospel. But <hi>many are called,</hi> not euery particular man, and the greatest part of the world haue alwaies bin out of the couenant; besides of them that are called, few come, so as all to whom this grace is published, participate not in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Note the extent of this couenant farre aboue the other: whence it is fitly called by <hi>Iude,</hi> the <hi>common saluation,</hi> as in regard of the ends, and meanes of it, so also in respect of the subiects called vnto it: so in the former Chapter, vers. 4. it is called the <hi>common faith,</hi> not onely in regard of the kind, and obiect of it, but also of the subiects, persons of all kinds beeing called thereunto: which consideration should stirre vp our reioysing, in that the barren and desolate hath more children, then the married wife, that the place of the tents of the Church is so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and the courtaines of her habitation spread out; as we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Isa. 54.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Note that the kingdome of Christ admitteth no distinction of men; it is not of this world, which accepteth of men for their place, countrie, calling: but all countries and callings are alike vnto God, in euery nation and calling he that feareth him, is accepted of him: he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepteth the person of the Prince, nor of the poore, <hi>for they both are the worke of his hands:</hi> he calleth the Gentile, the seruant, the poore,<note place="margin">Iob 34.19.</note> and these receiue the Gospel. Where againe we who are Gentiles, and were <hi>Lo Ammi,</hi> and <hi>Lo Ruhania,</hi> may reioyce that we are receiued to pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and that the wing of Gods mercie is stretched ouer vs, <hi>who iustifieth the circumcision of faith, and the vncircumcision through faith.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.30.</note> Hence may the poore beleeuer, be he a thrall, a seruant, and base in the world, raise his heart to comfort, that euen he, whom men despise, is called and that effectually, to see the grace and saluation of God; euen he who is perhaps a seruant to some meane man, is a free citizen in Gods kingdom; euen he that hath neuer a foote in earth, is become a purchaser in heauen. Here is no complaint that the prodigall sonne is entertained, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable sonne neglected. The Enunch need not say, <hi>I am a drie tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 56 3.</note> nor the sonne of the stranger, <hi>the Lord hath surely separated me from his people,</hi> but whosoeuer <hi>cleaueth vnto the Lord to loue the Lord and serue

him,</hi> them he will giue <hi>a name better then of sonnes and daughters, euen an euerlasting name, that shall not be put out.</hi>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 4. This meeteth also with a wofull delusion among many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, to whom when we call for conscionable walking in a Christian course, What, say they, did not Christ die for all men? and is not heauen as open for mee as for others? would not God haue all men to be saued? is he not mercifull? will he condemne for such and such things? which what is it else, but from the abundance of grace, to make their sinnes su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabound? and thus they plainly shew that they were neuer yet effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, and that although they haue bin called to the supper, yet haue they refused to come.</p>
               <q>Hath appeared,]</q>
               <p>The Gospel is compared to a great light shining out brightly and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously. 1. a <hi>light,</hi> in that 1. it dispelleth a manifold darknesse, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore occupied the minds of men. 2. in regard of direction. 3. comfort which it bringeth to the beleeuing soule.<note place="margin">Matth. 4.15.4. difference betweene the doctrine of the Law &amp; Gospel.</note> And 2. <hi>a great light:</hi> wherein is a fourth difference from the old Testament, in which all things were more darke and obscure through the vaile of figures, and ceremonies, so as their light was but like the obscure light of the sunne before the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing;<note place="margin">The fathers of the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had but a candle to see by, not a sunne, as we.</note> not that the substance and scope of their doctrine was not the same with ours, but that in the manner of deliuerie it was farre lesse light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some. But now the light is risen vp in glorious sort, shining not as before almost to none but Iewes, but to the Gentiles also: so as according to the Prophets foreshadowing hereof, the sunne is not only risen and in our midheauen, but the light of it is seauen fold bigger then it was before. And the reasons are sundrie:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Many were the types, and predictions of the old Testament, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> must be knowne to be accomplished in the new; which for this cause must as farre excel the other in light and brightnesse,<note place="margin">The very eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts haue preached themselues.</note> as the bodie the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow; or the thing it selfe, the figure and picture of it: truely to this saith one, that the exposition must be more cleare then the text. 2. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> promises made to the Church of the new Testament were many moe, and farre more ample, then to the old: as that, <hi>from the least to the greatest all should know the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 11.9.</note> that the <hi>mountaine of the Lord should be lifted vp vpon the toppe of the mountaines,</hi> that <hi>all the earth should be filled with the knowledge of God, as the waters couer the sea:</hi> the which if they be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fulfilled, then this great light hath appeared. 3. The generalitie of the doctrine confirmeth the same: For all nations were to be called to the embracing of it, Gentiles, Arabians, Barbarians, and the rest euen of the most barbarous Heathens: much light therefore and perspicuitie was to be required in such a doctrine, as should acquaint all nations, not
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:18792:231"/>
only with it selfe, but all that doctrine also which was formerly deliuered in all ages to the Church of God: and this latter most full and clearely explaned in the former. This light in this regard is growne (like that cloud) from an handbreadth to couer the whole heauens; and is indeed that water running vnder the threshold of the sanctuarie, which is risen from the ankles to a riuer, yea a sea couering the earth. 4. The exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Christ in fulnesse of time, who came from his fathers bosome,<note place="margin">The spirit to the old belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out droppe by droppe, but now in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</note> to reueale things there secretly reserued from the beginning of the world; and the plentifull powring out of the spirit long before promised, and 50. daies after Christs ascension accomplished to the Church of the new Testament, doth certainely seale vp this same truth; besides those expresse places of Scripture, which might be alleadged to this purpose. In 2. Cor. 3. Paul affirmeth, that the ministration of the spirit is farre more glorious, then that of the law, which he calleth the ministration of death; of which he affirmeth, that yet it was so glorious, that it made Moses couer his face with a vaile, without the which the children of Israel were not able to behold him; signifying vnto vs, that they were not able to comprehend those manifold obscure types of the Law, till the vaile was remooued; which, saith the Apostle, ver. 14. <hi>In Christ is now put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> In this respect our Sauiour affirmeth, that although among them <hi>that were borne of women, there was not a greater then Iohn,</hi> (who yet in regard of his person, was inferiour to sundrie of the Prophets) because of them all he was nearest vnto Christ, and in his ministerie pointed at him with the finger now exhibited into the world; yet <hi>the least</hi> minister, <hi>in the kingdome of heauen,</hi> that is, of the new Testament, <hi>is greater then he.</hi> For he can preach that the sonne of man is lifted vp, dead, raised, ascended, which Iohn could not doe, as neere as he was, and much lesse Abraham, Dauid, and the other Prophets, who sawe his daie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But hereby it seemeth that before Christs appearing, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospel appeared not. <hi>Answ.</hi> We must consider the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in a double respect: 1. As it is a doctrine conteyning a promise of grace, freely for the Messiah, who was to be the sonne of Abraham, and Dauid; and thus was it euer in the Church, deliuered by God immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly to Adam after the fall; <hi>Moses writ also of him,</hi> and <hi>to him giue all the Prophets witnesse.</hi> 2. As a doctrine propounding free grace in Christ exhibited, dead, raised,<note place="margin">Evangelium promissum.</note> &amp;c. and thus it appeared not before his owne appearing, before which time it was onely a <hi>Gospel fore-promised,</hi> Rom. 1.2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. In that the doctrine of the Gospell is such a shining light, we may see the miserable estate of such as want the meanes of it, who abide
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:18792:232"/>
in obscuritie and darkenesse, euen as those are in the night, to whom the sunne is not risen;<note place="margin">A candle is not so necessarie in a darke house, as the light of the Gospel in the darknes of mens hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Note hence with how little danger we can shut our eyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such a light as is risen vp vnto vs; shall we without blame now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing as at midday, see no more nor so much as those who liued in the dawning?<note place="margin">Not without great danger can we shut our eyes against the light which hath appeared.</note> shall the light of the sunne be seauen fold greater vnto vs then euer before, and yet we stumble and fall, as if we were cast into the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night? What a fearefull iudgement hangeth ouer our negligence, if vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our ministerie which exceedeth in glorie, we come behind the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie beleeuers of the olde Testament in knowledge, faith, and fruition of Christ with his graces? Is all the pedagogie of the lawe past, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in euen the Prophets and arch-beleeuers (so farre as we consider the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie ministration) were to vs but as children in their elements? Is Christ come, crucified, raised vp to glorie, and so the fulnesse of time come wherein we haue the bodie and substance? Oh what a disgrace is it, that we should be inferiour to those who obtained but the shadowes? what a great condemnation will it be, that we who are reserued to such means should sinne against such a light? In a misty night to stumble and fall were no such disgrace, no such danger; but with many Christians to say, I am in the light, I see my way well enough, and yet to come behind not onely the Iewes, who walked in a darke light; but euen the Gentiles who not onely walked in darkenes, but were darkenesse it selfe, in the practise of sobrietie, iustice, mercie, chastitie, and such like; is an heauie condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet the condition not of a fewe professed Christians.</p>
               <p>It will be here said, but God forbid that we should not receiue this light, and walke also in the direction of it, and to say the contrarie were to broach a slaunder. To which I say, that when Christ himselfe preached, most of the Iewes were blind still, so true it is that many who heare and professe the Gospel, yet neuer receiued the light to walke by it. Some receive indeede this light superficially vpon themselues, as the light of the sunne falling vpon trees and stones, it enlighteneth the outside, and
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:18792:232"/>
warmeth the barke a little, but peirceth not into the heart and midst of them: so the Gospel shineth round about many professors, and it may be conformeth some outward actions, and set them forward to speake of it, and for it, at least for a while, but it gets not within them, nor peirceth their hearts: there is no change there, the soule nastie corners of them lie vnswept still, and so they remaine hypocrites still. Others receiue this sunshine no otherwise then the aire receiueth the light of the sunne; when the bodie of the sunne is present, it enlighteneth the whole aire, but the bodie of the sunne departing, darkenes succeedeth againe: so many hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ers may be affected with the present sound of the word, and thinke themselues sufficiently enlightened, but the sound beeing gone, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer darkenes commeth, they heare many things but keepe nothing, and so make themselues fit for many stripes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how shall I knowe whether I receiue this light aright or no? <hi>Answ.</hi> By these notes.<note place="margin">A triall whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuest this light.</note> 1. If thou wilt not attempt any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the direction of it, no more then thou wouldst thy earthly businesse without the light of the sunne or of a candle. A fewe naturall actions a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> man can doe in the night time, as eate, drinke, sleepe, &amp;c. but in any matter of weight he will haue light: so for workes of darkenes men neede no light nor desire any, but for the least worke of grace, thou must first call for a light. The Apostle wisheth vs to <hi>walke as children of light:</hi> but how shall we doe that? the Apostle Iohn telleth vs,<note place="margin">Ioh. 12.35.</note> namely if wee <hi>walke in the light</hi>; and <hi>while we haue the light.</hi> The Israelites might not mooue a foote towards Canaan, but by direction of the pillar, and the wise men could not goe to Christ without his starre.</p>
               <p>Secondly, light is a pleasant thing to the eie, saith Salomon, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thing it is to a poore prisoner to behold the light of the sunne, through neuer so small a creuise; In like manner is the glad message of the Gospel to the Christian soule that knowes it aright, as if vnexpected tydings of a pardon were brought to a malefactor readie to execution. Examine thy soule then, are the statutes of the Lord thy delight, thy so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, thy songs in this time of thy pilgrimage? for as the child of God knowes his freedome from all powers of darkenesse, so can he not (if he be out of beginnings of conuersion, and act of temptation) but haue sweete comforts in his soule from the sense and feeling of the same.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, thou must not onely take direction and comfort, but goe on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to one thing yet wanting, required, 2. Cor. 3.18. namely, that seeing <hi>we behold the glorie of the Lord with open face, we must be changed into the same image from glorie to glorie:</hi> that is, seeing by the appearing of grace the vaile is remooued, that we may see the face of God clearely, now must we by meanes of this knowledge be transformed into his image;
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:18792:233"/>
that image in which we were created must be daily renewed, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees further restoared in vs, which is the meaning of the Apostle when he saith, <hi>from glorie to glorie:</hi> for wheresoeuer this shining light is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, it not onely illuminateth the mind with knowledge of the truth; but by little and little it transformeth the whole man into it selfe. Whence the Apostle saith, Coloss. 3.10. that <hi>the newe man is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</hi> and no light else can change the thing enlightened into it selfe. Examine then whether thou art not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inlightened with knowledge and vnderstanding, but whether thou art changed by it from an vnbeleeuer and vnrighteous person, to a beleeuer, fruitfull in the workes of faith, whereby thy selfe shinest as a light in the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Motiues to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the light while it is with vs.</note>Now the motiues to prouoke vs thus to entertaine the light, are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie. 1. Consider our businesse is such as requireth light; the course of Christianitie is an husbandrie, a race, a iourney, a battel. 2. The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> dangers, and obstacles in these businesses are many, and we haue need <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of light to avoide them. 3. The day lasteth not alwaies, Ioh. 12.35. <hi>yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a little while, and the light is with you:</hi> and let the day once slippe, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer walketh, walketh in darkenesse, he that worketh, worketh the works of darkenes; the former knoweth not whether he goeth; the latter kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not what, or how he worketh: and let this worke be neuer so ciuill and seemely, yea let it be neuer so good in the matter, yet is it euill in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the worker. 4. Those that regard not the light while it abideth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> iustly either forfeit it, and make themselues vnworthie the kingdome, or by Gods iust iudgement are hardened by it vnto further euill, the God of heauen in his iustice giuing them vp to the god of the world to be blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to destruction, and ruled at his will, wherein we might be plentifull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in examples. 5. What light soeuer can befall a Christian, is by meanes of this: Art thou in the darkenesse of ignorance and blindnesse? this is a meanes of the spirit to enlighten the darke dungeon of thy heart, and no other. Art thou in the blacke darkenesse of thy sinnes? here is a light discouering the remission of thy sinne, the imputation of Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse. Art thou compassed with the darkenesse of Gods displeasure for sinne? this by offring conditions of grace and reconciliation, maketh the face of God to shine vpon thee. Art thou plunged in the darke deeps of afflictions and miseries? hence shineth out the light of comfort, miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and deliuerance. Art thou by temptation laid in the darke graue of vtter darkenes, death, and damnation in thy owne sense and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension? here onely seest thou Christ abolishing death by his appearing, <hi>bringing life and immortalitie vnto light by the Gospel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.10. Coloss. 1.12.</note> and making thee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> partaker of the <hi>inheritance of the Saints in light.</hi> Lastly, the freedome of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:18792:233"/>
this gift to such wretched and vngodly persons strongly perswadeth, that we should as freely offer our selues to the light, as it freely offereth it selfe vnto vs. The which reason is expresse in the text, which saith, that this grace offered it selfe, and appeared, when men sought it not, desired it not, obtained it not by entreatie, or otherwise. So Ioh. 3.19. <hi>the light is come into the world,</hi> namely, the world not expecting it, nor wishing it, nay when it shone gloriously vpon them, they not acknowledging it; and this is not the least motiue to the willing and thankefull entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all which reasons,<note place="margin">Many refuse the light.</note> what a iust damnation hangeth ouer many mens heads, who still loue darknesse rather then light. For, 1. a number please themselues in their naturall estate, find sufficient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus numbers turne from the light, who by it should be allured to ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Others turne against it, and hate it, and the candlestickes too which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hold it forth vnto them: they complaine of the brightnesse of the sunne, and of too much preaching: they scoffe at it, and disgrace it, and the bringers of it: and these are monsters in nature; for all creatures natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally loue light, and follow it, except hatefull battes, and owles, and such like: all true men loue the light, and the day, but the theife robbeth in the night, the adulterer watcheth the twilight, he that is drunk is drunk in the night, and Christ concluded against him that hateth the light, that he is an euill doer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Others are not so malicious against the light, but would faine ioyne light and darknesse together: they would be professors, and goe for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> good Christians, but would not forsake some profits and pleasures of sinne. The first thing that euer God did in the creation, was the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of light from darknesse; which is the first thing also in regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The law condemned all mixtures, and halting betweene two; and the Gospel teacheth, that we are either children of the night, or of the day, and cannot be both at one time, no more then it can be night when the sunne is in the midst of heauen. Let professours therefore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:18792:234"/>
that the Arke and Dagon will not stand together; and that they are either in Goshen or Egypt; beware of thrusting this earth betweene this sunne and themselues; for such an ecclipse portendeth great ensuing euills.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Another sort would faine walke in this light, but would be loth to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> be seene in it; would haue the vse of it, and yet hide it vnder a bushell too; and therefore keepe it with them, but as in a theeues lanthorne, that none can know there is any light there besides themselues; for feare of reproach, or danger they will not be knowne what they are a doing: but they mistake this light, if they thinke it can be kept so close; for where euer it is, it is a glorious shining light; and can no more abide hidde, then the sunne can be couered with a bushell, or put into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorne.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 5. A last sort haue walked in the light heretofore, and made good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings, but haue thought the day too long, and are growne wearie of the sunne: and therefore as the people, Exod. 35. at the first brought too much to the Temple, but after wards sacrilegiously deuoured these holy things, as the Prophet witnesseth: euen so in the beginning of her late Maiesties raigne, this light was accounted of, followed, and happily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained; but since, the verie length of the day hath wearied the labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers.</p>
               <p>A third <hi>Vse</hi> might here be fitly followed, against those who still accuse the Scriptures of obscuritie, now when the vaile is gone, and the light is gloriously shining: and thence frame a consequent, more impious and absurd, then the premisses, namely, that therefore they must not be med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led withall of common people, but onely by the Popes licentiates; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom I only affirme, that they as yet neuer saw the expresse face of Christ in the Gospel; and that when all vailes and shadowes conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued vnremooued, it was not lawfull for any Iew thus to reason.</p>

               <p>This doctrine of the Gospel is a schoolemaster, and full of instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein it differeth not from the law; for euen that also teacheth the deniall of vngodlinesse, and a sober, righteous, and godly life. <hi>Quest.</hi> What neede the Gospel then teach ouer the same thing againe? <hi>Answ.</hi> Because though they teach these same things, yet they differ in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of teaching.

The Gospel perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:18792:234"/>
to bring that power into act, by such an argument as the law neuer knew; namely, from the great price that was paid for sinne, euen the blood of that immaculate lambe, wherewith we are washed: which to count profane, or to tread it vnder our feete, were horrible impietie, yea much more fearefull, then to transgresse that law, which was confirmed with the blood of bulls and goats; and yet if a man willingly transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed against that law, <hi>there was no sacrifice for that sinne.</hi> And this manner of perswasion the Apostle here vseth, in saying,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.26.</note> that the doctrine of <hi>grace which bringeth saluation, teacheth vs.</hi>

This doctrine meeteth with that slaunder of the Popish Church, whereby they accuse our doctrine of licentiousnesse, and affirme, that we teach that a iustified person is freed from all keeping of the law: that all the law is fulfilled in beleeuing: that there is no sinne, but vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe: and that nothing but faith is commanded in the Gospel: as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things they are indifferent, not commanded, nor forbidden.

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Many a loose Christian can well endure to heare, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of grace bringeth saluation,<note place="margin">The wisdom of God hath ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned saluation &amp; instruction to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: mans fullie would disioyne them.</note> and the brighter it shineth to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the better: but oh, that the Apostle had staied there, and not come to teach them their dutie, for they are slow of heart to beleeue, and dull to learne. Let a man come and offer saluation, and preach promises: who will not pinne himselfe on such a mans sleeue? but let him teach the same men their duties, and the way to become partakers of these promises, and they will fall off as fast,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.6.</note> or faster then they did from Christ, when he asked his owne Disciples, if they also would goe away.</p>
               <p>But in great wisedome hath the Lord happily ioyned these two toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, saluation and instruction, to shew that he that hath no care for the latter, hath no part in the former: grace bringeth saluation to none but to the schollers of Christs schoole; it is then no matter to thee that grace hath appeared, nor any benefit to thee that it bringeth saluation, vnlesse thou be also instructed by it in the lessons following.

Pet. 1.17.18. <hi>If you call him father, passe the time of your dwelling here in feare: knowing that you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed, &amp;c.</hi> And the reason is of great force, for gifts and good turnes haue great power to hold mens harts to the bestower, that a man is scarce his owne but as the <hi>borrower is a seruant to the lender,</hi> so much more doth the giuer binde the receiuer; but if the gift be no trifle, but of great price and necessarie vse, the receiuer is much more straitly bound then before.<note place="margin">Prov. 17.8.</note> Salomon saith, that a gift <hi>prospereth where euer it goeth,</hi> noting the great power that gifts haue to sway the heart to good or euill, and this latter so effectually, as they can make a man who hath eyes of his owne, to shut them vp &amp; see with other mens, yea &amp; force euen wise men to peruert iudgement. Ioseph when he wrastled with the wicked attempt of his impudent mistris, how did he fortifie himselfe against such a sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse motion? hee considered that his Master had committed all into his hand, and aduanced him aboue all in the house, saue his Mistrisse: how should I then (saith he) commit a fact of such indignitie against him; for
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:18792:235"/>
besides the wickednesse of it against God, shamelessnes it selfe would be ashamed of it. And as he was withdrawne from this sinne, so by the same motiue would the Apostle draw on euery Christian to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of euery Christian dutie: for hauing disputed of free iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by faith, and shewed both from what estate, and vnto what condition beleeuers were brought; he laieth this for a ground to build his exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto holy life, Rom. 12.1. <hi>I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God</hi> euen by these mercies of God, be perswaded to <hi>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> In any temptation vnto sinne, say to thy selfe as Ioseph: what was I a bondman before I came to my master? nay, was I vnder damnation before, as the bringing of saluation implyeth? was I without God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, held vnder chaines of darkenesse? was sentence passed against me not to die on a gibbet, but to be held vnder euerlasting death with the damned? hath the Lord by the word of his grace giuen mee a free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and deliuered me from all this wofull estate? Oh how can I do this wickednes against such a master? against my God, who hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed me from my miserie, but aduanced me to such dignitie, as no man is in the house aboue me: and made me not steward onely, but heire with Christ to partake in the same glorie with him: Oh I could neuer answer such vnthankefulnes. Would God men in temptations would lay such considerations to heart, and then could they not be so headlong carried into the common sinnes of the age, of swearing, drinking, sabbath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vncleannes, and such like. Againe, if the Lord make any suit vnto vs, as he maketh many in the ministerie of the word, the motions of his spirit, and the counsels and exhortations of his children; either to call vs forward in grace, or recall vs from some sinne; here is a strong motiue for the good speed of it, euen the laying to our hearts the great things he hath done for our soules: he can command vs nothing, but we are sure he hath done farre more for vs: say then with thy selfe, oh I was attainted of high treason against God the King of glorie, cast and condemned by the law, my necke was vpon the block, and the streak of death was euen a giuing: and then did this great King send me a most vnexpected, but a most welcome pardon; he hath put away my offence, abolished the staine of it, and restored me by act of parliament kept in heauen to my blood: nay more, aduanced mee to an honourable office neere himselfe, that none is in greater grace then I am: shall this King now command mee any thing that shall seeme burdensome? can he command any thing so soone, but I must needs call to minde such free grace formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed? Nay, doth he enioyne me but some small peece of seruice for
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:18792:236"/>
mine owne good, and vrge me thereto with the remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grace towards me? Oh what an vnthankfull creature were I, if so equall a suit should not preuaile with mee, but goe vnrespected. In a word, let vs be glad of such a gentle schoolmaster, which inuiteth vs by such allurements, which if they be not of force to mooue, and preuaile with men, there remaineth nothing but that the terrors and curses of the law returne againe vpon them, and these shall schoole and tame them well inough.</p>
               <p>Now we come to the former of the lessons which grace teacheth, namely to <hi>denie,</hi> 1. <hi>vngodlinesse,</hi> 2. <hi>worldly lusts.</hi> By <hi>vngodlines</hi> is meant properly euery transgression of the first table, namely, all irreligion and open despight of God and his ordinances; all negligent also and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruing of him: an inbred and mother sinne, hauing so many sinnes sucking vpon her, as there are wayes whereby any or all the fowre first commandements are transgressed.<note place="margin">Gen. 20.11.</note> And more indirectly the sinnes of the second table are included, so farre as they proceed from the neglect of the former.</p>
               <p>By <hi>worldly lusts</hi> are meant two things. 1. the lust of vnlawfull things, which tend to our owne hurt, or our neighbours, in bodie, goods, name, &amp;c. 2. the vnlawfull or immoderate lust of things lawfull, which are brought to three heads.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.16.</note> 1. <hi>The lust of the flesh,</hi> that is, desire to liue soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to fare daintely and deliciously euerie day, and that the soule may take the ease; and much more the fruits of these, as vnchast desires, lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and rouing affections, and looks; loose and vncleane words and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises. 2. <hi>Lust of the eyes,</hi> the couetous and crauing eye, the euill eie, which can see nothing but it wisheth it: the excessiue seeking and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of earthly things, immoderate desire of riches. Achan will haue the cursed Babylonish wedge and garment; and Ahab will fall sicke on his bed for Naboths vineyard. 3. <hi>Pride of life,</hi> ambition, thirst after prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, state, credit, popularitie, blind selfe loue, contempt of others, boasting, rash confidence, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>All these are called worldly lusts, because 1. <hi>they are not of the father, but of the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lusts why cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led worldly.</note> that is, either in the best vse of these things so affected, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they are of the world, and respect the present life; they are not diuine things but tend vnto the world wholly, and are corruptible with the world which passeth away: so as it were madnesse to place the kingdome of God in such things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as meate, drinke, honours, pleasures, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so lawfully vsed: Or else these lusts are the desires of worldly men: for naturally mens hearts feed vpon these lusts, till grace worke some change in them, that they can see God in Christ become their father, who <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> contenteth them with better and sweeter portions. 2. They are so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:18792:236"/>
because they hold and detaine men so in the employments of this present world, as that they haue no leisure to thinke seriously of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so can no more tast the sweetenesse, or frame themselues to an heauenly life, then the bruite beast can liue the life of an Angel.</p>
               <p>These must be <hi>denied,</hi> that is, when temptation by Satan, the world, or our owne corrupt flesh will be still egging and vrging, yea soliciting and prouoking with much instance to euill: as, thou seest others do thus and thus: or else pitie thy selfe, fauour thy selfe, enioy this pleasure, it is twilight, or darkenes couereth thee; here must be as instant denialls and refusalls, as it was with Ioseph, so must it be with euerie Christian: albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it his mistris spake to him <hi>day by day, yet he harkened not vnto her, but kept him out of her company, and when she offred violence to him, he fled out from her.</hi> But by whom must these be denied?<note place="margin">Gen. 39.12.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The doctrine of grace teacheth <hi>vs,</hi> saith the Apostle, euen the most godly, Paul himselfe, who after many yeares conuersion shall finde the law of his members rebelling against the lawe of his minde; he that hath receiued most grace, and most strength, must be here further instructed.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Apostle speaking indefinitely, sheweth that <hi>all these</hi> must be denyed, no vngodlines, no one lust excepted. For grace will not stand with the cherishing of any lust, though neuer so secret, neither is he taught of God, that liueth and tradeth in any sinne. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible commandement, and as impossible a doctrine as any the law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. Is the Gospel become so seuere a schoolemaster, as the law is? <hi>Ans.</hi> The doctrine of grace teacheth not what we can doe, but what we are bound to, and ought to doe. 2. Though corrupt nature make such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements impossible, yet by grace the yoake of Christ becommeth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and light; in so much as Paul could doe all things by his grace that strengthened him. Grace can crucifie the world to a Christian, and a Christian vnto the world. 3. In beleeuers whome grace hath taught, there is a possibilitie in the commandement three wayes.<note place="margin">In beleeuers the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble 3. waies.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of <hi>grace receiued,</hi> the nature of which is, euen then when it is foiled to preserue some resistance and denial in the heart of the things which the flesh hath vnlawfully yeelded vnto; so as the godly sinne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> not with full consent of heart, but doe often the <hi>things they would not,</hi> yea euen that <hi>euill which they hate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 7.15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> in regard of a godly mans <hi>disposition,</hi> who hath with him, 1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> a purpose of heart to cleaue vnto God; if he embrace vngodlinesse or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> lusts, it is besides and against his purpose. 2. an inclination of his will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> them all, Psal. 119.57. <hi>I haue determined to keepe thy words:</hi> and ver. 107. <hi>I haue sworne, and will performe to keep thy righteous iudgements:</hi> so as they are in the sinne they doe as a forced woman, whose whole will
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:18792:237"/>
is neuer gained to the act shee is in. 3. an indeauour answerable to that will; Pauls <hi>endeauour was to keepe a good conscience before God and all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> men:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 24.16.</note> Psal. 119.6. <hi>I shall not be confounded when I haue respect to all thy commandements.</hi> Indeede the beleeuer is like a prisoner with bolts on his heeles, who hauing escaped the prison, cannot flie his danger as fast as he would, cannot denie what he would, but yet some progresse he maketh; slowly he goeth forward, but as fast as he can, according to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> measure of grace receiued. 4. what he denieth not for the present, he denieth not long after, yea denieth himselfe for it, and is neuer quiet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he haue met God in the wayes of repentance. Thus he that is borne of God is said, <hi>not to sinne,</hi> both in that he commits not sinne fully, the seede beeing in him: as also because it is against his purpose, will, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour: besides that, he lyeth not in his sinne, and so sinneth not vnto death.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is a possibilitie in this doctrine in regard of <hi>Gods accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>; who in his Christ accepteth of our weake indeauours, of the will for the deede, and the truth of desire for perfection of action, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs more then conquerours. In all which points we see, how these are not impossible lessons to beleeuers; but no maruell if they be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to such as neuer endeauour in them, whose libertie grace hath not yet wrought, who for their purpose imagine euill; for their wills rebell against God; for their endeauour, they set themselues on a way that is not good; and in whose eyes sinne committed, is but a small thing. So much of the meaning, now followe the doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. Whosoeuer hath truely receiued the grace of God, is taught thereby to denie all vngodlinesse:<note place="margin">Grace truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued hath taught to denie all vngodlines.</note> and whereas vngodlinesse see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth both to fixe deepe rootes in the heart, as also to display the branches abroad in the life; grace teacheth to striue two wayes against it. 1. in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the heart. 2. in striking off the armes, which are (as we say) aboue ground, so as neither roote nor branch is spared.</p>
               <p>The first thing that grace attempteth, is to make the inside cleane, and the roote holy, by working true and sauing faith in the soule, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of which is, to <hi>purifie the heart.</hi> Now as for the branches of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlinesse, because they are verie many, it shall not be amisse to enquire into some of the principall, to the ende we may the better acknowledge the worke of Gods grace expressing the same in vs. And as they looke and stretch many wayes, so may we reduce them to fowre heads. 1. some respect God himselfe. 2. some his worship. 3. some his ordinances. 4. some a mans owne selfe.<note place="margin">Vngodlines branched into 4. heads.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The first branch of vngodlinesse is, to be ignorant of God, not to see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or to denie him in his power, mercie, care, prouidence, iustice, blessings,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:18792:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
afflictions, and euents. This is made a propertie of vngodly men by Iude 4. <hi>vngodly men they are who denie God:</hi> and by Iob, <hi>they say who is the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mghtie that we should serue him?</hi> Tush, the Lord seeth not, <hi>he is within the thicke clouds</hi>; they aske what <hi>profit there is in seruing the Lord,</hi> and walking humbly before him: they see no danger in not attending him, but violently followe their owne lusts; this day is as yesterday,<note place="margin">Malac. 3.14.</note> and to morrowe shall be as this day: they can tast liberally of his blessings, but neuer a whit of his good will in them: they dwell in the sweetenesse of present profits and delights, but neuer tast how sweete God himselfe is. In afflictions they in their hearts can say with Iehoram, <hi>Is not this euill fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord, and shall I attend any longer vpon him</hi>? Thus in the land of mercie and righteousnesse to doe wickedly, in the midst of blessings not to finde the heart more bound to holynesse, not to be confirmed in Gods loue, to gather no strength of faith, nor desire to walke more worthy of God: as likewise to refuse the roddes of the Almightie, and not to bowe or be humbled vnder his hand, are high points of Atheisme and vngodlinesse, the which although grace teacheth to denie; yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ignorant persons liuing vnder grace, in their hearts and liues say there is no God? yea how many that professe this grace, thinke themselues at the best ease in their neasts, when God and godlines is furthest from them? that is their heauen, and then can they enioy their sinnefull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures most remorslesly, though deare shall they buy them: O how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome is a thought or sauourie speach of God to such persons? and in their afflictions how many professed Christians flie as farre from God, as hell it selfe, to diabolicall meanes, vnto witches and sorcerers; because as Saul complained, God answers them not? and yet many moe with Asa, dwell in the naturall meanes, and seldome looke any higher.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another branch of vngodlinesse respecteth Gods worship, and hath two members. 1. To cast off the worship of God, either in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke at the house of God: or in priuate, in their owne houses: whereby men after a sort banish themselues from the presence of God, and with Caine cast themselues out from the face of God; and herein they highly sinne, whom conscience compelleth not to come in, but law, custome, or imitation of others: as also those that lie vnder their pretenses to iustifie the withdrawing of themselues: whether more simple, who say that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie mans good meaning is his good seruice of God: or more fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who say they can serue God as well on their horsebackes, as in the Church; and what can they learne more there then they knowe? &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Ordinarily to ioyne in Gods publike worship, and not seldome at home in the family; but yet with hearts full of guile and hypocrisie, when
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:18792:238"/>
men approach with their lippes, but their hearts regard wickednesse, and nourish vngodlinesse: such as the Prophet speaketh of, <hi>which sanctifie themselues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 66.17</note> and yet <hi>in the garden behind a tree eate swines flesh, and mise, and such abhomination.</hi> Now although grace (which neuer contenteth it selfe with the forme of godlinesse, but worketh the power) teacheth the deniall of all this; yet how many trewants haue entred into this schoole, and liued vnder the Gospel a long time, and yet the loue of the world, the pursuing of the honours, profits, and pleasures of it, hath banished all the care of Gods true seruice in them? so as howsoeuer many in some blind and sinister respect or other, can come to heare Ieremie speaking from the Lord, and for the present delight in that which is spoken; yet their hearts goe after their couetousnesse: or some other vngodlinesse hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vp their thoughts and affections, that the word cannot sinke into their soules; which is the lamentable condition of infinite Christians, who are all pronounced vngodly persons, notwithstanding all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> The third fruit or branch of vngodlinesse, concerneth the word of God,<note place="margin">1. in thoughts.</note> against which many notable parts of impietie breake from a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men. As, 1. Inwardly to conceiue that either God speaketh not in and by vs; but that we speake of our owne heads besides the booke; which were it not a generall receiued opinion amongst men, certenly they could not, they durst not shewe themselues so careles, so vnreuerent and retchles in hearing, as most men doe. For I auouch, neuer did any of the heathen receiue the oracles of their reputed gods (deuils indeede) so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily and drowsely, as Christians doe the oracles of God.

               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The Gospel bringeth salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence.</note> note that where the Gospel bringeth to any person saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there it looketh for returne of some recompence, and namely this, that it be enterteined with <hi>sobrietie, righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>godlinesse,</hi> which are the three graces which goe hand in hand, and euery one looking at another. <hi>Sobrietie</hi> keepeth the owne house, and moderateth the minde at home; <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> looketh forth, and giueth euery man his due a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad; <hi>Pietie</hi> looketh vp vnto God, and giueth him his right. Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie preserueth, and is content with it owne estate and portion. Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse preserueth, and is content that other men enioy their estate and portion. Pietie preserueth, and is willing that Gods part be reserued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Againe, sobrietie must goe before as a nurse of the other two; for he that dealeth not soberly, cannot deale iustly, but depriueth the Church, the common wealth, and family of their due. Righteousnesse without godlines is but Atheisme, and a bewtifull abhomination; and pietie without righteousnesse, is but hypocrisie: for how absurd is it to be precise with man, and carelesse how wickedly we deale with God? Now as sobrietie the first is the nurce of the two latter, so pietie the last is the
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:18792:242"/>
mother of the two former, which where it is wanting, neither of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nor both of them can commend a man vnto God. Therefore none of these three aduerbs of Paul (as a learned writer speaketh) must be forgotten, which ioyntly conteine all the rules of Christian life.</p>

                  </gap>se we will obserue two points. <hi>First,</hi> the proper worke. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the rules of practise. And first of <hi>Sobrietie.</hi> The proper worke of it, is to moderate the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conteine it in due compasse, both in all the affections of the soule, and the actions of life which it tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it selfe vnto,<note place="margin">1. in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</note> as may appeare, 1. In things <hi>inward</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 2. <hi>outward.</hi> First, in the inward gifts of the mind, it teacheth three things. 1. To be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> wise to sobrietie, and not to presume aboue that which is written: it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth not to pry into the Arke, as the Bethshemites did to their cost, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in inferiour things to meddle with curious arts &amp; sciences; but exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth it selfe not in things which <hi>haue onely a shew of wisedome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.23.</note> but such <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as are profitable, yea necessarie. 2. To conteine and content it selfe with the owne measure of gifts, to know their owne bounds and keepe within them: the portion of grace, which is giuen according to the <hi>measure of the gift of Christ,</hi> it acknowledgeth with thankfulnesse, but arrogateth not that which it hath not; for this were to runne ouer the measure, and Christ giueth no such gift which is not in the measure of it. Of this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie we haue a singular president in the Apostles themselues: 2. Cor. 10.13.14. <hi>We reioyce not in things without our measure—nor stretch our selues beyond our measure, nor boast of things without our measure.</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. As it teacheth a man to know himselfe, so also not to despise ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although he hath not receiued the like measure: it swelleth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another,<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>is pure, peaceable,</hi> not <hi>iudging, not aduancing.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Luk. 21.34.</note> no more then with surfetting and drunkennes: it curbeth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet desire of increasing wealth, and so both giueth freedome to the duties of the generall calling, and fenceth from beeing too much wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> and entangled in the cares of the particular. <hi>Secondly,</hi> in his <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,</hi> this vertue of sobrietie setleth a man in a quiet comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, for it teacheth to want, and to abound, and putteth into a mans hand the benefit of contentation in all estates.

of low degree, in that he is exalted; he is taught to be emptie as well as full, and that sicknesse, losses, crosses, (if present) are the best estate for him. Againe, if prosperous estate befall him, and the world come vpon him, this prosperitie puffeth not him vp, but he can vse the world as not vsing it: this excellent grace hedgeth his heart, and suffereth it not to be vnlimited in the greedie desires of these things, nor to seeke hastie ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, nor to be too fast in holding them when he hath them; it confineth his cares within the day; and if the Lord keepe <hi>Mannah</hi> sweete but for the day, he is well contented, yea heartily thankfull.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in the pleasures and delights of this life, wherein a number <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> are become as filthily drunke as others in beastly quaffing; this grace still leadeth the heart in wisedome, that prooue it with ioy, and bid it take pleasure in pleasing things, it can <hi>say of laughter, thou art madnesse, and to ioy, what doest thou?</hi> If vpon occasion a man giue his flesh to wine, it preuenteth least the pleasure of it, make him sensuall and brutish,<note place="margin">Eccles. 2.1.</note> and drawe the heart from heauenly desires and heats: it suffereth not a man to powre out his heart to pleasure, nor to become a louer of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure more then of God; but to reioyce as not reioysing, <hi>yea with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, in things indifferent,</hi> as meat, drinke, apparell, sleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/> marriage, &amp;c. it keepeth within compasse, it putteth the <hi>knife to the throate,</hi> looketh not at wine in the cuppe; eateth and drinketh for strength, and not for surfetting and drunkennesse; to fit a man vnto his calling, and not to make him more dull or heauie; and that in season: with watchfulnesse, and with care of Iosephs afflictions. In apparell it shunneth pride, lightnesse, confusion of sexes and degrees, and idlenesse, and reduceth to comlines, decencie, inward decking rather then out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: yea to such attire as not onely becommeth holinesse, but also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the calling, custome of the countrie, example of the grauer sort of our ranke, and the right ends of apparell. In buildings it suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not to wast the substance in building Babels, so as a man is vnfitted to helpe forward the building of Sion. It causeth the sleepe to be seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and moderate, and suffereth not to sleepe till he be clothed in rags. In marriage, it holdeth from beeing drowned in carnall delight, so as a man cannot come to the Kings supper, but so moderateth the affection as though he were <hi>free from a wife:</hi> and so in other things:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.29.</note> all which shew the admirable excellencie of this grace.</p>
               <p>Now therefore we will come to the second point, namely, the rules of the practise of it, and they be three. <hi>First,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">II. Rules of practise.</note> Denie thy selfe and thine own wisedome, and giue vp thy selfe to Gods teaching and ordering, subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to his wisedome in euery thing: for so shalt thou desire nothing, and
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:18792:243"/>
rest in nothing but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Gods portion of gifts and good blessings: in which thou shalt be able to say that thy lines are fallen in a good ground, &amp; that thou hast a goodly inheritance, wheras the vanitie and desires of the mind <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> are numberles and restles. <hi>Secondly,</hi> know and remember that the end of all thy receits is Gods glorie in the seruice of the Church, and if thou hast receiued more gifts thou must doe more seruice: for so the Apostle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth, Rom. 12.3.4. taking a comparison from the members of the bodie, which haue not all one office, but diuerse, yet neuer a one is his owne but anothers; euen so saith he, <hi>we are one anothers members:</hi> what then must the more honourable members disdaine the inferiour ones as hauing no need of them? No, but this must receiue more seruice and safetie from them: and this is a speciall consideration to keepe the heart from swelling, and proud conceits.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Labour to vse all the good gifts of God. 1. In the <hi>right <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> cause,</hi> acknowledge that it is God that teacheth, feedeth, clotheth thee, prouideth thy portion for thee, and maintaineth thy rents and incomes. Thus shalt thou not sacrifice to thine owne net in any thing, nor reioyce in that thine owne hand hath made thee inwardly or outwardly rich; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be so distrustfully prouident, as though thou hadst no father to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide for thee. 2. In the iust measure of their goodnesse and excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> rightly discerning and distinguishing betweene spirituall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall good things, and waying them aright in the scoales of the sanctuary, finding the lightnesse of the latter, that they may giue place to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Thus shalt thou be drawne with good contentment, to part with these for the fruition of the other; yea thinke thy selfe richer with one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> dramme of these, then with a talent of the other. 3. In their right ends, vses, and seasons, for most part frugally; and sometimes for delightfull and pleasurable vse, but neuer immoderatly: and thus shall thy end and vse agree with Gods, and with the seruice of thy necessarie and lawfull occasions, and not the satisfying of thy vnlawfull lust.</p>
               <p>Now the practise of this vertue in these rules is a fruit of our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1. Pet. 1.13.14. &amp;c. to the which seeing the Gospel calleth vs, how ought we to open our eares, and hearts to entertaine this voice. The sonnes of Ionadab the sonne of Recah obeyed their father when he called them to sobrietie, they neither drunke wine, nor built houses, nor planted vineyards, but obeyed their father in these straight commandements, and for this the Lord blessed them exceedingly: now the Lord commeth not with such a straite charge, not such a one as strippes vs from these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of our liues, but onely restoreth the right and comfortable vse of them vnto vs: and may not he much more say to vs as he did to the Iewes; <hi>should not you heare my words also?</hi> If they obeyed their earthly
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:18792:243"/>
father depriuing them of the things themselues, ought not we much more to obey our heauenly father, who prohibiteth not the things, but onely the abuse of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iustly,</hi>] In this vertue of iustice which the Gospel calleth for at eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie professors hands who looketh for saluation by it, we are to consider the two former points. First, the proper worke of it: what that is will appeare in this definition: <hi>Iustice is a grace of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. The proper worke of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.</note> 
                  <hi>whereby we giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euery man that due which God would haue vs giue him.</hi> First, I say it <hi>is a grace of God:</hi> for in Adam we are all vnrighteous and destitute of the glorie of God herein. 2. Whereby <hi>we giue to man his due,</hi> for there is a iustice towards God, for which Iob, Zacharie, Noah, and such were commended, but that is verie little different from pietie, of which we are to speake: but by this we giue man his due. 3. Because it would be short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne what is due from man to man, I adde, not that which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall reason, or ciuilitie, or mans lawe will giue him, but what <hi>God would haue vs giue him.</hi> Wherein it passeth all that iust dealing which many vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men can performe and glorie in, yea and that also which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the heathen haue beene famous for, seeing this must be a frui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the true knowledge of God reuealed in his word, and performed by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the doer. This vertue is the maintainer of all humane societie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hen no mans bodie, goods, name, are depriued of their due, but haue all offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of loue performed them according to Gods will; when superiours deale iustly with inferiours, and inferiours acknowledge the superioritie of the other in and for God: so masters with seruants, equals with equals, buyers with sellers, and sellers with buyers: which shall suffice to haue noted in generall, seeing the particular workes of it are infinite.</p>
               <p>The second point is the rules of practise, the chiefe of which are these fowre:<note place="margin">2. Rules of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</note> First, that rule of Christ which is the whole lawe and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Whatsoeuer ye would that men should doe to you, doe ye likewise vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them:</hi> and on the contrary, wouldst not thou then be circumvented, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by false waights, or measures, detracted in thy name, &amp;c. doe not thou so to others, the verie light of nature bindeth this on thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> let no man seeke his owne things, but the common good ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as euerie member in the bodie serueth to the good of the whole. A deuillish rule is that, <hi>euery man for himselfe, and God for vs all</hi>; for it is an enemie to all iustice, which bindeth me to tender my neighbours, yea mine enemies bodie, goods, name, comming in my way, as well as mine owne; and farre different from Pauls rule, <hi>let euerie man be seruant to an other for good.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 13.36.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> be <hi>readie to distribute,</hi> and lend freely to the poore, looking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> for nothing againe: for there is iniustice as well in with holding that
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:18792:244"/>
which Gods word hath made an other mans due, as in purloyning his right from him. Now the word commanding to giue to the poore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to euerie ones abilitie, and to lend to the poore members of Christ if neede require freely; to be hard hearted, and straite handed in these ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, is to be vniust, in deteyning from the right owners that which God hath made theirs. Let rich men especially thinke that they are not Lords, but stewards vnder the Lord, to distribute to the necessities of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe seruants.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> walke diligently in thy calling, idlenes is an open iniustice, and the idle person should not eate, for he eateth and drinketh other mens. Beware here of excessiue pastime and recreation, a neare friend to idlenes, calling a man out of that calling wherein he is bound to walke diligently through the sixe dayes. Besides, the encrease of goods by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, is a notable kinde of theft, for it is the encreasing of a mans selfe with the damage and hurt of others, by such a meanes as God neuer san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to such purpose: so also he that decreaseth his wealth thereby, is a starke theefe both to himselfe, as also to his wife, children, the Church, the poore, whom hereby he robbeth of their right. That rule of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle must be remembred as a speciall meanes of righteousnesse, <hi>Let him that stole,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4.28.</note> 
                  <hi>steale no more, but rather labour that which good is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we might the better practise these rules, we haue sundrie motiues in the word of God.<note place="margin">Motiues to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise these rules.</note> 1. God hath appointed his kindnes vnto vs thus to be recompenced, and herein will haue vs manifest the estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we haue of his grace: seeing therefore he hath set ouer his whole grace thus to be answered in our righteous dealing, we in buying, selling, reporting, and hearing reports, in magistracie and subiection, must shew what price we set on Gods mercie; and this we do, when all our dealings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> with men are a part of our obedience vnto God himselfe. 2. This righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is called a brestplate, whereby the heart is defended both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the assaults of Satan; for euen hereby we make our election sure, and lay vp good foundations; as also against the slanderous tongues of men. Hence Iob accused of hypocrisie cleared himselfe, through the whole 31. chapter of his booke, professing that he would neuer part with this righteousnesse, which both proceeded from, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>estified the faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and vprightnesse of his heart. 3. God hath made one man the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house of an other, and caused men not to liue as beasts, euerie one to shift for himselfe, but in societie for a more publike good; for which cause he hath distinguished the seuerall callings and conditions of life, in which he hath laid a peice of euerie mans welfare out of himselfe in some other, so as he that liues not to others as well as himselfe, liueth out of a lawfull calling. For example: in the magistrate the fatherles haue the
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:18792:244"/>
right of a father, the widowe of an husband, the blind of eyes, the lame of feet, and so in other callings, although not so publike. 4. Whosoeuer would haue Gods image restored and renewed vpon him, must exercise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> righteousnesse. God is truth it selfe, his image standeth in righteousnesse inward and outward: wouldst thou be like vnto God, practise this vertue in word and deede. And this was Satans sinne, he stood not in truth and righteousnesse, but was a lyer and murtherer from the beginning, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome vniust dealers or speakers conforme themselues.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And godly,</hi>] First,<note place="margin">1. The proper work of pietie.</note> the proper worke of pietie will appeare in this definition. <hi>Godlines is a grace, whereby God is rightly worshipped both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and outwardly.</hi> I say, <hi>rightly worshipped,</hi> that I might both include the knowledge of the true God, as he hath reuealed himselfe in his word, and faith, loue, and a sincere heart; as also exclude all false worship, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a false God, or of the true God in a false manner, whether in Pharisaicall hypocrisie, or Laodicean coldnes and lukewarmenes. I adde both <hi>inwardly:</hi> For, 1. God is a spirit. 2. the inside must be washed first. 3. all oblations, sacrifices, fasts, almes, vowes, are reiected as abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble without this, Isai. 1.10. <hi>And also outwardly:</hi> For, 1. God requireth the whole strength. 2. himselfe hath instituted diuerse outward actions of religion, as the hearing of the word, receiuing of Sacraments, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, obseruation of his Sabbaths, wherein we must professe our selues to be his, and wherein we cannot be wanting without some degree of contempt against himselfe. 3. God hath created, redeemed, gouerneth, and giueth his law to the whole man, yea to euery member how it should be ordered both in his worship, and out of it also.</p>
               <p>The second point is, the rules of practise,<note place="margin">2. Rules of practise.</note> and the principall are fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. 1. Learne to knowe God as he hath reuealed himselfe in his word; and reioyce more that thou knowest God shewing mercie, iudgement,<note place="margin">Ier. 9.23.</note> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> righteousnesse in the earth, then in wisedome, wealth, or strength: for all such reioycing as this is not good, and will not hold out. 2. Walke with God, and this is done two wayes. <hi>First,</hi> by the light of his word. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by the sight of himselfe. To doe the former, thou must giue vp thy owne reason, will, wisedome, affections. For how absurd will it seeme to reason, with the word to call the hungrie blessed; to account the rich vnhappie, to esteeme corrections loue: the Iulians of the world would scoffe at such paradoxes; who as the Prophet speaketh, walke by the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles of their owne fire: but the life of faith is, when the heart giueth vp the whole man vnto Gods leading, when his wisedome is become thy direction, and his word the men of thy counsell. And for the latter, thou must doe three things. <hi>First,</hi> set thy selfe often in his sight, and himselfe alwaies at thy right hand: let thy heart religiously thinke vpon him, and
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:18792:245"/>
his presence: let thy tongue reuerently speake of him and his goodnes. <hi>Secondly,</hi> whatsoeuer thou doest, whether thou eatest or drinkest, and much more performest the duties of thy calling, to which these are but seruants, doe all to his glorie: beeing about any thing, aske thy selfe, what glorie will redound to God by this speach, or by this action. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> by euery euent make this vse to gather still into his fellowship: by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blessing, gather encrease of faith, loue, and confidence in him: by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery crosse, adde vnto thy feare, reuerence, watchfulnesse: by euery speciall prouidence, obserue his admirable wisedome, truth, and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: and thus by euery thing growe vp in him: these are worthy fruits of pietie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third rule is, to keepe the set times of Gods worship both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke and priuate: for this is the pale, and preseruatiue of pietie, which whosoeuer hath, he will vse Gods meanes to preserue it. A godly heart reuerenceth and reioyceth in all holy things, the word, Sacraments, sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and striueth to make his house a little Church: and he that makes little or no conscience of the sabbath, and family duties, let him pretend what he will, is an vngodly person without all religion.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. Be carefull to attend the waies of thine owne heart: both how it subiecteth it selfe to the will of God <hi>written,</hi> whether it be desirous to receiue the law at his mouth, whether it tremble at the word; as also how it subiecteth it selfe to the will of God <hi>done:</hi> whether in prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, it lift vp it selfe to be something besides or without God, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in correction, it be silent vnto God, because he hath done it. Attend it how readie or heauie it is to lift it selfe vp in prayer for wants, in praise for supplies: whether it pray alwaies, or in all things giue thankes. Watch ouer it in thy seruices that it start not away, and leaue thy worship liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les without spirit, without truth; know that God is a spirit, and will be serued of thee (if aright) as he was of Paul, <hi>in thy spirit:</hi> and looke well to this matter, for Iudas can follow and reuerence Christ, and yet his heart going after couetousnesse, be practising to betraie him: and Herod can pretend to worship, when he intends to kill. Watch it further in the motions to sinne, whether it be zealous and resolute against it, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it sticke fast, and with full purpose vnto the Lord: whether it feare the least offence of God; or can swallow smaller sinnes: whether it bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the tongue from idle talke, and smaller oathes; vaile the eyes from wanton lookes; or whether it can easily digest such things, which are no small departures from God when occasion is offered, and know that such is thine heart, as it is found in temptation. Lastly, watch it in the motions of the spirit, how it entertaineth them; how stirring it is in the causes of God, as when occasion is offered of promoting Gods glorie in his
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:18792:245"/>
pure worship, or in the establishing of a conscionable ministrie; how it entertaineth such good motions offered; how it entertaineth Gods counsells, rebukes, and exhortations in the ministerie: a cleare case it is that those that neglect such motions, and much more resist them, are yet in their sinnes, and are no better then impious and vngodly persons.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In the loue of men, ioyne the loue of God: for charitie abstracted from pietie is a counterfeit: and this thou shalt doe, when thou louest <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> man in and for God, because of Gods image, and of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so as if thou seest godlinesse grow in any man, thy loue groweth with him, and if grace decaie as he estrangeth himselfe from God, so thou for his good, becommest more strange vnto him. For although by vertue of Gods commandement we must loue all, and do good vnto all; yet we must reserue a speciall loue to the image of God renued, and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially affect such as are of the houshold of faith.<note place="margin">Gal. 6.10.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> If these be the practises of pietie, which cannot be attained but by these rules,<note place="margin">Many sorts of men bewray the vngodlines of their hearts.</note> then shall many a one who take themselues to haue taken out this last lesson, be found non-proficients, and such as whom grace ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taught any such thing as godlinesse. And to omit to speake of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Esaus and Ismaels, scoffers of such as walke in these straite waies of God, tossers of reproaches against them, so farre from that inward and pure worship of the heart in spirit and truth; as they are open despisers of the outward ordinances of the word and sacraments, who are furthest from repentance, and verie seldome reclaimed; yea so monstrous and black are these filthie dogges and swine, as they are not more condemned of others then of themselues for most part. We will leaue to wash such bricks, and come first to our common people, whose extreame and secure ignorance, loads them with such a burthen of impietie, as it is impossible for them euer to stand vnder it when Christ shall appeare; and yet they thinke to get to heauen nimbly inough. For this whole practise of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is placed in that which they call a good meaning, and a good hope: but replie and tell them that grace is not contented with good meaning, but teacheth to liue godly, and so bringeth pietie into the life; they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that they could neuer make any shewes as many men can, but yet they hope they may haue as good hearts as the best to god-ward. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto if you demand, how that roote can be so good, which sendeth out such sower fruite; or that fountaine sweete which sendeth out such bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter water; for in these good hearts ignorance raigneth; and the goodnes of their hearts openly neglecteth the word, Sacraments, &amp;c. the means of saluation, and preseruatiues of pietie: they can answer, that they keepe their Church, and doe as the most doe; and if they receiue not the sacrament, it is because they are not reconciled to some that haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended

                  </gap> the matter further with them, and tell them your good heart sendeth out wicked oathes, bitter curses, and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imprecations, then they sweare either nothing but the truth, or by nothing but that which is good, or if they did happe to sweare or curse much, they were vrged vnto it. And for the sabboath adde, that whereas a good heart maketh it a delight to consecrate it as glorious vnto the Lord, neither your selfe nor yours obserue it. They say they doe as much as they need, and they know inough: for they loue God aboue all, and their neighbour as themselues; and for the sabboath what need such strictnesse, it was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: and as for this singing of Psalmes, and reading, and prayers in priuate houses, they must needs say it is too much precisenesse, and they cannot away with it; and they could neuer see hurt in giuing their seruants and children liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to goe on the saboath and doe what they list, and themselues may with good companie play and passe the time (so it be not seruice time) on the sunday, as well as other daies. But take all these pleas out of their mouths, and shew particularly that good treasuries would send out better things, they draw all to this one conclusion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What, we cannot be Saints here, that is, in plaine words, they cannot frame themselues to this life of pietie, and so are still without all the teaching of grace: and piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is to see, how many persons that thinke themselues no meane Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, debarre themselues from the practise of pietie by such ignorant conclusions as these: which I would not here haue reckoned, but that I know diuerse, perhapps of our daily hearers, whom grace hath offered to teach otherwise, thus tainted. Well, a fearefull delusion it is, to hope for saluation in such a dangerous estate.</p>
               <p>A second sort, farre differing from the former, are such as haue attained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> much more knowledge, but neuer yet attained this high point of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise to liue godly: they can make a shew of godly life, and Pharisaicall righteousnesse, but all is vnsound within: they can with Herod doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things at Iohns preaching, but it is but for a brunt of newfangled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: they can seeke God, but either in affliction, or for corne and oyle; but after freedome from the one, or fruition of the latter, let him alone till they need him againe: nay more, they can be zealous for good and quickly enflamed, but it is as fire in straw, a blase and away: they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue others for sinne, but can abide no reproofe themselues: they can reioyce in the word and be rauished, but as a man with sweete odours in the Apothecaries shoppe, but he carrieth none out with him; or as one is delighted with the sweet smell of hearbs, so long as he is in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but hath no vnderstanding or diligence to gather of euery kind some
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:18792:246"/>
to carie with him, that so he might haue the benefit of the garden when he is a great way from it. They can further attaine to many good things, as to delight in good mens fellowship, so did Iudas in Christs commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, gather from them many common graces of vnderstanding, speach, abilitie to pray, teach, comfort, exhort, but all to their owne hurt; for either they hide these talents in napkins, not vsing them at all, or in vsing them without humilitie, abuse them; yea not seldome making them bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to offend God, and more careles of duties vnto men, by meanes of such gifts, then if they had them not: but here is yet no teaching of grace, and better had it bin such had neuer knowne the way of truth, then thus to depart from the way of righteousnesse.</p>
               <p>A third sort there are, who many of them I doubt not are the Lords,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and haue a desire in truth, and for the most part to walke before him as beseemeth them; and yet whose liues are not so acquainted with such a course of Christianitie, but that oftentimes by corruptions not well watched against, they breake out to scandalls and reproaches of the Gospell, and in these some of them lie longer; as when professors can liue inordinately, not attending vpon their lawefull calling, but let themselues loose where God hath tyed them, becomming ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther busie bodies, or companions, or perhaps worse; which falls may for a time befall those which are the Lords: but yet grace hath not taught them so much as they make account of, and time will trie whether any thing at all in truth or no. And other Christians who in their worshippe of God, are often cold and dead hearted; and in their dealings can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to some ciuill men: can nourish contentions and heart burnings, misdeeme and misreport others, now &amp; then idle in their talke, or worse, vnprofitable in their liues; can bolster vp their friends, children, and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants in things worthie punishment, as Eli did: are not so frequent in watching the wayes of God with him, nor the wayes of his own heart; such I say may be schollers in this schoole, and Christians, but they haue forgotten their rules, and had neede hasten their repentance, that grace may nor order a great part, but their whole liues to a godly conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in respect of Magistrates, and others that are called Gods: for Christ is not a God (as they be) by office, or participation, for so he should be but a weake and little God, whereas he is a mightie God, both in his nature and essence: <hi>and who is God like our God,</hi> saith the Psalmist. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in regard of this his appearance; for although he shall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his iudiciarie power, and appeare as the Sonne of man; yet shall he be mightily declared to be the Sonne of God, much more then by his resurrection from the dead: the personall vnion of his diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, shall shine out as the sunne in his strength, which while he liued vpon earth, was vayled and hid. And thus it shall appeare,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his humane nature, he shall appeare the head of the Church his bodie, Ephes. 1.22. 2. His power shall be such as shall subdue all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> things vnto himselfe, and put them vnder his feete, euen Satan, sinne,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> hell, death, and damnation, Revel. 20.14. 1. Corinth. 15.28. Now his glorie cannot but be proportionable to his power: hence we read of <hi>the glorie of his power,</hi> 2. Thess. 1.9. 3. Hee shall come with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> such attendants, as no man is able to behold the glorie of the least of them: for he shall come with thousand thousands of his Angels beeing his Ministers, the glorie of all whome he shall so farre surmount, as the sunne doth the lesser starres in brightnesse. 4. Hee shall sit vpon his great white throne, Dan. 7.9. <hi>great,</hi> as beeing infinitely more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> then Salomons white yuorie throne; and <hi>white,</hi> answerable to the puritie and perfection of the iudge, and iudgement; and beeing set, he shall after the summons giuen to all flesh, and presented before him, declare and iudge not only open sinnes committed from the beginning,
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:18792:249"/>
but also (his godhead manifesting the same to his minde) euen the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of hearts, which none but God can doe; and then proceed to the pronouncing of a most righteous sentence, according to the qualities of the persons presented; the which sentence once vttered, it shall stand without all gainesaying for all eternitie; In all these then shall he shew himselfe as the sonne of man, so also the <hi>mightie God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now because this appearing is set out to be so glorious and fearefull, in that the person of this iudge shall be clothed with all his roabes of glorie and maiestie; least the godly hereby should be terrified and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited, least they should by reason of their sinnes and infirmities be afraid, and loath to behold this glorie; and least that they beeing in themselues so base and abiect, should beginne to conceiue, that they should be contemned, or neglected of him, who shall shew himselfe so glorious; the Apostle for the comfort of such addeth, that although he be a mightie God, yet is he also <hi>our Sauiour,</hi> and will not in all his glorie forget himselfe so to be: neither can neglect those for whose saluation he paid such a price as was his dearest blood. Where also by the way note, that these two titles, <hi>the mightie God, and our Sauiour,</hi> are not of two subiects, as some heretikes haue held, laboring thereby to elude this so pregnant a testimonie of the diuinitie of Christ, the weight of which so pressed them, as that they were gladde to flie to a miserable s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

those good things, the first fruits whereof haue here contented vs. To the confirming of which truth, it is <hi>first</hi> to be noted,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> that the Scripture speaketh in such phrases, as if the whole worke of the Gospel were no <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> other, then to raise vs vnto this blessed expectation: 1. Pet. 1.3. <hi>Who hath begotten vs againe to a liuely hope, &amp;c.</hi> that is, we who before were <hi>strangers and without hope,</hi> are now through the mercie of God,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.12.</note> by the Ministerie of the Gospel regenerated, and so restored to the hope of an inheritance not fading, immortall, reserued in the heauens: Coloss. 1.23. <hi>If yee be not mooued away</hi> (he saith not from the Gospel, but) <hi>from the hope of the Gospel,</hi> namely, those sweete promises of life, which are the verie matter of the Gospel. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the whole doctrine is called by the name of confidence, and hope, to shew, that one maine scope of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is, to raise the heart hereunto: Heb. 3.6. <hi>If we hold fast the confidence and reioysing of the hope:</hi> that is, the doctrine of the Gospel, whereby these are dispensed and confirmed; <hi>then are we the house of God. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the Apostle sometime speaketh, as if the whole worke of euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penser <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Gospel, were no other, or greater then to quiet the heart in this expectation: and that in his owne example, and the rest of the Apostles, 1. Thess. 1.10. <hi>Yee know what entring we had, and how we turned you from idols vnto God, and to looke for his Sonne from heauen:</hi> no sooner were they turned to God, but they waited for his sonne: and that all the gifts of Ministrie are bestowed to worke in beleeuers this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, we haue an expresse place, 1. Cor. 1.7. <hi>Ye are not destitute of any gift, wayting, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>lastly,</hi> it addeth to the euidence of this truth, that the faithfull are hereby marked as by their propertie; euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> such as with good seruants <hi>expect their Masters comming,</hi> Matth. 24.45. such <hi>as looke for him,</hi> Heb. 9.28. <hi>such as loue his appearing,</hi> 2. Tim. 4.8. such as beeing wise virgins and louing spouses, prepare themselues &amp; euery needfull thing for the bridgromes comming: and such as beeing strangers and pilgrims vpon the earth, haue their eyes still towards their country, who while they liue in earth, yet trafficke and haue their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in heauen, from <hi>whence they looke for a Sauiour.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Here is another triall,<note place="margin">Philip. 3.20.</note> to see whether we haue receiued this grace of the Gospell in truth, or in appearance only: If in truth,<note place="margin">Triall of our selues by the former doctrin.</note> then is the tast of the loue of Christ so sweet vnto vs, as that we cannot but long after our fill of him in his appearing: the sonnes of the Church, begotten by the Gospel, cannot but waite for the adoption of sonnes: the Church <hi>is sicke of loue</hi> after him whom her soule loueth: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon voice of the spouse is <hi>Amen,</hi> vnto the promise of Christs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: Rev. 22.21. the bride saith, <hi>Come,</hi> and doubleth her desire and ardencie saying, Amen, Amen:<note place="margin">Cant. 2.5.</note> so as they are none of Christs spouses
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:18792:250"/>
that say not <hi>come.</hi> Neuer thinke then that thy heart is right affected, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou find in it this desire, and breathing after Christ thy life: for this is a speciall note of discerning betweene the godly and the wicked; the one hath the spirit which saith <hi>come,</hi> the other shake at the mention of this comming: the one longeth till these <hi>shadowes flie away, and that day breake on them</hi>;<note place="margin">Cant. 2.17.</note> the other can no more desire his comming, then the guiltie fellon can the comming and presence of the iudge.</p>
               <p>But that no man may be deceiued in this triall, examination must be more particularly made, whether this wayting be such as the Scripture prescribeth, lest by mistaking it, men faile of that comfort they leane vnto in their most need.</p>
               <p>Be sure then that thy wayting be sound and true, 1. in the <hi>ground</hi> of it: 2. in the <hi>qualities:</hi> 3. in the sound <hi>fruits</hi> and effects of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of Christ, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired 1. a sound ground.</note>The <hi>ground</hi> of this expectation, must be the free promise of God for all our future welfare, applied by faith vnto our owne hearts: the which promise of God being most certaine, and our faith also as certenly laying hold thereon, giueth such a certaintie to our hope, as the Scripture bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speaketh, <hi>it can neuer make vs ashamed:</hi> yea and ascribeth <hi>a full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance vnto it,</hi> Heb. 6.11. and calleth it the <hi>sure and stedfast aucre of the soule, vers.</hi> 19. This ground distinguisheth our Christian hope, from those iogling perswasions of the Papists,<note place="margin">Lumbard. 3. sent. distinct. 26.</note> which they call hope: for aske them concerning their hope, what it is? they tell vs, that it is a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion arising partly from the grace of God, and partly from our owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding merits. But vrge them, and say, mee thinke there should be no great comfort nor setlednesse, to leane vpon a vertue founded vpon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: they will tell you, that indeede no man can be sure of his saluation, for that were too much presumption: but doe well and hope well; hope well and haue well. But against them we affirme, that Christian hope buildeth <hi>certaintie</hi> vpon <hi>speciall</hi> faith (neither of which they can abide to heare of) without speciall reuelation, and that by this reason: Looke what was the ground of Abrahams hope, the same must be the ground of the hope of all beleeuers: but the <hi>free promise</hi> of God applied by <hi>faith in speciall,</hi> was the ground of Abrahams hope and wayting, Rom. 4.20.21. <hi>Hee doubted not, but was strengthened in faith,</hi> beeing <hi>fully assured</hi> that he which <hi>had promised was able to doe it.</hi> There is no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie here, but that Abraham had a speciall word, for speciall faith to be grounded, which (say they) we want. But I answer, that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we haue in substance a particular word, in that God who hath giuen the promise hath also giuen a commandement to euery beleeuer to apply it in speciall to himselfe: 1. Ioh. 3.23. and this is equiualent to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular word. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But it is presumption to hope without merits. <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <pb n="485" facs="tcp:18792:250"/>
It is indeed presumption to hope for them, they beeing so farre inferiour to the thing hoped for. Againe, it is faith and not presumption, to hope for saluation in and for the merits of Christ, though not for our own. So much of the ground, the qualities follow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the qualities whereby the soundnesse of this Christian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation is discerned, are fowre.<note place="margin">2. sound quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which are fowre.</note> 1. It must climbe aboue all humane sence and reason; for it is no wayting with carnall eyes, but with the eies of faith, which the Apostle defineth to be the existence of things not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> seene: and sight extinguisheth hope, which is of future good things: nay more, it must hope often the cleane contrarie to that which it seeth, as Abraham was said to <hi>hope aboue hope,</hi> when he saw nothing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in Sarah, in the whole course of nature, but things which would haue dashed his hopes; euen so here while within our selues we can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold little besides our sinnes and infirmities; while without our selues we haue Esau hating vs in his heart, and Ismael persecuting vs with the tongue; while in this life we are compassed with miseries, in the ende of this life with death, after this life with the graue and corruption of it; all which seeme to ecclipse our hopes, and cut them short; yet now is the time that our hope must be working,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note> and <hi>looking at things within the vaile,</hi> that as a strong staffe it may vphold vs in a godly course.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second sound qualitie of this hopefull expectation is, that it must be <hi>patient</hi>; for what <hi>we hope we expect with patience,</hi> Rom. 8.25. and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> so necessarie is patience vnto hope, that the Apostle calleth this waiting by the name of patience it selfe, 2. Thess. 3.5. The Lord guide your hearts <hi>to the wayting for of Christ:</hi> that is, to endure in waiting for Christ.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> And we haue neede of patience to enioy the promises: Abraham himselfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed not the promise, till he had waited patiently, Heb. 6.15. we shall deceiue our selues if we looke to be wrapt into heauen, as Enoch and Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as were; seeing the promises of life goe with exception of the crosse, which will trie our patience. We knowe there is a time promised, we may neither prescribe it, nor if we beleeue <hi>make hast</hi>;<note place="margin">Isa. 28.16.</note> but as the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man patiently expecteth the fruites of the earth; much more should we possesse our soules in patience, to reape our fruites and haruest in heauen.</p>
               <p>The third qualitie is a sighing and longing after the thing hoped for: the heart that waiteth for such things hath both a griefe for the absence,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and a groaning desire after the presence and possession of them: Rom. 8.23. <hi>We sigh in our selues, waiting for the adoption, euen the redemption of our bodie.</hi> To this purpose saith Salomon, that hope deferred,<note place="margin">Prou. 13.12.</note> 
                  <hi>paineth the heart.</hi> Thus should we be sicke of loue, and neuer finde our selues well and at ease in any thing below, neuer thinke our selues happie in things
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:18792:251"/>
present, which are indeed but prison-ioyes, in comparison of the ioyes of heauen; but (as crazed persons) be euer complaining, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, Oh who shall <hi>deliuer mee from this bodie of death?</hi> Now who seeth not that this qualitie includeth an earnest loue of Iesus Christ, whome we therefore waite for, because wee loue him: whence the Apostle Paul fitly knitteth these two together, 2. Thess. 3.5. <hi>The Lord guide your hearts to the loue of God,</hi> and <hi>the waiting for of Christ:</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thence that we cannot waite on the Lord Iesus Christ, vnlesse we first loue him.</p>
               <p>The fourth qualitie, is a reioycing in that our hopes shal certenly come: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Rom. 5.2. <hi>we reioyce vnder the hope of the glorie of God,</hi> that is, that we shall partake one day of his glorie. Excellent is that place in 1. Pet. 1.8. <hi>whome we haue not seene, and yet we loue him, and beleeue in him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce with ioy vnspeakeable and glorious, receiuing the ende of faith which is saluation.</hi> And surely if Abraham the father of our faith, reioyced to see the day of Christs humilitie <hi>so farre off,</hi> euen 2000. yeares, how ought we his beleeuing children reioyce to see the day of his and our own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie approaching so neere, that now is euen the last minute of the last houre? how should we reioyce in that the time of refreshing and restoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things is come? and if we be spouses of this bridegroome, wee cannot but (as we are exhorted) <hi>reioyce in that the marriage of the lambe is come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 19.7. 1. Pet. 5.4.</note> and the day of our owne coronation with an <hi>incorruptible crowne</hi> of glorie.</p>
               <p>The third thing to trie the soundnesse of this expectation, is by the <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects</hi> of it, and these be fowre. 1. It purifieth and purgeth the heart and life,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.3. 3. sound effects, which are also foure.</note> 
                  <hi>whosoeuer hath this hope, purgeth himselfe:</hi> for he that waiteth for Christ, wayteth for this ende, to <hi>be like him:</hi> and therefore conformeth himselfe daily vnto his similitude, and becommeth <hi>pure as he is pure</hi>: the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which puritie (howsoeuer it bee esteemed of in the world) whosoeuer profiteth not in, he cannot hope nor waite for Christ. If a man after the tearme of a fewe yeares hope for a large reuenue, he cannot, nor will not in the meane time take the way to cut off all his hopes, but rather make wayes for the accomplishment, and preuent whatsoeuer would come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene him and them. It is true that the blood of Christ purgeth vs from all sinne, by satisfying for it, and meritting the spirit of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for beleeuers; but yet we must purge our selues, by manifesting that we receiue not this grace in vaine, nor neglect the meanes wherein we are to testifie our thankefulnesse, which is by striuing against iniquitie. The Scripture noteth him to be an euill seruant, that saith, he wayteth for his masters comming, and yet he beateth his fellowe seruants, and sitteth downe with drunkards: such hopes as these ende in vaine perswasion,
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:18792:251"/>
when presumption and vngrounded confidence confoundeth the person that giueth them harbor. Dost thou hope then to be like Christ when he appeareth? thou must then resemble him in this life, beeing in thy mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure pure, holy, innocent, meeke, louing, and obedient: professe hope without this conformitie vnto Christ, it is but a pretence, all is vnsound and deceitfull.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It not onely freeth from sinne, but frameth to obedience both cherefull and constant: whereof we haue a pregnant example in Christ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> himselfe, whom we are commanded to looke at for imitation; who for <hi>the ioy that was set before him, endured the crosse, and despised the shame.</hi> So also are the Saints in their measure looking to the ioy before them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, both in labours and sufferings: hope worketh the will,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.2.</note> it setteth the hands and holdeth them to worke: it putteth a difference betweene the workes of Christians and ciuill men: they attempt Christian duties that their master may finde them well doing, and hold out also in well doing; but these vndertake sightly duties, but in some by-respect or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and wanting this hope are off and on; especially in difficulties, they giue vp all; whereas the Christian, who hath the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in his eye, can esteeme with Moses, the rebuke of Christ great ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This hope taketh off our fierie edge and heat of affections from the world, and setteth them aboue: it fixeth the eie vpon things within the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vaile, the glory of which dimme and obscure all the glorie of the world: it causeth refusall of the pleasures of sinne for a season: it maketh treasures of Egypt seeme small, yea vile in a mans eie comparatiuely: the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this resurrection, maketh the mocks and contempts of the world to be contemned; yea sentences of death, nay executions lightly estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of: this hope hath carried martyrs through fires, feares, lyons dens, teeth; and a thousand kinds of death, through all which they hastened to the fruition of the thing hoped for, in which onely they looked for securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and contentment.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It beeing the daughter of faith waeeth not wearie, but still vseth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the best meanes for the obtaining the thing hoped. It is importunate with God by prayer, for the comming of Christ, and (as Iacob) wrastleth with God, when it hath nothing but it selfe to sustaine faith: yea and preuaileth with the Cananitish woman after many repulses: they that haue this hope, pray for all the meanes which hasten this comming; for the free passage of the Gospel, the peace of Ierusalem; the puritie of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrine, which themselues loue and beleeue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and propagate vnto others by word and example, that so farre as lyeth in them, the number may be euerie way accomplished. And further, they greiue and sorrowe when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:18792:252"/>
of these are hindered, when the state of the ministerie and ministers is destitute and distressed; when the light and life of professors is obscured and darkened, when errors are broached, maintained, and receiued: for these are things comming betweene them and their hopes, and the iust causes of heauines and griefe.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Now this triall will discouer to many men their estates, who lay hold on the doctrine of grace to saluation, but not to instructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

In regard of the nearnesse of it: the Apostles time was the last houre, and ours then cannot but be the last minute: a fearefull thing and full of danger it is, to conceiue that the Master will deferre his comming, or that the Lord is slow, as men count slacknesse; or that the law is but a scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow because fellons are put in prison, and bound ouer to the assises, and not presently executed. This day may be nearer in it selfe, at least to thy selfe then thou thinkest for; and yet a verie little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarrie. Let vs applie our hearts hereunto a little. Euery man when he seeth euery thing grow worse and worse can say, surely the world draweth neare an end: and much more may we, who haue our senses exercised in the word, when we see Satan so busie and stirring in the plotting, contriuing, and executing mischeefe against the Church, may we not conclude, that surely his time is verie short? when we see particular iudgements vpon our countrie, lingring and durable plagues, threatnings of whole kingdomes and countries; with visible iudgements vpon particular persons; why doe we not conclude that surely these are forerunners of the general, and that it is not farre off. If we see the sunne; and moone, &amp; great lights in the Church fall from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and be darkned; if the starres, the professors of the Gospel, loose their shine, and fall from their first loue; why doe we not thinke that shortly the heauens themselues shall shriule away like a scroule, and be no more? seeing the Scriptures affirme that immediatly after such things this appearing shall be. In a word, when we see such generall securitie, that all men cry peace, peace, vnto themselues; if we shall perceiue Noah daies returned againe in which men eate, and drinke, build, and plant, marrie and giue in marriage, and thinke <hi>nothing,</hi> either <hi>nothing</hi> else or <hi>nothing</hi> more; how is it that we cannot conceiue of this appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, which shall be as a flood and destruction to all that thinke not of it? for as a snare shall it come vpon all the vngodly of the earth.</p>

An excellent meanes to prouoke men vnto the duties of Christianitie, is the consideration of Christs comming vnto iudgement.<note place="margin">The expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ is a notable meanes to prouoke men to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an duties. 1. To attempt them.</note> For some might haue asked the Apostle, but how shall we be able to goe through the duties you haue described, and hold out against the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold discouragements which in the entertainment of this doctrine we are sure to meete withall? the answer is; <hi>Wayting for the appearance of the mightie God our Sauiour.</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> it is a notable meanes to set and enter men into this course of godlinesse: and this is cleare in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, where we may obserue the spirit of God vsing this consideration, as a speciall motiue both to draw men out of their sinnes, together with the loue of this world; as also to plant in them the feare and reverence of the Lord: all which must be done, before men can come to breathe in the common ayre of Christians. For the first, how doth the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reuoke the young man from his vnbridled vanitie, and from walking in the sight of his owne eyes, and lust of his owne heart, but by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that <hi>for all this hee must come to iudgement.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 11.9.</note> This was the argument vsed by Peter to the people of Ierusalem who flocked to see the lame man, who laie at the bewtifull gate of the Temple healed, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your liues, and turne, that your sinnes may be put away when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord, and he shall send Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 3.18, 19.</note> By the same argument would the Apostle Paul haue wonne the Athenians from their idolatries, Act. 17.30. <hi>But now he would haue all men to repent, because he hath appointed a day, in which he will iudge the world:</hi> and haue reclaimed vnhappie <hi>Felix</hi> from his wicked and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, when he made him <hi>tremble in hearing the iudgement to come.</hi>

To the forsaking of the world in the profits and pleasures of it, how effectuall this perswasion is, the Apostle in his owne example declareth, Philip. 3.7. who accounted all aduantages losse, yea dung to attaine the resurrection of the dead: while his minde was vpon the resurrection and Christs appearing, he was mortified vnto the world, and the world vnto

                  <note place="margin">Act. 26.22.</note> For what other thing could any of the Prophets write concerning Christ, but either touching his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, or his glorie? and how could himselfe haue beene raised but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or we but by his abasement? Let not therefore both thine eyes be fixed (as the Iewes are) vpon the basenesse of his first comming, but let one behold (as a Christian) the glorie of this second appearing, which shall abundantly counteruaile the humilitie of the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. The glorie of this second appearing, is a terror to all the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, who haue despised his humilitie, and his still voice in the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Gospel. For whosoeuer now in this his appearance of grace, will not tremble at his word, to frame their soules to the obedience of it, shall at this second appearance of glorie, tremble to dust at his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and not be able to abide the brightnesse of his glorie. Those that are now ashamed of him, and that contempt and dishonour that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his profession, shall then be ashamed of themselues, when the Sonne of God shall be ashamed of them. And as for such as daily pearce him with the speares and nayles of their sinnes, they shall be sure to see him thus glorious whom they haue pearced, when themselues shal be pearced with shame and sorrow to their endles confusion.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. To comfort the faithfull, seeing there is a time when they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shall appeare in glorie: they must be content first to suffer with Christ, before they can raigne with him, and weare the crowne of thornes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this crowne of glorie: the Lord dealing herein with them as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his children, who though they be borne to neuer so great pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and estates, yet in their minoritie subiecteth them to such discipline as befitteth their yeares, before he bestow their portion vpon them. God hath his children now in the world, the world knoweth them not, nor seeth their glorie: nay they themselues cannot in any clearenesse behold their owne glorie, for no eye can see the full glorie of the Saints, till the fulnes of Christs glorie appeare: but when this time commeth, the least of them shall be knowne to be <hi>Kings sonnes</hi>; so as the Deuil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and his wicked instruments, who can now accuse them, and say, there goes an Hypocrite, there goes a Precisian, a Puritane, a dissembler, and are offended at the low &amp; base estate of the Saints here, shall change their note, and be compelled to say, there goes a child of God, there

Now for our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, we haue the Scriptures insisting in magnifying God, and Christ, and the blessed Spirit, in their titles and attributes, especially for these three ends.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> 
                  <hi>First,</hi> to shew what a one God is in himselfe, as here to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> shew what a person Christ is, namely full of glorie, might, and mercie, our Apostle is much and large in his stile and attributes. To this purpose the Prophet Isay in one place giueth him fiue titles. His name shall be called <hi>Wonderfull, Counsellor, the mightie God, the euerlasting Father, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the Prince of peace. Secondly,</hi> not onely for the glorie of God, but for the benefit of the Church; 1. That hereby they might acknowledge him to be the true God: so the Prophet Ieremie opposing the true God against all idols and false gods, speaketh most highly of him, <hi>There is none like vnto thee, O Lord, thou art great, and thy name is great in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 10.6.</note> and in the next verse, he calleth him <hi>King of nations,</hi> and challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth all <hi>dominion</hi> to belong vnto him. And our Apostle when he would bring the Athenians to the acknowledgement of the onely Lord, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth many and great things vnto him: as that he <hi>made the world, and all things else,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.24, 25.</note> 
                  <hi>that he is Lord of heauen and earth, that he giueth to all, life, breath, and all things: that he made of one blood all mankind, that he assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their times and the bounds of their habitation, that in him we liue, &amp; mooue, and haue our beeing, vers.</hi> 28. 2. That after this acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we might prouoke our selues to answerable duties for example. In
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:18792:256"/>
consideration of his mercie, to breake out into his due prayses: Psal. 3.3. <hi>Thou Lord art my buckler, my glorie, and the lifter vp of mine head.</hi> Isa. 12.2. <hi>Behold, God is my saluation, I will trust and will not feare, for the Lord is my strength and song, he is also become my saluation.</hi> In regard of his omnipotence, to studie for vprightnesse: Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am God all sufficient, walke before mee, and be vpright.</hi> In meditation of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence, to be euery where reuerent because of his eye: Act. 10.33. <hi>We are all here present before God, &amp;c.</hi> In respect of his truth, to relie our selues vpon it: 1. Chro. 17.27. <hi>Thou hast blessed, and it shall be blessed.</hi> Exod. 3.14. Moses must tell the children of Israel, <hi>that I Am hath sent mee:</hi> that is, who giueth beeing to all things, and especially to this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of your deliuerance out of Egypt now at the end of 400. yeares. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> another end of Gods titles in Scripture is, that we should not onely glorifie God, and edifie our selues, but also stirre vp others to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> praise and worship of the true God, who hath thus made himselfe knowne vnto vs: Psal. 95.3.6. Come let vs worship, &amp;c. for the Lord is a <hi>great God:</hi> namely, in beeing, knowledge, mercie, and power: Psal. 40.9. <hi>I haue declared thy righteousnesse in the great congregation, I haue not hid it, nor concealed thy mercie and truth.</hi> And surely whosoeuer hath his heart filled with God and sence of his goodnesse, cannot not onely himselfe, but reuerently speake of him, but also bring others to a feeling and loue of him; such a one I say cannot but bring men to confesse the Lord, and make his workes known vnto the sonnes of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Which condemneth all the trifling vse of the name of God and Christ, the which no man shall guiltlessely lift vp in vaine, whether <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in a vaine matter, or in a vaine manner; for it is not said, that he that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it vp malitiously, or falsely, or blasphemously, but vainely, shall not be guiltlesse, and much lesse these other. 2. Euen many of our selues are iustly reprooued, who seldome or neuer haue broken out into the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prayses of Gods power, loue, iustice, &amp;c. or Christs greatnesse, grace, or saluation by him; the <hi>law of grace</hi> is not vnder our lippes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>hearts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This doctrine occasioneth vs to resolue, neuer hereafter to take the name of God or Christ vp into our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> mouthes, but when either our owne hearts glorifie and reuerence him, or else to stirre vp our selues or others to take benefit by the same. 4. In the reading of these titles in the Scriptures, labour to obserue and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

               <p>In this verse our Apostle vseth another forceable argument, to vrge the deniall of vnrighteousnesse, and practise of the former vertues of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, iustice, and pietie; for the Gospel not onely teacheth these things, which while we professe it, we must adorne, but also if we looke for any benefit by the death of Christ, we may not like <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iuen vessells, let this doctrine slip; for to what other end did Christ so willingly giue himselfe to death for beleeuers in his name, but that they should reape the double fruit of it, mentioned in the verse. First, <hi>redemption</hi> from sinne; and secondly, <hi>sanctification:</hi> the which 1. inwardly <hi>purgeth</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers to become the <hi>Lords owne peculiar:</hi> 2. causeth them outwardly to shine out in the <hi>zealous</hi> practise <hi>of good workes.</hi> Well knew our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle how close sinne sitteth vnto vs, and how heauie our frailtie is vnto that which is good in Gods eyes; and therefore whereas if we were wise to doe well, one word were inough: he forceth and presseth vs with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse arguments, and those so waightie, as euen in mans iudgement, and much more in Gods, he is iudged vnworthy of life that shall despise them. For suppose there be such gracelesse men, as by the appearing of grace cannot be mooued, or will not he be taught, when he heareth that the Sonne of God himselfe came downe from heauen, to deliuer the blessed doctrine of saluation vnto his Church; let such see rather then heare an argument more weightie, let them cast their eye vpon the death of Christ, who willingly suffered such torments as are vnconceiueable; and all to abolish sinne, and raise sinners out of their graues of sinne and death, vnto the life of grace and glorie. And though some may be found so gracelesse, as they will haue nothing to doe with this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of grace; yet seeing none is so desperately gone, as to refuse his part in the death of Christ, let this be a motiue vnto such, as with whome any thing in the world can preuaile, to the timely taking vp the practise of the former precepts, of which we haue spoken at large.</p>
               <p>In speaking of this argument, seeing the Apostle hath cast it into so excellent an order to our hands, we will accordingly followe the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches laid downe, and they are two. <hi>First,</hi> the <hi>fact of</hi> Christ, <hi>who gaue himselfe for vs:</hi> secondly, the <hi>fruits</hi> of it: which are two, 1. <hi>redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he might redeeme vs:</hi> 2. <hi>sanctification,</hi> and <hi>purge vs to be a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

people, &amp;c.</hi> The meaning of the particulars we will giue, as we come vnto them.</p>
               <p>In the former part of the verse, containing the fact of Christ, are three points to be noted: 1. the giuer, <hi>who.</hi> 2. the gift, <hi>gaue himselfe,</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all that passion to which he gaue himselfe. 3. the persons for whom, <hi>for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> the giuer is noted in the words immediately going before, to be <hi>Iesus Christ our Sauiour. Obiect.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">How Christ gaue himselfe for vs.</note> But God the Father gaue Christ for vs, and therefore he gaue not himselfe. <hi>Ans.</hi> God the Father gaue his Sonne, and Christ the Sonne gaue himselfe by one and the selfe same will; and one ioynt and inseparable operation of them both, together with the holy Ghost: Ioh. 5.19. <hi>whatsoeuer the Father doth, that same doth the Sonne. Obiect.</hi> But Iudas, the Iewes, and Pilate, gaue Christ for vs to passion, and therefore not himselfe. <hi>Answ.</hi> They did indeede concurre in the same action with the Father, and the Sonne, but in a farre diuerse manner, and ende: they in malice, but these in admirable loue: they not <hi>for vs,</hi> but Pilate for feare, Iudas for couetousnesse, the Iewes to please their Priests and rulers; but these gaue him <hi>for vs,</hi> and for our saluation: neither had any of them any power to haue giuen Christ to the least part of passion, if it had not beene giuen them of the Father, and of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, who had <hi>power to lay downe his life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 10.18.</note> and none could take it from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> but the gift will better manifest the giuer: he <hi>gaue himselfe,</hi> the which that we may the better vnderstand, we must withall consider vnto what Christ gaue himselfe, for so the consequent fruits shall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter discouered: and that I say in one word, was vnto passion. The which passion must not be restrained to the time of his death, but extended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the whole course of his life: as namely, the laying downe of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and glorie, wherein he was equall vnto his father, to become man: and beeing man, whereas he might haue vsed heauenly qualities of soule and bodie, his mind free from sorrowe, feare, greife; his bodie from hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirst, wearines, &amp;c. and at least haue beene like Adam before his fall; yet he tooke our nature, subiect to all infirmities since the fall, only sinne excepted: hence was it, that he was borne in a stable, laid in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.7.</note> of poore parents that had but a paire of turtles to bring for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; brought vp by the labour of his hands; and entring into his office he must beginne with strong temptations: in the execution of it, he became a seruant vnto all, for himselfe came not to be serued; he washed his disciples feete; he went about with wearinesse from citie to citie to preach: yea more, the lawgiuer subiected himselfe vnto the law, that he might redeeme them that were vnder the lawe: the Lord of life gaue
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:18792:258"/>
himselfe vnto death, not ignominious only before men, but accursed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: the Fathers delight and darling, became the obiect of such wrath, as would haue crushed all creatures in heauen and earth to peeces. Now the bitternesse of this passion in and about the time of his death, may appeare, 1. by his complaint to his Father in the garden, testifying how heauie his soule was vnto it, which if it had beene but an ordinarie death, it could not haue dismaied him, no more then many martyrs who haue not shrunke at it. 2. By the strange droppes of water and blood that fell from his face. 3. His sundrie cries to his father, that if it were possible the cuppe of death might passe from him. 4. By those most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie things, which the most innocent lambe of God suffered at the hands of sinners; beeing taken as a theefe with swords and staues, bound and carried away, and brought as a malefactor before the Magistrate: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whome, though he was cleared, yet must he be scourged by the Iewes; stript of his owne apparell, cloathed with scornefull kingly robes, the crowne of thornes, and a reede put in his hand in stead of a scepter; lead away as a sheepe to the slaughter, where betweene two theeues, as the chiefe of all sinners, he was crucified, his ioynts stretched and racked, his hands and feete digged with nayles, his side peirced with a speare: in stead of drinke, he had vinegar tempered with gall reached him: all sorts of men mocked him that trusted in his God: the high Priests scoffed, the passengers wagged their heads, the souldiers flouted him, nay, the verie theife on the crosse could with his last breath blaspheame him. 5. But all this seemed lesse then nothing to that which he inwardly felt, beeing as one oppressed and forsaken of God, which made him crie out, <hi>my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me.</hi> Thus did the Sonne of God make exchange of the greatest glorie aboue all comprehension, with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test infamie, and the greatest ioyes with the greatest sorrowes that can be imagined, euen the sorrowes of hell: the which considerations notably set out the qualitie of this passion, vnto which our Lord gaue himselfe.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The speciall things obiected by the Papists against this truth, are two: first, that Christ is indeede such a Priest as we speake of;<note place="margin">The Popish di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Priests into primarie and secondarie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne.</note> but they distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Priests: Christ is the chiefe and principall, but there may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarie and inferiour Priests by whom, Christ still offereth himselfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and in these Christs sacrifice is perpetuated. But as our learned Fulke speaketh;<note place="margin">vpon Hebr. 7.</note> If all externall priesthood before Christ was but a figure
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:18792:259"/>
of the the eternall priesthood of Christ; and if Christ haue abolished all externall sacrificing priesthood that was before, and instituted no other in the newe Testament to suceede him, then must the Popish shauelings bring forth a third Testament, to prooue their secondarie Priests and priesthood, seeing it hath no footing nor ground neither in the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, nor in the newe. 2. Besides, this distinction flatly ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Apostles position, who by this sacrifice of Christ, ouerthroweth all the sacrifices of such Priests as are mortall, and of such as had need to offer first for their owne sinnes, and then for the peoples, as the legall Priests did, and the Papall doe. Nay more, it ouerthroweth it selfe, for whereas the Papists say, that the sacrifice of the masse is the verie same sacrifice which was offered by Christ himselfe vpon the crosse, and that verie Christ is offered by them, this is against all reason; seeing the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vpon the crosse was offered by himselfe alone, without the helpe of any ministers, except they meane such as Pilate, Caiphas, Iudas, and the souldiers, and such ministers we will easily graunt their secondarie mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to be. 3. The nature of this sacrifice will not admit of that foolish distinction, seeing it cannot be offred by any but the high Priest, euen he that was the <hi>high Priest of things to come,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 9.11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>who was not euerie yeare to enter once into the holy of holies with the blood of beasts, but once for all hath he entred into the holy place, and obtained eternall redemption for vs:</hi> and if eternall redemption be obtained where there is no remission of sinne, there is no more neede of oblation for sinne. 4. Whereas they say that Christ indeede is the onely Priest to offer a bloody sacrifice, and that is but once done and cannot be repeated; but yet ought daily to be offred in an vnbloodly manner by their Priests for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead.<note place="margin">Mors necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius modus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis, tolle mortem tollis oblationem.</note> The Apostle taketh away that euasion, affirming that <hi>without blood there is no remission</hi>; and that if Christ be <hi>offered any more, he must of necessitie suffer againe,</hi> Heb. 9.22.26.</p>

And if there were no meanes to apply Christs merit vnto beleeuers, then by daily offring himselfe with it; then were there no meanes to apply vnto vs the fruit and benefit of his incarnation, death, resurrection, or ascension, vnlesse he should be borne, die, rise, and ascend euerie day, for the reason is the selfe same.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Where it is said that Christ <hi>gaue</hi> himselfe, it may be further noted, that his whole passion and death was voluntarie: for what is more free then gift: and this appeareth in that he was wont to say before hand, that he must goe <hi>away</hi> vnto his father, that he must <hi>leaue</hi> the world, and his disciples;<note place="margin">Ioh. 10.17, 18.</note> that he had power <hi>to lay downe his life,</hi> and take it vp againe: and that no man could take it from him: for who could take that life from him, whose sinneles nature of it selfe was not obnoxious to death, it beeing the stipend of sinne. And further, it is briefly to be obserued, how the holy Ghost thorough the whole historie hath noted speciall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which confirme the same truth. As 1. when the time drewe neere that he should leaue the world, he foretelleth to his disciples, that he must goe to Ierusalem, and suffer many things, and be crucified, and yet he went; yea when Peter tooke him aside, and entreated him to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour himselfe, he checked him more sharpely then we reade that euer he did any of the rest, <hi>Get thee behind me Satan:</hi> he would not patiently heare any thing which might worke the least vnwillingnes in him. 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>When he came to Ierusalem, did he withdrawe himselfe when he knewe the Iewes sought to apprehend him, as he at some other times had done? no verily, but knowing that Satan had put into the heart of Iudas to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray him, he went to his accustomed place of prayer, which Iudas well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> knewe, and whether he knewe he would bring his route. 3. When the companie came to apprehend him, although he let them knowe by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting them all to the ground, that he could haue resisted or avoided them, yet he let them rise againe, he told them he was the man they sought, and deliuered himselfe into their hands: yea more, the text saith, he went out to meete them, shewing the truth of that prophesie, Psal. 40.6. In the roule of the booke it is <hi>written of me, that I am readie to doe thy will.</hi> And as he would not resist in his owne person, so when Peter made a rash resistance, and in his rescue smote off Malcus his eare, Christ immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healed the wound, wished him to sheath his sword, and asked him if he thought not that he could command a legion of angels if he would: but how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled? 4. When he was brought <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> before the Iudge, he denied no part of that truth, which he knewe they would wrest against him; shewing in all his answers a presen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> minde and courage with all meekenesse in suffering horrible contumelies, without perturbation or confusion, vttering such holy speeches as became the most innocent lambe of God: as his holy Apostle noteth, that he witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>a good confession before Pontius Pilate.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.13.</note> 5. When he came to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> place of execution, he needed no helpe to die, he refused the cup of vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:18792:260"/>
which in likelihood was reached him, to shorten the sence of his paine: and that his soule willingly left his bodie, besides that strong crie at his death and expiration, which argued no languishing death: all the Euangelists note that Christ <hi>sent out</hi> his soule, or gaue vp his spirit: yea, in great wisedome he preuented the souldeirs violence, in breaking his legges, or offering him while he was yet aliue any deadly wound; that he might manifest that he did not violently, but voluntarily vndergoe that passion, and drinke of the bitternesse of that cuppe. By all which seuerals, we perceiue the truth of that the Apostle speaketh, Philip. 2.8. that Christ was made <hi>obedient vnto the death</hi>; and this made it an acceptable sacrfice: for had it not beene a free-will offring, it had not beene accepted.

               <p>The third and last point to be considered in this fact of Christ, is the persons for whom he gaue himselfe, <hi>for vs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Christ gaue himselfe for his Church, &amp; not for euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man.</note> The which words by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of the verse, must be expounded only of beleeuers, of which number the Apostle was; and are not to be meant of all mankind, as though Christ gaue himselfe for an vniuersall saluation of euery particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar man, or intended to saue all, if they would beleeue, as they who are tearmed the Lutheran Diuines doe contend.

aswell of Iudas, Caine, as any other; and consequently their sinnes must necessarily be remitted: for satisfaction for sinne, and remission of sinne, are inseparable: so the Apostle maketh redemption nothing else but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne, Ephes. 1.17. <hi>By</hi> whom we haue <hi>redemption by his blood, euen remission of sinne:</hi> and where remission of sinne is, must need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which if it had beene so, then was the Apostle mistaken in saying, that the <hi>Iust suffered for the vniust</hi>; whereas he should haue said, the iust suffered both for the iust and vniust. Besides, this guing of himselfe, withstandeth any meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for himselfe: for if it was necessarie that he should merit for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, his obedience could not be voluntarie. And what an absurd thing is it, to thinke that it was necessarie for Christ beeing God, to descend from heauen, become man, and condescend to most bitter death, the graue, and sorrowes of hell for his owne sake? For what could he merit which he had not from his first conception, or which was not due to his manhood from that conception, by reason of the vnion of it with the word, the second person? what could it want, which had such insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fellowship with the deitie it selfe? who in the midst of his abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, his flesh beeing the flesh of the word, could not want any glorie, although he was pleased to hide it for the time of his passion. Lastly, the humane nature of Christ is a creature, and can therefore merit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the creator, to whom all obedience is debt. 2. it was guided and mooued wholly by the diuine, and in that regard could not merit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing for it selfe; for a meritorious worke must be in the owne power of the worker, &amp; by himselfe meerely performed; nay, his merit for vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not vpon his nature, but vpon his person, in which both his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures concurre to the work and efficacie of the same.</p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> if Christ haue giuen <hi>himselfe for vs,</hi> we must receiue this gift and the benefit of it, seeing a gift not receiued,<note place="margin">We must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue this gift and make our best benefit of it.</note> is to no purpose or profit. And the meanes to receiue Christ, and applie him with all his benefits is, 1. to know him, for darknesse comprehendeth him not; and he came to his owne, but they not knowing him receiued him not, but crucified him, whom had they knowne they would neuer haue crucified the Lord of glorie. 2. By prizing the gift aboue gold, siluer, pearles, esteeming the precious blood of the immaculate Lambe, aboue euery corruptible thing vnder the sunne: all which cannot redeeme one soule. 3. By opening the doore of the heart, purified by faith, to entertaine him, while he offereth himselfe with all his merits in the word and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and this not as a stranger, by giuing a nights lodging, but as our husband and head, neuer to be departed. Consider that now Christ standeth at the doore of thy heart and knocketh, and vseth reasons (as once he did, Cant. 5.) from the great paines and sorrowes which he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent to come to thee: he wayted when it will once be, that for thine owne good thou wilt open vnto him: that he may bring his father with him to suppe with thee, and impart vnto thee knowledge, sanctification, and the rest of the graces which accompanie saluation. Oh therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer aduenture to trie what a fearefull thing it is, that he should depart in displeasure, or that thou shouldest not know the day of thy visitation: but receiue him whilest he is neare, that thou neuer know what an heauy thing it is to seeke repentance with teares perhappes too late; or how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable a thing it is, to seeke him when he is greeued at thy vnkind delaies, and will not so easily be found.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if Christ haue giuen himselfe so willingly to such a cursed death <hi>for vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">We must giue our selues to him who gaue himselfe for vs.</note> we must also in way of thankefulnesse giue our selues vnto him. He gaue his bodie, his soule, his glorie, and all for vs: we must not thinke much to part with bodie, goods, name, libertie, or life it selfe, for his sake, when he calleth vs vnto it; the lawe of thankefulnesse requireth that we should part with such things as in comparison are but trifles for him, who thinketh not his dearest things too good for vs: and the rather, because when we haue done all we can, we can neuer be sufficiently tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>k<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this greatest gift that euer was giuen to the sonnes of men, wee can neuer speake sufficiently of it, nor euer wade deepe inough into the ocean of that loue, that presenteth vs with such a gift as this is. Howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer therefore the sight of the blood of bulls and goates would more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect many, then this most pretious blood, which they tread vnder their feete, yet let those that looke for part in it vnto saluation, account this pretious, yea and their glorie, and reioyce that the wisedome of God hath left them meanes by the word and Sacraments, wherein Christ is
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:18792:263"/>
daily crucified before their eyes, to reuoke it into their memories; let them conscionably vse these meanes to this ende; that this gift running euer in their mindes and memories, they may bethinke them what they may acceptably returne for so great receits; and when they heare their hearts called for, they may giue heart and hand, head and feete, will and affections, vp to the perpetuall seruice of so good a benefactor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Seeing Christ hath giuen himselfe, there neede no other satisfaction for sinne.</note>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If Christ haue giuen himselfe <hi>for vs,</hi> then there is no other satisfaction for sinne. If angels or men, liuing or dead, masses or merits, could haue satisfied the iustice of God, Christ might haue spared <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi>; but nothing can be giuen to God, nothing accepted of God in way of satisfaction of mans sinne, but the person and merits of Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: for if any thing belonging to our persons could goe for paiment, then might he haue retained his glorie in heauen, and neuer haue left it for our sakes. If any Papist stand out here, and say, that Christ taketh our workes and dieth them in his blood, and then offereth them to his Father, who accepteth them as meritorious not for our sakes, nor their owne, but onely for Christ. I answer, that Christ indeede dieth the workes of the godly in his blood, and so presenteth them vnto his Father, and his Father accepteth them at his hands; but no way in respect of any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of sinne, or merit of saluation, but onely as testimonies of our thankefulnesse and dutie, and not otherwise.</p>

For by sinne we became bound, 1. to the <hi>seruice</hi> of it, 2. to <hi>damnation,</hi> the stipend of it: both which the Apostle includeth, in that he saith, that sinne <hi>raigned vnto death:</hi> where is both the <hi>raigne</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of sinne,<note place="margin">Christ redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med his church from the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie of sinne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The dignitie and <hi>excellencie of the person</hi>
                  <pb n="511" facs="tcp:18792:263"/>
who performed this work, who was not a bare man, but 1. the Sonne of God by eternall generation. 2. his onely Sonne. 3. his beloued Sonne.<note place="margin">Mortem re, non tempore infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam tolleravit Christus.</note> And to shewe vs that these be the respects which make the worke so me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious in it selfe, and so acceptable vnto his father; the Scriptures eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where giue him such titles as declare him to be most deare vnto God his Father: so Ioh. 1.14. <hi>the onely begotten sonne of the Father, full of grace and truth:</hi> and 18. <hi>the onely begotten Sonne which is in the bosome of his Father:</hi> and Ioh. 3.16.

               <p>Secondly, consider the <hi>sufficiencie of the worke,</hi> beeing so admirable as neuer was the like: for it was no simple action neither of God alone, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of man alone, and so neither meerely diuine, nor meerely humane, but (as Diuines speake) <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, the largenes and <hi>extent of the price,</hi> most absolutely satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatsoeuer was required, and that in all <hi>voluntarie obedience</hi> both <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue</hi>

So as for the time, the Sonne of God, and Lord of all, was deiected vnder all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and held vnder the most accursed death that euer was, seeing the sinnes of all his bodie lay most heauily vpon him: vnto both which bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of his obedience, if you adde the voluntarinesse and freedome of both, the whole will appeare most perfectly meritorious; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (because nothing can merit, to which any man is bound) the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, that he paid that which he neuer tooke, and so was not bound to any such paiment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. Seeing Christ must giue himselfe to redeeme vs, it imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a wonderful bondage and tyrannie of sinne ouer vs before that Christ wrought our libertie.<note place="margin">Before this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption we were bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dslaues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnder sinne &amp; death. 2.

nothing else, but a voluntarie putting of a mans selfe vnder the will and power of sinne: and thus he that <hi>committeth sinne,</hi> that is, giueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto it,<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.34.</note> is <hi>the seruant</hi> of sinne. To this purpose also we heare the Apostle often speaking of the raigne and dominion of sinne in the mortal bodie, and of the lawe of sinne in the members rebelling against the law of the mind, and of the lawe of euill which is euer present with the best.

If we consider the Iewes oppression in Egypt for 400. yeares together, euen when their taskes were most encreased: If the vnmercifull intreatie of them in Babylon, when strange Lords had rule ouer them 70. yeares: If the cruell and bloodie persecution of Antiochus, of which Daniel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied, that before it neuer was the like, nor should be after it: If the miserie of the Turkish gally slaues; yet is there no miserie, no bondage to this. For there the enemie was externall, here within a mans breast and bowels: there the losse was outward of goods, lands, libertie, or life; but here of Gods image, his fauour, the soule, &amp; life eternall: there might they in time looke to change their Master, or to flie, or with the ende of their liues at the least to ende their miserie; but here no man can flie except he can flie from himselfe, nor ende by death, but beginne rather his bondage in comparison of what it was before. And whereas there is no other bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage wherein a man cannot at least wish his freedome, here men will not beleeue they are in such snares, but reioyce in them, and are neuer so mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, as when they are strengthning their bonds vpon themselues: of which thraldome if we would more distinctly conceiue, in one word thus it is; Originall sinne inthralls vs to actuall, preceding actuall sinnes to conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent as iust punishments of the former: present sinnes are presidents to other men, and so we are intangled not onely with our owne, but other mens transgressions also.

and eternall, which entred into the world by sinne: hence commeth the torment and sting of a guiltie conscience; hence is the sinner haunted with the horror of Gods dreadfull iudgement, and the best fruit of the best mens sinnes is shame and sorrowe, euen where God raiseth vp to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>

Sam. 12.13. <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sinne:</hi> And yet because he had made the enemies of God to blaspheame, <hi>the child must surely die,</hi> ver. 14. and this was the temporall punishment: and what are the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frings of Gods people in this life, and in the end of this life at their death but punishments for sinne? <hi>Ans.</hi> The text sheweth plainely that both the sinne, and the <hi>punishment</hi> was forgiuen: for so those words shew, <hi>thou shalt not die,</hi> death beeing the iust wages of sinne: yet the child must die, not to make any satisfaction for the sinne, but the text shewes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, that the enemies might cease to blaspheame, when they should see the Lord no patron or fauorer of sinne, but rather iustly offended with it. And as for the afflictions which befall Gods children for sinne, and lie often very heauily vpon them, none of them satisfie, or can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any part of the iustice of God for sinne past; but are fatherly correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons preuenting sinnes to come, many waies seruing for their owne good, and the warning of others, least they should conceiue him a God bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string sinne in those that are dearest vnto him; but no way as a satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God, for thus only the passion of Christ is a satisfactorie redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from sinne. And the like may be said of death,<note place="margin">Mors piorum est medicinalis non poenalis.</note> which is left to the godly to conflict withall, although they haue obtained full remission of sinnes; but this is not as a punishment of sinne to them to whome Christ hath altred the nature and visage of death, but now it is only an exercise of their faith, hope, and pietie, yea a verie passage vnto eternall life.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. It must worke in vs a detestation and watchfulnes against all sinne, which bringeth such vassaladge vpon vs:<note place="margin">Beware of sin which bringeth back the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bondage.</note> for shall Christ take vpon him our debts, that we like desperate prodigalls should doe nothing but aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them? shall he ransome vs, and giue vs perfect freedome, that we with the vnthankefull Israelites, should runne backe againe to our former bondage? shall we with Salomons foole, make but a mocke of sinne, which cost Christ so deare to expiate? he neuer knewe what this greatest benefit of Christ euer meant, that can take his pleasure in the course of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one sinne.

And here is it not to be omitted, how the Popish do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is in this point an vtter enemie to this redemption purchased by Christ; not onely in magnifying their owne merits, but in extenuating sinne, so as men cannot come to a serious sense and hatred of the same: for many sinnes are small, and scarce sinnes; many are veniall, and there is no danger in them: originall sinne which is the mother sinne of all, is no sinne at all in the regenerate. They turne many of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments into counsels, which men may giue eare vnto for conuenience sake, but not of necessitie, and in doing these, they doe more then the lawe bindeth them vnto. By all which dreames of their owne braines, as by thicke clouds of darkenes, they obscure the brightnesse of this our sunne of righteousnesse, and lessen the merit of his sufferings. For if so many sinnes are in their owne nature so veniall, Christ might haue spared much of his paines; and if they were so slight as they make many, the Christian might forbeare much of that watchfulnesse against them, vnto which we are so often exhorted by the Apostle.</p>

By obtaining our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remission of sinnes, and absoluing vs both from the guilt and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them: and this is the iustification of a sinner before God, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he effected once and absolutely vpon the crosse, of which we haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the words immediately foregoing: the latter way is by freeing vs,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from the filth and contagion of sinne, and this is the sanctification of a sinner, and is not done at once, but is daily while we liue in this world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising to further perfection: and of this purging our Apostle now speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the which he affirmeth to be a fruit of the death of Christ, as well as the former. From the right conceiuing of which, those places may not hinder vs, where our sanctification may seeme to take an other rise: as where the Holy Ghost is called that cleane water, whereby we are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, Ezech. 36.25. <hi>I will powre cleane water vpon you, and yee shall be washed from your filthinesse, and from your idols</hi>; for it is the Lord Iesus, who by the power of his <hi>eternall spirit offereth</hi> his blood as the materiall and meriting cause of our cleansing,<note place="margin">Hebr. 9.14.</note> without which diuine and effectuall power of the holy spirit, the <hi>flesh had profited nothing.</hi> 2.

For Christ is the onely agent in our sanctification in and by all these: he giueth faith and sanctifieth by it, as by an internall meane and instrument whereby we receiue our cleansing; he sendeth Ministers with his word, and sanctifieth by it, as by an externall meane wherein sanctification is offered: and with his Sacraments, that by them as an other outward meanes, that inward sanctification might be represented and sealed. Thus Dauid prayeth, Purge me with byssope, that is, wash away my sinne with the blood of thy Sonne, which is shadowed in these legall sprinklings made with byssope: and thus are diuerse other Sacramentall speeches to be vnderstood.</p>

No, no, the wedding garment, and this our elder brothers garment is wouen of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as well as righteousnes; and there is no admittance to the supper of the Lambe, no blessing without either.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. Let both these considerations mooue vs to be euer washing and clensing our selues from our vncleannesse, and neuer to be at rest till we finde our selues, although not free from blacknesse, yet comely, as the Church confesseth of her selfe. And because this is the cheife vse of this doctrine, I will stand a little longer to propound in it two points: 1. the meanes and notes which we must vse, and by which we must discerne our selues to be washed and purged. 2. the reasons or motiues, to vse carefully those meanes.</p>
               <p>For the former; A man that meaneth to be neate and cleanly,<note place="margin">Meanes of our purging to be vsed.</note> 1. hee willingly looketh himselfe in a glasse, he is not angrie with the partie that setteth the glasse before him, but he calleth for it, that he may see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> what spots are about him, and looketh neere that he may discerne them: euen so a man that would be purged, must often set the glasse of the law before him, will not be angrie with him that preacheth and propoundeth the law vnto him, whereby he may see his foule spotts and disorders. And here is one difference betweene the cleane and vncleane; one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure to take notice of his filthinesse, his heart will abide no ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging nor sounding; the other hath a purpose to be cleanly, and would haue the least filth about him discouered, that it may be remooued.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="520" facs="tcp:18792:268"/>Secondly, A man that is in this way to be purged, beginneth with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the foulest spots first, and those which are most conspicuous, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly first remooueth those in his face. Now the foulest and most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted defilement, which is most conspicuous, and consequently odious vnto God, is an vngodly and wicked heart: which as the Lord begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his washing withall (for the first thing he doth in the conuersion of a sinner,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> is to take away the heart of <hi>stone</hi>) so he that would haue eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his cleannesse, must beginne here, <hi>and first wash the inside:</hi> so the holy man Dauid, although his sinnes were in the eyes of the world, yet to be soundly purged of them, he craueth a <hi>cleane heart,</hi> and a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed spirit.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 51.</note> And thus as he that meaneth to be cleane, beginneth at his head, and so washeth all downeward, so the <hi>pure of heart</hi> beginne at the heart, and this carrieth all other parts and members; they know that of the filthinesse of the flesh and spirit, the latter is more filthy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they seeke first to be renewed in the spirit of their mindes; and to wash their consciences from dead workes: whereas those that meane neuer to be cleane, beginne as it were at their feete; if they can abstaine from murther, adulte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie, drunkennesse, and such open sinnes in the act, which is apparant to euery eye, they thinke all to be cleane and well, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they neuer see the hardnes, the pride, and foulenes of their hearts: but euen this conceit that they haue washed their hands in innocencie, neglecting their hearts, is a brand and marke of their vncleannes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puritie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee that will be cleane, proceedeth on to the other parts of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> his bodie, and will see that they be sutable: so this grace of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as it beginneth in the minde, so it proceedeth to worke in all the members: it is carefull that all the vessels be preserued in holinesse and honour. A pure heart will not be without pure hands, chast eyes, an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered tongue,<note place="margin">1. Thess. 4.4.</note> &amp;c. Where is to be obserued another maine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the cleane and vncleane: the former endeauour to cleanse them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from <hi>all filthinesse</hi> of flesh and spirit,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.1.</note> and to grow vp vnto <hi>full holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>; but the latter can content themselues with a supposed goodnes of their hearts, and yet let loose their tongues to all obsene and lewd spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and open their eyps to all wandring and lustfull spectacles; and their hearts thinke no ill, but are good inough for all that: but halfe an eye can discerne what impure wretches they are, both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, such a person will proceed on to his garments, and will not endure filth or spots on them: euen so that soule whom Christ purgeth, hateth euen the <hi>garment spotted by the flesh</hi>; euen all occasions, induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and appearances of euill; yea such as he cannot auoid, yet he can
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:18792:268"/>
hate. Whereas the carelesse and slouenly Christian, runnes into all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, into all courses, and thrusts himselfe into all occasions of sinne; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is filthy he careth not to be filthy still, yea and to foule and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smeare all that come in his companie.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The sanctified person vseth all good meanes, whereby he may become cleane, and beeing so, he is carefull to preserue himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> cleane so long as he can. For, 1. he desireth to be euer sprinkling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with the blood of Christ, by often meditating, and applying vnto himselfe his death and merits, which are the onely <hi>purging <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malac. 3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers sope</hi>; without which, although he take much sope and nitre, yet can he not be purged: this is the onely fountaine opened to the house of Dauid for sinne and vncleannesse, this is the onely lauer of the Church.<note place="margin">Zach. 13.1.</note> 2. He laboureth in the encrease and strengthning of his faith, which as an hand apprehending the former, purifieth the heart. 3. He diligently, and reuerently frequenteth the word, and Sacraments, as the outward meanes appointed by God, for the effecting, and encreasing of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. 4. When he heareth Christ say, <hi>If I wash thee not, thou hast no part in mee,</hi> he reuerently falleth downe at his feete in feruent prayer, Lord, not my feete only, but my hands and my head: <hi>wash mee through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> euen from toppe to toe. Thus he knowes he can onely become cleane; and by these same meanes he seeth he can only be kept cleane; he dare not neglect these meanes as the foule monsters of the world, that had rather be wallowing in the dung of the earth, and bathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in their dirtie and sinnefull sports and delights, then frequent the places where these pure waters streame in most pleasant abundance: but their cards, dice, bowles, boules, vnprofitable companie, idle solitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, (which as so many draynes, carie with them all vncleannes, the which they powre on the heads of wicked men with full buckets) chaine them with chaines of darknes, that they cannot so much as desire these cleane waters, which the spirit powreth on those which thirst after them.</p>
               <p>The second point, is the <hi>motiues</hi> to become purged, and to labour in sanctification. 1. Because hereby wee resemble the Lord himselfe,<note place="margin">Motiues to vse carefully the former meanes.</note> by which reason we are often in the Scripture mooued to the study of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, Leu. 19.2. and hence we become deare vnto God, when he spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his owne image vpon vs: for euen naturall fathers loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren best who are likest vnto them. 2. Hereby we are not only confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to his image, but to his will: for this <hi>is the will of God, that euery man know to possesse his vessell in holinesse and in honour,</hi> 1. Thess. 4.3. 3. Hereby we distinguish our selues from the profane Esaus of the world, whereas by nature we are as foule as they. 4. We attaine to the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> end of our redemption;<note place="margin">Luk. 1.71.</note> and haue an argument that Christs death is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>

effectuall to vs, because we see the power of the deuil, and sinne destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> in vs. 5. All legall purifications are resolued into nothing but euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall sanctimonie, which may not be neglected vnlesse we will come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind those who were directed by shadows &amp; types; whereas we haue the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> truth &amp; substance. 6. Without puritie of heart and life no man shall see God. Blessed and holy are they that haue part in the first resurrection, the second death shall not hurt such; for only those that are slaine by the first death, are hurt by the second, and the second resurrection only profiteth those that haue part in the first: <hi>Without shall be dogges,</hi> and whatsoeuer is filthy and vncleane: and know we not, <hi>that the vnrighteous shall not inherit the kingdome of God?</hi> 1. Cor. 6.9. What meane men then to feare least they should be too pure, and too holy? and to reproach o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as beeing so? What a fearefull delusion is it for men to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as most doe, that there need no such strictnes or precisenes, but to come to Church, and receiue Sacraments according to law, and do as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men do; and sometimes as their leysure suffers to read or pray alone, and heare a sermon extraordinarie. But alas, what will it profit a man to be a sundaies Saint, and a work-daies Deuil? Or what great good can good moods do? are we not exhorted to the <hi>following</hi> of holines, to cleanse our selues from <hi>all</hi> filthines of soule and bodie, to an heauenly <hi>conuersation,</hi> to haue <hi>no fellowship,</hi> nor <hi>touch any vncleane thing?</hi> On the other side, are we not vrged to <hi>continuall</hi> prayer; <hi>In all things to be</hi> thankfull; to meditate day and night in the law of the Lord; to make the word our marke to aime at; and in all things with full purpose of heart to cleaue fast vnto the Lord? And now dare any flesh except and say, but if I shall doe thus it is more then need, and I should become too precise and too pure, and so are they that do so? we serue a God of pure eyes that will not be thus dallied withall.</p>
               <q>To be a peculiar people vnto himselfe,]</q>
               <p>In these words is set down one end why Christ vnderwent such paines not only to iustifie, but also to sanctifie his Church: namely, that it might become impropriate vnto himselfe, and applied vnto his owne best pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses. For as vncleane vessels can neuer be vsed vnto any good purpose, vntill they be washed and sweetned; no more can sinnefull men euer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vessells of honour, reserued vnto the Lords owne vse, before they be washed by the blood of Christ, and those pure waters of the spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.

Thus although all the earth be the Lords,<note place="margin">Iun. in Exod. 19.5.</note> who beeing the God of nature and grace, hath all power and libertie to conferre where he pleaseth grace aboue nature: yet his good pleasure was to choose Israel, to be his cheefe treasure aboue all people, and an holy nation, that vnto them he might shew his wisedome and glorie; and his loue and mercie vpon them. But that was but a type,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.</note> the thing it selfe is specially apparant in the Church of the new Testament, euen the true Church of God in all ages since: vnto which all those titles iustly belong which Peter giueth to the beleeuing dispersed Iewes: <hi>A royall pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Now the Church may be said to be a peculiar people, (by the Church vnderstanding the true and essentiall members of the Church) 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause beleeuers are the most precious of men,<note place="margin">The Church is Gods peculiar sundrie waies.</note> euen the most noble per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the earth, descended of the blood of Christ, in which regard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> they are the dearest of men and nearer vnto God, because more noble then the rest. Thus Salomon describeth the Church, as though it were a stately court, where are none but of the blood royall, Kings, Queenes,<note place="margin">Cant. 6.7.</note> Lords, and Ladies: and hence are beleeuers called <hi>sonnes of God, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Christ,</hi> and <hi>heyers</hi> vnto the crowne of heauen. Secondly, In <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> regard of God, they are a peculiar people, distinct from others by his grace of election, by which they are chosen out of the world, and set highly in his fauour aboue all others. For they lie before him in the righteousnesse of Christ, in whom the Father is well pleased; they are bought from the earth, and stand before him in the worke of his owne fingers, namely, their new birth and second creation, in which he also delighteth to behold. Hence are they called an <hi>holy nation,</hi> the <hi>spouse of Christ,</hi> the <hi>daughter of God,</hi> the <hi>choise</hi> of God, and Gods <hi>delight.</hi> Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> they are a peculiar people, in regard of their whole maner &amp; condition of life: which made Balaam say of Israel, that it was a <hi>people dwelling alone, and numbred not himself among other nations,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Num<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is no part of earth, for they are here but strangers and pligrimes,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.15.</note> but heauen, to which they tend, and from whence they looke for a Sauiour. 3. Their <hi>King</hi> is neither borne nor created, but the euerlasting King of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> glorie, who ruleth not some one countrie, but from sea to sea, yea to the worlds end: and not for an age, but as he is a King for euer, and his kingdome an euerlasting kingdome, so he ruleth for euer and euer, and<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n=""/>

Thus we see how the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of the Church are called a peculiar people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Hence we may note a liuely description of the Church of God, namely, that it is a peculiar people, selected and called out of all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, peoples, tongues, and kinreds of the earth, for the Lords owne pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session and vse. That which the Lord once spake of Israel, is true of all the true Israel of God, <hi>Israel is a thing hallowed vnto the Lord, and as his first fruits:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 2 3.</note> for as the first fruits were of all the fruits of the earth separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and sanctified vnto the Lord; so out of all the people of the earth, are a remnant set apart and separated to become his, and belong vnto him: see Hos. 1.10. &amp; 2.23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Hence is affoarded no small consolation to the members of the Church,<note place="margin">Many consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Gods people from the former doctrine.</note> and that sundrie wayes: for God will not forsake his people whom he hath chosen, whom he hath made his peculiar. But 1. his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection watcheth ouer them, Zach. 2.5. <hi>I will be a wall of fire round about <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> her:</hi> he will suffer none to doe them wrong; let them be kings who will not be reprooued by any other,<note place="margin">Psal. 105.14.</note> yet he will reprooue them for their sakes: this was the ground of the Iewes safetie, Deut. 32.9. <hi>The Lords portion is his people, Iacob is the lot of his inheritance: he found him, he taught him, he lead him, and kept him as the apple of his eye.</hi> Be thou then a child of the Church, and although thou maist finde thy selfe in thy selfe lost, blind, ignorant, and in a thousand perils, feare not, the Lord will finde thee, lead thee, teach thee, and keepe thee as safe in the chambers of his prouidence, as thou wouldest keepe safe the apple of thine owne

eie. Secondly, his prouidence is euer with them, his eies vpon them, his eares, his hand, his treasurie open vnto them: yea himselfe becommeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the portion of those that are his portion; and no good thing can be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to such who haue the Lord their portion, in whom is no lacke.

For instruction to teach vs who professe our selues the Lords peculiar, to liue vnto him, to whose vse we are set apart.<note place="margin">We must liue vnto the Lord whose we are.</note> And this is the Apostles reason, <hi>Ye are not your owne, therefore glorifie God in your soules and bodies, for they are his:</hi> and that we may this doe, we must propound two rules before vs. 1. We must see that the whole course of our liues <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> be carried according to his pleasure: for looke whose we are, to him we must giue vp our selues to obey. If we be the Lords peculiar, then no creature in earth can lay claime vnto vs, not the Pope, not the deuill, not sinne, no nor our owne lusts must command vs: for thus the Apostle rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth, <hi>ye are a chosen generation, a peculiar people; dearely beloued, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you abstaine from fleshly lusts:</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> this inference sheweth what a disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and disgracefull thing it were, for Christians so farre to forget their nobilitie and dignitie, to stoope to such base seruices: they should rather call to mind that beeing set apart to the Lords vse, and like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nobles beeing to attend the nearest seruices of their King, they are to heare and fashion themselues according to his good pleasure: Deut. 26.18. <hi>The Lord hath set thee to be a pretious people vnto him, that thou shouldst keepe all his commandements.</hi> Neither may beleeuers frame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues according to the guise of the world, seeing they are called out of the world to be the Lords peculiar. Those that are the next seruants in a princes court, liue not according to the fashions of other courts, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of their owne: so the Lord from this reason char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his people, that they should not conforme vnto the heathen in their fashions; <hi>for ye are an holy people,</hi> and the Lord <hi>hath chosen you for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious people:</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> in like manner we must not conforme to Romish or Italian fashions, nor the courses of loose and profane men amongst our selues: but as we professe our selues the Lords, so must we square and order our wayes according to his word.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second rule is, that as euerie peculiar serueth to the praise of the owner, so we must frame our liues and actions to the praise and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God, whose we are. This is the reason of the holy Ghost, Psal. 135.3, 4. <hi>Praise the Lord, oh sing praises vnto the Lord</hi>; for the Lord hath chosen Iacob to himselfe, and Israel for his cheife treasure. Whence it followeth, that whatsoeuer practise would tend to the dishonour of

God, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e must resist and withstand in our selues and others. And thus the Lord chargeth his people, that they should be so far from associating themselues with the wicked people that liued neere them, in their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.</note> that they should breake downe their altars, and cut downe their groves and images, and resist them; euen from this same ground, because he had chosen them to be pretious vnto himselfe. So that if any sinner shall mooue and wooe vs vnto any vngodly practise, we must reason the case with our owne hearts; I may not doe any such thing as may disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, or my profession, let others doe thus and thus, I may not doe so, I am the Lords peculiar, and must liue to his glorie, which I cannot doe if I withstand not such motions, as whereby his glorie is hazarded, and hindered: and thus also maist thou: iudge of thy selfe, whether thou beest the Lords; if thou seruest not the times, nor mens lusts, nor fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onest thy selfe to mens humors, but liuest vnto the Lord, thou art the Lords.</p>

Hence is afforded a motiue to loue the Church, and shew all kindnesse to the members of it, euen because it is the Lords heritage, and because the Lord is not vnfaithfull to forget the worke <hi>and labour of loue shewed to his Saints</hi>; yea be it but a cuppe of cold water, it shall not loose a reward, seeing the Lord accounteth it as done to himselfe.

               <p>Here is another ende of Christs sanctifiyng his Church, that euerie member of it should ardently endeauour in all good and goodly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation. Where the Apostle seemeth to answer a secret obiection: for it

might be said, if Christ haue thus redeemed, purged, and washed vs, and so made vs his owne peculiar, what neede we more, or what further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for vs to doe? neither wanted there Libertins in those dayes, that from the appearing of grace cast off all yoakes, and thought they might doe what they listed. But the Apostle telleth such, that Christ neuer wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, redeemed, nor powred out his grace vpon any, but such as thereby were wrought to forwardnes, and cheerefulnesse in all well-doing. And here (not to speake of the nature and necessitie of good workes, because that treatise is to be referred to a fitter place) three things are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.<note place="margin">cap. 3.8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First note, that before the Apostle speake of good workes, we heare of redemption, and purging, and washing,<note place="margin">The worker must be good before the worke can be so.</note> and of a peculiar people that must doe them: for indeede, the best workes are so farre from iustifying and purging, that none can be good before the party be iustified and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. A leper or polluted person in the law, might not touch or attempt any thing for whatsoeuer he touched, became also vncleane: so while the whole man, euen the minde and conscience, the fountaines from whence all the actions issue, are polluted; how can any thing streaming from thence be cleane and pure? vnlesse we will say, that one fountaine at once, can send out sweete water and bitter: or controll holy Iob, who saith, that <hi>no man can bring a cleane thing out of filthinesse:</hi>

The whole scope of the Epistle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes is to prooue, that no man can by workes be iustified before God; the verie first proofe of which conclusion is fetched hence,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.10.</note> because <hi>all are vnder sinne, and depriued of the glorie of God</hi>; and so beeing euill trees, cannot bring forth good fruit, and much lesse in this state of sinne, vnwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shen and vnpurged, can be <hi>zealous of good works: without me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>ye can doe nothing</hi>; namely, no good thing: till a man therefore be set in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, he cannot possibly turne his hand, to any thing that is truely, and formally good, no more then a sient can bring forth fruit which is not set into a stocke, or a branch which is not set into the vine.</p>
               <p>Secondly note, that whosoeuer are iustified and sanctified,<note place="margin">A good wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker cannot but bring forth good works.</note> they must needs bring forth good workes: for else Christ should be frustrate of his end in those for whom he gaue himselfe: Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are his workemanshippe, created to good workes.</hi> We must first be his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, before our selues can be good workmen, but beeing once his new creatures, then can we neither be idle nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The adopted sonnes of God imitate the naturall Sonne, who when the Iewes said, <hi>Tell vs, art thou that Christ, that we may doubt no longer</hi>; he presently sendeth them to his workes, <hi>If I doe not the workes of my Father, beleeue mee not:</hi> so art thou a Christian, and the child of God, as thou profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest and beleeuest? I say if thou dost not the workes of God, thou art not to be beleeued. Now the workes of God, are 1. to beleeue in his Sonne; 2. to endeauour to keep all his commandements; 3. to practise the duties of repentance and invocation, and that daily: 4. to call others, especially those that belong vnto thee vnto the knowledge and seruice of the true God, that thou with thy house maist serue the Lord: 5. to make thy calling and euery dutie to man, branches of obedience vnto God. These would make thee diligent in the Ministrie, for faith must be maintained, neither canst thou obey all, vnlesse thou knowest all: the third would cause thee to watch against sinne in thy self, the fourth to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it from thy family, the last would make thee beneficiall to all men, hurtfull to none; and by all shalt thou adorne thy holy profession. These works of thy father cheerefully and constantly performe, and we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that thou art the child of God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly note, that the thing that God requireth in a professor, is zeale, forwardnes, and earnestnes in well doing, and that his whole course should be a studious prosecuting of good workes. The same word is vsed in 1. Cor. 14.1. <hi>Couet spirituall gifts,</hi> but the word is,<note place="margin">

               <p>Now because euery forwardnes and earnestnesse euen in good things, is not commendable zeale (for Peter euen in Christs defence may hastily draw his sword, and rashly lay about him) therefore to the right orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of it, there must alwaies goe with it these three things. <hi>First,</hi>

A wise man will not powre out all his indignation against euery trifling displeasure, nor set his whole strength to that which he can wipe away with a finger. There must alwaies be a fire of zeale kept burning in the soule, as the fire on the Altar neuer went out, but it must be a iust zeale, proportioned according to the occasion, euen as we keepe the fire on our hearths all day long, but enlarge or lesson it according to the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the house. If some great good be in thine eye, tending to the great glorie of God, and great good of his Church, stirre vp and adde to thy zeale, till it become a great flame; but in smaller, and minutiall matters to carrie an vnbounded and vnbridled zeale, were to call for a sword to kill a flie, or an hatchet to breake an egge; and yet zeale must euer fence the heart from affecting, committing, or communicating the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> least euill in the world. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it must carrie with it, <hi>sincere affection,</hi> abandoning all by-respects, besides the glorie of God, desire of mens good, and conscience of the good dutie it selfe. In doing any good thing the close corners of the heart must be well searched, seeing much deceit and guile lurketh in them; and if with the Papist, we doe any thing neuer so good for the matter; and neuer so zealously for the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to merit at the hand of God; or with the Pharisie, to be seene of men, or in which our owne respects prouoke our zeale, whether glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, fauour, credit, wealth, or any other by-end, verily we haue already our reward.</p>
               <p>Now what a necessarie attendant this right ordered zeale is to our good workes,<note place="margin">How necessarie zeale is to a good worke.</note> and what great reason the Lord hath to require it, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the fruits and effects of it, which are such as make the workes we doe, not good only but glorious. And because zeale is a mixt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of loue and anger, therefore at one time it hath respect both vnto the good worke it selfe, as also that which is contrarie, and produceth effects of loue to the former, and properties of hatred against the latter. The effects of zeale against euill, are, 1. a great hatred of it, with a care and diligence to preuent it, or if that cannot be, it causeth an inward greefe and vexation of heart for the euills it cannot reforme: thus was the righteous soule of Lot vexed for that he could not redresse: and this greefe giueth often testimonie outwardly of it selfe in sighs and teares: as Dauids eyes gushed out with <hi>riuers of teares, because men kept not the word</hi>:<note place="margin">Psal. 119.136.158. Ier. 9.2.</note> and Ieremie wished his head <hi>a fountaine of teares,</hi> to weepe for the sinnes of the people: yea, it is a marke of such as are marked for the
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:18792:274"/>
Lords, that their zeale prouoketh them to <hi>mourne for the abhominations of the rest.</hi> 2. As anger pursueth the obiect of it,<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.4.</note> so doth zeale hunt out, and reforme euill where it hath calling and power, and that most earnestly: Examples we haue: in Nehemiah who reprooued, smote,<note place="margin">Nehem. 23.22.</note> and pulled off the haire from the beards of the Sabboath-breakers. In Phine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, who beeing stirred vp extraordinarily slew Zimri, and Cosbi,<note place="margin">Numb. 25.</note> in their filthy fact. In our Sauiour himselfe,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.14.17.</note> who in great zeale whipped out of the Temple the buyers and sellers, giuing this reason, because the zeale of his Fathers house consumed him. And although it properly feedeth vpon the sinne, Reu. 2.6. Thou <hi>hatest the doctrine of the Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laitans</hi>: Psal. 15. I hate the <hi>workes of</hi> them that fall away: yet it disli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euen the persons so farre as they are agents in sinne; for thus farre this grace carried both the Prophet and the Angel of the Church in both those places: Reu. 2.2. Thou canst not <hi>forbeare them</hi> which are euill; and Psal. 15. In whose eyes <hi>a vile person</hi> is contemned: so Salomon, Prov. 28.4. those that <hi>keepe the law, set themselues against the wicked:</hi> but yet so as it carrieth with it such sympathie and compassion, that it can quickly turne it selfe into praiers for the offender.</p>
               <p>The effects of zeale for good, are,<note place="margin">The effects of zeale about the effecting of good things.</note> 1. It preserueth in the heart a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and preparednes to euery good worke, required of euery beleeuer, 2. Tim. 3.17. Secondly, it exciteth diligence and hast in the things we doe; it abandoneth idlenesse, slothfulnes, and delaies, by which occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of well doing are often cut off; the zeale of Dauid made him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> diligently for the Temple: zeale in the Magistrate causeth in him diligence throughout his gouernment: zeale in the Minister maketh him like Apollos, of whom we read that being feruent in spirit, he taught dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently the way of God: zeale and feruencie in priuate men causeth them to shake off slothfulnes in their duties, and remooueth in all conditions the curse which is denounced against the man that doth the worke of the Lord negligently: most fitly therefore doth the Apostle combine those precepts, Rom. 12.11. <hi>Not slothfull to doe seruice, feruent in the spirit, seruing the Lord.</hi> Thirdly, zeale causeth continuance in well doing, which is also required in euerie good action, as well as in <hi>prayer:</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not it selfe with one or two good actions, but is plentiful in them,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.12.</note> and bringeth the partie possessing it to be rich in good workes, and to shine light somely therein; yea it maketh a man hold out, and keepe a constant tenor in good courses, and that as well in aduersitie as prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, so as he is neither choaked by preferments, as verie many; nor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by distresses, as not a fewe. Fourthly, zeale setteth such an high price vpon the glorie of God, and performance of conscionable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that it causeth the partie to attempt and goe through, though with

neuer so much difficultie, whatsoeuer he seeth himselfe bound vnto; it hardneth the face like brasse against dangers, and losses; the losse of the world is in his iudgement gaine, yea all things are losse, and dung so as he may winne Christ; this alone yeeldeth ioy in the spoyling of goods; by this can a man hate father and mother in comparison of his obedience, &amp; be contented to be hated of all men for well doing, in which case the losse of freinds is but light. This zeale for God maketh a mans libertie small in his eye;<note place="margin">Act. 20.24.</note> nay in standing out in a good cause, his life will not be so deare vnto him as the finishing of his course with ioy: yea he can reioyse to be offered vp vpon the sacrifice and seruice of the Churches faith,<note place="margin">Philip. 2.17.</note> as Paul. And which is yet much more, the zeale of Gods glorie will so burne in the heart, as it can carrie a man so farre beyond himselfe, as that he shall neglect his owne saluation, and wish to be accursed, yea and blotted out of the booke of life,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> if God may be more honoured by the one then by the other. What be the things then which zeale will not forgoe for Gods honour and mens saluation; when as things most precious are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with, yea and cast away in comparison as vile? will it sticke to be at a little labour, or charge for the saluation of men, when it willingly will part with possessions, freinds, preferments, fauour, libertie, and life, yea bodie and soule for God and his Churches causes? By all that hath bin said, may be concluded how aptly the spirit of God requireth zeale to good works, which not onely (as we haue seene) hateth, watcheth against, pursueth, and reformeth euill: but prepareth, inciteth, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in good, and will not be driuen from it by any meanes.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> By this doctrine many may see and challenge themselues of want of zeale in religion, yea of religion it selfe. For 1. a number there are, who thinke it well and enough to giue a countenance, or some shewe to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> religion; and sometimes they can speak to a good cause, but so coldly, and so warily, as if they would not heare that voice of the damsell, which would as much terrifie them, as once it did Peter, <hi>surely thou art one of them:</hi> which imputation they would take as hainously, as the Iewes did the speach of the blind man: will ye be also his disciples? here may be wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the flesh, but little zeale or feruencie of the spirit: here is poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but pietie scarse euer a whit. 2. Others walke so indifferently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Protestants and Papists, that a man cannot tell what to make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of them, other then such as neither worship God nor Baal; they can well away with either religion, but care greatly for neither. 3. And a third sort goe so iust betweene a ciuill and religious life, that euen while they professe religion, it is verie hard to say, whether nature or religion giueth the stroake to their actions, but zeale to the truth haue they none: vnto which lukwarme Laodiceans being neither hote nor cold, that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

of the holy Ghost is fit, <hi>Be zealous and amend,</hi> for else the Lord will spue them out of his mouth. 4. Some are zealous, but either without <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> knowledge, or beyond the right vnderstanding of the word, affection leading it, and not iudgement at, least rightly enformed, and this tendeth but to their owne, and the hurt of the Church. 5. Some are zealous in and for wickednesse: Zealous persecutors, as Paul before his conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> on such fellowes as were those fortie, that tooke an oath that they would not eate nor drinke till they had slaine Paul:<note place="margin">Act 23.12.</note> Zealous railers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God; against his word, his ministers, and seruants; against the strict obseruation of the Sabbath, against the most conscionable duties of watching against sinne, or of working of righteousnesse, vnto which they are sworne enemies themselues, and in others account it mere follie and madnesse: all their zeale is against zeale. But let vs whome God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into his schoole to teach vs better things, be careful to raise this grace out of the ashes of it: and consider, 1. how zealous the Papists be in their owne inventions, and for the traditions of their fathers; and shal not we for the truth. 2. the more resistance it hath, the greater is the glorie to hold it out. 3. how that cold Christians haue but cold comfort, from God, in themselues, and from their best workes; because they come short of this precept, which requireth that euerie C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then should we not meet with so many pretors for sinne and libertie to the flesh, strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their wittes to legitimate bastardly broods of opinions, which the Scripture neuer acknowledged hers. Nor so many who in their reproofes glad the hearts of the impenitent, and make heauie the hearts of those to whom the Lord hath spoken peace; who strike at the best things and men; and so as soone as euer they haue deliuered a truth <hi>in thesi,</hi> least they should leaue it while it is true, misapply it in the <hi>hypothesis</hi>; girding at godlinesse as too much scrupulositie and precisenesse; accounting consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence an hypocrite, and the feare of God dissembling before men.</p>
               <p>Hence are discouered as sinnefull, all reproofes of sinne by iesting, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terluding, and stage representations, in which <hi>fooles make a mocke of sinne,</hi> and open a publike schoole of all lewdnesse and iniquitie; and if any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill or sinne be cast out there, it is by Belzebub the Prince of the deuils. Further, all reproofes by satyrizing, and by slanderous libells, and secret calumniations (all which commonly wrecke themselues rather vpon the persons then sinnes of men) are here reprooued: which although they be indeede sharpe and biting meanes, yet hath the Lord appointed fitter and sharper arrowes to smite his enemies withall, euen sound and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient conuictions out of the word, which is able to wound and daunt kings themselues: and prescribed them also to be publikely drawne, and shot in such graue, reuerent, and seemely sort, as is befitting, 1. both the

Small wisedome therefore it is, for men in these cases of the saluation and damnation of men, to suffer their wits to play vpon sinne so lightly and iestingly as becommeth rather some vaine spectacle, or professed iester; then either the errand of the Lord, or a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger from the Lord of hosts.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Ministers must take heede of coldnes in their ministerie, of liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and spiritles preaching, of powerlesse and a frozen manner of deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word, alwaies preseruing a fire of zeale and conscience in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; mettals we knowe will not worke without fire; no more will the steely and stonie heart of man, melt or soften without the spirituall fire taken from the altar. And yet here I must not be vnderstood as condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all coolenesse, or moderation of speach; for doctrine may be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and weightie, where the speach is calme and treatable, still waters often runne the deepest;<note place="margin">Prov. 17.27.</note> and Salomon saith, that <hi>a man of knowledge spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his words,</hi> but yet it followeth, that he must be of an excellent spirit: so there must of necessitie be at the least a soft fire in these distillatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But the thing iustly condemned is, when men by their owne default, beeing giuen ouer either to pride, sensualitie, or worldlynesse, haue benummed their spirits, and are become frozen, without power or life in their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie, and so bring forth their doctrine, as many women doe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, stil-borne; teaching as the Scribes onely of forme without zeale, or conscience, or experience of that they speake. And before I leaue this point, it must be knowne, that whereas I require heate and authoritie in the deliuerie of the word, that therefore euerie heate should be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: for some is iustly condemned, as. 1. all heate of humane affection, proceeding from perturbation and passion. 2. all inconsiderate heate of youth. 3. all heate not well guided (although in good men full of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections) but suffered to boyle ouer so farre, as a man looseth his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, and interrupteth his doctrine and whole discourse.</p>

                  <hi>Let no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise thee,</hi> teacheth two things. First, how people and hearers should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the Ministers sent them of God, seeing they cannot without great sinne despise them; for seeing the Lord, who could by himselfe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> worke the saluation of men, yet is pleased to vse as his helpers herein weake and base men, whom he assumeth into fellowship with himselfe, to become <hi>coworkers with him,</hi> although not in the act of conuersion,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 3.9.</note> yet in the Ministrie of it: who dare despise such whom the Lord so farre honoureth? and therefore calleth them his <hi>white horses:</hi> horses,<note place="margin">Rev. 6.2.</note> in that he vseth them in his battailes against sinne, Satan, the world, and wicked ones; and <hi>white,</hi> for the puritie of their doctrine, and integritie of their liues: yea his <hi>Angels,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 1.20.</note> namely such as by whom he reuealeth his good pleasure vnto vs: and his owne <hi>voyce,</hi> by whom he beseecheth men to be reconciled. Secondly, how carefull is the Lord to preserue his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from contempt, when he affirmeth, that such as despise them, despise himselfe that sent them. In which sence we read that the posteritie of Caine, contemning the preaching of Noah, dispised and contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods spirit: so Israel murmuring against Moses and Aaron, Moses saith, he hath <hi>heard your murmurings against the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 16.7.</note> 
                  <hi>for what are we that yee haue murmured against vs.</hi> Thirdly, how vnnaturall a part <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> were it for children to despise their Fathers: and what seueritie hath the Lord shewed against it in his law? but godly Ministers are the Fathers of their people, <hi>I am your Father,</hi> saith Paul: and Onesimus, yea and Titus here begotten by him vnto the faith, he calleth his sonnes. Let no cursed Cham presume to scorne them, which is not so hurtfull to them, as dangerous to themselues, beeing the next way to bring themselues vnder the curse. On the contrarie, let the naturall children of the Church, 1. <hi>know them,</hi> 1. Thess. 5.12. that is, both in <hi>heart</hi> accknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them the Ministers of Christ, and in <hi>affection,</hi> loue them as his Ministers, accounting their feete bewtifull: 2. render them double honour, 1. Tim. 5.17. in which precept the holy Ghost hath made, 1. reuerence, 2. obedience, 3. thankfulnes, 4. comfortable maintenance, their due from their people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Ministers are hence taught so to order their liues and doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, as they lay not their pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns open to reproach, nor prostitute their authoritie vnto contempt, and so loose it both from themselues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For this is the way for Ministers to winne authoritie and reuerence in the hearts of men, by their liues and doctrine,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.3.</note> to become <hi>examples</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flocke: And thus shining in the puritie of doctrine and conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:18792:278"/>
they shew themselues <hi>starres in the right hand of Christ.</hi> The point beeing formerly prooued,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.16.</note> we will only note a threefold vse of it.</p>
               <p>First, to confute the Popish teachers, who haue deuised another way to free themselues from the contempt of the laytie; namely, by inuesting their Bishops and clergie into ciuill authoritie and Magistracie: by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing them with wealth and abundance, yea superfluitie of state, and pompe: by distinguishing them from other men by strange fashions of apparell, miters, crosyer staues, rings, and bables; that if Titus had bin such a Bishop, this had beene a needlesse precept, for who durst haue despised him, but he should soone haue heard of him. But the word tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, that it is no politicke deuise that maintaineth the estimation of a Minister, or Ministrie; but the holy carriage both of the doctrine and liues of the Ministers: euen as the Apostle also speaketh of Deacons, that by <hi>ministring well,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.13.</note> 
                  <hi>they get themselues a good degree,</hi> and great libertie in the faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ground laieth heauie things to the charge of the idol-ministerie, who for any gifts for teaching, are many of them inferiour to boyes and girles of seauen yeares old: and wofull it is to thinke, how many places are serued, or starued rather with Ieroboams priests, who were raked out of the basest of men, the iust subiects of reproach and contempt: And others the sonnes of Eli, who by the wickednesse, and dissolutnes of their courses, not only stinke themselues, but make the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and worship, and word of God, to be abhorred: men mistake their marke, when they say, that it is often preaching which maketh it dispised; but because it is so often preached by such leud men, it looseth the grace and power of it in the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when men thus teach, and thus liue purely and innocently, and yet are despised, let them not thing it strange, nor be discouraged; for they haue done their dutie, and taken the right course to get reuerence and authoritie: Let men at their perill now despise them, the Lord will not refuse to honour them; and if they cannot in earth, yet are they sure to shine in heauen.</p>
               <p>And thus by the assistance of God, haue we absolued this second Chapter, to him be therefore praise for ouer. Amen.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the former Chapters the Apostle hath beene care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that Titus should in his ministerie propound the seuerall offices, and duties of Christianitie vnto seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall estates and conditions of men. Now in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he will haue him teach more generall, and more publike duties, which concerne no estate more then other, but all Christians of what estate and condition soeuer they be: wherein he taketh vp the greatest part of the Chapter, vnto the 9. verse. II. The second part of the Chapter warneth Titus, how to carrie himselfe more respectiuely, 1. in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious questions. 2. in dealing with heretikes: both which abounded in those dayes, in the 9, 10. and 11. verses. The third part containing the third part, namely, the conclusion of the whole Epistle, remembreth some priuate and personall matters; which is ended with the accustomed apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall salutation.</p>
               <p>Concerning the first of them: These generall duties are, 1. propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in 1. and 2. verses: and 2. confirmed and vrged in the sixe following. They are propounded in this method and order. First, Titus must instruct all Christians in their duties towards Magistrates. Secondly, in the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties one towards an other. The former taketh vp the first verse, wherein two things are to be considered. 1. the manner of propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the precept. 2. the substance of the doctrine it selfe: wherein wee must speake, 1. of the duties required, which are two, 1. subiection, 2. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. Secondly, of the persons, 1. to whome. 2. from whome they are due. But first we must returne to the manner of propounding this lesson; in these words, <hi>Put them in remembrance.</hi>

                  <hi>is not all the congregation of the Lord holy?</hi> 2. The Iewes in these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> times wherein the Apostle writ, stood much vpon many temporall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; as vpon Abraham, the Temple, the lawe, &amp;c. and were stiffe and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> loath to stoope to the authoritie of the Gentiles. 3. The Christians of Iewes and Gentiles stood as much vpon spirituall priuiledges; not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it inough to be set free from the thraldome of Sathan, and bands of sinne, and so be made spirituall kings vnto God and the lambe; vnles also by a boundles Christian libertie they might be at their owne hands, to do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> as they listed, without the knowing of any subiection. 4. This also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their error, that they more respected mens persons then Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance: for because in these dayes they sawe the most of the Magistrates heathen men, and enemies to Christ and his gospel; they thought it a most vnworthie thing, that they beeing beleeuers should still be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, and remaine subiect vnto them: the weakenesse of which ground we haue discouered in cap. 2.9. for on the same commandement, seruants presumed on more libertie then was mee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The spirit indeed doth it principally, but by the word in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie instrumentally.<note place="margin">Reasons.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The reasons of the doctrine are these. 1. None is so farre instructed
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:18792:279"/>
but is wanting much in knowledge, and much more in the cheerefull practise of that which he knoweth, and therefore euerie one hath neede of quickning and stirring vp; and who is he that carrieth flesh about with him, that findeth not the heauinesse and vnweldinesse of it vnto any thing that is good? therefore the Apostle Paul telleth the Romanes, that although they were <hi>filled with goodnesse, and knowledge, and were</hi> able to admonish one another, yet he thought <hi>it needefull to put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of their dutie: and Peter writing to those <hi>that had knowledge, and were established in the present truth, thought it meete so long as he was in this tabernacle, to stirre them vp, by putting them in remembrance:</hi> so as we neede not feare in this case the spurring of free horses, seeing no man is so free, but he needeth spurres. Secondly, none are so strong but they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> stand in neede of this confirmation, as well as the former quickning, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any caution, or any admonition be too much in things of such moment. Thirdly, no mans memorie is so found, but as out of a leak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> vessell good things are euer running out:<note place="margin">Heb. 2.1.</note> and when such things are slipt away, they had need be renewed and recalled againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Ministers must not desist from teaching and exhorting, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that thinke a little inough; nor discouraged when people forget their wholesome doctrine; but incourage themselues in their dutie, which is to keepe in mens memories the mindfulnesse of their duties. 2. When they come to teach, they may not seeke out vaine and strange speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which were neuer heard of before; but teach plaine things, yea and deepe mysteries in plaine manner; as such who respect the weaknes both of the apprehension and memorie of their hearers. 3. An wholesome thing it is to teach the same things often, whereby things deliuered are recalled into the memorie: curious men cannot abide repetitions, nor heare common things, notwithstanding these be excellent helps of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie; which is the cause of such grosse and euery-where palpable ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in the most familiar principalls of religion. But the wisedome of godly teachers will be not too much to yeeld vnto the nicenes of their hearers; nor to feare to do that which is the <hi>safest for them,</hi> as Paul spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: which if it be, let it be to vs what it will or can, it will be our part that by our practise they may finde the profit.</p>

                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 2. We learne hence also,<note place="margin">The memorie of Christians should be taken vp with godly instructions learned in the ministerie. Deut. 6.</note> what it is that should possesse and take vp the memories of Christians, namely, those lessons of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie which they heare in the ministrie. For, 1. The commandement must be <hi>bound vp vpon our hearts,</hi> and we ought to make our memories the statute booke of our soules, and by diligent meditation, chaine this booke vnto our selues. The precept is in Prov. 4.21. <hi>Keepe these words <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the midst of thy heart, for they are life and health of the bones.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>

herein standeth the sanctitie of the memorie, partly in retayning the rules of life, and partly in presenting, and offring them vnto the mind vpon occasion of practise, both to direct and vrge the conscience to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Thus Dauid <hi>hid the word</hi> in his heart, the blessed fruit of which was, that <hi>hee did not sinne against God</hi>; and indeed holy memorie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the holinesse of the whole man.<note place="margin">Psal. 119.11.</note> Thirdly, forgetfulnesse of the word, is euery where in the Scriptures taxed as a greeuous and hatefull sinne: <hi>Be not forgetfull hearers, deceiuing your owne selues,</hi> saith Iames: haue <hi>you forgotten how I fedde so many thousand, &amp;c.</hi> saith Christ to the Disciples: and the author to the Hebrewes, <hi>haue yee forgotten the consolation?</hi> which interrogations are seuere reprehensions, and indeed it is the mother and nurse of most sinnes, as we see in Peter, who forgat the words of Christ till he had thrise denied him; whereas if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred them, it is likely he had beene preserued from the sinne; for when the cock crew he remembred the words, and when he remembred them, he went out and wept bitterly; euen so the forgetfulnes of the words of Christ, maketh men so often to denie Christ in his word, and in his profession, as in many vnchristian practises it doth appeare: and although we account but a small matter to forget them, yet if euer Christ looke backe vpon vs, we shall as bitterly as Peter bewaile it in the end.</p>

But suffer now in thy prosperitie the things belowe to take vp thy senses, it shall be iust with God in the day of thy darkenesse and miserie, to leaue thee without the comfort of any one place of Scripture; that what thou wouldst not take vp into thy mind when thou mightest; thou shalt not be able, then when it is offered, and thou gladly wouldst.

The reason is, 1. the kingdome of Christ is not of this world, his authoritie deuideth not ciuill inheritances, his crowne and scepter detract not from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> earthly crownes and scepters, his weapons are not carnall, the keyes of his kingdome are no temporall iurisdiction, he could both be the true &amp; lawfull King of the Iewes, and yet conuey himselfe away when they would haue giuen him his right. 2. For one ordinance of God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> another, would argue want of wisedome in God the ordainer, the very thought whereof were blasphemous. The orders of Christ in his Church then cannot bring confusion in the commonwealth: for then the Lord should not be a God of order, but of confusion: nay on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie, for the Churches sake which he loueth, he keepeth order, and maintaineth gouernment in common wealths, that his Church while it is a gathering in the world, might find safe harbour therein, and this doue of Christ haue place, where to set without danger the soale of her foote. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. Moses so wisely from God constituted both ecclesiasticall and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall ordinances, as that the one was so farre from violencing the other, as one of them could not stand without the other: and was Christ the

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine meeteth with that wicked opinion of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists, and Libertines, who hold that Christians need no Magistrates,<note place="margin">Against Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists.</note> nor ought to be subiect vnto any; and why so? 1. Because they are the Lords freemen. 2. They are the iust who need no laws, but are a law to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. 3. They need no protection but the Lords. 4. Their badge is loue, which suffreth, and couereth all things, and therefore they may not reuenge, nor resist euill by carrying before the Magistrate. But for the first, the libertie of the Lords free men in this life, is spirituall and inward: and no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>utward and bodily, till the life to come. For the second, if the law be not made against them, yet it is for them, and their good; for suppose they do no euill, yet may they suffer much wrong and euill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence of law; so as the old saying will here be true, Kings were ordained for men, and not men for Kings; and especially for good men, as the shepheard for the sheep, and not principally for the wolues. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the supposition is nought, for though they be iust, yet they are so but in part, and therefore sometimes they follow their priuate affections and do wrong, and need the law to vrge them to do right. For the third, although beleeuers be vnder the protection of God, who suffreth not an hayre to fall from their heads without his prouidence; yet may we not strip his prouidence from the meanes which serue it, of which this is a speciall one. And for the fourth, true it is that loue <hi>couereth all things:</hi> but by couering, must be meant, 1. A fauourable construction of all things, which in right reason may be well con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A passing by smaller infirmities, and priuate offences, as one that would not take knowledge of them. 3. Such a couering as may cure also, for loue is wise, and herein most louing when in taking notice of an iniurie, it turneth it selfe to the discipline of the partie; sometimes by louing admonition in all lenitie, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by mercifull seueritie in sharper reprehension: yea, and if that take no place, in proceeding further to discouer the sores to skilfull surgions, according to the quality of the offence, to the bench either of the church, or commonwealth; and this is no impreachment vnto loue, as we see in God himselfe, who chasteneth vnto amendment whom he loueth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, Christians may not returne euill for euill, but rather beare two blowes then giue one, and suffer a double iniurie then offer one: but yet this hindreth not, but that a Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for euen Christ himselfe hauing a blow on one cheeke turned not the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but was readier and would haue done it before he would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the wrong as he might. Lastly, Christians may not reuenge. But reuenge is twofold; either lawfull, or vnlawfull. This latter is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate reuenge done by a mans selfe, or by the help of the Magistrate; when a man seeketh to right his wrong with the hatred, and wreckling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vpon the person, or any other sinister end; and this must be farre from a Christian. But there is a publike reuenge put in the hands of the Magistrate,<note place="margin">Rom. 13 4. 1. Pet. 2 14. <gap reason="foreign">

By what other meanes did the Chaldean courtyers, incense Nebuchadnezzar against the three companions of Daniel,<note place="margin">Dan. 3.12.</note> but by imitating their contempt of him and his edict? <hi>These men haue not regarded thy commandement, nor will serue thy gods, nor worship thy image which thou hast set vp.</hi> By what other means did Rehum and Shimshai, and their companions, hinder the building of the temple, then by writing vnto Artashast, that if the Iewes had once fortified themselues within walls, they would be rebellious as of old, and would pay neither toll,<note place="margin">Ezr. 4.13.</note> tribute, nor custome; and that they wrote thus much, because they would not see the kings dishonour? In the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:18792:282"/>
how haue Christians standing out for the lawes of Christ against Antichrist, beene alwaies charged, that they were the onely subuerters of the place where they liued, and the direct contradictors of the decrees of the Caesars vnder whom they liued? How often was Paul accused, by the Stoicks in Athens, by Demetrius, by Tertullus,<note place="margin">Act. 17.18. and 19.26. and 24 5.</note> that he was a pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fellowe, a moouer of sedition among all the Iewes thorough the world, and a sect-master. And it is no meruell if the members and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ be thus dealt with in the world, seeing the head himselfe,<note place="margin">Satan hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer laboured to bring Christian religion into the hatred of Princes, as the greatest enemy to their estate.</note> was not onely accused and condemned, but executed, for that he was an enemie to Caesar, and a moouer of sedition. Our eyes haue seene and read, and our eares haue heard, how Popish spirits haue euer beene rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to charge the Protestants in seuerall countryes, to haue attempted to wrest the sword out of the Princes hand: <hi>Harding</hi> chargeth <hi>Luther,</hi> to haue animated <hi>Thomas Munzer,</hi> the rebels preacher in Thuringia; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Luther plainly calleth him, the preacher of Sathan: so the Rhemists call <hi>M.

This hath euer beene the cunning of Sathan, to preuent the accusation of others in the things wherein himselfe is most guiltie; for those that knowe Popish doctrine, can easily discouer it to be none of Christs nor his Apostles, because it wresteth all Princes authoritie out of their hands, and mooueth their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects to rebellion: and such as knowe the state of Rome and Rhemes, knowe where the shoppes stand in which all conspiracies and rebellions haue beene, and are daily forged: and then where would they lay them but vpon Protestants? who hence shewe themselues taught by Christ, because if Satan himselfe should come to accuse, yet could he not say truely, that euer any such thing was found in their hands. Did not Charles the ninth of Fraunce giue out, that the most bloodie massacre that euer the sunne sawe, was done for the conspiracie of the Protestants against him, and the kingdome? whereas it was onely a Popish and perfidious plot, long before laid against the liues of those deare children of God. And where should the gunpowder treason haue beene laid, if the blowe had beene giuen? had not Satan deuised shoulders, which had borne a many such malitious imputations before? But notwithstanding such bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beares, whereby Satan would scare men from the sincere imbracing of the truth, and entertaining of the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of Christ, as the greatest enemies of states and kingdoms; let vs be wise hearted, and bold to giue Satan the lie: seeing the sincerest preachers and professors of the Gospel, are so far from denial of the right of Princes, as that the doctrine which they bring establisheth their power in their hands rather: like the workemen of Salomon, who built the Temple, and built his throne too. And let Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant

preachers, and professors carrie this garland and tryumph against all Popish spirits; that although the enemies of the truth haue narrowly in all ages sifted them, to finde iniquitie in them, that thereby they might iustly get the ciuill sword drawne against them; yet haue they found no such thing in them.</p>

It is not power, it is not policie, that will still subdue and keepe vnder a rebellious people, without the power of the word in their consciences: for till obedience be willingly yeelded vnto God, it can neuer be conscionably, and then not constantly, yeelded vnto his Leiftenant. This may be a ground of our prayer, that the Lord would be pleased to put into the hearts of our gouernours, that the Gospel may be throughly planted in Ireland; for this is the most direct way to subdue the rebels, and bring the whole countrie vnder willing and free subiection.</p>

Aaron the high Priest must obey Moses: Ahimelech when wicked Saul sent for him to slay him, obeyed him, beeing summoned he came, and appealed not from the vniust sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death: so did Christ, so did his Apostles, and so must and ought their successors vnto the ende: yet sometimes (as it is seene in all tenures which are not from God, men knowe not what to hold to) after the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish cleargie hath challenged their exemption and authoritie by diuine right from the word; beeing pressed, they forget themselues, and claime it <hi>iur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The second point is, wherein and how farre we ought to obey Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.<note place="margin">Eccles. 8.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Euery Christian is bound to <hi>take heede to the mouth of the king</hi> in all things, and so farre as he hath power to command. Now because the ciuill Magistrate is alwaies bound to <hi>command in the Lord</hi>: and 2. is the father of our bodies after a sort, and of all our outward man: hence two grounds of great moment are concluded. The former is, that euerie man must obey all possible commandements,<note place="margin">Vsque ad aras.</note> which are not against the lawe of nature, and the lawe of God: for the Magistrate in all his commandements, as well as executions must be the <hi>Minister of God,</hi> onely vrging that vpon his subiects, which God himselfe, whose place he sustaineth, would vrge. It is said of Cyrus,<note place="margin">Isa. 44 28. 2. Chr. 19.6. Zach. 4.14. Salomons throne is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Gods throne, 2. Chr. 9.8.</note> that he must be Gods <hi>sheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,</hi> and he shall performe not his owne, but all <hi>my desire.</hi> The iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not <hi>mans, but Gods</hi>: and it is the honourable style of Princes to be assistants <hi>to the ruler of the whole earth:</hi> neither is this to denie any supremacie to Princes, to tie them to the tables of which God hath made
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:18792:284"/>
them the keepers; but it is to ascribe vnto them such soueraigntie vnder God ouer all causes and persons Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill, as that they may not depose the care of Church or Common-wealth, as a thing wherein they will not be wearied; but must prouide that sincere and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt doctrine be published in all their Churches; that the Sacraments be duely and seasonably administred according to Christs institution; that the whole worship of God be purged from humane traditions, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions; that the Church discipline be executed according to the word of God; that not onely thefts, murthers, adulteries, forceries, (which euen heathen kings haue rooted out of their countries) be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but also blasphemies, cursings, atheisme, heresie, drunkennes, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, &amp;c. In a word, we yeelde vnto the soueraigne power, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne authoritie to driue all sorts of men Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill, to all those duties religious or secular, which God hath laid vpon them, and according to their care herein haue they beene commended or disal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Now that Princes should not command, but according vnto God, the Lord hath appointed them meanes:<note place="margin">Deut. 17.18.</note> as, 1. The <hi>booke of the lawe</hi> to be by them continually, to iudge of all matters according to the mouth of the Lord, and to frame and execute their lawes according to the same. 2. The <hi>ministerie</hi> to explane and lay open,<note place="margin">Magistracie and ministerie serue one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the left hand doth the right.</note> and put them in mind of their dutie out of that booke. For these two, Magistracie and Ministerie, serve one an other, as the left hand the right. But here Ministers must take heede, that they take no more vpon them, then to aduise and aduertise from the Lord; seeing this is one maine difference betweene Magistracy and Ministerie, that although one haue an eye to the other, in that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracie must stablish the Ministerie;<note place="margin">Harmon of Confess. sect 19. cap. 23.</note> and the Ministerie direct Magistra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; yet neither of them may execute the other. Moses and Aaron must communicate their counsels and labours, but both must knowe their owne standing. After them Iosuah must ioyne with Eleazer: Dauid the king must take advise of Nathan, and Gad the Prophets: Iosiah with Huldas: so long as Iehoidah the Priest liueth to direct Ioas, he prooueth well,<note place="margin">2. Chr. 24.2.17. 2. Chr. 26.5.16.</note> but after his death he waxeth worse. And Vzziah will seeke the Lord in the dayes of Zachariah the Priest, but afterward degenerateth, and groweth verie naught, and vnlike vnto himselfe. Thus as formerly we haue stablished the regall power ouer all persons Ecclesiasticall as wel as others; so now haue we also ouer all causes Ecclesiasticall as well as Ciuill, with this onely exception, vnder Christ; who must still be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the soueraigne Lord and King of his Church, to rule it by his own word and lawes: according to which direction, while they square their gouernement (as Moses did all in the temple by the patterne shewed in
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:18792:284"/>
the mount) happy are the people, happie is their gouernement, happie are themselues in their administration, but thrice happie shall they be in their account.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But all this while you onely bind the Prince to the lawes of Christ in gouerning the Church; doe you giue him no power to make Ecclesiasticall lawes and constitutions of his owne? <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, but concerning this point I thus conceiue, that Ecclesiasticall lawes are of two sorts. 1. Such as prescribe both the matter and manner of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of God, and the whole substance of Church gouernement, which are all the lawes of Christ himselfe made to his hand. 2. Other Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall lawes which remaine for the supreame power to make, are of two sorts. 1. Either edicts for the authorizing and commanding the excuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the former lawes, for the building and repairing of the Church, that it may be a louely spouse of Christ. Or 2. such constitutions as are circumstantiall, and in things meerely indifferent; which may varie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the variablenes of times, places, and dispositions of Churches: and here he hath power to make Church-lawes of his owne, so as the rules of the word be not transgressed concerning things indifferent. And I thinke this a truth not denied by any. In performing both these latter, Kings and Queenes are called nursing Fathers, and nursing Mothers to the Church.</p>
               <p>Now follows the <hi>second ground</hi> to be laid for the resoluing of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer point, namely, that seeing Kings are of power to doe what they list, although not euer lawfully in regard of the lawes of God or nature, yet safely in respect of his subiects, who may not violently resist their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or proceedings: for who shall say vnto him, <hi>what doest thou?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccles. 8.4.</note> in this regard they may, and sometimes doe command vnlawfull and vniust things; and inflict grieuous and heauie burdens vniustly: whether must obedience and subiection be yeelded them or no? <hi>Ans.</hi> The conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, It is neuer lawfull to resist or rebell, or vse any violence against a lawfull Magistrate; for this were to rise vp in armes against the ordinance of God, and consequently against God himselfe.<note place="margin">Ordinatio divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na secundum substantiam: humana secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum modum, &amp; finem.</note> The Apostle Peter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede calleth it an <hi>humane ordinance,</hi> or creature; but not in regard of the author, as if it were deuised by man; but of the ende, because it is ordained of God for man as the proper subiect, and for his profit as the proper ende of it. And therefore though Popish Friers and factors stand within Corahs tents, with poisoned daggers digging out the life-blood of Christian Princes, and especially the Iesuites those cursed Shebaes, which make no bones by themselues and others, most treacherously to slay their kings and masters; yet Dauids heart smote him when he made but a slight assault vpon the skirt of Sauls garment, because he was the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:18792:285"/>
Lords anoynted: teaching vs by his example another lesson, then by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to helpe our selues (if we could doe it) out of the vniust comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, and executions of those whom God hath set in eminence and authoritie aboue vs.</p>
               <p>But here we must take direction how to carie our selues towards law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Magistrates, commanding or imposing vnlawfull things. For consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration must be had, whether the command bind vs to <hi>doe,</hi> or to <hi>suffer</hi> and beare any vniust thing. If the former, enioyning vs to doe that wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue not good ground to do it of faith, here the supreame power of all must be obeyed; and the prince only in and for the Lord: for so Cesar must haue Cesars, as God may haue Gods. Daniel and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes deliberated not to answer the King, but boldly and readily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, that they would neuer worship his Image, they would submit themselues to his furie, but durst not to his commandement. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in Queene Maries time, whose mention and memorie is honourable, resisted not, nor rebelled, they willingly and ioyfully gaue their bodies to the flames; but still professed against the idolatrous worship and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine established by law. In Ieroboams time, those which could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselues to the edict of the calues, were doubtles counted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient, and had the grace of the times: and it went hard with others that durst not saue their labour, but repayred to the Temple still: but the Lord condemneth and accursed such wicked obedience, and bringeth euill vpon all Israel for it. No power on earth can make the conscience safe in the doing of a thing vnlawfull, although in a thing indifferent, conformed to the rules of the word, the Princes law is a binder. It is a weake speach therefore to say, I do this and that vnwillingly, or which I had rather not doe: and if it be a sinne which I do, it is the Princes sinne, and not mine: nay, whatsoeuer action of thine wanteth faith, is thy sinne: besides, although all thy externall condition is in the power of the Magistrate, yet internall things, as the keeping of faith, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and good conscience, are not in his power, but placed by God in the will and consent of the beleeuer, to keepe or to loose. Secondly, but if the Princes commandement call vs to <hi>suffer</hi> any vniust thing, as if he should laie tyrannicall burdens vpon bodie, goods, and outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state; these we must acknowledge subiected vnto him by God, and therefore the ordinarie defence is prayer and patience, by which the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of vniust vexation will become iust and comfortable: vnlesse for the time of the brunt of persecution, we can conuey our selues from the furie: according to that of Christ, if they persecute you in one citie, flie to another: and Act. 8.1. the Saints were scattered by the persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for by this meanes of preseruing our selues, we preserue also the
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:18792:285"/>
Church, which otherwise would be destroied in vs: but els we must meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beare all vniust vexations,<note place="margin">Prov. 24.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> and in such times take heed of <hi>medling with the seditious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These two former grounds will become clearer, by the explaning of some instances which we meet with in the Scripture, and therefore it will be worth our labour breifly to inquire into some few of them. And first, whether Mordecay did with good conscience deny subiection, yea reuerence to Haman; seeing hereby he not only made light of a great man sent by the King, but also of the Kings commandement, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Haman thus to be honoured, as the reprehension of the Kings seruants noted in the text prooueth,<note place="margin">Ester 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>why transgressest thou the Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement? Answ.</hi> Mordecay was bound in conscience to obey nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them in any thing contrarie to the word of God, as this required honour was: 1. Because it was more then ciuill: for such the Persian Kings required as was at least mixed with that which was due to God; else it is lawfull inough to fall downe on ones face before Princes. 2. If it had beene but ciuill honour, yet it had not beene due from Mordecay to Haman, because Haman was descended from a nation which God had cursed, and willed his people to hate and abhorre, and neuer to seeke their peace all their daies: but especially, they were charged neuer to forget the inhumanitie of the Amalekites, but vtterly to destroie them,<note place="margin">Deut. 25.17.19.</note> because they were the first that came out to warre against them after their comming out of Egypt. If the honour had beene but ciuill; and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay of any other people then the Iewes, to whom that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was directed, and Haman of any other offspring then an Agagite, that is, of the offspring of the Kings of the Amalekites, who were all of Agag, surnamed Agags, as it were the Pharaohs of Egypt, and Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sars of Rome; he would not haue denied this honour, or if he had, he had sinned.</p>
               <p>The second instance is in Naboth, of whom it may be enquired, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could iustly denie Ahab his vinyard,<note place="margin">1. king. 21.3.</note> seeing the Kings hath power to take feilds and vinyards, and giue them to his seruants, 1. Sam. 8.14. and in outward things we must obey, although to our detriment and losse. <hi>Answ.</hi> Naboth iustly refused, because God had forbid him so to do. In Leuit. 25. the law is expresse, that no Israelite might sell his feild but vpon condition of redeeming it, and returning vnto it in the Iubely: but Ahab did not so require it, but either to purchase it out, because it lay so fit for him; or else to exchange it. Now that this was the iust ground of his deniall, appeareth in his answer: God forbid that I should giue the <hi>inheritance of my Fathers vnto thee:</hi> he knew well, that if coppie-holders and tenants vnto men, may not set, let, or alienate without their
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:18792:286"/>
landlords consent: much lesse might he against the expresse will and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of his Lord. Againe, if it had bin only a losse and dammage vnto himselfe alone, he would doubtles haue yeelded: but no euill of sin must be chosen at all.</p>
               <p>The third instance, whether the people might warrantably resist Saul, when he would haue put Ionathan to death:<note place="margin">1. Sam. 14 45.</note> seeing Saul had sworne his death, and the Lord seemed by lot to designe him thereto. <hi>Answ.</hi> This was a meane wherby it pleased the Lord to deliuer Ionathan at that time. The deliuering of an innocent was good, the question is of the meanes. To which I adde, that if it were by meanes of intercession, and due respect and reuerence to the Kings person and place (as the text see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to implie by their pleading for Ionathan) the meanes also were good: but if it were by mutinie, or opposition, or sedition, yet this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the fact shall be condemned, but not the fact it selfe. As for the lot, the Lord indeed noted thereby Ionathans fact; but thereby conuic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not of a fault, <hi>for Ionathan heard not when his father charged the people with the othe</hi>; the whole falt therefore rested in Sauls inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate and rash othe.</p>

                     </gap>.</note>The fourth instance is in Ioab, both in not obeying one commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Dauid, and in obeying another. First, whether he did well in slaying Absolon, hauing such an expresse charge to spare him, yea to vse him kindly. <hi>Answ.</hi> Absolon iustly deserued death by the law, Deut. 21.18. and iustly fell in his sinne: but Ioab sinned in slaying him: for although he was the generall of the warre, and had power, yet he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that he was a subiect, and that in this one point his power was limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by him that gaue him his whole command. Meete it was that Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon should be punished, but by Dauids consent: and though Ioab thought it in policie the safest way to put him out of the way, yet his father conceiued how fearefull his death would be, if he should be cut off in his sinne; and no doubt purposed otherwise by banishment, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment to haue repressed him, if he could no way haue reclaimed him. But Ioab had no power ouer his life wilfully to slaie him, when Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid had excepted it; and put case it was a falt to spare him, it was Dauids, and not his.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.1.</note>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But whether did he well to obey Dauid in numbring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, beeing a thing which Moses, and Ioshuah did without sinne; and wherein the King was so peremptorie. <hi>Ans.</hi> He sinfully obeyed Dauid, euen as he did also in betraying Vri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h vpon Dauids letter: he was a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyer that conceiued himselfe to be at euery command, although against his conscience, as this was: he knew that God had forbidden to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the poople, without a speciall commandement, or necessarie cause,
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:18792:286"/>
or without paying the halfe shekel appointed for <hi>euery ones redemption</hi> at euery time of numbring: his speach in 1. Chro. 21.3. sheweth,<note place="margin">Exod. 30.12.</note> that it was not only against the law of God, but the light of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: <hi>are not all the people my Lords seruants: wherefore doth my Lord require this thing? why should he be a cause of trespasse to Israel:</hi> as if he had said, there is no warre in had, no rebellion in the land, no comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God, and therefore this wil be turned into trespasse against Israel, yet he did it.</p>
               <p>Thus by these instances we haue cleared the second point considered in this doctrine, and haue seene wherein and how farre we are bound to obey: now we come to the third.</p>
               <p>The third point in this second doctrine is,<note place="margin">Reasons why Christians must be subiect to Magistrates.</note> wherefore we must be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect? <hi>Answ.</hi> The reasons are sundrie, First that we may herein acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ordinance of God, which we must looke vnto whatsoeuer the persons be; for to this the forme of speach in the text calleth vs, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I haue alreadie noted. The which that we may take better notice of, 1.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Lord challengeth it to belong to himselfe to raise vp and giue Kings to rule ouer people, <hi>By mee Kings raigne:</hi> and Daniel 4.14. <hi>The most high hath power ouer the kingdome of men, and giueth it to whomsoeuer he will.</hi> Moses praying for a successor saith, <hi>Let the God of the spirits of all flesh appoint a man.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Numb. 27.16.</note> the Lord hath put his owne name vpon such whom he thus raiseth: <hi>I said yee are Gods.</hi> Thirdly, he setteth a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> stampe of his owne maiestie, mercie, iustice, and wisedome vpon these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> little gods; yea a great part of his image shineth vpon euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; both in that so many hundred thousands are subdued vnder the power of one, in that the whole administration of a people is in one hand, and that the good estate of all dependeth vpon him vnder God alone. Fourthly, he putteth his own spirit vpon them as he did vpon the seauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Elders to assist Moses, yea he giueth them extraordinarie spirits,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.17.</note> and as we read of Saul, changeth them into other men; not alwaies the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of sanctification, but of regiment and authoritie. Fifthly, he maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> this their authoritie, and this sundrie waies. 1. by putting on them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a maiestie and presence, euen a sparkle of his own to draw an awfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence of themselues, and daunt offenders. 2. he permitteth them an answerable estate,<note place="margin">The Lord main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth their authoritie 4. waies.</note> whereby they may lawfully beare themselues with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> state, pompe, and magnificence aboue all other; and by their costly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, stately pallaces, and sutable seruice and attendance, they may not be only distinguished from their subiects; but expresse also the maiestie and greatnes of there estate. 3. by diuerse laws and iniunctions he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> such things as any way might bring the calling into contempt. As 1. concerning their persons, if any be to be chosen, they must be men

of <hi>courage, fearing God,</hi> and <hi>hating couetousnesse:</hi> to this purpose he gaue a lawe to the Iewes,<note place="margin">Deut. 23.2.</note> that no bastard should be raised vnto of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice among them to the tenth generation; and this was, least the place should bee embased by such persons. 2. Concerning their behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in the place, it must carrie with it a stately grauitie beseeming the place; and scorning to attempt any meane or base actions, such as Dauid intimated Saul did in persecuting and hunting him, <hi>Is the King of Israel come out to seeke a flea?</hi> To this serue such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as that,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 26.20. Prou. 31.4.</note> 
                  <hi>It is not for Kings to drinke wine, nor for Princes strong drinke</hi>; this were an indigne thing, and a great blot in his high place. 3. Concerning our behauiour towards them, it must be euery way hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dutifull: hence are such precepts, <hi>thou shalt not raile, or reuile the Prince of thy people:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 22.28. Eccles. 10 20.</note> no nor <hi>curse the King in thy heart, nor the rich in thy bed chamber.</hi> Thus is the Lord euerie way carefull by his lawe to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> whatsoeuer might lighten this authoritie in the hearts of men. 4. The Lord maintaineth this authoritie by directing their counsells, <hi>God sitteth in the midst of the gods:</hi> by protecting their persons, for <hi>he giueth saluation vnto Kings</hi>; and strangely to this purpose by reuealing the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie thoughts onely imagined against them. By all which, the Lord will haue vs to honour them whom himselfe thus honoureth, and espie his own stampe and image vpon them: so as in our subiection and obedience vnto them, we may knowe that we haue to deale with God; and in our despising of them, make account to heare that in 1. Sam. 8.7. <hi>They haue not cast thee away, but me from ruling ouer them.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The second reason is drawne from the profit we receiue by this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which is also the Apostles reason, <hi>he is the minister of God for thy wealth</hi>; namely, both to defend from a thousand euills, from the robber and spoyler, from him that would defile wife and daughter: as also settle euerie man vnder his vine and figtree, that with good hearts and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse they may serue God. A King neuer so bad is a great good, and better a tyrant then no king: when there was no king in Israel, euerie man <hi>did whatsoeuer seemed good in his owne eyes</hi>; anarchie openeth the windowe to all licentiousnesse; and farre better is it to beare one tyrant then many, &amp; to suffer wrong of one, rather then of all, and to part with a tenth, then be stript of the whole; for where any gouernment is, although sometimes the good be punished, so are the bad too, that they cannot doe what villanie they gladly would. What a rich blessing then is a religious and vertuous Kings, from whom his people vnder God receiue the whole benefit of religion and iustice? here is the nurse of the Church, the father of the commonwealth,<note place="margin">Iob 29 16.

of which reacheth to heauen from whence it came; the sight of it to the ends of the world while, it selfe standeth in the midst of the earth, that there might be equall accesse of all vnto it: in it is meate for all: it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a shadow vnder it for all the beasts of the feild, and all the birds make nests in the boughes of it. Let vs here cast our eyes vpon our own happines in our noble King <hi>Iames</hi>; whom we haue great cause to account (as the Israelites Dauid) the light of our Israel: yea and (as they of Iosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah) the breath of our nostrils: the serious acknowledgment whereof,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>The third reason is drawne from the danger of resisting and rebelling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> against this ordinance, which the Lord hath taken vpon himselfe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; as he did Moses against <hi>Corah, Miriam,</hi> and the murmuring Iewes. Who hath euer taken the sword (God not putting it into his hand) but he perished by it? What Shebah or Adoniah euer blew a trumpet of sedition, but they did this thing <hi>against their owne liues?</hi> When Dauid would haue spared rebellious Absolon, did not the Lord hang him by the haire betweene heauen and earth vnder an oke? <hi>Had Zimri peace which slew his Master?</hi> wicked Iesabel could obserue the ruine of such treacherous conspirators. Our owne Chronicles are full of rare examples of Gods iudgements, our eyes haue seene not a few vpon such. The strange discouerie of Percies conspiracie may not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; nor let that wickednes, and the iust vengeance of God vpon the actors, neuer be put out from vnder heauen. Neither is this only an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane obseruation, but an infallible extract and conclusion out of the word: Prov. 24.21. My son, feare God, and the King, and meddle not with the seditious; <hi>for their destruction shall rise suddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them?</hi> To these reasons might be added, that it is the brand of Libertines and carnall Gospellers, to <hi>despise gouernment,</hi>

But the precept is entire of it selfe, and seuerall from the other before: and as I take it both parallel vnto that generall phrase, cap. 2.14. <hi>zealous of good workes:</hi> and contrarie to that cap. 1.16. <hi>reprobate to euerie good worke.</hi> Secondly, more <hi>specially,</hi> both 1. by remoouall of the lets of concord and loue,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> 2. by entertaining such vertues as are the nurses and cherishers of Christian concord amongst men; of which the Apostle nameth two of the principall. The former, is Christian <hi>equitie,</hi> which ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth the minde equally and indifferently, freeing it from passion and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:18792:288"/>
that it may conceiue the best of persons and actions. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is Christian lenitie, gentlenes, or <hi>meekenesse,</hi> which euen in taking notice of the faults and vices of others, <hi>couereth</hi> so farre as is good for the partie: and also in the spirit of loue and meekenesse <hi>cureth,</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to restore such an offender. And as the two former vices were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in regard of all men, so these two vertues are not so nakedly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, but that their obiects also are by the Apostle noted in the last words: where the Apostle saith that we must be equall, and mild, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those in authoritie, who may else returne our frowardnes with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable displeasure; nor onely to our friends and familiars, or such as by the bond of nature or seruice may claime such dealing from vs; neither onely to Gods friends and beleeuers: but to <hi>all men</hi> indefinitely, euen those to whome out of the bond of Christianitie we are nothing bound; those who in themselues deserue no such thing, but the contrarie at our hands: in a word, those who are not onely our enemies, but Gods after a sort; beeing as yet without, and not brought vnto the faith: which last words may not slightly be ouerpassed, because they lay a notable ground, and make way vnto the verses following.</p>
               <p>For this first generall exhortation, the scope is, that euery Christian ought to keepe with him a propensitie, and disposition to euerie good worke, whether it concerne God, or himselfe, or others: for the Apostle hauing called vs to giue God Gods, and Caesars to Caesar; that the body of Christ might be without rent, as his coate was without seame; and that there might be a sweet harmonie and concent in the Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; he now calleth to the practise of a common principle, and lawe in nature, namely, to giue euerie man that right which God hath giuen him: and Christians are not onely debters vnto Magistrates, but to the meanest and weakest, to whom the common bond of nature and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie hath knit vs: so as no man can say of any man, I owe him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. The like practise of our Apostle we may elsewhere obserue, as Rom. 13. where hauing in many verses required subiection and tribute due vnto Princes; in the 7. and 8. verses to shut vp his exhortation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, he wisheth to giue to euerie man his due, tribute to whome tribute, custome to whome custome, feare to whom feare, honour to whom ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but loue to all men, <hi>owe nothing to any man but loue:</hi> which is such a desperate debt as a man can neuer discharge himselfe of. The like doth the Apostle Peter, who combineth all these duties in one short verse, but a little inverting the order: <hi>Feare God, honour the King,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This precept in hand chargeth vpon euerie Christian these two maine duties. <hi>First,</hi> that he must make account with himselfe that everie
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:18792:289"/>
Christian dutie belongeth vnto him, euen <hi>euerie good worke</hi> to which the Lord giueth him calling and abilitie. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that he must keepe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in a fitnesse and readinesse thereunto.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The former is cleared by the testimonie and other obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions out of the Scripture: The lawe curseth him that continueth not in all <hi>things:</hi> the Gospel also in generall requireth the obseruation of <hi>all things:</hi> Teach them to <hi>obserue all things</hi> which I haue commanded you; which precept was giuen when Christ had on the crosse fulfilled all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in the persons of his members. As for the speciall precepts of the Gospel, they are many: Philip. 4.8. <hi>Whatsoeuer things are true, honest, iust, pure, pertaining to loue, of good report, if there be any vertue, or any praise, thinke on these things.</hi> The Apostle was not content that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths should abound in euery grace else, and be wanting in one: but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.7.</note> that as they abounded in <hi>euerie thing, in faith, in word, in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in diligence, in loue,</hi> so they would striue to abound in <hi>this grace also,</hi> namely, of mercifulnesse to the distressed Saints. The same Apostle to the Thessalonians knewe what he prayed, when he wished that they were stablished to <hi>euerie good word and worke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2.17.</note> 2. This standeth with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> those special commendations which the Apostles haue giuen of sundry of the Saints, to stirre vp others vnto their imitation. When Paul would be large in commending the Church of the Romanes, he affirmeth they were <hi>full of goodnesse</hi>:<note place="margin">Rom. 15.14.</note> so of Dorcas we read, that she was <hi>full of good workes and almes:</hi> and mention is made of the coats and garments which shee had made for the Saints.<note place="margin">Act. 9.36.</note> 3. As the holy Ghost in Scripture ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooueth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and commendeth the presence of any true grace, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of it; so also taketh he notice of that which is yet wanting, to prouoke to the purchase of it. Many of the good kings of Iudah were highly commended, yet something or other they fayled in, either the high places were not wholly taken downe, or some league or othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

4. The nature of grace giueth light and euidence vnto this truth, the which disposeth the will and powers of the soule equally vnto one good <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> thing, as well as vnto an other: for regeneration includeth in it the seeds of all vertues, and reneweth and changeth the whole nature, which hath in it the seede of all sinne and vice: and when the Scripture would note the soundnesse of grace, hence it doth it, that it both hath respect <hi>to all the commandements, and hateth all the wayes of falshood.</hi>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine first teacheth vs to learne the rule of euery good worke, legall or euangelicall. The former are not only such as are commonly knowne and expressed in the words of the decalogue; but such also as therein are included and implied; these must be sought out; for else ignorance of the law excuseth not from fault. Content not thy selfe that thou canst say the commandements, nor if thou canst say that thou hast kept the whole letter of the law from thy youth: but studie the whole Scripture, which is an exposition and large commentarie of those tenne words, heare it, read it diligently, meditate vpon it, apply it to thy heart and life, else knowest thou not how to beginne any good work. Learne further the speciall good workes required by the Gospel, such as are faith in Christ, repentance of sin past, amendment of life for time to come. And cursed be all that Popish doctrine, which would hide this light vnder a bushell, whereby alone the Christian can discerne what is a good worke, and how himselfe may do it well.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. If euery good worke belong to euery Christian,<note place="margin">Not onely the Minister but common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must be ready for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duties.</note> then may not men post ouer the matter to the Minister; the common conceit is, that the clergie should be <hi>holy, hospitable,</hi> and so qualified as we haue heard in the first Chapter, but for common men and vnlearned, it will be acceptable inough if they be <hi>almost Christians,</hi> that is, as good as neuer a whit: whereas the Lord bindeth vpon euery Christian, of what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion soeuer, the practise of euery good worke which is offered him within the compasse of his calling, either generall or particular. For example: If a Christian be called into publike place, as of Magistracie, he may not conceiue that the building of the Church, the discountenancing of sinne, the encouragement of the godly, belongeth only to the Minister; but he must set hand to these workes, he must establish, and countenance the Ministrie, he must be the foreman in all good exercises; he must be rich in workes of mercie and of iustice, the patron of the poore, the sheild of the oppressed: but especially a patterne of pietie, he must be a man <hi>fearing God: yea he and his house must serue the Lord.</hi> If thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainest a priuate man, the same care lyeth vpon thee in thy proportion: thou must procure the wealth of Ierusalem, at least by thy prayers for the peace of the Church, for able Ministers, for the free passage of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel:
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:18792:290"/>
and if God further enable thee, thou must releeue such as stand for the truth of God, and puritie of his worship: Thou must doe all the good thou canst to others in preseruing life, feeding the hungrie, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the naked, visiting the prisoners, and so become rich in the works of mercie. Thou must also be diligent in duties at home, in reforming thy family, teaching them, praying with them, examining how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and thriue in grace, and walking religiously and conscionably in euery good worke of thy personall calling. Here is a course which goeth farre beyond harmelesnsse, and good meanings, and good words, which Iames saw to be the religion of many in his time; this is soundnes in christianity, when a man can thus turne himselfe, as well to one good action as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Some there are that seeme very religious, can come to Church, go in the count and companie of Christians, and religious persons, but verie vnmercifull, ouergrowne with couetousnesse, and in priuate, for a pennie aduantage, discharge all religion, till Church time againe. Others are mercifull inough, but carelesse of religion altogether; some are iust in their dealings, but vncleane, or intemperate; others are temperate, but vniust, lyars, swearers, and no fidelitie in them. The Apostle Iames meeteth with all these,<note place="margin">Iam. 1.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bros.</note> and keeping ones selfe vnspotted, but in visiting the fatherles and widow; that is, the frequent practise of workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and charitie: many say, if I were rich I would do thus and thus: but art thou a Christian, art thou religious? then though thou beest poore, thou art mercifull. Paul commended the Macedonians that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but poore, yet they were rich in liberalitie toward the Saints. 2. in cap. 2.10. that he that offendeth in one point of the law, is guiltie of all; and he that saith thou shalt not commit adulterie, saith also thou shalt not kill; now if thou dost no adulterie, yet if thou killest, thou art a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. If a Christian must employ himselfe in <hi>euery good work</hi> then must men so cast and contriue their courses,<note place="margin">The Christian course must be so wisely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued, as no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie may hinder another. Eccles. 8.5.</note> that neither duties of pietie hinder the duties of their calling, nor these stand in the way of the other. And he that <hi>hath the heart of the wise to know time and iudgement,</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casteth both wisely, and knoweth one of these to be subordinate, but not opposite vnto the other. Hence must Christians forecast, and remember the Sabboath before hand; and so order and husband their times and seasons, that there may be place, and time, and oportunitie for euery good worke in the week-day; and especially for the best workes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publike exercises of religion, or priuate prayers and exercises in the family. Which wise managing of affaires, because men are wanting in, therefore sometimes the Sabboath must be encroched vpon, and Gods
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:18792:290"/>
seruice iustled out for some carnall matters: other times weeks exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are neglected, because this inconuenience or losse in the calling, was not seasonably and prudently preuented; the priuate seruice of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the family, must now and then be laid downe for a time or turne, because some other domestical distraction hath deuoured the time allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it. Let no man then seperate those duties, which the Lord hath coupled; if thou beest readie to the duties of thy particular calling, forget not the duties of the generall; if thou wouldst be seruiceable to men, forget not in the meane time thy seruice of God. If thou canst be diligent to prouide for thy selfe and thy family, set sometime apart to looke out, to enquire into and releeue the necessities of Gods children &amp; family abroad. But woe to such knots of companionship tied fast by the deuil, to sporting, gaming, or other vngodly lusts, that neither the duties of their calling on the weekeday, nor religious exercises on the Sabboath can obtaine them.</p>

Hereby we may laie hold of Christian consolation, in that this readie and willing mind is accepted, where often power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> good is wanting; and indeed the regenerate often want power and abilitie vnto good, but to want will and desire, is dangerous.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> soule; God who loueth only a cheerefull giuer, will not endure it. 2. He that is continually readie to euery good worke, cannot but be abundant in good workes: the phrase little differing from that, 1. Tim. 5.10. The widow that hath beene <hi>continually giuen to euery good worke</hi>: for else this readinesse could not be other then an idle preparation. Dost thou <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue</hi> in prayer? in <hi>all things giue thankes?</hi> hast thou bin diligent in tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vp thy family in Gods feare? hast thou with <hi>Onesephorus, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed the Saints?</hi> doth the loynes of many blesse thee, and the blessing of the poore and widow returne vpon thee? shew me the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In such a partie will be a forgoing and departure with things of price, yea the best thing he hath will not be too deare to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase that dutie which he seeth God requiring at his hands; which if it be wanting (because many good works are costly) a man cannot be ready to euery good worke.</p>
               <p>Now to apply the point, if we looke seriously and vnpartially into many of our sacrifices and oblations to God and men, may we not accuse our selues, as the Lord once did his people? <hi>Yee haue snuffed to offer the thing which was good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Malac. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and haue offered the torne, and lame, and sicke</hi>: nay many of vs snuffe at these last and worst. If the best and most religious action would charge many a one but with a matter of tweluepence, such is their readines to any good worke, that it shall lie in the dust: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God hath giuen them abundance of outward things, to the end that they might be meanes of performing many a good worke, yet still they plead want of abilitie, whereas if they were as willing as able, they would become rare patternes of welldoing. But herein they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (what euer they professe) forgetfull of this precept, and destitute of this grace, which quickly and vpon euery iust occasion findeth it selfe
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:18792:291"/>
called into practise: and finding it selfe so called, standeth not so much vpon abilities, but worketh the will to the abilitie,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 8.4.</note> yea and <hi>beyond</hi> in iust occasion: not that we call any man to the cracking of his estate, or to the exhausting of the fountaine of his liberallitie, for we need not; but we would haue them to know, that God maketh them able to giue, before they be able to cast away as much as they giue and hurt them not: and calleth them to distribute, before their owne pleasures and lusts be serued: seeing this precept requireth the departure with, and forgoing of that which is often sweete, pretious, yea and necessarie for our selues. Let vnconscionable men think well herof, who can contentedly throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at one cast, or game, at cards or dice, more then willingly they would sow in pence to the poore all the yeare long.</p>
               <p>Hauing now seene the necessitie, and notes,<note place="margin">Rules of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</note> we will shortly set down some rules of practise, for the better setting vs forward in this dutie. First, get into thy soule the conscience of this commandement, accounting it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> worthie of all thine obedience, beeing so often vrged in the Scriptures, and made in the end of the former Chapter, the end of Christs purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of vs. This reason drawne from the feare of God, preuailed so farre with Iob, that thence he was mooued to vse mercifulnesse to all sorts of men: for Gods <hi>punishment was fearefull vnto me, and I could not escape his highnesse.</hi> Secondly,<note place="margin">Iob 31.16. ad 23</note> Take euery opportunitie of welldoing while <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it is offered: for else the opportunitie may be cut off from thee, or thou from it. This is the Apostles rule, Gal. 6.10. <hi>While we haue time, doe good vnto all:</hi> That is, take the present occasion of doing all the good thou canst, 1. in regard of thy selfe, performe the principall and maine dutie, know the day of thy visitation; slacke not this thy tearme-time, but get the oyle of faith, knowledge of God, and obedience to his word, that thy lampe may euer be shining to the glorifying of thy Father, which is in heauen: in one word, forget not while thou hast time to <hi>giue all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence</hi> to make thine election sure. 2. In regard of others, if now thou canst doe them good in soule or bodie, delaie it not: Prov. 3.28. <hi>Say not to thy neighbour, goe, and come againe to morrow, and I will giue thee, if now thou hast it:</hi> and what knoweth any man, whether this may be the last day wherein he can doe good to himselfe or others? Thirdly,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Goe yet one step further, to seeke and watch occasions of doing good, and be glad when thou hast obteined them, that so thou maist euer be furthering thy reckoning. We read of the Patriarchs Abraham and Lot, how they sate at their doores watching to entertaine strangers, that they espied them a farre off, runne out to meete them, and most earnestly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to abide and refresh themselues; shew thy selfe herein the sonne of Abraham. And would to God Christians were a little quicker
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:18792:292"/>
not only in taking, but seeking occasions of exercising the duties of mercie and loue: for there is more in it then the seruing of euery begger at doore; who the most of them liue in the breach of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and in a course against all good order; they might bethinke them of many poore and carefull Christians, some labouring vnder po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, some vnder debt, some vnder sicknesse, some vnder temptation, some vnder one burden, some vnder another, whose necessities ought to be inquired into, and so occasions sought of releeuing Christ himselfe in his members; the want of this inquirie, is the cause of much vnfruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</p>
               <p>Here I might free our doctrine from that Popish imputation, challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it as an enemy to good works; but of that we shall more fully speak in the 14. verse.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 2.</hi> That they speake euill of no man,]</q>
               <p>The speciall precepts which are to be performed to all Christians, are propounded, 1. <hi>negatiuely,</hi> 2. <hi>positiuely.</hi> The negatiue requireth the good abearing, 1. of the tongue, <hi>That they speake euill of no man:</hi> 2. of <hi>the hands,</hi> no <hi>fighters.</hi> The affirmatiue layeth bridle vpon the affections, <hi>but soft, shewing all meeknes to all men.</hi>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth as well vnbridled speaches as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note>For the first. The word is a rule not only of <hi>doing</hi> well, but of <hi>spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> well also; and condemneth aswell vnbridled speaches, as disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red actions, and frameth aswell the tongue to euery good speach, as the hand to euery good worke: and therefore fitly is this precept induced vpon the former: instructing beleeuers that as they must be <hi>readie to euery good worke</hi>; so also must they as readily exercise their tongues in sutable speaches, abandoning all hurtfull language, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the disgrace or iniurie of any man: seeing these two may not be diuorced in him that would dwell in the Lords Tabernacle; who must be both <hi>a worker of righteousnesse,</hi> and <hi>a speaker of the truth</hi> in his heart: and no <hi>slaunderer</hi> of his neighbour; Psal. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> The Apostle seeming to prohibit all euill speaking, whether is it not lawfull to speake the euill we know by another, so we speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but truth? <hi>Answ.</hi> It is neuer lawfull in any vncalled to speake it. But if question be when a man is called, I answer, that God giueth a man calling in diuerse cases.<note place="margin">What cases a man may speak of the euill he knoweth by an other.</note> 1. When any man is publikely called before a magistrate, to testifie of a fact, for the clearing of some truth, and execution of iustice, and now to speake the truth, is to strengthen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> sinews of humane societie. 2. Priuately, when a truth is called into <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> question betweene man and man, and cannot otherwise be cleared then by rubbing some old sore; especially if in such a case a mans owne credit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be hazarded, and cannot otherwise be saued. 3. When a man counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:18792:292"/>
and aduiseth with another, how such a man may be recouered out of such an euill, or else admonisheth the partie himselfe; both which are so far from intending his hurt, that they tend to his amendment. 4. For the preuention of such hurt as may arise to some other by a scandalous and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> wicked person: in which case, a father to his child, a master to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, a freind to a freind, and one Christian to another, may fore warne and inhibite such a mans companie and conuerse, and adde his reason, he is knowne thus and thus to be vicious; out of which grounds, all the speaking of the euills of others, though neuer so true, may go vnder the title of euill speaking.</p>
               <p>Now all euill speaking, may be referred to two heads:<note place="margin">Euill speaking reduced to 2. heads.</note> for it is 1. ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the vttering of false and euill things: or 2. of true things falsely and euilly.</p>
               <p>The former, 1. when men speake vpon no ground, as when men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> or absent, are accused of the euills which they neuer did. Thus Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> accused Mephiboseth, that he went not out to meete king Dauid, but staied at home, expecting to be made king ouer Israel, which was a meere slanderous invention of his owne. 2. When men speake some euill of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vpon weake and insufficient ground: as when any either publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> or priuately, chargeth some other man before his face, or behind his backe, with euill vpon suspitions. Thus the Princes of Ammon charged Dauids seruants with deceit, and caused Hanun to vse them most villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nously, onely vpon suspition, that they were spies:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 10.3.</note> which what mischiefe and blooshed it wrought, the text declareth. Yet here in more hainous offences, if the suspitions be more vehement, a fact may be charged by the Magistrate vpon the partie himselfe; that so he may either cleare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, or lie guiltie vnder his offence; but else to relate euill vpon suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is altogether vnlawfull. 3. When men cast railing, cursing, or reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling speeches vpon an other present or absent, openly or secretly, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by insinuation: as <hi>Absolon,</hi> when he told the people, that there was no <hi>man to heare their matters:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Sam. 15.</note> all these are directly euill speaches in false and euill things.</p>
               <p>The latter kind of euill speaking is in true things: as, 1. when a man speaketh of some thing done or spoken, but destroyeth the sense. Thus <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> the Iewes witnessed against Christ, that he said, hee would destroy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the temple, and build it vp againe in three dayes; the which false witnesse cost him his life. 2. In vttering nothing but truth, but with wicked insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, and collections of euill. Thus Doeg spake the truth to Saul,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but poisoned his speach with insinuating that Dauid and the Priests con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired against him. 3. In speaking of good things, but either lessening them, or deprauing them, as done of bad intent, for bad ends, or in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="568" facs="tcp:18792:293"/>
4. In speaking of things euill and not so well done: 1. by vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> infirmities, which is the guise of cursed Chams, who are euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealing to their brethren other mens nakednes; which an ingenuous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, yea humanity it selfe (if there were no religion) would couer and hide: Prou. 11.13. <hi>He that goeth about as a slanderer, vncouereth a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, but a man of a faithfull heart concealeth a matter.</hi> 2. whereas we can excuse our owne faults twentie waies, by amplifying the faults and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences of others, be they neuer so apparent, we become euill speakers in a high degree: as sycophants who make the scapes of men farre greater then they are; affirming often that to be done of deliberation, which was done rashly and in hote blood; or presumptuously, when it was perhaps done but weakely; and imputing that to want of conscience, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was want of heedefulnesse and foresight: and thus the sinne is heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, when men so wickedly speake of that which they ought altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be silent in, and not speake at all.</p>
               <p>Now because of all sinnes, there is not a more manifest and generall mischeife in all the life of man,<note place="margin">Euill speaking a most vnseem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sinne in a Christian.</note> wherein euen Christians themselues are not exempted, who (not conceiuing how this little member defileth the whole bodie, yea disturbeth not the naturall bodie onely, but euen the Politicall and Ecclesiasticall, that is, the Church and Common-wealth,) carrie a verie world of wickednesse about with them, and yet wipe their mouthes as though all were well with them; therefore will it not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, to take a little paines with this sinne, scarse so accounted of, and to shewe, 1. how vnseemely it is for a Christian, 2. how dangerous in it selfe, 3. the meanes to represse and auoide it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 10.18.</note>For the first: To vtter a slander, saith Salomon, is a <hi>note of a foole</hi>; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the slander it selfe is a fooles bolt which is soone shot. And the Apostle in so many places affirming it to be a practise of the old man,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.31. Coloss. 3.8. Phil. 2.8.</note> which must <hi>be cast off,</hi> maketh it hence an vnbeseeming thing for Christians that professe newe life, to walke in such heathenish courses, for the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which God gaue so many of them vp to their owne hearts lusts. 2. This cursed speaking wherby our brethren are hurt in their names, is the deuils language, who thence hath his name, and argueth a venemous and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full disposition, not becomming the children of God: and therefore when men will speake their pleasure of men absent, obtrecting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting from them, and yet preface, that they thinke the partie no euill; it is false, for thou thinkest euill before thou vtterest it vncalled; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test him in thy heart, for if thou louedst him, thou would couer (not coin) <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> a multitude of sinnes. 3. True religion will not stand with such a tatling course as many Christians take vp, who like the Athenians, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in nothing more then hearing and telling newes; and once getting
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:18792:293"/>
a tale by the ende, they are in trauell, till they haue deliuered it to others; and with these all opportunitie of good and edifiable speach perisheth. True it is, that a good man cannot be an euill speaker, and where the speach is not good, all religion is naught;<note place="margin">Iam. 1.26.</note> 
                  <hi>If any seeme religious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraineth not his tongue, that mans religion is vaine:</hi> and yet in truth this is the most religion of our dayes. Which although it haue the name of bounding and <hi>binding</hi> the whole man to God, to men,<note place="margin">Religio à reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gando.</note> to all good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and duties to both, yet indeede hath not preuailed to the bridling of this little member in the most. 4. Were it not most disgracefull for a Christian to be counted a theife, or a continuall robber in the high way,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or a continuall breaker of the peace? and yet this sinne is a greater breach of loue then theft, or spoyling of the goods: for a good name is more pretious then gold, more sweete then the sweetest oyntment. And if our neighbours beast or goods must finde releife at our hands, much more must his name: for if those should be taken away or perish, they might be restored or otherwise supplyed; but a wound in his name, is like a dangerous gash in the bodie, of which we say, once broken euer a scarre. Now if it be the greatest enemie to loue, which is the badge and marke of a Christian and disciple of Christ, and of peace, whereof the refraining of the tongue is a preseruatiue; how can it possibly agree with the person or place of a Christian.</p>
               <p>The second point, is the danger of this sinne, which cannot but attend it,<note place="margin">It is not thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ght so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as it is.</note> vnlesse we conceiue no danger in breaking such expresse commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as we haue, Leu. 19.16. <hi>Thou shalt not goe about with tales among thy people:</hi> and Iam. 4.11. <hi>speake not euill one of an other, brethren:</hi> for this saith he, is not onely to breake, but <hi>condemne the lawe:</hi> that is, as not sufficient or worthy to guide him in all the particulars of his life. The defence of many a man is, I speake nothing but truth, and so long I may speake it: But if that thou speakest be a tale true or false (as it is if without a calling thou playest the <hi>pedlar,</hi> and settest to sale the name of thy brother) these commandements cast and condemne thee. Others thinke it is a fault indeede, but not so great a fault to speake the thing we knowe by an other: but looke vpon it, not as it may seeme in thine eie, but in the penaltie the Scripture hath set vpon it; Psal. 15.3. it hindereth the entrance into the holy mountaine of God: and 1. Cor. 6.10. raylers and reuilers shall not enter into the kingdome of heauen: and therefore it is no such small matter as many take it for. Others reply, what are words but winde, and God is not so strait-laced: if a man should goe to hell fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall conceit, that outward profession and ceremonie, will carrie a man to heauen, although in the particulars of the life, the power of godlinesse
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:18792:294"/>
be neuer expressed: But marke how the Lord answereth such vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, Psal. 50.19, 20. <hi>Thou giuest thy mouth to euill, and speakest against thy mothers sonnes: these things thou doest, and I held my tongue, and thou thoughtest me like thy selfe: But I will reprooue thee, &amp;c.</hi> God hath his time then to call vpon old reckonings, and then thou shalt not thinke words winde,<note place="margin">Prov. 18.21.</note> but knowe to thy cost, <hi>that life and death</hi> was in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of thy tongue.</p>
               <p>Others yet see no such danger, or if any be, it is farre off: But this sinne beside the iust hire of it hereafter, carrieth a secret plague with it for the present: for look as thou dealest with an other mans name, so shal thine be dealt with, and with what measure thou meatest to others, shall men measure to thee againe. But I must speake my minde, and then I haue done: no, thou hast done thy speech, but thy speech hath not done with thee: thou maist as well say, hauing stabbed a man to the heart, I gaue him but a blowe, and I had done, but the blow hath not done with thee, thou must before the iudge for all that, and then see if that plea wil hold.</p>
               <p>Let professors therefore humble themselues for this sinne, which is so dangerous and so common, as that it is the english of our tables, of our beds, of our publike and priuate meetings, to rippe vp this or that olde slippe, or iniurie done by an other: the deuill doth so sit in the lippes of a number of men, that no other talke can proceede from them, but such as is like <hi>arrowes</hi> to wound those that are farre off,<note place="margin">Prov. 25.18.</note> or <hi>hammers</hi> to knock him in the head, to whom such tales are told, or <hi>swords</hi> wounding his owne soule to the death. Beware also for time to come of the subtilties of Satan, who that he may not appeare an accuser or a deuill as he is, or so blacke as he is, hath taught his nouices in this art to vse diuerse prefaces as it were to get attention by: and then is the sinne most dangerous, and hath most Satanicall subtiltie in it. Sometime yee shall haue some that will beginne with the praise of the partie he telleth a tale of: he is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, one that I haue cause to loue well, and one of verie good parts, &amp;c. and yet thus will he wound an honest man, he spareth not his friend, but as a flie followes his sores. Sometimes the talebearer beginneth with the profession of friendship to the partie, to whome hee would vent some mischeife, and insert some seeming care of the others credit; you are my friend, and let it be spoken betweene vs, and goe no further; tell none that I told you: But would he haue a word against his neighbour die with an other, and cannot let it die with himselfe? or would he shut another mans mouth euen in opening it? he hath also his friend to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate it vnto, and so it goes from hand to hand, fretting secretly like a cank<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many will say, it is great pitie of the man, I speake it with griefe, but the series and tenor of the speach sheweth it a merciles pitie. These speaches are farre off from saluing vp the matter, or licensing thee to speake thy pleasure: nay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they argue a bad cause, and a guiltie conscience, accusing for that euill, from which yet thou desistest not: and whatsoeuer thou maist pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for pretence, or defence of thy course, thou cariest thy selfe liker those vermines which rise and feede of venome, excrement, and poyson, then a Christian, who, wert thou possessed with Christian loue, thou couldst not reioyce in euill: 1.

               </p>
               <p>The third thing to be considered, is the meanes to auoid this sinne of euill speaking, which may be reduced to fiue rules.

Of <hi>enuie,</hi> which greeuing at the graces and good things in another, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to darken them: as Satan enuying Iobs prosperitie, said <hi>hee serueth not God for nought.</hi> 3.

Of anger and displeasure, <hi>mallice</hi> we say <hi>neuer spake well,</hi> but there lyeth a secret grudge of reuenge hid in it, which quickly setteth the armes on worke in the strong, and the tongue in the weake. Banish betimes these nurces and midwiues of this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe; and contrarily get into thy heart the loue of God, and of thy brethren, which will not hastily discouer, but carefully hide and couer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a multitude of trespasses and sinnes: Excellent to this purpose is that of Salomon, Prov. 11.13. <hi>A faithfull heart concealeth a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> be carefull to containe thy selfe within thine owne calling; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> follow thine owne plow; beware of the sinne of busie bodies, who loue to plaie the Bishops in other mens diocesses: who if they had not with the Witch in the fable, put off their owne eyes at home, they might finde soule corners inough well worthy of reformation in themselues: but therefore load they others, because they spare themselues; they throw

                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In all companies pray to the Lord to set a watch before thy mouth, and to keepe the doore of thy lippes, for the tongue can no man of himselfe tame, beeing such an <hi>vnruly euill,</hi> as the Apostle Iames tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it to be; yea resolue with Dauid, before thou entrest into any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, <hi>not to offend with thy tongue:</hi> accustome thy selfe to soft answers which break wrath:<note place="margin">Psal. 39.1.</note> strike two stones together and fire will sparkle out, but take away the fewell and the fire fayleth.</p>

And because many who are loth to giue their tongues libertie to runne vpon others, yet conceiue no danger in keeping their eares alwaies open (like the vncleane vessels in the law) to receiue any report against an other; let such knowe, that the sinne clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth fast vnto them, and becommeth their owne, who are no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For as there would be no theeues, if there were no receiuers, so if there were no hearers of false reports, there would be no speakers. And what an vnworthy thing is it, for a Christian to be a fosterer, yea a base s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

or sworne, and that against the credit and good name of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest man, flat against the rules of the lawes of God and man: of <hi>loue</hi> to his neighbour, for if there were loue in the heart, it would expresse it selfe in the tongue, in the iust defence of the partie: as he would haue his friend defend his owne name, if it were hazzarded. Further, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God is direct against it, Exod. 23.1. <hi>Thou shalt not receiue a false tale:</hi> and to <hi>giue heede to false lips,</hi> is a note of a wicked man:<note place="margin">Prou. 25.23.</note> and on the contrarie, it is made one of the tenne notes of a citizen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, not to <hi>receiue an ill report</hi> against his neighbour. Let vs therefore be wise to take vp that wholesome counsel of the wise man, to driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way tale-bearers with an angrie countenance, as the North winde, the sharpest of the windes purgeth the aire, and driueth away the clouds, which else would quickly resolue themselues into showers and stormes. Thus shall we make him loath to speake, that which he seeth vs loath to heare; and if he will needes speake of others, intreate him to speake of their good behind their backs, and of their euill to their faces: if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill be priuate, wish him to admonish him betweene them two; if it be more knowne, put him in minde that in many things we sinne all, and had neede beware least our selues fall; or that if he speake in loue, it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an other manner of proces: and if of hatred, his anger were better turned against his owne sinnes. If thou knowest the partie innocent, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly defend his innocencie, as Ionathan did Dauids; if thou doest not, tell him that the lawe requireth better proofes against a stranger, and thou maist nor giue credence to so slender a testimonie.

               <p>The which that we may the more fully conceiue, we must consider that howsoeuer the lawes of God are perfect, and admit not of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensation, relaxation, or mitigation, yet the lawes of men are like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, perfect onely in part, and in that they are deuised by men, cannot possibly hold in all cases alike: hence haue wise lawe makers prescribed their lawes in their greatest extremitie, thereby to curbe the wickednesse and presumption of men; the which lawes if in the execution they should be euer stretched to the furthest extent, this extremitie of lawe would prooue extremitie of iniurie, and be turned into vnmercifulnesse and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie it selfe. Then commeth in this vertue, and looking vnto equitie, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp a chancerie in the conscience, and prouideth a remedie for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, where the common lawe hath no prouision. The thing will yet be plainer in some examples. The lawe (iustly warranting in some cases, some extremities) giueth thee leaue to sue thy bond, and take the forfeyture of an 100. for non paiment of fifty by a day: it giueth thee leaue to reenter into thine house, and to take into thy hands a forfeited lease of some poore mans, that thou maist gaine to his vtter vndoing 7.12.20. or more or fewer yeares, for not paiment of the quarter or yeares rent at the day appointed: the poore borrower, or tenant for necessitie and want, or some other accident, breaketh his day; to take here the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, were extremitie of iustice; to cast out a poore man, were vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull extent of lawe: both maist thou doe by lawe, but in doing either, thou shalt doe also extremitie of iniurie, and the iustice of the lawe will not free thy conscience from iniustice. In this case then this Christian vertue driueth thee to take thine owne, namely, the principall, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considering of the damage thou sustainest for want of paiment, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to satisfie thy selfe therefore; and if further thou goest, thou sinnest against God, against thy brother, not dealing with him as thou wouldst haue an other to deale with thee; and against the very law of forfeiture it selfe, which was not appointed for thy aduantage further then the secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the principall. Againe, the lawe of man giueth thee leaue to make the most of thine owne; but if hence thou shalt by racking thy rents, and hoysing thy wares, corne, or other commodities grinde the

Now this vertue steppeth in and saith, this is not a case wherein extremitie is to be vsed, thou maist not by the lawe of God doe that, which by mans lawe thou maist doe: here is a case where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the court of man may saue thee harmelesse, but the court of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and the court of heauen, will adiudge thee iustly a sinner for it.</p>

               <p>Others plead, why it is my right, and why should I not haue it, I will not loose it if the lawe will giue it me: and when they haue a man on the hippe (as we say) and at advantage, they follow him with all extremitie, euen to the making of dice of his bones. It is true, that men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand no more but their right, are counted very honest men, and it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed but a reasonable thing if a man aske but his owne, although he demaund all that: but yet it is as true, that he that is a strict stander for his right alwaies, cannot but sometimes goe beyond the bounds of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which must yeeld some part of the right; and of loue, which seeketh <hi>not her owne,</hi> that is, not all her owne. And whosoeuer thou art, that canst so nimbly take all advantages and forfeitures, consider whether God deale so, or thou wouldst haue him to deale so strictly with thee: doth he strike so soone as thou hast sinned, and so soone as he hath thee at an aduantage? and yet he might say, I hope I doe no more but iustice and lawe, I require but my couenant. Oh therefore let euerie Christian looke into this cleare mirrour; and say with himselfe, oh how softly and tenderly doth our God deale with sinnefull flesh? he layeth not about him, nor presently bringeth the forfeit of his lawe vpon me, but hath sent out his gospel a mercifull moderator of that rigour, without which euerie day would bring a newe deluge of iudgement against all flesh: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so must I in imitation of my heauenly father, deale with my brethren, not seeke or take the forfeites which the lawe suffereth me to doe, but by Christian softnesse which the Gospel teacheth me, remit of that rigour and extremitie: for shall the Lord powre out a sea of mercie vpon me, and shall not I let one droppe fall vpon my brother? and would not I
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:18792:301"/>
haue God to deale in iustice with me, and shall I stand altogether vpon iustice and lawe with an other? And thou also that takest thy brother by the throat and castest him into prison, and there detainest him for some debt, vnto which he is altogether insufficient; here is lawe also, and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: and I thinke it meete that such should be punished, whether for their ouersight, or yet much more for their craftie or vniust dealing: but yet mercie and equitie must at length take place, where there is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame insufficiencie especially. Consider how insufficient thou wert if the Lord should exact all thy debt; how he contenteth himselfe to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee with the rods of men, in mercie, and not with scorpions, nor in wrath, aboue that thou art able to beare: he might by his couenant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire totall obedience of his whole law, but seeing thy state to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he is contented to take as thou art able, euen a debt of ten thousand pound as it were by a penny a yeare; go thou now and doe the like, be mercifull euen as thine heauenly father is mercifull.</p>
               <q>But shewing all meekenesse to all men,]</q>
               <p>In this precept three things must be considered. 1. The vertue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <hi>meekenesse.</hi> 2. The manner how it must be excercised, it must be <hi>shewed</hi> openly. 3. The persons to whom, <hi>to all men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nature of this grace will appeare in the description of it. <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> is a grace of God, whereby the heart and affections are enclined, vnto a mild and louing, a kind and curteous carriage towards our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,<note place="margin">Description of meeknes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed.</note> euen then when they might be prouoked to anger. Where three things are laid downe to be further opened, to the better knowledge of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this vertue. 1. That it is a <hi>grace of God,</hi> for the next verse will teach vs, that we are borne as rough as Esau in our corrupted nature; and therfore this strippeth and goeth beyond the best nature, beeing a <hi>fruit of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.23. and 6.2.</note> and is called the <hi>spirit of meekenesse,</hi> because it is such a peculiar work <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the spirit, and proceedeth not of the flesh. 2. The worke of it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to preserue Christian affection, in <hi>moderating all reuengfull passions,</hi> not suffering the heart to be easily ouercome with bitternesse, but is as a wall or fence of the soule, receiuing all the shot of iniurious and hostile actions and speaches, and yet keeping all safe within, not permitting the possessor hastily or violently either to offer to another, or remooue from himselfe such iniuries. The mother of it is humilitie, the daughter is long-suffering, and therefore we read it set betweene these two in diuerse places:<note place="margin">Eph. 4 2. Col. 3.12.</note> The next attendants or handmaids of it, are <hi>inwardly</hi> a quiet &amp; peaceable spirit, for these hath the Apostle combined as inseperable, 1. Pet. 3.4. <hi>outwardly,</hi> 1. soft answers, such as that of Abigail which broke the wrath of Dauid. 2. compassion or affliction of spirit in sight <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and sence of the afflicted. 3. readinesse to forgiue offences. 3. I say
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:18792:301"/>
it preserueth peace within, <hi>when it is prouoked to warre,</hi> to anger, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of wrongs: for then is the cheife vse of this grace: which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore added, because many men seeme to haue attained this vertue, when it is neuer a whit so. Let them alone, offend them not, you shall haue them gentle, courteous, affable and tractable inough; but crosse them a little, and stirre their blood, oh now you must pardon them, they haue their affections, and you shall know they can be passioned and angrie as well as others; here shall you see the best nature betraying her meeknes. But Christian meeknes must step in to ouercome euill with good when it is prouoked to returne euill, or else what great thing dost thou; it is no hard thing for the very Infidell and Turke to be kind to the kind, nay the wild beast if thou goest no further, will be as meeke as thou, who the most of them hurt not vnprouoked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> this meeknesse must be <hi>shewed forth,</hi> not hidde with our selues, but it must be brought into the light; that others may haue the benefit of it: for as this grace is a signe and pawne of our election, which as the elect of God we must <hi>put on,</hi> and <hi>araie our selues</hi> withall, Collos. 3.12. so also must it be the ornament of our vocation, whereby we glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God, adorne our profession, and winne others vnto the liking of it. Hence the Apostle praying the Ephesians to walke worthy of their high calling, teacheth them that this they shall doe, if they put on <hi>humblenes of mind, meeknesse, long suffering, &amp;c.</hi> Ephes. 4.2. for otherwise if men partake not in these our graces, the vnitie of the spirit in the bond of peace, cannot long last vndissolued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this meeknes must be shewed <hi>to all men,</hi> beleeuers, vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, freinds, enemies, the better, and the worse, which is a speciall point not to be neglected, because it is the ground of the verses follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Quest.</hi> But if meeknes must be shewed,<note place="margin">This meeknes no enemie to true zeale.</note> yea <hi>all meeknes to all men,</hi> how may we warrant any anger against any man in any sinne or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or how may any seueritie be put on against any offender? <hi>Answ.</hi> This beeing a grace of the spirit, it crosseth not any other of them, so as it is no enemie to that of zeale, which we haue vrged out of the 14. verse of the former Chapter: and Christians mistake this grace, when they dreame it to be a bottomles charitie, and vnder pretence of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, can beare with any euill, which indeed is nothing else but an irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and mute approbation and association in the euill. He that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth to be angrie, but not to sinne, maketh it a sinne not sometimes to be angrie: neither did the meeknesse of Moses hinder, but that he might be exceeding angrie at the calfe they had made. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that publicke persons must publickly represse, and reprooue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen sinnes, disturbing the publike proceedings of religion or iustice; so
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:18792:302"/>
Dauid put on zeale to weed the wicked out of the land: and the Minister hath bin taught,<note place="margin">cap. 1.13.</note> if he see beasts or slow bellies, to reprooue them sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. The priuate person must priuately also, but yet plainely reprooue his brother, and not suffer his sinne vpon him, or at the least by shewing his indignation against sinne, he freeth his owne soule from the guilt of it, as also the punishment; yea from the suspition of it in such as may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, who else may think him that holdeth his tongue a partner, or of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the sinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The vse of this grace. Iam. 3.13.</note>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What is then the vse of this meeknesse? <hi>Answ.</hi> To purifie our zeale, for so the Apostle Iames would haue a wise man to shew forth his good conuersation in <hi>meeknes of wisedome.</hi> Which meeknes of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> or wise mildnesse, 1. causeth a man to put a difference betweene the person and the sinne; and affecteth him with pittie to the person, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in reuenge of the sinne: so Ioshua called Achan, <hi>my sonne,</hi> when yet presently he executed the iudgement of death vpon him. 2. Between <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> sinne and sinne; for Christians are no Stoiks to account all sinnes alike, some are motes troubling the eye, some are beames putting out the eye: a mote may soone be blowne away and remooued, a beame requireth more strength; wise meeknesse will more shew it selfe in the one, but more retyre it selfe in the other. Againe, some sinnes are more directly iniurious to men, and perhappes the partie himselfe; others more iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to God: Now this meeknesse of wisedome will be Queene in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> former, but giueth place to zeale in the latter. 3. It discerneth between sinner and sinner: for all sinners are not of a suite; some sinne of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, some against their light and knowledge; some of weaknes, some of set purpose, and obstinate wickednes; some are leaders and setters of sinne, some are led and seduced: some seeke excuses, as ashamed of that they haue done; others defences, as glorying in their iniquitie: Now commeth this meeknes of wisedome, and putteth difference, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compassion on some,<note place="margin">Iude 22.</note> and others sauing with feare. Thus meeknes and zeale destroie not but strengthen one another: and thus all meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of wisedome must be shewed to all men, but this is such as neither impayreth the glorie of God, nor the proceedings of the Gospel, nor the edification of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Beware of that vice, which Paul would here note in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of those dayes, which we may well wish they had not traduced to sundrie professors of our times; for they beeing conuerted they scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnbeleeuers, and cared not how carelesly they carried themselues towards them.

all men, foes as well as friends, yea the worst as well as the best. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is drawne from the consideration of the present condition of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted Christians, compared with that estate they were in before their conuersion and calling to the faith: to which purpose he is verie large in describing, 1. our estate of corruption in this 3. vers. 2. our estate after conuersion, in 4, 5, 6, and 7. verses: from both which the Apostle thus concludeth the same thing thus. <hi>First,</hi> from the former: If we our selues were in times past in the selfe same condition, which other men are not yet called out of; then ought we to be meeke and mercifull euen to those who are not yet conuerted. But we our selues were in times past as they are, we lay in the same puddle of corruption, were hewne out of the same pit, and though we may thinke we were neuer so gracelesse, as we see some others, yet we cannot charge them so deepely for time present, but they may come ouer vs with the same in times past, as this third verse will teach vs: and therefore we ought to shewe all lenitie and meekenes to all men. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from our latter condition of conuersion, thus our Apostle frameth his reason; If God haue beene so bountifull a benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor vnto vs, when we were so vnworthy, as the former verse describeth, that his meere and alone mercie saued vs; then must we in imitation of our heauenly father, doe the like to our brethren. But God hath done thus, ver. 4, 5. so as from both we may well reason, that a newe condition requireth a newe conuersation; newe men must haue newe manners; we beeing Christians may not carrie our selues so crookedly as in times past, nor so roughly towards those who now do the same things which then we did, considering our owne selues.</p>
               <p>But before we come to the particular descriptions of these two estates, one or two general obseruations are necessarily to be collected out of the scope of the verses.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon condition is a ground of meeknes.</note>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The consideration of the common condition, is a notable ground of meeknes and moderation towards those who yet are vncalled to the faith. For 1. whereas pride maketh the heart to swell against the brother, and is a roote whence these bitter fruits arise: this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> pulleth those peacock feathers, and humbleth the heart, so as when it can finde no other reason of forbearance, here it neuer wanteth a most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall one. What, we are brethren, of common parents, of common condition, our estate, our temper was all alike, I was borne into the world as naked in soule, in bodie, as he was. And thus by this consideration, the Apostle beateth downe the pride of man, <hi>who seperated thee? hast thou any thing</hi> aboue another <hi>which thou hast not receiued?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4.7.</note> 
                  <hi>and then why boastest thou as if thou hadst not receiued it?</hi> and elsewhere disputing of the breaking off of the naturall branches the Iewes, and ingrafting the
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:18792:303"/>
Gentiles, he vseth almost through his discourse no other argument to keepe the Gentile from insulting and priding himselfe ouer the Iew but this same, The Iewes now <hi>beleeue not, nor haue obtained mercie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.30.</note> no more in <hi>time past did you Gentiles beleeue nor had obtained mercie:</hi> Againe, the Iewes are broke off; so may you Gentiles be, for of your selues you stand no faster then they did,<note place="margin">20.</note> 
                  <hi>be not therefore high minded but feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This consideration not only subdueth that violent affecti-of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> pride, but worketh the heart to such affections as not only beseeme our selues but befit the offender, and these are two. 1. for time present <hi>pitie,</hi> and compassion. 2. <hi>hope</hi> for time to come. The former of these two is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a fitter affection for a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then anger or wrath against the vnconuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. How forceable that argument is to mooue vs to the workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and loue towards the bodies of men, in that they are <hi>our flesh</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Isa. 58.7. Thou shalt <hi>not hide thy selfe from thine owne flesh,</hi> but bring the wanderer to thy house, couer the naked, deale thy bread to the hungrie: and yet much more hence must we put on the bowells of mercie toward the soules of men, by letting their miserie into our hearts, that our verie bowells may yearne, as if their condition were now (as once it was) our owne. And if we must so farre pittie our neighbours beast, yea our enemies, that when we see it faile vnder the burthen we must helpe it vp, ought we not much more helpe to beare his owne bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and so fulfill the law of Christ? This affection would set men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout other worke, then talking of, iesting at, or disgracing men for their falls and slips, which (especially in a professor) is meate, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick to the scorners; who herein iustly prouoke the Lord to giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vp to feareful sinnes, and so be the iust reproaches and by-words of men. No, this compassion would cause them set hand to help them out of the snare, to counsell, to pray for, nay set the heart on bleeding rather then reioysing in their sinne: he were rather a monster then a man, that could see a man take a fall to the breaking of his back or necke, and could turne it into a iest; or a man wound himselfe deadly, and he make but a meriment of it: no the least droppe of humanitie would helpe vp the former, and thrust in some napkin to stanch the blood of the latter: hath nature taught thee such duties to the bodie of man, and hast thou no grace to take to heart the hurts of his soule?</p>
               <p>The second affection wrought by this consideration of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is hope for time to come, which is another speciall motiue to allay impatience towards offenders. Was not my selfe as hopelesse once, and in times past as desperately gone in sinnefull wayes; but now recalled and brought to the fellowship of the grace of God? so God may haue his
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:18792:304"/>
time for this man, whose works and thoughts are yet against him; farre he went that neuer returned, he that could change Sauls heart in the midst of his rage to make a Paul of him, can turne his heart also: he that could make of Onesimus a runagate and fugitiue seruant, a faithful brother, can bring this man b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cke the same way he is gone: he that made his heart, can mend it at his pleasure: I must not giue him ouer as hopeles, seeing he that had mercie on my selfe, may also haue mercie on him. We beare many weakenesses and toyes in children, because our selues were so once, and our hope is that time will outweare them, euen so must strong men with babes in Christ; and older Christians with such as are in their vnstaied heate. The reason is as good, our selues were such, and they may come to be stronger and older in Christ then our selues are.</p>

We see hence how the Lord would haue vs look vpon our sins and old estate: namly, to the humbling of our selues and the good of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. For the first, euery new remembrance of any sinne should be a fresh bleeding wound in our soules; a false heart it is and woe vnto it, that can with new delight thinke and speake of old sinnes, for there the selfe same affection and vile lust which brought on that sinne is yet aliue, and vnmortified. For the latter, euery such remembrance should mooue vs to commiseration to our brethren offending. Alas, why should not I be meeke to others, if I had no reason else, my owne estate ministreth a multitude: I was in times past as bad as any, the child of wrath aswell as any other. If for the present there be a change, by grace I am all that I am, and for the time future my selfe may be tempted, and am as subiect to fall as any other: thus I was, and then I would haue bin borne withall:
<pb facs="tcp:18792:304"/>
that thus I am not, it is the Lord that hath seperated me: and now I see what hand it is that keepeth me from beeing led and left in tempation.

The time was when the Romans <hi>were in the flesh,</hi> when sinnefull motions had force in them vnto death; and there was an aftertime when they were <hi>deliuered from the law,</hi> and serued God not in <hi>the oldnesse of the letter, but in the newnesse of spirit:</hi> Ephes. 2.3. <hi>Among whome</hi> the Gentiles <hi>we</hi> beleeuers <hi>had our conuersation in time past:</hi> Colos. 3.7. <hi>Wherein ye walked also once, but now, &amp;c.</hi> 1.

I adde further, that the conuerted may and must haue experience of this change: for the conuersion of a sinner, is a miracle aboue all naturall wonders: and therefore (except in some Ieremie, Iohn Baptist, and some few sanctified from the wombe) is no such insensible thing as cannot be perceiued. It is no such naturall change as is effected by insensible degrees, as when he that was a child is now become a man: but a supernaturall change by the spirit of grace, such as when a man is borne into the world, or when a blind man is restored to his sight, or rather a dead man vnto life, which are things of much note, and manifest alteration, and that of the whole man.

The former sort are such as are cast vpon a drunken sleep, and securely passe their daies in a course which indeed abandoneth all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and conceiue that a ciuill life will goe for good payment before God, as it only carrieth the report of honestie among men; and that good meanings and harmeles liuing, is Christianitie inough: in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion doe they dangerously sleep on the top of the maste, not once dreaming of the necessitie of any change, although their righteousnesse neuer came neare the righteousnes of the Scribes and Pharisies. But these are to know, that although they gallop not so fast to hell as some others before them, yet to hell for the present they tend: it beeing a sure thing, that vnlesse they be other then they were in time past, they shall neuer see heauen. The second sort are such as see indeed better things, but follow the worse; they consent to the law that it is good, and in their inner man are delighted with it, but by the tyrannie of sinne and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the flesh, the law of which is present with them, are drawn vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to euill, and followe the call of manifold lusts: yet because they hate the euill they doe, and preserue in them a strife betweene flesh and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which spirit still resisteth euen where it cannot preuaile,<note place="margin">Comfort to those that truly desire to feele it but cannot.</note> these may espie a change in themselues from that they were when the strong man kept the hold, and all things were at peace.

if thou knowest no change so thou art still. The knowledge of God, loue of God, and faith in Christ, growe not in thine owne grounds, neither is our God so prodigall of these, but he that hath them knoweth how he commeth by them: no man is borne a beleeuer, nor an heire to heauen; neither can any make purchase, or take possession of it without his owne priuitie. Others are so farre from this change in themselues, as they cannot endure it in others: If a man will not sweare, and drinke, and game, and riot, as <hi>he once in time past could</hi>; Oh, say they, you were wont to be a good fellow, and a good companion; and doe you now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be precise, and to take a way alone from all your neighbours? If he now begin to speake of a change, and they see perswasion will not preuaile with him, he had neede get him a new world to liue in a part from his old companions, who will be the men they were: times, years, and ages change, &amp; renew vpon them, but themselues are no changlings, no new men. A third sort, haue made a wofull change from that once they were, whose lamps haue died out in their hands, while as wearie of the good way, they haue departed from the way of righteousnesse: of whom whosoeuer knewe them, may say, how is the gold become so dim, how is the fine gold changed? the visages of some Nazarites are become blacker then a coale.</p>

Not to deeme of men as they were once in time past, when once this change is come, the Lord estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of men according to the present grace receiued, and neuer casteth them in the teeth with that they were in time past; and why should we vpbraid men with sinnes or infirmities past, which the Lord hath coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?

                     </gap>.</note> we must knowe, that before the fall, euerie man had an vnderstanding giuen him of God, both naturall and spirituall, both of them holy, and entire: and that by our apostacie from God in our first parents, we lost the maine part of the former, and euery whit of the latter. All our wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in earthly and natural things concerning this present life is not lost, yet that which remaineth is (as reason it selfe) very weake and insuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; that instance Eccles. 4.8. teacheth it: There is a man, and he is but one alone, without a second, he hath neither sonnes nor brother, of whose trauell in getting wealth there is no end; and yet he saith not with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, for whom doe I trauell? which argueth a merueilous impotencie and darkenes in the vnderstanding of naturall things. But come to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and supernaturall, there it is as altogether lost: we are not able of our selues saith our Apostle to <hi>thinke one good thought:</hi> and much lesse to conceiue the things of God, which are all mysteries and written in a clasped booke, and sealed with seauen seales, vntill the Lord by his spirit open the vnderstanding: such <hi>foolish children</hi> are we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>and of none vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi> Nay further,<note place="margin">Ier. 4.22.</note> we haue not onely a depriuation of spirituall wisedome in vs, but an auersation, and vntoward disposition, cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taarie thereunto, that we can imagine and conceiue onely euill continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: for what is else prooued by that we are called <hi>beasts in vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> and willed <hi>not to be like the horse or mule:</hi> which creatures are not onely with vnderstanding, but exceeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And which of vs hath not experience of his owne slownes of heart to conceiue the things of our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall peace, neuer so plainely, neuer so often taught in the ministerie? neither is one nature here of better apprehension then an other, for the speach is true not onely of simple ones, but of the greatest clerks who here are not the wisest men: the quickest natures, <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Seneca,</hi> are here as blinde as moles: nay, Nicodemus a ruler in Israel, how ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishly and foolishly did he apprehend the speach of Christ concerning the newe birth? there was no way but for men to returne backe into the womb againe. Thus <hi>sensuall</hi> and <hi>earthly</hi> is the best of our wisedome, and no sharper is our conceit in such obiects, till the Lord whet and frame them: till which time we see our selues by this we haue said, to be in the

Which a little better to vnderstand, we must knowe, that before our fall, the minde of man had two faculties about the truth of God. 1. the <hi>knowledge of</hi> it so farre as was meete. 2. an <hi>assent</hi> approouing that knowledge. In stead of which are succeeded two contrarie corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions since the fall. 1. darkenes in stead of that light of knowledge. 2. frowardnes or reasoning against it. For example, when the vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of man vnconuerted, conceiueth something of that we deliuer out of the word, whereas it should assent vnto the lawe that it is good, and the Gospel that it is the arme of God vnto saluation; the wisedome of the flesh on the contrarie, it becommeth enmitie to all this; it can finde euasions to shift off the curse; it can couenant with hell, and death. And for the Gospel, it is to one foolishnesse, to an other offence: Pauls prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching shall be counted madnesse, or malice, or something els which shall be reason and warrant inough to contemne it.</p>

                  <hi>Deceiued,</hi>] This is the third degree of corruption of mind, and a consequent of the former. It is a word borrowed from trauellers, that are in a wrong way; that goe by gesse, which they must needs doe who neither knowe the way, nor will knowe it, who are out and will not bee called in. And this noteth a further miserie then before; namely, that men are naturally resolued in by-pathes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their wandrings, and haue no delight to heare of the path of life eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. Out of the first degree of the miserie of our minds, we learne what is the course of vngodly and vnconuerted men;<note place="margin">The course of the vnconuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is an vnwise walking.</note> namely, a foolish and vnwise walking. That which the Lord speaketh of Israel, is true of euerie naturall man, <hi>My people is foolish, they haue not knowne me, they are foolish children, they are wise to doe euill, but to doe well they knowe not:</hi> the same confirmeth the Apostle, Ephes. 5.15. <hi>walke not as vnwise,</hi> (namely, as ye did before your calling) <hi>but as wise.</hi> And if the knowledge and feare of God be <hi>the beginning of wisedome,</hi> how can such as are without Gods teaching euer be wise to walke in the wayes of saluation? We account such as want and are destitute of naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in outward things, no better then fooles: and shall those goe for wise, who haue not one sparkle of spirituall knowledge, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="597" facs="tcp:18792:307"/>
men who care not to wrong and hurt their bodies, much more may such as depriue their soules of spirituall foode, raiment, yea of eternall life it selfe. If those who would exchange gold for a counter; much more such as thinke it a good bootie to gaine a small portion of the world with the losse of their soules. If they be fooles whom men so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme, much more whom the Lord so stileth, as euery where the naturall and vngodly man; and this not for one or two foolish actions, for thus the best euen Dauid himselfe confesseth, that sometimes he doth <hi>verie foolishly,</hi> but for that his whole course is the practise of notable folly.</p>
               <p>And that we may see this truth in some instances, we will note some maine properties of folly, and see whether they are not most naturall to euerie naturall man.</p>
               <p>The 1. maine propertie of fooles and silly bodies is,<note place="margin">The maine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of folly most natural to the naturall man.</note> that they knowe not the end of their liues, why God made them and put them into this world: euen so aske many men why God did inspire the breath of life on their faces; how fewe would giue this direct answer, that by glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God in my calling I might be lead to a better life herafter. Ask many <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> a man concerning heauen, and earth, and sea, and other sensible things, and they will giue some sensible answers, as that the earth was made for man and beast to liue vpon, the sea for fish, and nauigation, the ayre for man and beast to breath in, the Sunne, Moone, and starres for light, heat, and comfort; the beasts, fishes, foules, &amp;c. for man: but why thy selfe? fewest would say for God, but if they speake true, some for themselues, some for their familie, some for their pleasures, some for wealth, or some baser ende, to which such a noble creature as man is should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated.</p>
               <p>The second propertie of folly is, that as fooles liue for the present <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> time, if they can get meat, drinke, sleepe, cloathes, and necessaries for the present, they forecast nothing to come: euen so vngodly men if they can get wealth, and lay vp things present for many yeares to come, they dreame of no other heauen, they forecast no day of death, nor iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but oh foole, what if thy soule be taken away this night? this was that which that foole thought not of: and as of their owne, so they iudge of all other mens felicitie by things present: into which folly Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid himselfe was sliding, when he confesseth himselfe as ignorant as a beast in this point, vntill he went into the sanctuarie.</p>
               <p>The third propertie is, fooles are indocible, and incorrigible; so the naturall man put him to schoole, he learneth nothing by the booke of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the creatures, nor of the creator in the Scriptures.

                  <hi>but as a dreame:</hi> for whose hearts leap within them at the ioyfull message of the pardon of their sinne? who leane vnto the promises walking worthy of them for their life? very few assent vnto the truth we teach; it hardly sinketh with men that God should become man, that by the death of one, life should be procured to so many: that the way to heauen should lie by hell, that by afflictions <hi>they should be passed to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi>; these things be riddles to many professed Christians. So when we call people, as God did his, to walke <hi>in the old way,</hi> that they may find rest to their soules: they answer vs with them, we will not walke in that way: the sound of the thing, if not of the voice speaketh: for we call men from swearing, lying, couetousnes <hi>which is idolatrie,</hi> from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boath breaking, intemperance, drinkings, and vncleannes; but mens hearts speake by their liues; we will sweare, we will drinke to drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, we will by gaming or idlenesse breake the sabboath; the waies of God are too straite and vnequall, a man had as good be in prison as in these bonds.

               <p n="2">2. Hence may we cease to wonder, why so fewe obey the Gospel, why after so much teaching, there is so little fruit, so little knowledge, so little turning to God; because the degree of corruption of mind, is beyond bare ignorance; as to assent to the word is a further degree of grace then bare knowledge. The Minister may hale and pull, but vnlesse the Father drawe, none come to the Sonne, such is the contumacie and stubborne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of mens hearts naturally, that no curse can terrifie, nor promise affect it: and this was it which made Christs own ministerie vnprofitable to the Iewes, as we reade, Ioh. 8. Let hearers and students of the Scripture la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and pray for the sanctification of mind, and the spirit renewing their inner man: without which they may heare, and study, and reade, but as the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> without vnderstanding for want of a guide. Without this teacher our report shall not be beleeued, nor without this finger of God shall the arme of God be reuealed. A sound of words may be heard, and the report of truth may be so strong, as to winne acknowledgment of it selfe, but faith shall not be founded, nor loue quickned, nor hope confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor that change wrought, without which thou shalt continue a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiller still, yea froward, and an enemie to God and his truth.</p>

If we be such as are called out of this estate, to whom God hath giuen hearts to beleeue, assent, and obey the truth; let vs not depriue God of his glorie, but acknowledging his gift, giue him the honour due vnto him, for here is an exceeding great power of God put forth, if it be giuen thee to beleeue: the worke of faith is a worke of great <hi>power:</hi> see 2.

               <p>Now the reason of all this error, is a filthy flatterie of the heart, and a guilfull securitie of spirit, which holdeth men from seeking happinesse where it is to be had, while they mistaking their condition, make faire weather with their soules, when in the meane time all is amisse, and they for truth embrace nothing but dangerous and damnable error.

               <p>A second and as fearefull deceit as the former, is that proude conceit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> of a kind of inbred and inherent righteousnesse of many reputed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, but indeede of such as wanting Christs righteousnesse, seeke to sew their owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So how many ciuill, iust dealing, and harmeles men, euerie where are there at this day, who ouerthrowe themselues with this deceit? which ariseth sometimes by measuring themselues with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; as the proud preachers of Corinth, seemed somewhat comparing themselues with themselues: and otherwhiles by comparing themselues with others whom they take greater sinners then themselues, as the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies did: but especially through ignorance, or a dead knowledge of the righteousnesse of the law, they see not what strict righteousnesse God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, nor their owne corruption boyling within them, and so neglect all the sence of their secret lusts rising vp against the loue of God or man, and that incessantly in them.

               <p>Now alas what a generall deceit is this? where is there a soule in towne or country, but in it owne conceit is aliue? which yet liueth in all profanenesse.

They meane no man harme they say, yet their nature must needes be angrie, and reuenge too, if men much prouoke them; they can ordinarily sweare without touch, because they say they hope they sweare nothing but truth, or by nothing but that which is good. If they curse or banne, they were vrged vnto it: they can seeke out to the witch for themselues, their children, and cattell, because God hath prouided a salue for euerie sore: they defie drunkennes, but can sometimes in the weeke resort to the ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house for good fellowship sake: they are no common gamsters, but after seruice on Sundaies (as they say) can spend away the time for good neighbourhood. Oh how hath the deceitfulnes of sinne ouerreached these poore ones, and put out their eies to destruction; if there were no law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede there could be no transgression, nor these could be no sinnes: but let that light shine once vpon the conscience, let the voice of it once awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the soule out of these dead sleepes, they would as fast crie out of themselues and their courses: then would all such Pharisaicall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse vanish as the smoake in the winde: then would they no longer say with the Iewes,<note place="margin">Ier. 8.8.</note>

Charge his conscience with his sinnes, strike him downe for his vnlawfull courses, or neglect of good duties; he can saue his head with the doctrine of free iustification without works, or tell you that the best man sinneth seauen times a day, or that we are concluded vnder sinne, that God might haue mercie on all, or that where sinne aboundeth, grace aboundeth much more, and that we are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the workes of the law: but <hi>O vaine man,</hi> saith Iames, dost thou imagine a sauing faith without repentance, and works of pietie and loue? dost thou professe an holy religion, and by the loosenes of thy life, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest that holy way of God euill spoken of? did not the latter end of the former Chapter teach vs, that Christ died not only to set vs free from the curse of sinne, but from the courses of iniquitie, that we should <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come zealous of goodworkes?</hi> Christ saueth no other, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not thy selfe.</p>

What meane those many exhortations, <hi>seeke the Lord while he may be found,</hi> and to <hi>day if yee will heare his voice harden not your hearts</hi>; and this is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time: the which gratious inuitations while men haue put off, how hath the seueritie of the almightie cut them off suddenly by strange deaths? and this most deseruedly, in that they had so long abused the time of his patience.

               <p>The fifth sort of secure persons may be called sensible Protestants,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> who by outward things iudge themselues highly in Gods bookes: and many both rich and poore tread in this path. Rich men need not seeke for further ground of Gods fauour, then that their hand hath found out riches, and they are increased in their possessions, and prospered in their labours: And how can it be other, seeing vengeance must pursue the wicked, and if they were so, they could not be prospered so long, and diuersly as they are. Thus Dauid obserued of wicked rich men: their houses were peaceable without feare; and because they are not in <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like other men, pride compasseth them as a chaine:</hi> they seeke not after God, nor sound and setled peace in him: but little knew they the end of that fat pasture; he learned at the sanctuarie,<note place="margin">Tolluntur in altum vt lapsu g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this is but a guile and stratageme of Satan, to cast his poyson into the Lords cup, and bane and destroie men with that which might be a speciall meane of their good, euen a speciall prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make them seeke reconciliation with God in Iesus Christ: which many men who will not much murmur at affliction, but generally can confesse it a fruit of their sinne, little thinke of; the affliction it selfe is a token of loue inough alreadie, though no amendment accompanie it, nor any sorrow for sinne, feare of offending, or diligence in good duties follow it. Thus by all these meanes securitie eateth vp the soules of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite professed Christians, who are all miserably deluded, and not yet gotten out of their naturall corrupted estate, but for the present are the children of wrath.</p>
               <p>The fourth and last sort of men <hi>who are deceiued</hi>

the good way, are some that seeme to themselues and others to be very good Christians, at least none of the worst: and yet many of them lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better then some of the former. And these are of two sorts: some are deceiued in regard of their sinnes; others in regard of their graces or vertues.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Of the former sort. There be some, who because they are not carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such sinnes as they see others, they conclude presently that they are in the right way to heauen, whereas there may be a worke of the word and spirit forcible against many sinnes, where there is no sauing grace in the soule. Hence is it that many, 1. <hi>before sinne,</hi> are vexed at it and affraid of it, and are loth to be too bold with it, but hating the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more then the sinne, they goe through stitch at length as Herod a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Iohn, and Pilate against Christ. Others can auoide sinne, as swearing, drinking, vncleannesse, &amp;c. but haue a false finger that hath laid hold vpon some one or moe, which shall bee dearer then to forgoe for naught; so as all sinnes shall not be left: nay they will in some cases be very commendable, euen aboue good Christians, in repressing corruptions, and yet not bee clensed from their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thus Haman could a long time refraine himselfe from Mordecay. 2. <hi>After sinne</hi> many moe can deceiue themselues with a counterfeit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, whereby they can feele it, crie out vpon it, and confesse it vvith griefe: d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Hence haue vve many, that after their sinne vvith a Lord haue mercie, or saying ouer of a prayer, vvith a forced sigh, dravve a skinne ouer their consciences, and for the time there is peace. And others vvho haue spent their vvhole liues in oppression, and grinding the faces of the poore; euery pennie of vvhose vvealth is vvorse gotten then other; if about the time of their death they giue a little trifle to the poore, or be liberall for a sermon, or set apart some small thing to some good vses; they rest herein as a sufficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance from all their vnrighteousnesse: vvhereas they neuer thinke of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Let such punish themselues, pray, fast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giue almes, and yet the Lord vvill neuer a vvhit regard, for here are no bands of vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nednes loosed. Others by some short humiliation in a seruile kinde of flatterie of God proceeding of slauish feare and selfe-loue, vvill come and confesse their sinne, and promise they vvill no more so transgresse, but yet they dissemble with their double hearts: for how many haue we knowne whose extorted righteousnesse hath been as the morning dew? In their sicknes and distresse they haue humbled themselues, but with the
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:18792:313"/>
Iewes <hi>for corne and wine:</hi> they haue howled and cried vpon their beds, but they returned not to the most high; they affected deliuerance, not repentance: nor further fawned vpon God then to get out of his hands. By these wordly sorrowes, infinite men deceiue themselues, and rest in them as sufficient repentance.</p>
               <p>The latter sort are they, that deceiue themselues in turning their eyes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> from their sins, to some vertues or graces which they find in their soules. Hence haue we men, that can be diligent in hearing the word, and that gladly with Herod, and thinke that enough to dispence with their hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their Herodias, some sweet sinne or other. Others can reioyce and be affected, as we haue knowne soft hearted Protestants, that could melt at sermons into teares, with great affection, and yet haue made little conscience of their wayes: but not mortifying the deeds of the flesh, haue yeelded to their lusts the raines in all libertie. Others can receiue the word, talke of it, yeeld a seemely obedience vnto it, any man would say, they were surely good Christians, yet as bad ground they giue it not depth enough; they giue it the vnderstanding and some affection, but the will and the whole ioy is not carried vnto it. If they talke of it, it is but as such as onely haue tasted it with their tongues, (as cookes do their seruices) but they haue not filled their bellie with it, as they for whom it is prepared. Their sightly obedience is like Herods, who did many things because Iohn was a good man. In a word, they can be reuerent &amp; liberall to Ministers, kind to professors, forward in good motions, can lend their hands or purses to helpe the godly out of trouble; &amp; yet in all these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable duties are like a deceitfull bow, which being cast &amp; crooked, let the eye aime neuer so right at the marke, it casteth it quite besides all the way; euen so all these proceeding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deepe hypocrisie, &amp; done not pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but sinister respects furthering them, deceiue the soule, &amp; keepe it farre from the happinesse of it. I graunt that in a good heart naturall hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie will be mingling it selfe in the bringing forth of such fruites; but yet it swayes not the heart, it is resisted and mastered; so as the maine sway of a good heart is sincere, choosing good things and doing them purely for God and themselues; but thus it is not in the former.</p>

First,</hi> according to the subiects it is diuersly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> considered. 1. In some subiects the will is confirmed and free to nothing but good, and that either by <hi>nature,</hi> as in God himselfe, or by <hi>grace,</hi> as in the good angels, and in men who are renewed in the highest degree, that is, the Saints departed, who immutably will onely good and onely <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> well. 2. In some other subiects the will is ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>med and hardened in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and free to will nothing else, as in the wicked angels and damned <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> men. 3. In some other it is more indifferent, as in men on earth, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther renewed, or in the state of corruption. In the former of which, as the subiect is but in part freed from the power of sinne, so is the will: it is so farre as flesh and sauouring of the old man, <hi>free</hi> to will things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe according to the corrupt nature: and as farre as it is spirit, and hath a worke of renovation, it is <hi>freed</hi> to will supernaturall and diuine things. But all these subiects are remooued as not that which our Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of; who not obscurely speaketh of naturall men, and their wills so farre as vnchanged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> for the <hi>obiect</hi> of this bondage. 1. We denie not in the will
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:18792:314"/>
of vnconuerted men a passiue power vnto good, that it can <hi>posse velle:</hi> but by this I meane a capablenes or abilitie of willing that which is truely good, not by any principle in it selfe,<note place="margin">The bondage of will conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the right obiect.</note> but when God shall send out the grace of conuersion. 2. We denie not in such a will an actuall freedome from all coaction and compulsion, which the nature of will cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> for it is not will vnlesse it be thus free. And therefore while it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth euill, it willeth it most freely;<note place="margin">Bellarmine saith we haue turned men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beasts, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will.

Where by the way lyeth the answer to that Popish obiection, that will cannot be free vnlesse it be inclinable alike to good and euill: for will is not properly free in regard of the obiect, to which it is mooued, but of the efficient moouing it: and what say they to the will of God? they cannot denie it to be most free, and yet cannot without blasphemie affirme it to be equally inclinable to euill as well as good.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

But alas <hi>what hath the righteous done</hi>; for what good work do men lay such load on them? why was Ioseph hated of all his brethren, and sold and bought among them, what had he done? surely his carriage was so wise, so dutifull, and respectiue, that his father could not but loue him aboue the rest; and his life was a reall reprehension of all the rest: so is it the verie light which is hated, because it checketh the darkenes of the world, which loueth her owne. But how do these men iniurie them selues most of all? what manner of men may we repute them, who the better any man is, the lesse they can abide him? A good man the more of Gods image he espieth in an other, the more (as he is bound) doth he loue and honour him. Againe, whereas euerie man should imitate the best examples and so walke more cheerefully to heauen together: the malice of these towards them will not suffer them, either to do good vnto them, or take any good from them. Which worke of malice is so bold, as wee may reade it in mens foreheads, and heare it from their mouths, that they will take no good neither by the doctrine, nor by the life of that minister, whose light reprooueth their darkenesse. But Ahab while he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth Micha a Prophet of God, will hate him notwithstanding, and therefore will receiue no direction from him: euen so we want not such as hearing the preacher rebuke, and apply the word against their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar sinnes; no sooner commeth the finger to the bile, or the quicke tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, but the carnall heart beginneth to boyle, and saith, this man mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me, he hath some spite at me, he hath heard something of me, he spendeth some of his anger against me, I will heare him no more; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as indeed it is the light of the word alone which ransaketh their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and it is no other but the natural malice of the heart against the truth, and bringers of it, which hindereth the entrance of the word for the time present and to come.

This is the cause why so few perceiue this estate of theirs, that so few see the necessitie of beeing renewed in the spirit of their minds, and that so few seeke in true humilitie to be shrowded vnder the righteousnesse of the Lord Iesus. But if euer thou wouldst be raised, labour to see and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayle the poyson of thy nature; the more thou seest it the lesse it is; and the more thou art sanctified, the more weakenes thou findest; yea little else but death and darkenes in thy soule.</p>
               <p>There is as great difference betweene two sorts of men, as betweene fire and water. The former haue alwaies found a good disposition in themselues, they haue grace at will, they neuer doubted of Gods loue, they haue euer loued and serued God without let; yet these pitifull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded creatures liue no otherwise then the very Stoiks, who followed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for their guid, and neuer find fault with their estate. Another sort of men such as Saint Paul can cry out of themselues as miserable men, ouermatched with a bodie of sinne and death; they pray for a free spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and then when first the Lord hath enlarged them and loosed their bolts, they can promise to runne the way of his commandements. These would doe good but they cannot; they would not doe euill, but they do it; which of these two now are more Puritanes? Againe, in their falls and slippes they differ no lesse. The former if he sinne he lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it vpon something without himselfe, as the sight of some obiect, and beholding of some Bathsebah, some Achans wedge; or his inward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces call to his minde some iniurie, vanitie, or some such occasion or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,<note place="margin">Men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally possessed with this point of Poperie, that this corruption is seated in the bodie, sences, and inferiour faculties of the minde onely.</note> which had he escaped all had bin well, thus he will lay his sinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where but on himselfe.

their saluation. If they find ignorance in themselues they presently haue recourse to this darknesse of mind which naturally hath depriued it selfe of the knowledge of God. If they come short of doing any good as they would, or doe it not so well; they can blame this inbred euill which is present with them: when they finde themselues heauie to that which the vnderstanding rightly conceiueth, they can grone vnder the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their will, which is renewed but in part only: when they goe hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and fall downe sometimes in their course, here they can espie their owne counsells casting them downe: when they see a conquest to will and effect that which is good, they can returne the honour to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and glorie in him who hath wrought both the will and the deed; yet so as they forget not the combate and molestation of this their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar foe, who continually eateth, drinketh, and sleepeth in his bosome, watching Dalilah-like to deliuer him to his destruction.</p>
               <p>Lastly, let euery one learne timely to take in hand this crooked nature, before he be accustomed to euill;<note place="margin">Timely take in hand thy croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked nature.</note> for else as hardly as a blackmoore changeth his skin, shalt thou become changed when wicked nature, and worse custome haue both barred thy repentance, and bound thy sinnes faster vpon thee. And because much of this folly is bound vp in the hearts of children and seruants, let masters and fathers seeke seasonably to driue it out; fathers especially because they helped their children into it, must by Christian instruction, godly example, and the rodde of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, labour to helpe them out, and thus do their best to make their children a part of a mends. Zuinglius calleth this corruption the <hi>disease</hi> of nature. And herein it fitly resembleth the diseases of the bodie,<note place="margin">Morbus &amp; lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor naturae.</note> the which the longer they continue the more incurable they are; and if they be let go too long they bring certaine death: and therefore let parents and masters (many of whom are carefull inough to preuent and seeke out for helpe against the diseases which threaten the bodily death of their children and seruants) take vp some care to remooue that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting death which this euill threatneth, and will certainely bring if in due season it be not repressed. Teach thy child, and traine him in the Scriptures from a child: teach thy seruant the trade of Christianitie and godlinesse, for thou art no lesse bound to deliuer him the principles of this calling as the particular to which he is bound: vse good meanes to get them the light of knowledge, opposed against this blindnesse of mind: worke vpon their wills to breake them from the follies and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of youth, opposed to this rebellion of will: bring them at least to outward conformitie in their conuersation, opposed to this generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauation of manners: these things they will not forget in their age, or if they do, the perill is their own, thou hast done thy duty, one thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,

               <p>Our Apostle hauing so largely described the miserable condition of man in his naturalls, whose whole temper we haue seene to be such as carieth him to all rough and gracelesse courses: he now setteth by it a liuely description of a new condition, vnto which those who are good in Gods sight are called: and this he doth in these foure verses, in this order. <hi>First,</hi> by the <hi>principall efficient cause of it,</hi> which is the <hi>bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and loue of God:</hi> fitly opposed to that hardnesse and vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of men, which was the ground of feircenes in their speaches and behauiours: God was not so feirce against man, but when we were in that miserable condition: as he is the fountaine of all goodnes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; so his gentlenes and philanthropie streamed out; and the glorious beames of his grace shined out vpon vs through his Christ, ver. 4. Now this principall efficient is illustrated, 1. by the <hi>time,</hi> when. 2. by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moouing the contrarie things, which whatsoeuer they may seeme, are so farre from beeing causes, as they are rather diametrally opposed; namely <hi>the workes of righteousnesse which we had done,</hi> that is, the verie best and floure of our workes, which indeed had no righteousnesse; here was no such thing concurring to the helping of vs into this estate, but his meere <hi>mercie saued vs:</hi> which assertion of Gods free mercie is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted and repeated againe, to take downe the arrogancie of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous spirits in those dayes. This he doth in the former part of the 5. verse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the <hi>instrumentall</hi> or ministeriall efficient cause, which helpeth vs into this change, and new condition; and this may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued either <hi>proper,</hi> and that is the renewing <hi>of the holy Ghost:</hi> or <hi>ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall</hi> and sacramentall, and that is the <hi>lauer of regeneration.</hi> By which some vnderstand Baptisme in a larger sence, including all the gifts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to saluation; as it is taken, Ioh. 3.5. and 1. Pet. 1.3. because the verse following casteth eye to such places of the old Testament, which speake not of the effusion of sacramentall water, but of the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull powring out of such graces of the spirit, as were prophecied to be
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:18792:320"/>
in abundance conferred to the Church of the new Testament: as Ezech. 36. <hi>I will powre out cleane waters:</hi> Ioel. 2. <hi>I will powre out of my spirit,</hi> that is, the waters of grace vnto a new life. But I will not leaue the high way, where I may (as I take it) more conueniently goe in it. I will speak of this <hi>lauer of regeneration,</hi> in the stricter sence, taking it for the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptisme: for so I shall not confound things which the text see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth plainely to distinguish; the whole former sence beeing expressed in those words, and the <hi>renewing of the holy Ghost</hi>; as after in prosecuting them we shall see.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this new condition is amplified by the <hi>finall cause of it,</hi> and this ende is twofold: 1. nearer hand, namely our present iustification, <hi>That by his grace we beeing iustified,</hi> that is, accounted righteous; 2. more remote and further off, but annexed, and inseperably tyed vnto the former, namely our future glorification, when we shall be manifested to be <hi>heyres of life eternall</hi>; which yet is not so farre off vs, but that we haue sure hold of it by <hi>hope.</hi> So as the whole carriage and meaning of these 4. verses, seemeth to be this.</p>
               <p>Howsoeuer formerly we were in our old estate, lost in wandring and vagrant courses, yet after that the most free loue and good will of God our Sauiour (whose sole mercie alone mooued him in his sonne to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace vs) through the preaching of the Gospel, did more clearely shine out; then not of any workes of righteousnesse which we had done, for what could we then doe? but of his meere mercie he saued vs: and to this purpose he powred vpon vs his holy spirit to the renewing of vs, and the purging of our consciences from all the impuritie of them: of which inward purging that lauer of Baptisme is a signe and representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he doth not sparingly and drop by drop, besprinkle our consciences with those pure waters, but abundantly and with a liberall hand sheddeth them, and powreth them ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All which our good God hath done for vs, that we might obtaine righteousnesse, and all spirituall graces attending it; and so might be led to the fruition of that glorie which he hath alreadie put in our hands by faith and hope, which shall not make vs ashamed.</p>
               <p>In the principall efficient, we are to speake of three things in order. 1. of this <hi>loue,</hi> and <hi>bountifulnesse</hi> of God, which is the positiue cause of our saluation. 2.

And yet this loue of God must be brought a little lower, if we would settle it on his right obiect: for it is not generall nor absolute, but respectiue and hauing reference vnto Christ, as the verse implieth: in whom it freeth from the miserie mentioned in the former verse, and accepteth vnto that especiall mercie mentioned in the next. In a word, here is a greater and more glorious loue then was seene in the creation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of all things in the world: here is a loue electing, redeeming, regenerating, and glorifying miserable men; a loue aduancing our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature in his sonne, who tooke not the seed of Angels but of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; a loue which hateth worldly Esaus in comparison of his Iacob, whom he calleth out of the world; not by the outward sound of the Gospel only, but by the effectuall call of his spirit in their hearts; whom he loueth not as creatures but new creatures, liker vnto himselfe then all the other, by a restored and renewed image: and for whom he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued more loue in heauen when they shall become yet liker vnto him in all holines in the holy of holyes.</p>

                  <note place="margin">How God can be so good to man, seeing so many vessells are prepared to destruction.</note>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how can such loue of man be ascribed vnto God, seeing that so many vessels are prepared to destruction, and so many millions are hated before they haue euer done good or euil: and secondly, of those that are dearest vnto him, many yea the most are so afflicted and distressed that they scarce see any good day: can this stand with such a bountifull <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> loue? <hi>Answ.</hi> First, the goodnes of God must stand with his wisedom, which affoardeth not the same degree of goodnes to euerie one: it is not against the goodnes of a potter to make ignoble vessels to dishonour as well as to honour, seeing the former haue also their good vses. How could the goodnesse of a father appeare, if he should set vp hogs, and dogs at his table as well as his children? as the Lord is good, so he is wise to be so good to each in their degree as may make for his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and advantage. 2. This goodnes and loue of God must stand with
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:18792:321"/>
his iustice also as well as his mercie. Hence the Apostle would haue vs to cast our eye on two things at once in God, when we would be satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this point. The <hi>goodnesse</hi> and the <hi>seueritie</hi> of God:<note place="margin">Rom. 11.22.</note> for this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse cannot suffer euill and sinne in the impenitent vnreuenged: it cannot suffer the good and bad to be alwaies mingled together, no more then the good husbandmen can alwaies suffer the wheat and chaffe on the same floore. 3. This loue and goodnesse is more seene and shining in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing one soule by his Christ, then his seueritie in the deserued death of al the vngodly; the former beeing meere mercie, the latter due desert. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he correcteth indeede his children often sharpely, but the ground is good, euen this loue and goodnes. 2. the manner and measure is good, with rods of men, and not aboue their strength. 3. the ende is good to drawe them nearer vnto himselfe. Doth a father loose his loue when he correcteth his sonne whom he tenderly loueth? was Christ hated when he was on the crosse or in the graue? so when the adopted sonnes are conformed to the naturall, they are not lesse but more loued, in that they are not suffered to runne with the world, that so they may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This goodnesse of God is a singular consolation to such as are his. It will not suffer them to want any good thing that is good for them, but it will most certenly and seasonably communicate it: it hath giuen the sonne, and how can it but with him giue all things? remission of sinnes, peace of conscience, wealth, length of dayes, grace and glorie. Is the fountaine in thy fathers grounds? then maist thou looke to drinke to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie of euery good thing: shall any good thing be wanting to him that feareth the Lord: no surely, for his goodnes is entailed vnto them, by promise, by oath, yea by season and possession. But looke well to the purity of thy heart, seeing God is good especially to the <hi>pure of heart.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we are taught hence sundrie dutyes. 1. In the want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good thing, in confidence &amp; affiance of our hearts to flie to this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of goodnes: it is a liuing fountaine that knoweth not the yeares of drought; here faithfully aske it, hopefully expect it, and in longer delaies or denials onely know it is a wise loue of a father, who neither giueth his child hurtfull things, nor yet any store of good things, till he know how to vse them. 2. In the receiuing or enioying of any good thing, the praise and glory must be returned to this wel head, which is the sea from which all the riuers of goodnesse flowe, and to which they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> for he not onely is pleased to <hi>take away iniquitie and passe by the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:18792:322"/>
of the remnant of his heritage</hi>; but to walke friendly and famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly with men: not onely the worthies of the former world; such as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch, who walked with God: Moses with whome he talked face to face as a man with his friend: Abraham with whom he imparted his secret counsels: Iacob with whom he wrastled familiarly: but euen vnto our selues, whome he hath pleased not onely to admit vnto eternall saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his sonne, but hath in the meane time reuealed vnto vs his secret thoughts; sent out his spirit to accompanie, comfort, quicken, raise, and enlighten vs, and his word to rule and direct vs, and in the ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of it euen striueth with vs, that he may leaue vs a blessing behind him. It was his great familiaritie that he should shewe Moses the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan before his death: but he hath shewed vs a farre off, that euerlasting rest and receptacle of all the Israel of God. And Paul himselfe was not more beholding to this goodnesse, when he was taken vp into the third heauen, then we are in hauing so many high mysteries reuealed vnto vs, and so many great things put into our hands by faith and hope, which we cannot vtter with our tongues, nor yet with our hearts conceiue: and shall our hearts be barren in the meditation, and our mouthes mute and dumbe at such a goodnes as this is? 4. To imitate this goodnesse of God, whose nature and image we must put on daily: we must grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by it, we must be led to loue him more for his goodnesse; and a shame it were that this bountifulnesse of God should not lead vs vnto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Besides, none are partakers of it, but such as being borrowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come seruants vnto the lender: for although the Lord be boundlesse in all bountifulnes, yet is he not so regardles in conferring it, as that he looketh not for answer of loue for loue; and if he be kinde to the vnkind what is it else, but the heaping of coales on the heads of those who are in fitting to destruction: for any man then thus to reason, God is full of goodnesse, and abundant in mercie, and therefore I will doe as I list; it is the abusing of his patience, and the treasuring of wrath against the day of wrath. Let such knowe, that as with the vpright he will be vpright, to bring on them all his promised goodnes, so with the froward he wil deale as frowardly: and that there is not a more seuere plague abiding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, then to haue all the goodnesse of God turned to his euill and hurt by his owne sinne; to whome let mercie be shewed, yet in the land of vprightnesse hee will do wickedly: let the Gospel be preached, it is the <hi>sauour of death,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.15.</note> yea let Christ himselfe be offered, the greatest gift of loue that euer was giuen, hee will be but a rocke of offence and a stone to stumble at. 5. In regard of others we must learne to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate our goodnes euen to the helping and winning of them that as yet are not called; so also must this bountifulnesse of our Master, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:18792:322"/>
vs from taking our fellow seruants by the throate; for hauing beene forgiuen ten thousand talents, we may well forgiue an hundred pence. Thus shall we manifest our selues to be the children of our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by resembling that goodnes of his which worketh in the winning and sauing of sinners; and in shewing mercie, and remitting of manifold debts.</p>
               <p>The second point in the efficient of our saluation, noteth the time when God saued vs, namely, when his bountifulnesse, and loue appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and shined out in the Gospel; then came this blessed saluation vnto vs, when God the inexhaust fountaine of all goodnesse by the tidings of the Gospell, shewed that he was become our friend in Iesus Christ: when this cleare sunneshine and dayspring began to shine in our hearts, then beganne our saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1.<note place="margin">Then are we saued when we are sanctified.</note> Then are we saued when we are sanctified and changed by the word and spirit: for as no sooner are we in the first Adam, but we are in the state of damnation, so no sooner are we in the second Adam, but we are in the state of saluation. The Scriptures are plaine to this purpose, Rom. 1.17. The righteousnes of faith is <hi>revealed by the Gospel,</hi> and by this faith the iust <hi>man liueth:</hi> which place hath relation as well vnto the life eternall, at this temporarie: 1. Cor. 2.9, 10. The great things which eye hath <hi>not seene, &amp;c.</hi> the spirit <hi>reuealeth vnto vs:</hi> yea more, the spirit maketh vs knowe the things that are <hi>giuen vs of God.</hi> Now what be these things that are giuen vs, but grace, iustification, and saluation, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out vnto vs in the ministerie of the Gospel, and receiued of vs by faith and hope, the which also are wrought and confirmed by the same meanes. But more expresse is the Apostle Iohn, <hi>wee are now the sonnes of God:</hi> and, Eph. 2.7. by grace <hi>ye are saued</hi> through faith: and,<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.2.</note> Ioh. 10. <hi>I giue to them life eternall,</hi> he saith not, I will giue, but noteth a continued act begun in the present.

<pb n="628" facs="tcp:18792:323"/>
as we carrie this flesh about with vs, subiected and tending to death and corruption, yea subiect to become an instrument of sinne: and besides, those phrases of the Apostle, that we are now <hi>saued by faith,</hi> and <hi>by hope,</hi> seeme to denie our present saluation, seeing neither of them are of things present, but both of things not seene, and both in the fruition of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation must cease.<note place="margin">Saluation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered two waies.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We must consider our saluation two waies. <hi>First,</hi> in Christ our head, in whom we haue not attained one or moe parts, but full saluation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as it is in our selues his members, and this in two degrees. <hi>The former,</hi> as it is only inchoate and begun, which is, when beeing regenerate and adopted into the number of the sonnes of God, we haue attained in Christ remission of sinne, freedom from the seruitude of sinne, and Satan, and deliuerance from the curse and condemnation of it: so as although sinne as a poyson will be in our flesh so long as we are in the flesh, yet is there no condemnation for it to those that are in Christ: neither is there a raigne of it vnto death, but <hi>a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alking after the spirit</hi>; and as for the reliques of sinne which are left in their mortall bodies, they are not deadly, no nor the last enemie that shall be destroied their death it selfe. Now in this first regard we are not as we were before, the sonnes of wrath, but truely and properly may be said to be iust, reconciled, heyres of grace, and saued from wrath. The <hi>latter</hi> degree, is the perfect consummation and finall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of our saluation: which is nothing else but a putting off of death and corruption, and the putting on of full glorie of bodie and soule. Now we may not conceiue this another saluation in kind then the former; but another degree of the same, which as certainely shall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the former, as the former is certainely begunne. And thus are we saued <hi>by hope,</hi> not that by our hope we expect another saluation then that which now in Christ we haue in our hands; but for that we certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waite for a further and more full degree of that we haue. A man that lyeth sicke of a desperate disease is restored and recouered by two degrees: the former, when the force of his disease is by the skilfull ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of physicke broken, the humors purged, a temperature in part procured: now the disease is not deadly, hee beginneth to eate, to drinke, to sleepe, to walke; here if we say the partie is recouered and safe, we speake truth; although he be not attained to the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree which is a perfect recouerie of all parts to former soundnesse; which shall certainely follow the former, because it is not another reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, but a further degree of soundnesse, the principles of which he hath alreadie attained and is in possession of: euen so is our case, God looking vpon vs in his Christ, accepteth vs as perfectly saued, our selues are freed from the imputation and damnation of sinne, and so perfectly

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Whosoeuer would be saued hereafter, must be saued here: a Saint hereafter, a Saint here: the gate of heauen is here below,<note place="margin">None saued hereafter who are not saued here.</note> and the suburbs of that great citie into which the iust doe enter. Christ is the doore, by him we must enter into the paradise of God. Laie hold on him with his merits by the beleefe of thy soule, thou hast gotten sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation alreadie; and in not beleeuing in him, thou art condemned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie. Fearefull is the estate of men, that neuer acquaint themselues with saluation before the end of their daies; and then they will be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, and dreame of another condition. But Saints in heauen, must be the same men they are vpon earth, and change not their condition but onely in obtaining a further degree of grace, glorie, holinesse, life, and happinesse which they had beginnings of euen in this life; they purchased heauen while they were vpon earth, treasured in heauen while they wandred in the earth, conuersed in heauen while they liued vpon the face of the earth. Alas, how few are acquainted with such a life as this, which is the beginning of all happinesse and saluation? We call men to forsake the world in affection, as the Saints in heauen haue actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally done; to flie the corruptions that are in the world through lust, as they haue put off all corruptions and sinnefull lusts: to haue no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the vngodly ones of the world, no more then they whose sole conuerse is with God and his Saints. But how knocke we (as they say) at deafe mens doores: the most haue no portion, no treasure but below, and therefore their hearts must be below where their treasure is. As for the auoiding of sinne, whereby as the elect of God, they might shine in vnblameable and vndefiled conuersation, and so reprooue the darknesse of this euill world; they say they cannot be Saints here where all men are sinners, and because they cannot be so, their lusts are let loose and are at all manner of libertie. As for the societie of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, they must goe out of the world if they would auoid it: it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ough if in heauen after the finall separation, they haue nothing to doe with them; but while they are in earth mixed with them, they settle themselues to runne with them into all riot and excesse of wickednesse. Is this now a beginning of the kingdome of heauen? or is it not rather a course that tendeth to nothing else but destruction. And as we call men from earth, earthly courses, and companie; so also we call them
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:18792:324"/>
vnto the beginnings of fellowship with God, with the Saints of God, to a perpetuall Sabboath or rest from sinne, and a constant and cheerefull performing before him all the parts of his worship and seruice both publike and priuate: because in the perfection of these, consisteth the heauenly life of the Saints. But how vnwelcome is our counsell? it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to seeke their torment before their time. How many be there that cannot abide the least shew of heauenly life in themselues? how many scorne it in others? and how many who thinke it more necessarie then vtterly to neglect it, yet are content to cast the care of it into their last accounts, as if they were loth to be saued before they be dead, or as if they would leape into the perfect libertie of the sonnes of God at one iumpe? But let it be well remembred, that he that is not saued before death, shall neuer be saued after death; and that he that findeth not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon earth, looseth it for euer. The Apostle maketh two degrees of the vision of God: the former is as in a <hi>mirror,</hi> or glasse, and that is here vpon earth, in the word, Sacraments, and meanes of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe; the latter is <hi>face to face,</hi> in heauen when the kingdome in regard of these meanes shall be giuen vp to the Father: and concludeth, that we must knowe in part, before we can come to knowe as we are knowne.</p>

Whosoeuer would haue assurance of saluation, let him haue recourse to his sanctification, and change of heart and life: doest thou finde that the word hath beene powerfull to subdue thy rebellion, and frame thy soule to a sanctified condition, and thy outward man to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuersation in part? here is an assurance and seale of saluation vpon which thou maist ground good hopes: for this small measure of sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is an earnest pennie confirming all the bargaine and couenant of God with thee: and it shall get daily strength and encrease vntill it bring thee to meete God in that celestiall Sion, where shall be no faintnesse; but where all the remainders of sinne, and rellickes of corruption and mortalitie shall be put off. In this regard is the worke of our sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion called the <hi>first fruits</hi> of the spirit: because as the offring of the first fruits was the sanctification of the whole field; so these first fruits of our sanctification giue assured hope of the full glorification of the whole man both in soule and bodie. This blessed change is called also the <hi>first resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> which whosoeuer haue part in, haue alreadie escaped the second death. It contracteth the Christian soule as a pure spouse vnto Iesus Christ, so as it may with boldnesse and much reioycing expect the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the lambe.</p>
               <p>Where come to be controlled those blind hopes of presumptuous men; they are perswaded of their saluation and as sure as any man can be
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:18792:324"/>
by hope of life eternall; yea but where is your assurance? oh no, I am not sure, nor I thinke can any man be, but I haue a good hope; but whence is this hope of yours? because I loue God aboue all, I will doe no man any wrong, I will pay euerie man his owne, I serue God, and goe to Church, am good to the poore: that a man would verily thinke he had a Papist in hand, who will be saued by his good deedes, rather then one that euer heard of the doctrine of free iustification by faith in the sonne of God. But the doctrine we haue in hand teacheth, that there is an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, a seale, an earnest of saluation, on which a man may assuredly settle his inward peace, and his hopes shall neuer make him ashamed. Yea further, that this assurance is no blind perswasion, nor bold presumption, grounded vpon any thing of our owne; but founded vpon the worke of God in vs, changing vs daily, &amp; renewing the image of God vpon vs: the which good worke wheresoeuer it is begunne,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.6.</note> shall <hi>be perfected vnto the day of Christ.</hi> Cold is the comfort which this doctrine can minister to a number of men, Christians by profession, who neuer knewe this change in themselues: the word hath beene too light to lift them vp to a newe life; but they rotte away in the same sinnes and corruptions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they were borne, and haue since confirmed vpon themselues, and cannot say truely, I am changed, or yet am in the state of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. See hence the blessed condition of men conuerted and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to God, that we may neuer rest or be in quiet,<note place="margin">Men conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are happie men, though the world see it not.</note> vntill we haue attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this grace of conuersion: for they are alreadie possessed of their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse and saluation; which standeth in pardon of sinne, couering of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie, freedome from the curse, libertie from the raigne of sinne; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the purchase of victorie ouer sinne and death, of peace of good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, of ioy in the holy Ghost, in the certaine fruition of God himself, and all those pleasures which are at his right hand for euermore. The worldling seeth no part of this present happinesse, and saluation of the Saints; and therefore knowing no better, he neuer accounteth himselfe so blessed as when he is drowned in carnall delights, when his corne and wine and oyle is encreased vpon him, when his cup runneth ouer, when all men flatter him, when his mouth is filled with laughter; and yet in the mean time his bones are filled with the sinnes of his youth and age, &amp; are likely to be laid downe together with him in the dust, as Iob speaketh. Nay more, euen our selues who haue our blessednesse in our hands, often see but a smal part of it; that it is no meruaile if others can determine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our present happines, when our selues are at such demurres in the matter: especially when we see the world hating vs, the earth expelling vs, bonds &amp; prisons receiuing vs, our countrie scarce acknowledging vs,

our kinsfolkes not knowing vs, our friends forsaking vs, our enemies kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vs, dangers so assayling vs, as we can scarce be safe in any corner: nay sometimes our owne holds are taken, that we cannot feare more warre abroad, then we finde at home, not meete with lesse peace without then within. But now would it be an high wisedome to espie and know our blessednesse, which with this change we firmely hold whatsoeuer our outward condition be or can be. If now we suffer for righteousnesse it withstandeth not, but maketh to our happinesse: If all men speake all manner of euill against vs for Christs sake, it hindereth not but furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth our saluation: If earth refuse vs, heauen approoueth vs; if men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne, God will iustifie: if our friends denie vs, Christ our husband will confesse vs: In any miserie we shall haue assured felicitie, in sorrowe and heauinesse matter of true ioy, in outward trouble inward peace, in temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation assurance of euasion: In nothing all things, in death and corupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, life and immortalitie. Thus our happinesse must not be mistaken, which is inward, spirituall, and heauenly; not depending on man, but God, by whose assured word and pledges it is bestowed, nourished, and perfected in vs.</p>
               <p>Now if any would trie whether he hath this happinesse in his hands or no,<note place="margin">Trie thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent happines by this touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</note> let him come to this touchstone. 1. Canst thou finde in thy soule a godly sorrow for sin, which proceedeth on to repentance, causing thee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to loath thy sinne, and loue righteousnesse constantly, and canst thou <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> loue him that dealeth sharpely against thy dearest sinnes? 2.

Findest thou thy whole conuersation to be now a constant practise of righteousnes and holynes? perceiuest thou thy selfe more heauenly minded then euer thou wast earthly and couetous; more vpright in dealing with men then before vniust, more pure and sober in word, deede, thoughts, lookes, then euer thou wast vncleane or intemperate? Take all these together with thee, and go on as cheerefully as happily, thou art a blessed man alreadie, and not all the gates of hell can hinder thee of thy saluation.</p>
               <p>A second point to be learned in that it is said, that then God saued vs, when his bountifulnesse <hi>appeared,</hi> is, That before this reuealing of our saluation by Christ,<note place="margin">Before the Lord put forth his loue in his Christ, it could not be reached of man or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</note> this loue and bountifulnesse of God was hid with himselfe, and could not be reached vnto by the most peircing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, or industrie of man or Angel: only God could inuent our cure, onely God could manifest the same, and make it appeare vnto vs. True it is, that it was giuen in the wise counsell of God, before the world
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:18792:325"/>
was, and shall be consummate and perfected when heauen, and earth, &amp; time shall be no more: But if we enquire the proper time and manner of the happie appearing of it to the sonnes of men; then we must an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that it was at the reuealing and appearing of our Lord Iesus Christ; namely, partly more darkly by the preaching of the Prophets vnto the auncient fathers and beleeuers: as Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid, who with the remnant of Israel enioyed the same promises, and precious faith with vs; and partly more clearely by the incarnation of the sonne of God, which was the glorious rising of this Sonne of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, who both by his owne doctrine and miracles, life and death; and the doctrine of his Apostles and Pastors, hath brightly shined vpon all vs vpon whom the ends of the world are come: according to that prophesie of Malac. 4.2. <hi>The sunne of righteousnesse shall rise:</hi> adding also, that he <hi>bringeth health vnder</hi> his wings.

To this purposeth is it said, that <hi>Christ brought life to light,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 1.10.</note> whereas else Adam and all his posteritie had for euer laid vnder death and darknesse; for when Adam little thought of saluation, yea when he was running from God, and hiding himselfe in his thickets, then Christ brought life to light, in that promise of the promised seed, reuealing himselfe to be the life of Adam, and all his beleeuing posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: as afterward he both enlarged the promise, and actually made it good in the full accomplishment. And all this, 1. in that Christ hath the right of life, and glorie in himselfe: 2. he hath it not for himselfe olny, but for vs also, whose head and husband by taking our flesh he is become. In the former, he standeth in the person of the Sonne; in the latter, in the person of a mediator, bringing and applying to vs that life and glorie which as the sonne he hath in himselfe. Both these the author to the Hebrewes implieth in those two phrases,<note place="margin">Hebr. 1.3.</note> that Christ is the <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the glorie,</hi> and the engrauen <hi>forme of his person:</hi> both because he is the eternall Sonne of the eternall Father, as also especially in that in our nature he shewed forth the liuely, and louely countenance of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: yea whatsoeuer is glorious, or gratious in the Father, as his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable wisedome, power, goodnesse, and mercie, hath the Father mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in his Sonne: without whom they had neuer bin made known vnto vs: <hi>for none euer saw the Father, saue the Sonne, and he to whom the Sonne
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:18792:326"/>
reuealeth him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine sheweth, that Christ is the only Mediator of redemption, and intercession; Isay. 63.9. <hi>The Angel of Gods face or</hi> presence: who could euer get a comfortable sight of God without Christ? who euer gat good speed in any suite out of him? who could euer behold the infinite glorie, or grace of God, but through this vaile? nay all the sight of God, in which any creature, man, or angel hath euer beene happie, was by meanes of this Mediator, and neuer immediate. Let the blinded Papist go to his Saints,<note place="margin">Let the Papist goe to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the court of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, we must goe to the Prince himself.</note> and Angels, as to the nobles of the court of heauen; we will repaire to the Prince the heyre of all things, as hauing commandement to seeke to no other, and as hopelesse that if he cannot speed, any other shall for vs. Wantest thou any grace? thou must <hi>receiue it of his fulnesse:</hi> wantest thou life? he is <hi>the life: I goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, saith hee, and you die in your sinnes:</hi> wantest thou peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? <hi>hee is the Prince of peace:</hi> wantest thou direction and wisedome to order thy waies aright? with <hi>him are treasures of wisedome:</hi> make him thy freind, in his loue there shall be no lack.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence we may note, the surpassing loue of God to vs his chosen, who when we had thrust a cloud of sinne betweene him and vs, that he could take no delight in vs, yea when we still prouoked him and warred against him as his enemies; yet then caused his mercie to breake out, that all the world might see and acknowledge it. Is it not wonderfull that the partie offended, should seeke to the delinquent? we thinke it a great thing to forgiue one offence to one that sueth for forgiuenes; but to offer grace and giue it to him that persisteth in outragious mallice against vs, is farre aboue that: but how transcendent a mercie aboue all these shadows in men, is that of our God, who in his Christ aduanced vs from so hatefull and base estate, to such an height of glorie and happines? what is our part then but to break off sin, and breake out into his prayses <hi>for such vnspeakeable grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Seeing God hath not only so freely, but so clearely reuealed his loue and fauour in his Christ, which before was hid and vnknowne to the world; let vs manifest our selues to be such as are come to the knowledge and participation of this rich grace, by entertaining the meanes in which Christ bringeth vs the tidings of our peace and reconciliation. For this grace appeareth in the Gospel; there Christ commeth to seeke vs; there he calleth vs, yea leadeth vs vnto it: therefore whosoeuer haue part in this grace, must giue the Gospel leaue to enter, must open their eyes to see it, their mouthes to tast of it, and their hearts to feed vpon it. Whence we may conclude, that surely this grace is still an hid thing and vnreuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto many, because the news of it is so lightly regarded of the most:
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:18792:326"/>
whereas if men did <hi>know this gift of God,</hi> as Christ said to the woman at the well, they would aske and enquire after it; they would account the feet of such messengers as could tell them tydings of it verie bewti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; they would sell all to make purchase of it; they would reioyce in the word, make it their song, their counsellor, their portion, the which both reuealeth, and as an instrument of God bestoweth vpon vs all our good. Nay, it could not be but if men knew who <hi>Christ were,</hi> and did see him in the ministrie, but they would run after it as fast, as to heauen it selfe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 5.</hi> Not of the workes of righteousnesse,]</q>
               <p>The third and principall instruction in this principall efficient of our saluation, is, That there is nothing at all in any man, which mooueth or enclineth God to reach out his grace of saluation vnto him:<note place="margin">Let it be well noted against the Papists, that euen works of iustice and grace are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto mercy &amp; grace: and not works of nature, as they would haue it.</note> the which point the Apostle is carefull to confirme sundrie waies. As 1. by remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing whatsoeuer man could dreame of, as the likeliest things to demerit God: as <hi>works of righteousnes,</hi> which before conuersion were none at all, and therefore could make no way to our saluation. 2. By expresse affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that being mooued <hi>by his</hi> meere <hi>mercie he saued vs:</hi> and although by nearer looking into the text, we shall meet with sundrie other motiues most orderly linked together, concurring to our saluation; yet shall we see them all in God, and neuer a one in our selues: 1. we haue mention of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> his goodnes: 2. of his loue to man: 3. of his mercie: and then in the last <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> place of saluation: whence if we goe backe in the same order, we shall ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceiue that our saluation floweth from his mercie, his mercy from his loue, his loue from his goodnes, and his goodnes from his owne infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite nature. 3. By opposing (according to his vsuall manner) as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the things which can neuer stand together in this busines: namely, Gods grace, and mans merit. 4. By his whole scope, which is to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the free loue and good will of God from this, that not for any goodnes in vs, but of his owne free grace he saued vs. In all which he setteth himselfe to meete with the corrupted iudgement of naturall men, who are still hammering of some vprightnes, &amp; honest dealing, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their nature disposing them to this mercie: but our Apostle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooueth all such bold and blind conceits, in affirming that there was no such thing which God could respect.</p>
               <p>Now because this is a maine ground of our religion, it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse to confirme it by other paralel places, as also by some other grouds out of Scripture: Rom. 9.11. That the purpose <hi>of God according to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might stand, not according to workes, but by him that calleth:</hi> and v. 16. <hi>It is not in him that willeth, or in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercie:</hi> and cap. 11.35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>who gaue vnto him first, that he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence</hi>?
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:18792:327"/>
Hence, 1. vve conclude, that if God should choose to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for any thing in man, it could not be but man should be the first in his owne election,<note place="margin">Our saluation beginneth in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and not after we come to faith, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or good desires and works. Both Augustine and Thomas vrge this place to prooue this conclusion.</note> and God should come after him: yea it would ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne all the order of God in his most wise proceeding, and would place his second grace before the first: for whereas the first grace, namely, the election of such as the Father is to giue vnto the Son by him to be saued, in all good order should precede the second, whereby such as are elected before all time, are in time giuen to the Sonne, called, iustified, graced, glorified, and so saued. The Popish doctrine of Gods foresight of faith, or workes, placeth this latter in Gods counsell before the former.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>election</hi> is of grace, Rom. 11.5. <hi>There is an election of grace:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but if it were of foreseene workes, it were at least partly of desert, and then should it follow, 1. that it could not be of grace <hi>any way, because not of grace euery way,</hi> ver. 6. 2. that all <hi>our owne reioycing should not be excluded,</hi> Rom. 3.27. 3. that if the Apostle should aske againe, <hi>who se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated vs</hi>? our answer might be, we partly separated our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly our Apostle, Eph. 1.4.5. affordeth vs three grounds more, 1. from the time of our election, which is before the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation <hi>of the world,</hi> before we had done either good or euill, or were in the world to doe it. 2. In that he maketh our workes effects of election and therefore cannot be causes of it: <hi>he hath chosen vs in him,</hi> not because he foresaw that wee would be holy, but <hi>that we might be holy and vnblameable,</hi> as in cap. 2.10. <hi>we are his workemanship created to good workes:</hi> and because it might be said, that yet God might foresee who would receiue grace, and who not, and consequently, who would vse the same aright in ordering their liues. The third conclusion in the 5. verse affirmeth, that God respected nothing out of himselfe, or in vs, past or to come: but according to the good pleasure which he <hi>purposed in himselfe</hi> (as <hi>Beza</hi> readeth it) he choosed vs to partake of his grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, I would aske a Papist, whether if the Lord did foresee any thing to bring vs to saluation by; whether that was not the couenant of grace rather then the couenant of workes, by the which neuer was or could any man be saued? 2. In case God did foresee any worke which should be answerable to either of those couenants of grace or workes, whether himselfe should not be the bestower of that grace and worke: so as still not the worke (if there were any) but his grace shall be the first moouer. 3. Whether God should be mooued (if by workes) by those before conuersion or after; if they say by those after conuersion, euen these saith the Prophet are as a stained clout. If by those afore, which their doctrine seemeth to tend to, affirming that our vnregenerate wills haue a power to consent and coworke with Gods will, and to prepare
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:18792:327"/>
themselues to iustification: then our text controlleth them, which saith there was no such works at all, which could mooue the Lord to take any pleasure in vs. Nay, we <hi>were sinners</hi> saith Paul, when God chose vs; and such sinners as are described in the former verse, blinded in mind, rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in will, and disordered in our whole conuersation. Which shal serue for the ouerthrowe of all workes, either preparatorie, or foreseene, or which any other way may obscure the free grace of God in our election and saluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. To be sober minded, and wise to sobrietie in the matters of Gods counsell, inquiring into no reason further then his will,<note place="margin">Voluntas dei occulta esse po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, non potest esse iniusta. August. ad Paul. epist. 59.</note> which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer iust although the thing may seeme strange and dazle our weak eyes: the which one point would cut off many controversies, and needles que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of sundrie diuines, who in their platformes of election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, will allowe the Lord no further libertie then themselues can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise reason of: for one, the foresight of some good, for the other, of some euill: which cannot but bring in an vniuersall reprobation, because all are the sonnes of wrath by nature, and God seeth them not out of this condition in themselues: besides that, the Lord shall be tied to conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereas he will haue mercie where he wil, and whom he will he will harden.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This doctrine is a ground of true humilitie: for when all saluation from first to last is acknowledged to be of grace, altogether out of our selues, it shutteth all presumptuous mouthes, who would gladly be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing to their owne nets. And this seemeth to be the Lords end in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing his free couenant; that his people might remember,<note place="margin">Ezek. 16.63.</note> 
                  <hi>and be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and neuer open their mouth any more.</hi> How carefull is he to take all such arrogant speaches out of their mouthes, Deut. 7.7. and 9.5. <hi>Say not because of mine owne righteousnesse hath the Lord giuen vs this land</hi> (and much lesse the heauenly Canaan) and telleth them plainly that they were the least <hi>and worst of</hi> all people before the Lord put the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them and others.<note place="margin">Dilexit non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istentes imo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistentes. Bern.</note> And the whole Scripture sheweth how he hath set his affection on such as were still the most vnlikely, and in all outward respects least commendable; the youngest for most part when the first b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="638" facs="tcp:18792:328"/>3. Hence we haue also a ground of thankefulnesse; when we heare of such a free choise, and that the Lord enquired not what we were, or what we were worthy of; but loued vs before we were, or the world was; when nothing could be conceiued either preuenting or meeting this goodnes of God. And indeede neuer can we come to see the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomelesse sea of this grace, vnlesse we behold it in this gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sse which our Apostle setteth before our eyes, of our free election and saluation meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by grace; the which once if we come to behold, how can we but mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie his grace, confesse his name, feare to offend him, tender all obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence vnto him, yea in way of loue and thankefulnesse giue vp our selues to liue and die in his seruice, who hath so freely, so highly advanced vs? vndeserued loues are great binders. It is in the mouth of euerie man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them of whome they haue receiued vndeserued good turnes, I can neuer make such a man amends for such or such fauours; and yet this boundlesse loue of God is seldome waighed of vs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Here is a ground of certentie of saluation, as which is founded in the election of God by grace; and is therefore more firme then the frame of heauen and earth: whereas were it founded in our selues, or put in our owne hands to keepe, we could haue no assurance of it; no though we were renewed to our first innocencie, as appeareth in Adam: but see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our life and salvation is hid with God, none shall take it or vs euer out of his hands. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But if it be laid so farre out of our reach, that we neither haue it in our hand, nor any hand in it, but it is all in the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God; how can we haue any euidence or assurance of it in our selues, vnlesse we should climbe vp into heauen? <hi>Answ.</hi> We must not conceiue of this as such a mercie which after it is freely set vpon vs hath no worke in vs;<note place="margin">Qui fecit te si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne te, non sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat te sine te. August.</note> nor such a mercie as saueth vs without our selues; but such a mercie, as 1. calleth vs by the Gospel, 2.

               <p n="5">5. Here is also another ground of moderation and meekenesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward such as are not yet called: because the change is of meere mercy, the difference betweene vs is not naturall nor deserued: we were in time past no better then they; they may in time to come participate of free

               <q>By the washing of the newe birth,]</q>
               <p>We are now come to the instrumentall causes or meanes whereby we are set into this newe condition. And these be two, First <hi>outward,</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are brought into the visible Church, and that is, <hi>the washing of the newe birth</hi> or baptisme. Secondly <hi>inward,</hi> whereby we are truely set in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie of Christ, and that is <hi>the renewing of the holy Ghost</hi>; who powreth out plentifully vpon our consciences pure waters to cleanse them both from the guilt and filthinesse of sinne, as after we are to make manifest.</p>
               <p>For the meaning of the former in fewe words to know both why bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is called the <hi>lauer of regeneration,</hi> as also why God is said to <hi>saue vs by it:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Essentiall parts of a sacrament three.</note> we must conceiue that in euerie Sacrament there be three essentiall parts, the absence of any of which destroy the whole: 1. the signe, 2. the thing signified, 3. the analogie betweene them, which is the vnion of them both: the first is some outward and sensible thing: the second in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and spirituall: the third mixt of them both. As in baptisme the <hi>signe</hi> is water, the thing <hi>signified</hi> the blood of Christ: the analogie or v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion standeth in this resemblance, that as the former outwardly washeth the filthinesse of the bodie, so the latter inwardly purgeth the soule from all sinne. By reason of which relation and neere affection betweene the signe and the thing signified, it is vsuall in the Scriptures by an improper, but Sacramentall speach, 1. to call the signe by the name of the thing signified, and contrarily. And thus baptisme is called the <hi>washing of the newe birth,</hi> because it is a <hi>signe, seale, and instrument</hi> of it. Secondly, to ascribe that to the signe which is proper to the thing signified, and so baptisme is here said <hi>to saue,</hi> as also 1. Pet. 3.21. which is indeede the proprietie of the blood of Christ, 1. Ioh. 1.7. but by the neere affinitie of these two in the Sacrament it is said so to doe, to note vnto vs, 1. not to conceiue of the Sacramentall elements as bare and naked signes, so to growe into the contempt of them. 2. as vve may not conceiue them i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle signes, so neither idoll signes, by insisting in them as though they vvere the vvhole Sacrament: for they are but outvvard, vvhereas the principall matter of a Sacrament is spirituall and invvard. 3. that then we trueliest conceiue of a Sacrament, when by looking at the one of these we see both; neither making the signe a vaine symbole, nor yet ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing any thing to it transcending the nature of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> such as are the peculiars and prerogatiues of God: but in the signe and action, which is outward be led to those which are spiritual and inward.<note place="margin">The Lord in baptisme not onely offereth but exhibiteth grace.</note>

               <p>But the doctrine will remaine obscure, if we shall not open two points before we come to make vse of it. 1. how, 2. to whom baptisme is the lauer of regeneration. For the former therefore, 1. how it is not. 2. how it is.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Concil. Triden. sess. 7. can. 8. si quis dixerit per ipsa novae legis sacramenta ex opere operato non conferri gratiam, &amp;c.</note>First, this effect is not ascribed to the worke wrought, as the Popish doctrine teacheth. 2. Neither by any extraordinarie eleuation of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby it is made able to conferre the benefit of renouation: for this were both to make euery baptisme a kinde of miracle; as also to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach vpon the clause following, wherein the worke of renewing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to the holy Ghost. 3. Neither that the waters of baptisme haue in themselues any inherent power or force to wash the conscience, as to wash the filth of the bodie: they wrong conceiue it that shut vp any such power in it, as is in a physicall instrument, as thogh it as properly washed, as an hearb healeth if applyed. 4. Neither because grace is tied by any promise, or meanes vnto the action, so as God who is most free in his gifts cannot either otherwise distribute,<note place="margin">Grace not tied <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For 1. grace is not tied to the word, therefore not to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the Sacrament. 2. They were separate in the first and greatest minister of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> baptisme Iohn himselfe, who confessed that he indeede baptized with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> water, but it belonged to him that came after him to giue the grace. 3. If these opinions were true or any of them, then should euerie baptized partie be truely regenerate; the contrarie whereof appeareth in Simon Magus, in many manifest wicked ones, and close hypocrites in all ages. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The falshood appeareth, in that some are iustified before baptisme, as Abraham was, <hi>before he receiued the seale of circumcision:</hi> Cornelius, Act. 10.47. the Eunuch,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.10.</note> Act. 8.37, 38. some after baptisme, as num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who are daily conuerted, some out of Poperie, some out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanenes: Yea, whereas onely two sorts of persons were baptized, either <hi>infants,</hi> or <hi>men of yeares:</hi> in the latter was faith euer required before their baptisme: so Phillip to the Eunuch, <hi>If thou beleeuest with all thy heart, thou maist.</hi> And for infants, if they be of belee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This opinion of tying grace <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> to the Sacrament, ouerthroweth, 1. the highest and most proper cause of our saluation, which is Gods free election to which onely grace is tyed.
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:18792:329"/>
2. the only meritorious cause of our regeneration, which is the blood of Christ properly purging vs from all sinne. 3. the most powerfull, next, and applying efficient, which is the holy Ghost<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to whome our renewing is here ascribed, and not to the Sacrament of Baptisme in this our first sense.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how is baptisme then the lauer of regeneration?<note place="margin">Baptisme how the laver of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation.</note> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> In diuerse regards. 1. As it is an institution of God signifying the good pleasure of God for the pardoning of sinne, and accepting to grace in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Christ: for as the word signifieth this, so doth also the Sacrament which is a visible word. And thus is it truely said of the word and Sacraments too, that <hi>they saue and sanctifie,</hi> because they signifie the good pleasure of God in sauing and sanctifying vs: euen as we say a man is saued by the kings pardon, not that the pardon properly doth it; for that is the meere mercifull disposition of the King, but because the pardon (written and sealed perhaps by an other) signed by the king, is the ordinarie instrument to manifest the mercifull minde of the king in pardoning such a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. 2. As it is a seale or pledge of our sanctification and saluation, as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> certenly assuring these to the soule of the beleeuer, as he is or can be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of the other: that as a man hauing a bond of a thousand pound sealed him, may truely say of it, here is my thousand pound, that is, a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, as surely confirming it vnto me, as if I had it in my hands, or as I haue this: euen so may the beleeuing partie baptized say of his baptisme, here is my regeneration, here is my saluation. 3. As it is a meanes to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> excite and prouoke the faith of the receiuer to lay hold vpon the grace of the Sacrament, and apply it to these purposes: in which regard it may be as truely said <hi>to renewe,</hi> as faith is said to <hi>iustifie</hi>; and that is onely as it is a meanes or hand to lay hold on Christ our righteousnesse: so Baptisme is a meanes helping forward our renewing, by the true vnderstanding and conscionable and serious meditation of it. 4. In that in the right vse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of it, it giueth and exhibiteth Christ and all his merits to the fit receiuer: for then Gods grace putteth forth it selfe, and after a sort convaieth it selfe, in and by this instrument into the heart of the worthie receiuer. And thus principally it is the lauer of regeneration; because in it and by it as a meane and organe, the holy Ghost freely worketh his grace in such as in whome he delighteth: and thus are we fitly lead to the second point propounded concerning these persons.</p>
               <p>The second point, namely the consideration of the persons to whome baptisme is the washing of the newe birth, will more cleare this difficult point: for we must not conceiue it thus in euery partie baptized, but in such as haue the gift of faith to receiue the grace offred: Ioh. 1.12. <hi>so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as receiued him, he gaue them power, &amp;c.</hi> Eph. 5.27. clensed with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Aug. in Iohan.</note> It is not then the washing of the bodie with water, but the receiuing and applying of the promise by faith, which brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth grace into the soule, without which faith both word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are vnprofitable. This Christ we knowe required in baptisme, <hi>he that beleeueth and is baptized shall be saued.</hi> The Apostle in the supper requireth a <hi>worthie</hi> receiuing; and who can denie but if grace be confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Sacrament, it must be receiued also: and if it must be receiued I would knowe how any thing which is spirituall can be receiued but by this hand of the soule.<note place="margin">Ruccella Iudae venenum fuit non quod ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, sed quia ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus male acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit.

And what mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell if vnto vngodly ones the Sacrament he as an emptie boxe, without oyntment, or as a dead letter without spirit? for nothing is promised them in the word, seeing all the promises goe with condition of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which they want: and can we meruaile if the seale doe him no good that hath no name, no right in the couenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But howsoeuer in men of yeares faith is required vnto bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, yet we are most to respect it as administred vnto children in whom we cannot expect faith, and therefore vnto them either faith is not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, or by the former answer their baptisme is vnprofitable. <hi>Answ.</hi> This well is deepe, and we want wherewith to drawe certentie of resolution: but will assay in some propositions to deliuer summarily that which may be extracted out of the Scriptures and expositors, as most probable for the vnfolding of this difficultie. To which purpose let vs first distinguish of infants; of whom some are elected, and some belong not vnto the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of grace. These latter receiue onely the element, and are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly washed: the former receiue in the right vse of the Sacrament the inward grace; not that hereby we tie the maiestie of God to any time or meanes, whose spirit bloweth when and where he listeth; on some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore baptisme, who are sanctified from the wombe; on some after: but because the Lord delighteth to present himselfe gracious in his own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, we may conceiue that in the right vse of this Sacrament, he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily accompanieth it with his grace: here according to his promise we may expect it, and here we may and ought send out the prayer of faith for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="643" facs="tcp:18792:330"/>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But they want faith? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. They want indeede actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith, which presupposeth hearing, vnderstanding,<note place="margin">Faith of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants what.</note> &amp;c. neither could it be that if they had at that time such an habituall faith, that they should so vtterly loose it, as neuer after to make shew of it, vnlesse it be attained <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> by newe instruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they want not all faith, Christ himselfe reckoneth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong beleeuers, Matth. 18.6. whosoeuer offendeth one of these little <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ones which <hi>beleeue in me:</hi> in which respect circumcision which was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred to infants, was called a <hi>seale of faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas some diuines thinke that this faith of theirs is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> then the faith of the parents: the truth is, that the faith of the parents is so farre theirs, as that it giueth them right to the couenant: for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant is made to Abraham and his seede, and to the faithfull and their seede: and the beleeuing parent also laieth hold on the couenant for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his seede, thereby intitling his child to the right of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as well as himselfe: euen as in temporall things he can purchase land for himselfe and his heires.

And not only the Scriptures, but that auncient and common distinction of baptisme 1. into that of water, 2. holy Ghost, 3. martyrdome, seemeth to him that well considereth to giue some ground of it.

               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Ministers must deliuer this doctrine plainly, and not as we may obserue some, who either not vnderstanding it, or not willing that others should vnderstand them; generally tie a certaine grace to this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of baptisme, but not explaning these two points, how, and to whome; leaue their hearers laid open to many dangerous errors: of which I will giue some examples. 1. To conceiue of an absolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of baptisme, and hence cruelly and impiously denie vnto Infants dying without it, the saluation. But we must beware of running backe into this point of Poperie, which at this day thrusteth the soules of such babes into <hi>a place</hi> very neere hell,<note place="margin">Limbus puero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> and their bodies out of Christian bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall (as they call it) into an vnhallowed place: and conceiue aright of the point thus. As for inward baptisme which is to be within the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and regenerated; to hold it absolutely necessarie vnto saluation: Ioh. 3.5. <hi>Except a man be borne againe of the water and the Spirit, he can not enter into the kingdome of heauen:</hi> but as for outward baptisme the seale of the former, to hold it necessarie but accidentally, as 1. in regard of Gods commandement, 2. of our owne weaknes, 3. to auoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and appearance of neglect, or contempt of so holy an ordinance: but
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:18792:331"/>
to hold it so necessarie, as that he that steppeth not ouer this threshold can neuer get into heauen, is directly both against the grace of God in the Scriptures; which affirme the children of the faithfull to be holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to this baptisme: as also the examples, of children dead before the eight day, the day of their circumcision; of men and children for the space of fourtie yeares wanting circumcision in the wildernes; of Dauids child dying before the eight day, the damnation of which he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not; of the thiefe on the crosse, who wanted the outward baptisme, although not the inward. Surely our Sauiour Christ where he had good occasion, maketh no such necessitie of it: <hi>He that beleeueth and is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, shall be saued</hi>; but marke in the opposition he saith not, <hi>he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth not,</hi> and is not baptized, <hi>shall be condemned:</hi> but that we should not conceiue of such a needles necessitie, he purposely leaueth out the latter clause of the former sentence, onely affirming that he that <hi>belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not</hi> shall be condemned. And what an vnequall thing were it, that if parents should neglect to bring children seasonably vnto baptisme, that the child not offending should for the parents fault be condemned?

               <p n="3">3. From the misconceit of this doctrine, and the extolling the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke of baptisme, the which imposters and deceiuers of mindes haue still delighted to dwell in, hath sprung vp that dangerous error of baptizing by women; as also the priuate nimbling vp of the matter in corners by some Priest or minister. Whereas for the person we know
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:18792:332"/>
that the Minister in his ministerial actions sustaineth the person of Christ, which a woman cannot doe.<note place="margin">No woman a fit minister of baptisme.</note> Againe, those that are called to baptize, are called also to preach, for the Sacrament without the word is a dumb ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie, and as a seale to a blanke.

If any woman haue beene accessarie to this grieuous sinne, let her seriously and seasonably humble her selfe for it, in that without, yea and against the commandement of God, shee hath polluted such a sacred ordinance. If any man should set the Kings broad seale to any instrument but the Lord-keeper, his fact were no lesse then high treason; and shall we think there is lesse danger in counterfaiting the great seales of Gods couenant?

               <p>Fourthly, from the doubtfull deliuerie of this doctrine ariseth an other error and opinion of falling from grace (for marke the man that stagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the former, he will be nibling and fumbling at all these as far as he dare) for if euery child receiue grace as a thing tied vnto baptisme, what becommeth of that grace when children growing in yeares, growe also extreamely flagitious and wicked?<note place="margin">Falling from the grace of baptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Lastly, as all error is fruitfull, so hence also is grounded that fancie of Popish penance, which they make a Sacrament to restore such by as are fallen from the grace of their baptisme: and a second table to saue such, as by vertue of their first couenant cannot be restored; as though the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God were <hi>not eternall</hi> and vnchangeable, or as if God married vs not <hi>to himselfe for euer:</hi>

What a comfort is it for a father to see his child washed with the blood of Iesus Christ? cleansed from sinne? set in to the visible Church, yea, into the bodie of Christ, in the right vse of this Sacrament? wherein a parent ought more to reioyce then if he could make it the heire of the world. 2. diligently vpon the occasion of their childrens baptisme to examine themselues, whether they be in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with God or no, that so their children may be entred into the same couenant: yea and seeing their often faylings with God, to enter now a newe league, and renew their couenant with him, by renewing their faith, by making vp againe through true repentance their former brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: yea by solemne prayer and invocation to vrge the Lord to call to minde his couenant made to the iust and their seede, and make it good vnto himselfe and his child now to be entred into the Church. But what a generall fault of Parents is it, to content themselues in bringing their children, that the outward worke may be performed vpon them, spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no small time in circumstances of solemnitie, as costly banquets and feasting (which in moderation I condemne not) but take little or no time in preparing themselues and their children to the receiuing of the inward grace of baptisme? which great error is worthy reformation in the most, in the best.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 3. To the congregation, that seeing this is such a solemne ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as wherein the Lord signifieth, sealeth,<note place="margin">The congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought not to depart from baptisme. Reas.</note> and exhibiteth sauing grace to euery worthie receiuer: that therefore euerie on in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation continue together vntill the ende of the Sacrament, and not runne out as the manner of most is. For 1. it is an ordinance not belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> only to the infants, parents and sureties (who are often left in a manner alone with the Minister) but to all the congregation: seeing Baptisme is a receiuing of a member into the congregation, and in this regard meete to be done by the whole. 2. Euery one ought to tarrie to helpe the congregation in prayer for the infant, and to ioyne in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> praise of God for the ingrafting in of another member into the bodie of
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:18792:333"/>
Christ. 3. Euery one ought to helpe himselfe both in calling to minde his owne baptisme, his promise, and ingrafting into Christ; as also to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> examine what fruit he reapeth of the death and resurrection of Christ into which he is set, and so to be either humbled or thankfull, as he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> his estate. 4. Lastly, how much so euer vsed, yet is it a most vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent part towards this ordinance: what an vngodly contempt were it to runne out from hearing the word: and why is it not also in running from the Sacrament, which is the seale of that couenant? as if men were loath to be present where the blessed Trinitie presenteth it selfe to such a gratious purpose as this is, namely to seale such benefits to one of that congregation. And more, it is a disordered thing: for the good of the Church requireth that the Congregation should come in together, and goe out together: wherein the Lord is so strait that the King might not depart till all was ended: Ezek. 46.10. <hi>He shall goe in when they goe in, and when they goe forth, they shall goe forth together.</hi> Let euery man make more conscience of this dutie hereafter, and seeing Christ himselfe dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth not to come to Iohns baptisme; let vs take heede of running from Christs.</p>
               <q>And the renewing of the holy Ghost,]</q>
               <p>Now we come to speake of the inward means of our saluation, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Lord setteth vs into this new condition, here called the <hi>renewing of the holy Ghost:</hi> wherein to vnderstand it better, we will consider two points: 1. what this renewing is. 2. why it is called the renewing of the holy Ghost: and so come to the instructions.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Regeneration what.</note>For the former. It is a grace of God, whereby the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in beleeuers, is by the power of the holy Ghost daily renewed vnto the image of God. I say, 1. it is <hi>a grace of God:</hi> 1. Pet. 1.3. <hi>Who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to his abundant mercie hath begotten vs to a liuely hope.</hi> 2. by <hi>which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the corruption of nature:</hi> which is the proper obiect of it, called in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the <hi>flesh,</hi> the <hi>old man:</hi> not the substance of bodie or soule, which were not decaied or perished; but the corrupt qualities, which by the fall tooke place in them. 3. <hi>is renewed:</hi> this is a word of relation, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to that olde corruption drawne from the old Adam: for so is the new birth by the spirit, opposed to that old natiuitie which is of the flesh, Ioh. 3. Againe, the word importeth a compleat worke vpon the whole subiect: for as in the birth of a child, not one or moe parts and members, but the whole child is borne; so in the new birth, the whole man must be borne againe, the whole man must be a <hi>new creature:</hi> in which is not the framing of something out of something but of something out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: For if the Popish doctrine were true, that there were some power in nature, whereby (the holy Ghost a little freeing it) it could of it selfe
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:18792:333"/>
will and performe that which is truly good; then were man but in part new, and so could not be called a new man, a new creature, or be said to be borne againe; neither raised vp from the death of trespasses &amp; sinnes, but reuiued and recouered as out of a swoone or some desperate disease; nor renewed, but a little repaired and mended. But because the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of nature is gone ouer the whole man, as we haue a little before heard: so this renewing must be in the whole man, and in the same order. 1. It must begin <hi>in the spirit of the minde,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> Rom. 12.2. the first worke in this new creation also must be to make the light to banish the darknes and blindnes of <hi>minde</hi>; vnder which are comprehended the vnderstanding, will, and affections. 2. It must proceede to the outward man and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, that euen the members of the bodie may become the members of Christ, and obedient vnto the law of the mind renewed; and so the whole may become a liuely, reasonable, and acceptable sacrifice vnto God. In these two standeth the renewing of the whole man, required 1. Thess. 5. The God of peace sanctifie <hi>you throughout:</hi> and I pray God your whole <hi>soule, bodie, and spirit be kept blameablesse:</hi> where is mention of the <hi>spirit,</hi> as the very soule and life of a renewed person, and is no other then the grace of sanctification, opposed to the corruption of nature, which is seated both in soule and bodie. 4. I adde, <hi>In beleeuers,</hi> because regeneration is the vndeuided and inseparable companion of faith, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is called the <hi>faith of the elect,</hi> as we haue heard: 2. Thess. 2.13. <hi>Chosen you to saluation through the sanctification of the spirit, and the faith of truth:</hi> whence it followeth, that as faith is not of all, no more is regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; neither is this grace further tied to the Sacrament, then where it meeteth with a faithfull receiuer. 5. I say <hi>daily,</hi> for although the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> be renewed in euery part, yet all is but in part, it is so compleat in the subiect, as that it is yet a continued worke, and not consummate vntill we all meete in the vnitie of the Sonne of God, when that perfect is come: for so long as we are here below, this righteousnes of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed <hi>from faith to faith,</hi> and we are changed <hi>from glorie to glorie,</hi> and we walke <hi>from strength to strength:</hi>

In a word, looke what the image of God was, which was giuen vs by our creation, vnto the same must we be wrought now by the grace of the second couenant; but that stood not
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:18792:334"/>
in the substance of the soule and naturall faculties of it so much; such as vnderstanding, free will, memorie, &amp;c. but 1. in the knowledge and illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of it, Colos. 4.10. <hi>Put on the new man which is renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>; 2. in the righteousnes and integritie of the whole man, Eph. 4.24. Put on the new man, which after God is created <hi>in righteousnes and true holines.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second point in the meaning is, why this is called the renewing of <hi>the holy Ghost. Answ.</hi> Not that it is not wrought as well by the other persons,<note place="margin">Opus ad extra.</note> beeing a worke without themselues: for the Father reneweth as beeing the foundation and fountaine not of the Deitie alone, but of all diuine actions and good things whatsoeuer: and the Son reneweth as the Mediator and meriter of it. But it is here ascribed to the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is the immediate and next applyer of it to the conscience, and therfore is more properly said to renew. And yet wher I say that in regard of the other persons he doth more immediatly applie this grace; it must not be so conceiued, but that he ordinarily doth worke it by meanes, vnto the which also often the Scriptures ascribe the worke of renewing. As 1. the Ministers are his instruments by whome he begetteth men vnto God: so Paul, I haue begotten you by the Gospel, that is ministerially. 2. The word and Sacraments are outward meanes which the Spirit v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to the same purpose: And the word is hence called the <hi>immortall seede of regeneration</hi>; and baptisme called the washing of regeneration in the words before, because the Spirit in these outward meanes washeth and regenerateth. 3. Faith is the inward meanes, which the holy Ghost working and exciting in vs, vseth by it to bring home to our hearts that which properly reneweth vs: Act. 15. <hi>by faith he purifieth our hearts.</hi> Thus we see how both the Father, the Sonne, the Spirit, the ministers, the word and Sacraments, and our owne faith renew vs: and how in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall senses they are to be truly and plainly conceiued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. All the worke of inward grace, in, or out of baptisme, is from the holy Ghost.<note place="margin">All inward grace in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme is from the holy Ghost.</note> The thing that giueth force vnto washing by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is the <hi>renewing of the holy Ghost,</hi> and this is regeneration indeede, 1. Pet. 3.21. <hi>Baptisme saveth, but not the washing of water, but the interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of a good conscience:</hi> that is, the answer of a beleeuing heart, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging these sacraments to be seales and pledges of the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of faith, and that inward baptisme which indeede saueth: Act. 2.38. <hi>Amend your liues, and be baptised euery one in the name of Iesus Christ for remission of sinnes:</hi> but all this will not serue the turne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the promise following be made good; <hi>and ye shall receiue the gift of the holy Ghost:</hi> 1. Cor. 6.11. <hi>Such were ye, but ye are washed, ye are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied ye are sanctified:</hi> but by what meanes, by the waters of baptisme?
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:18792:334"/>
No, they will not serue to iustification or sanctification, but <hi>by the spirit of our God:</hi> and if we would see this truth of both the Sacraments in one place, we haue it propounded, 1. Cor. 12.13. <hi>By one spirit we are all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one bodie:</hi> therefore not the water but the spirit setteth vs into the bodie of Christ by baptisme: and <hi>wee are all made to drinke into one spirit:</hi> and therefore the efficacie of the cuppe in the supper is to be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the spirit of God; which spirit when he withdraweth himselfe, we may truely say of the water in baptisme, as the Apostle speaketh of the <hi>blood of bulls and goates,</hi> that they <hi>cannot take away sinne.</hi> The true materiall cause hereof, is the blood of Christ,<note place="margin">Hebr. 10.4.</note> the holy Ghost inwardly applying it vnto the soule, and so inwardly indeede baptizing and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conscience.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine further ouerthroweth that Popish doctrine, that the water in baptisme carrieth in it a force and efficacie of washing and sanctifying the soule.<note place="margin">Bellarmins in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances to the contrarie refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. De Sacram. lib. 2. c. 4.</note> And as for all those figures which Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine produceth to this purpose, we shall in few words see them conclude directly against himselfe. Out of Gen. 1. <hi>The spirit of God mooued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the waters,</hi> he concludeth, that as the waters concurred necessarily to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the making of all naturall things; so the waters of baptisme necessarily concurreth to the conferring of the grace of regeneration in this second creation. But who seeth not, that these waters were dead without the spirits moouing? and who seeth not, that the spirit it is in baptisme which regenerateth, and not the element, vnlesse a bodily thing could properly worke vpon a spirituall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for that in Gen. 7.17. <hi>The waters bare vp the Arke:</hi> whence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he concludeth, that as the waters had a proper power to saue Noah and his familie, euen so the waters of baptisme properly saue. Besides the generall answer, that similitudes prooue nothing but illustrate; could Bellarmine, if he had looked into the text, so boldly haue detracted from the glorie of God? which saith, that Noah found <hi>grace</hi> in the sight of the Lord, Gen. 6.8. with thee will I stablish my <hi>couenant,</hi> verse 18. that the Lord bad him <hi>goe into the Arke</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap. 7.1. that he shut him in the Arke, 16. that he <hi>remembred him</hi> in the Arke, and brought him out of the Ark, cap. 8.1.16. all is ascribed vnto the grace, couenant, commandement, hand, and remembrance of God, and not to the water: and if Noah had beene saued by the clemencie of the waters, and their power of sauing, Noah was mistaken when he <hi>built an altar to the Lord,</hi> vers. 20. for hee should haue built his altar to the waters. And if we would follow here the Iesuite, we might make him wearie of his comparison: If we should say, 1. that the waters of the flood did for euery person and creature that they saued, drowne a million, therefore the waters of baptisme for one
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:18792:335"/>
they saue, drowne and damne a number, which will not stand with their deuise of <hi>opus operatum.</hi> 2. Noah was found righteous before he entred into the Arke, cap. 7.1. and therefore both children and men of yeares, may be sanctified before baptisme: whence will follow, that children of beleeuers, dying before baptisme, haue right both to the kingdome of heauen, and Christian buriall vpon earth. 3. It is said, Heb. 11.7. <hi>By faith Noah prepared the Arke,</hi> not which saued, but <hi>to the sauing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and his houshold:</hi> and that <hi>by faith,</hi> he was made heire of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; without which faith, neither the waters, nor the Arke had done him any good; and therefore neither without faith do the waters of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme saue or regenerate. Lastly, a poore reason it is of a Cardinal, that because Moses or Noah is saued out of the waters, therefore the waters saue him.</p>
               <p>A third instance is in the waters of Iordan, which (saith he) truly hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Naaman,<note place="margin">2. king. 5.</note> and was no seale of the promise: and euen so the waters of baptisme truly confer grace. But the truth is, that water had no such power of healing of and in it selfe, but only at that time, in that institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and from the word of God; which appeareth euen in Naamans indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who neuer knew any more vertue or power in it then in Arbanah or Pharphar. Againe, Naaman being healed, acknowledged not the vertue from the water, but from God; and therefore professed that he would henceforth neuer worship any other then the God of Israel: and if it be lawfull for any Sophister from euery resemblance to conclude what he pleaseth; why concludeth he nor (for he may aswell) that we must be baptised seauen times ouer, for Naaman must wash seauen times ere he be cleane. In a word, the very scope of this washing in Iordan, directly concludeth against that Popish collection of his: for why doth the Lord command him to goe and wash in Iordan, rather then (as he expected) that the Prophet should lay his hand vpon him, or by a word heale him? Surely, no stronger reason can be giuen then this, that he should not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute any power or vertue of the cure to the Prophets hand, bodie, or person; but seeing he must doe that in which there is no such power at all, but is so vnlikely a meanes of cure, as Naaman almost scornefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected; the whole glorie of the worke might returne to the God of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el. As vnlikely, yea more, that water should wash the leprosie of sinne from the conscience, as the outward leprosie from the bodie of Naaman: and indeede the worke in both is from the spirit of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The like may be said of the poole of Siloam, wherein the blind man must wash:<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.</note> and for that place in the 5. of Iohn, concerning the poole of Bethesda, which healed all manner of diseases, the text saith plainly, that it was the Angels stirring of the water; and without it nothing was done,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:18792:335"/>
and if the power had beene proper and naturall, or inseparably tyed to it, it would haue healed the second and third that had stepped in as well as the first. So we say when the spirit of God mooueth these waters of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, there followeth a cure, without which if a man were euery day baptized, it would be vnavaileable to regeneration and sanctification. Thus not to followe the rest, and wast time in them, we may see that when men willingly blind themselues, it is iust with God to giue them vp to all delusions, that in seeing they might not see, nor vnderstand.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. As to magnifie and reuerence these sanctified waters, as the outward meanes in the right vse of which, the spirit worketh and exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that which they represent: so also to beware least wanting this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worke of the spirit, which giueth all efficacie and comfortable fruit of baptisme, it become not a barren and a naked signe: the rather, in that the Lord himselfe obserued this corruption among his owne people, that they stood too much vpon outward institutions, as the Temple, the law, circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So when we see Christians stand so much vpon outward baptisme, and are well contented without the inward vertue of it: when we see them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in the bare title, without the power of Christianitie; it is our part to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate the Lord and his Prophets, and call our people to get the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision <hi>not made with hands,</hi> but by the finger and spirit of God:<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

So in afflictions and corrections, which are durable and lingring on many, why do men profit so little, why doe they not open the doore of discipline, why are not the roddes of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the tree of life to a number? surely because the spirit boareth not the eare, he teacheth not the right vse of them.</p>

                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But what can I doe withall, if the spirit teach me not? <hi>Answ.</hi> The spirit would not be wanting, if men would come preparedly to be taught. But 1. men come without beleefe and mingle not the word with faith; and so it becommeth vnprofitable: or 2. without repentance, whereas the <hi>humble shall be taught in the way</hi> onely: or 3. without prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the spirit powreth not out these waters of grace, but vpon thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie grounds: or 4. laden with lusts, and then the spirit will not sowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes.

It affoardeth a triall whether a man be in the way of saluation or no;<note place="margin">Notes to trie this secret worke of God in thy selfe.</note> hee that is a new creature is in the way of life. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this is a secret worke of the spirit, and how can we know it. <hi>Answ.</hi> First, thou must be borne againe, to which is required that God become thy <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Father in Christ; the Church thy mother; the word the immortall seed of which thou art begotten; there must be a conception wherein Christ must be formed in thee; a birth wherein by the helpe of Ministers as midwiues thou must be brought into this spirituall world; a desire of the sincere milke of the word drawne out of the two Testaments the brests of the mother: and after a desire of stronger meat to grow stronger by. Now thou art borne vnto God: but what a parable is this to many euen old men, Masters and Teachers and Rulers in Israel, who know no nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie but one of Adam and Eue, no progenie of God and his Church: know no parents but such as beget earthly children vnto naturall life; base borne, sonnes of the earth not knowing any heauenly Father, neither principall nor ministeriall, begetting them to any heauenly life of grace or glorie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, after this birth all old things must passe away, and euery <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thing must become new;<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.10.</note> he that is washed <hi>is all cleane.</hi> And therefore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> there must be, 1. a new light in the minde and vnderstanding, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the things of the spirit of God.<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.4.</note> For as the further <hi>blinding of men,</hi> is a note and brand of a reprobate; so is it a note of one begotten to God, to be <hi>renewed in knowledge,</hi> Col. 3.9. Secondly, there must be a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> newe qualitie in the will, readie to heare the voice of Christ in all things and obey it. The Scripture noteth it a marke of an vngodly wretch, to be further obdurate and <hi>hardened</hi>;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> but he that is borne of God <hi>heareth his words,</hi> Ioh. 8.47. he carrieth a flexible heart vnto the word: and 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Ioh. 2.29. <hi>he that doth righteously is borne of him.</hi> Thirdly, there must be a new conuersation manifesting the workes and fruits of the spirit: a life lead in the practise of raigning sinne, and making shewe of the works <hi>of the flesh,</hi>

Fiftly, there must be meanes vsed to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> preserue all these, as namely, the spirit of prayer and supplication, Zach. 12.10. a child new borne into the world crieth presently, and that which doth not is still borne, or a dead child: and vnder this I comprehend a cheerefulnesse to all the parts of the publike and priuate worshippe of God: whereas the Prophet maketh it a note of a wicked man, that he <hi>calleth not vpon God,</hi> that is he casteth off the whole worship of God. Wouldst thou then finde thy selfe to be a newe creature, finde this change that the clouds of darkenes and ignorance are remooued, that thou hast an heart of flesh, that thou findest an abatement of thy sinnes and lusts, that thou hast heauenly motions, that thou vsest meanes carefully of thy spirituall life; that thou growest by the nourishment of the word, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prayer, reading, conference, and other exercises of godlines and repentance; this is the way of life which thou hast happily found; thou art now much nearer saluation, then when thou first beleeued.</p>

               <p>To come to the right meaning of this verse we must explane fowre things. 1. the gift bestowed, <hi>which,</hi> that is the spirit, as the former words import. 2. the person bestowing him, <hi>he,</hi> that is, God the Father. 3. the measure of the gift, 1. <hi>powred out,</hi> 2. <hi>plentifully,</hi> or shed on vs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly. 4. the person meriting this gift, that is, <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> described here to be <hi>our Sauiour,</hi> through Iesus Christ our Sauiour.</p>
               <p>First, the gift is the spirit, or holy Ghost. <hi>Quest.</hi> How can the spirit be bestowed? <hi>Answ.</hi> In the spirit two things must be considered, 1. his essence and person. 2. his gifts and effects. The former cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, for neither can his essence or person be concluded in the whole frame of heauen and earth, and much lesse in the narrow corners of mans heart, he beeing an infinite God equall with the father and the sonne.

               <p>The second thing is the person bestowing the holy Ghost; <hi>he:</hi> that is, the Father, as ver. 4. who as he is the fountaine of the deitie, so of all good actions and operations, Ioh. 14.26. <hi>But when the comforter shall come whom the Father shall send. Obiect.</hi> But Christ saith, that <hi>he will send the spirit from the Father.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> This maketh no difference in the thing: the spirit proceedeth first from the father, as the first in the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and from the Sonne as from the second in order in the Trinitie; and he onely expresseth this order, when he saith, <hi>whome I will send from the Father:</hi> for when the Father sendeth the holy Ghost, it is by the Sonne, in whom all our good is deriued, but not as by an instrument, but as from a principall efficient with the Father, onely the second in order from the Father.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the measure of the gift is noted. 1. In that he is said to shed or powre him out, he saith not, he gaue, or communicated, or dropped, or showred, but powred him out, which noteth the liberallitie and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the thing conferred, namely, of the graces of the spirit, called by the name of the Spirit himselfe, that we might conceiue of the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse of our God, who seemeth rather to communicate the verie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it selfe of grace,<note place="margin">Graces of gods spirit compared to waters.</note> then the streames and riuers of it. In which Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor note by the way, that the graces of the spirit are here compared to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> waters, which most properly are powred out, and that not vnfitly. For 1. as water washeth the filthinesse of the bodie, so these graces as the pure waters of sanctification wash and cleanse the soule from the corruption <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and sinne of it, Ezek. 36.25. <hi>I will powre cleane water</hi>— 2. water hath a naturall qualitie to extinguish heat, and quench the thirst of man and beast: so onely these waters bring with them refreshing against the hotte wrath of God, which otherwise would prooue a consuming fire: for he that drinketh of this water shall neuer thirst more, that is, he shall neuer <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> wish that grace sooner whereof he shall not drinke to sacietie. 3. water softeneth the earth, and maketh it fruitfull: so these graces of the spirit mollifie the heart, &amp; so fitteth it vnto all good works, which are the fruits of the spirit;<note place="margin">Ier. 17.6.</note> without which we should be as the <hi>heath</hi> in the wildernes, and as a parched land which seeth not when any good commeth.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, in regard of the diuerse kinds of gifts then powred out: as, 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The common gifts of the spirit which all good and bad partake in, were
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:18792:338"/>
in greater abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer before bestowed, such as the gifts of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, outward calling, profession of the truth, common &amp; generall faith. 2. The more especiall gifts of sanctification the which our text most ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth at, as of faith, regeneration, loue, hope, &amp;c. for so the Apostle see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to restraine the graces he speaketh of saying, <hi>on vs</hi> who are renewed by the holy ghost: As both the prophet Ioel, and Peter speaking the same thing seeme to doe: the one mentioning <hi>my seruants, my handmaids</hi>; the other speaking of such as inuocate and call vpon the name of the lord: and to this purpose we might shew what a number were daily conuerted, and how in those dayes the kingdome of God was taken by force. 3. More <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> extraordinarie and miraculous gifts, which were more proper to those times, and in great abundance distributed, are here included; as, the gifts of tongues, of healing diseases, casting out deuils, porphesying, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of death after a sort to take and leaue mens bodies, and sundrie such other, very frequent then, aboue all times before or since.</p>
               <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, these gifts were plentifully powred out in regard of the <hi>persons <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> &amp; people</hi> vpon whom they were conferred: not now vpon some few Iews or handfull of people, as before Christs ascension, but vpon <hi>all flesh,</hi> saith Ioel, 2.28. vpon euerie nation vnder heauen, saith Peter. Now both Iew and Gentile, bond and free, circumcision, vncircumcision, all respect and acceptation of persons remooued, haue equall part and promise in these graces.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in regard of the <hi>meanes,</hi> in which the spirit now conueled <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> these graces, that is, the word, Sacraments, and ministerie of the new Testament, which farre exceeded in glorie all that ministerie that euer was before it. For in former time they sawe in their ministerie things a farre off, in types, shadowes, clouds; but we see the glorie of Christ with open face, all vailes are rent,<note place="margin">Isa 11.9.</note> and the <hi>earth is filled</hi> with the knowledge of God, euen as the waters couer the sea. And to this our Apostle hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, doubtlesse casting his eye vpon that plentifull grace of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which euen in baptisme was, and is conferred vnto beleeuers.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing in the meaning, is the person procuring this abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant grace for vs, and that is <hi>Iesus Christ our Sauiour:</hi> for what good thing soeuer can be deriued from God vnto vs, it must be by a Mediator, and such a one as must be humbled for sinne, and raised from sinne: the former in his death and passion for sinne, the latter in resurrection and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension from sinne: and in both these regards the Lord Christ obtaineth for his Church these graces, 1. as a redeeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> by the merit of his passion. 2. as an intercessor by the efficacie of his requests, which now after his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension he m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="660" facs="tcp:18792:339"/>
will send in my name:</hi> that is, the Father sendeth the Spirit through the Sonne, both as a Mediator, and as an Intercessor: both which workes so soone as he had accomplished, it was no meruaile if the Spirit through such merit of passion, and efficacie of intercession, was so plentifully powred out vpon his bodie the Church; as wee reade accomplished, Act. 2.2.</p>
               <p>

We haue the truth of many types and resemblances, as of the waters running from vnder the threshold of the sanctuarie,<note place="margin">Ezek. 47.</note> still rising to encrease: and of the proceedings of the new Testament, typified in the cloud which at the first appearance was no bigger then a mans hand, but after rise to that greatnesse, as to couer the whole heauens. 3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> If we compare our Church with that of the Iewes, we shall obserue, that the Lord did but droppe and sprinkle these graces here and there vpon a few persons where he pleased; but now hath powred out his Spirit, and opened a fountaine of grace to the house of Iudah and Ierusalem, euen for all true beleeuers. And here that speach of Iohn, 7.39. is verified, <hi>the spirit was not giuen yet, because the Sonne was not yet glorified:</hi> that is, in comparison he was not giuen before, but so sparingly, as in respect of this powring out, he might seeme not to be giuen at all: so also is that place of Peter to be vnderstood:<note place="margin">1.

                  <hi>of which saluation the Prophets haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, searching and prophesying of that grace that should come vnto you</hi>; not that themselues had no consolation of that grace, which by the eie of prophesie they foresawe to light in abundance vpon the Church of the newe Testament, but because in comparison it came to vs, and was not accomplished vnto them. To this purpose Christ himselfe pronounceth blessednesse vpon his hearers, whose eares and eyes heard and saw things which many Kings and Prophets desired to heare and see, but could not.

And thus haue we ministred vnto vs a ground of examination, whether we finde the fruits and worke of these waters vpon vs. When Ioel prophecied of the powring out of this spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, marke what wonderfull effects he foretold should follow: That sons and daughters, seruants, and maids, old and young should prophesie, should see visions, should dreame dreames: and accordingly at the first accomplishment of this prediction, what vnderstanding? what illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? what tongues? what miracles? what conuersion to God fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? sometimes many hundreds, sometimes many thousands wonne at one sermon; and how violently was the kingdome taken?

Looke any way vpon the liues of most men, and we cannot but demurre of the truth of the doctrine. If we obserue in the multitude the high atheisme, contempt of God and his word, his Sabbaths, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Ministers, and his whole worship, if we listen vnto the cursed oaths and imprecations, if we cast our eyes vpon the iniustice, pride, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, hatred, and earthlinesse, which dwelleth euerie where with men: can we now conceiue other, but that the wicked spirit which ruleth in the world of the disobedient, is abundantly powred out, rather then this pure spirit here mentioned? And if we behold the numbers of men who scorne and powre contempt on such as haue receiued the smallest measure of these graces; can we thinke that such abundant grace is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon men on earth, seeing the most seeke vnder the titles of schisme or heresie, to hunt it and banish it from off the face of the earth? Or yet if we further looke vpon men, that make shew of receiuing competencie of these waters, who are yet neuer a whit washed, nor euer a whit the cleaner; they come to Church and heare, they seeme to like good things and walke in ciuill conuersation; but in regard of the soundnesse of their hearts, we wash bricks, or Aethiopians, and loose all our labour: may we not now well aske, where is the abundance of this grace we speake of? Or if we looke at such as haue receiued true grace, howsoeuer the Lord will bring it to something in the ende, yet we can scarse see on them or in them any such abundance, but like strait necked vessels they receiue it but droppe by droppe, although it be powred on them with full buckets.

Thus should euerie man examine his owne heart.</p>

ware of accusing God, but condemne our selues in whom all the fault is, as who refuse and despise so great grace.<note place="margin">We haue great cause to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennes: whereof are 3. maine causes.</note> If any aske how it can come to passe that such excellent grace should be refused. I answer, there are three maine causes of it. 1. ignorance and blindnesse of minde. 2. hardnesse of heart. 3. securitie: which three destitute vs of so abundant grace as is offered. First, we see not, know not, and therefore affect not these gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Ioh. 4.10. <hi>If thou hadst knowne the gift of God, thou wouldst haue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and he would haue giuen thee waters of life.</hi> Water is so necessarie a creature, as nothing can be more dangerously or vncomfortably wanting to the life of man: this euery man seeth by the eye of his sence: and so are much more these spirituall waters of life vnto the heauenly life, which because men cannot discerne with the same eie, they neuer affect, nor thirst after them: whence it commeth to passe,<note place="margin">Tantalus.</note> that (as the Poet in the fable) men stand as it were vp to the chinne in these waters, and yet die for water, euen in the midst of those sweete streames die eternally for want of them. If we want them therefore it is because we thirst not after them: for onely he that <hi>thirsteth</hi> is called to them,<note place="margin">Isa. 55.1.</note> and Christ will giue onely to <hi>him that thirsteth</hi> to drinke of them. Enlarge thy heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, wait vpon the Lord, open thy mouth wide and he will fill it; Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son readie to die for thirst, called vpon the Lord, and the Lord opened a chawbone, and a riuer came gushing out: so if thou seeing the necessitie, and that there is no way but eternall death without these liuing waters, and thirst after the Lord, and call earnestly, he will before thou shalt want euen by miracle abundantly supply thee: but if thou esteemest of grace as a thing thou maist best want, there is good reason thou be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>The second let is <hi>hardnesse of heart,</hi> and worse then the former: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that cannot affect because it knoweth not; this will not though it know, but keepeth the soule drie and barren, without the least droppe of grace: powre a sea of water vpon a rocke, it remaineth a rocke still, neuer a drop sinketh in; and so is it with many a man, he setteth himselfe by yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnder the preacher, he heareth gratious doctrine; but the invinsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hardnes of his heart, suffereth not one droppe of these dewes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to sinke into his soule, but as the light of the sunne shineth onely on the outside of a tree, so doth this sunne of the Church on such a man, but neuer getteth within him.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>let is securitie,</hi> ioyned with extreame neglect of meanes, wherein the spirit vsually conveieth these graces. A man that meaneth to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be rich, will not neglect his calling nor the meanes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now follow the ends, why we are brought into this new condition, which are two. 1. our iustification before God. 2. the purchase of life eternall. In the former are to be considered, 1. what is meant by iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. 2. what by Grace. 3. the doctrines.</p>
               <p>Iustification is the absolution of a sinner from his sinne, and the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shment of it, by the satisfaction of Christ the Redeemer,<note place="margin">Iustification what.</note> apprehended by faith. 1. The <hi>absolving of a sinner:</hi> this the Apostle declareth when he opposeth vnto it accusation and condemnation,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note> 
                  <hi>It is God that iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, who shall condemne</hi>? for seeing a man by nature, and the cursed pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of sinne, is depriued of the glorie of God, and cannot but heape vp wrath against the day of wrath: before euer he can come to a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="666" facs="tcp:18792:342"/>
estate, he must be acquitted necessarily of the guilt and curse of his sinne, both in the high court of heauen, where God is the supreame Iudge, as also in the inferiour court and consistorie of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now if it be asked, how the sinner shall be thus absolued; the rest of the words of the definition declare. For 2. I adde, it is by <hi>the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Christ the Redeemer,</hi> wherein are contained both the matter, and forme of the iustification of a sinner. The <hi>matter,</hi> is Christs satisfaction, his obedience in his life, in his death; in fulfilling the law, and in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for our not fulfilling it; and the merit of all manifested in his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and glorious ascension. The <hi>forme,</hi> is the imputing of that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whereby the righteousnes of Christ doth now become the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers as truly and really by imputation, as it was Christs owne in action. So as it is no legall iustice, which requireth personall obedience in the straitest tearmes of the law; but Euangelicall, whereby the beleeuer sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfieth by the merit of a Mediator, and in the person of a suretie; which satisfaction is accepted, as though it were performed in his owne person. And thus the cure is proportionable to the disease: that looke as by the first Adam sinne went ouer all, who are naturally borne of him, namely by imputation and propagation; euen so by the second Adam iustice and righteousnes is imputed vnto all which are supernaturally borne of him. And 3. I adde, that this satisfaction of Christ, <hi>is apprehended by faith,</hi> the proper worke of which grace is as by an hand to receiue Christ with his merits, and bring him home into the owne heart: whence it is that to beleeue in Christ, and to receiue him, are put for one and the same thing, Ioh. 1.2. it is the mouth of the soule whereby we eate and drinke his flesh and blood, Ioh. 6. yea such a speciall instrument to this purpose, that it is said in sundrie places to iustifie vs, by laying hold on the merits of Christ which properly iustifie: and we by it, though not for it, are said to be righteous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by <hi>Grace</hi> in Scripture, sometime is meant the <hi>gifts of grace,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">What is meant by Grace.</note> any good gift which proceedeth from the fauour and loue of God towards man, whether <hi>priuatiue,</hi> withholding euills deserued, or good things which we would abuse; or els <hi>positiue:</hi> and these either <hi>generall</hi> and more common, as giuen to elect and reprobate, such as the gift of tongues, learning, prophecie, miracles, &amp;c. or more <hi>speciall,</hi> whereby onely they that are to be saued are distinguished. As namely, that first and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall grace of election; and that second grace whereby such as are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and giuen to the Sonne, are in due time by effectuall vocation, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and sanctification, lead vnto glorie and saluation. All these are of his grace,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.10.</note> whome Peter calleth <hi>the God of all grace.</hi> But there is yet another grace of God, which is no gift infused into vs, but resideth in
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:18792:342"/>
God himselfe; which is his free fauour and grace, by which he loueth and accepteth his elect in Christ his beloued: and this is the first, and cause of all other subsequent graces. Which is both to be distinguished from the former, because the Scripture doth alwaies distinguish them in the doctrine of iustification, Rom. 11.6. <hi>If of grace, then not of workes</hi>; and more plainly, chap. 5.15. <hi>much more the</hi> grace <hi>of God,</hi> and the gift by grace hath abounded to many. As also must be applied to this text; not only, 1. because it is the proper sense of the word in all such places as treat of the iustification of a sinner before God: but 2. because the Apostle by mentioning of grace againe, secludeth all that prevision of works for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, which might be motiues vnto God for the bestowing of his grace, that all causes and occasions of the free grace of God out of God might be excluded: and 3. to free the text from that corruption which by Popish doctrine is fastned vpon it.</p>
               <p>For how doth the Papists wind themselues, when they meete with this and such like places, that with them they may hold their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous doctrine of iustification by workes, and humane satisfactions? you shall haue the latter Iesuites affirme the same thing verie confidently with the Apostle, that we are iustified freely by his grace, as though they were of his minde and of ours, and as if no difference were betweene vs in this maine matter (which I dare say if we were agreed in, we should not long dissent in any matter of great moment) but they speake in their owne sence, and retaine a tricke of their mentall reservation, which both destroyeth the text, and ouerthroweth the foundation of religion. For 1. by <hi>Iustification,</hi> they meane not that compleat righteousnesse of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which the Lord imputing vnto vs, accepteth vs in; but a kind of righteousnesse, which God putteth into vs, to make vs iust: which is nothing else but a physicall change of the heart from euill to good, or a motion from iniustice to righteousnesse, at the first imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly begunne, and needeth a second iustification to eke it out. 2. By <hi>Grace,</hi> they meane nothing lesse then this fauour of God in Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting his elect; but certaine gifts of grace bestowed of fauour, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall graces of faith, hope, and charitie, which are daily perfected by the daily exercise of them. And what is this els then to say that we are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified, that is, made iust before God by the inherent righteousnes which he bestoweth vpon vs; the which righteousnes (not of Christ but) of our owne infused into vs (not imputed vnto vs) doth formally iustifie the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>But this evasion, 1. offereth great violence to the text,<note place="margin">A Romish shift auoided.</note> wherein as we haue heard, the Apostle opposeth these two, grace and good workes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as his vsuall manner is in all those places where he handleth this doctrine
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:18792:343"/>
as in the seat of it; and it is to be marked, that what the Apostle here calleth <hi>grace,</hi> he giueth three titles vnto it in the former verse: all of them without our selues, and peculiar vnto God himselfe: 1. bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, 2. loue, 3. mercie: and not only this place, but sundrie such paralel places shew plainely, that by grace cannot be meant any thing infused into vs, but only a free fauour in God accepting vs as righteous: 2. Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath saued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not according to our workes,</hi> (marke by the way that exclusiue) <hi>but according to his owne purpose</hi> and grace <hi>giuen vs</hi>; but when? <hi>before the world was.</hi> Let now any man of common sence say, whether this grace whereby we are saued, be any gift of grace infused vnto vs, vnlesse it could be infused before the world was, or we were in it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this conceit confoundeth two distinct things, namely, our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>iustification,</hi> and <hi>sanctification:</hi> which the Apostle distinguisheth, 1. Cor. 6.11. and Rom. 5. are noted two things which befell vs by Adams sinne, 1. the guilt of that sinne. 2. the natiue corruption or pronenesse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensitie to any other sinne, as a iust punishment of the former: and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he distinctly noteth two things, that by the second Adam are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored vnto vs: the former is freedome and absolution from that guilt, which is our iustification before God: and the latter is the repairing of Gods image, which is called regeneration, which is here imperfect, but shall be hereafter raised to that legall righteousnesse from whence we fel: implying vnto vs, that as we must retaine the distinction betweene the guilt and corruption of sinne, so also must we betweene the freedome from the one &amp; the other: which this popish interpreattion confoundeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this interpretation of the phrase by the Romish teachers, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the iustification of a sinner faile against those two maine rules which in Scripture are ascribed vnto it. 1. whereas the <hi>righteousnesse of God is made manifest without the law,</hi> Rom. 3.21. this shall be false, for the law reuealeth that righteousnes which is by inherent qualities, gifts, of grace, or the habit of loue. 2. whereas the iustification of a sinner, is by a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which satisfieth the iustice of God: such a righteousnesse as this cannot doe so: for our best inherent righteousnesse is mingled with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, is verie imperfect, farre from that which the lawe requireth, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> from that which God accepteth; who neuer accepteth but such as bring perfect righteousnesse, either of their owne, or of the Mediators. All which I haue propounded for the right interpretation of this phrase, because it nippeth in the head all that Popish deuise of iustification by workes, so derogatorie to this Apostolicall iustification by grace, as they can no sooner be reconciled, then can fire and water, light and darknesse: and that abandoning such tricks of mens braines, we might come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:18792:343"/>
the truth of this fundamentall doctrine, as the Scriptures haue taught vs to conceiue of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> The righteousnesse of a sinner before God,<note place="margin">The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of a sinner before God is no qualitie in the beleeuer.</note> is not any qualitie in the beleeuer, but that which the Lord imputeth and accepteth through his sonne. For, 1. the Apostle here speaking of renewing of beleeuers inwardly and in truth, yet ascribeth not their righteousnesse thereto, but attributeth it wholly vnto grace. And if we speake of the righteousnesse <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of a sinner before God, regeneration is indeede a companion of it, but no part of it: besides, he saith not we are iustified by grace, but by <hi>his grace</hi>;<note place="margin">Gratia iustifica<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in solo deo subiective, in nobis obiectivè tantum in est.</note> which is euen his gracious accepting of vs in his Sonne, and not for those graces which he worketh in vs, which are <hi>ours</hi> after he hath once giuen them. 2. Whereas the Apostle, Rom. 1.7. saith, that by the Gospel the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>righteousnesse of God is reuealed,</hi> by this righteousnesse cannot be meant that iustice of his, whereby he satisfieth himselfe against sinne: for that is more manifest in the law, &amp; the Gospel is a kind of mitigation of it: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any righteousnes, though of God in man, which properly is not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the righteousnesse of God being imperfect, in part, and mingled with much staine of sinne: &amp; therefore necessarily must be meant of that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes which himselfe imputeth &amp; accepteth a sinner perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in; which is able to acquit him before the barre of his iudgement, as no qualitie in the beleeuer is able to do. 3. This Euangelicall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> which fully acquitteth vs before God, is opposed to our owne best righteousnesse: Philip. 3.9. <hi>not hauing mine owne righteousnesse, which is by the lawe, but that which is by faith in Christ:</hi> which place is worthie our further opening, as a notable decider of this maine controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our aduersaries and vs. In which it is plaine, that the Apostle speaketh of two kinds of righteousnesse: the one which is a mans owne, <hi>not hauing mine owne:</hi> the other which is an others, and that is Gods, or Christs. The former, he calleth the righteousnesse <hi>of the lawe,</hi> namely, whereby a man through obseruation of the lawe is accounted righteous: and in this Paul would <hi>not be found:</hi> not that he would not be found fruitfull in good workes, but he would not be iudged by them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in comparison of the lawes puritie and perfection a stained clout. The latter, in which Paul would be found that he might finde acceptation in the sight of God, is not his owne but an others. 2. not obtained by any works, not excepting the best: but apprehended by faith, which cannot be said to lay hold on any thing within vs, but something which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vs. 3. it is <hi>of God</hi> through faith, that is, such a one as God freely through his Christ giueth vs, and maketh ours, not by putting it into vs, as other graces, but by imputing it vnto vs, and by this meanes acquitting vs: and 2. of such a person, that is God as well as man, seeing otherwise
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:18792:344"/>
euery man is depriued of the glorie of God. These two the Apostle eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where so opposeth, that whosoeuer cleaueth to the one falleth from the other, and whosoeuer will be iustified by the righteousnesse of the lawe, is abolished from Christ: which must not be so conceiued, as that they are not most friendly and necessarily knit in the same iustified partie; but that in the act of iustification, they can no more agree together to the presenting of a sinner righteous before God, then can the most contrary things in nature be accorded in the same naturall subiect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But the Papists cannot endure the word <hi>imputation,</hi> or that one should stand righteous by anothers righteousnesse, no more then one can be learned by another mans learning. <hi>Answ.</hi> What blindnesse is come on them that cannot endure the Scriptures phrase; Psal. 32.1. <hi>blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sinne</hi>; 2. Cor. 5.19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world vnto himselfe,</hi> not imputing <hi>their sinnes vnto them:</hi> and the phrase of not imputing sinne, and imputing of righteousnesse is repeated in Romans 4. tenne times; so as they must needs be strangers in the Scriptures to whom it soundeth strangely. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, although there be in men who are singular persons, proprietie of learning, wisedome, and gifts; yet there is a common righteousnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and the beleeuer; who now are not two, but one flesh, bone, and bodie. Neither need it seeme so strange as they make it, for the Lord to impute vnto a man that which is not his owne: for we say that nothing is imputed to vs, but that which is our owne: but a thing is ours two waies, 1. by infusion, inherence, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus was he who knew no sinne made sinne for vs, that we might be the righteousnes of God in him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But this is against the Scripture, which saith that God will not <hi>iustifie the sinner,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod 32.33. Rom. 5.19.</note> that is, account him iust, who is not so; and Paul saith, that we are <hi>made iust,</hi> and therefore not reputed only. <hi>Ans.</hi> The Scripture saith also, Rom. 4.5. <hi>That God iustifieth the vngodly:</hi> and therefore this is to picke a quarrell at the Scriptures themselues ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then at our doctrine. The truth is, that God iustifieth not the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked while he is so, while he is considered in himselfe, while he wanteth both inherent and imputed righteousnesse: but this hindreth not, but that after such a one is changed and set into Christ, who is made his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, both he is accounted as he is indeede righteous in the sight of God. As for that of Paul, saying that <hi>many are</hi> MADE <hi>righteous,</hi> the
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:18792:344"/>
next words loose the knot, namely, <hi>by the obedienc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of one</hi>; that is of Christ imputed vnto vs. Neither can that which they say that by this our doctrine a man shall be both a godly and vngodly, a iust and vniust per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; any way cloud &amp; vail this truth to an vnderstanding acquainted with the Scriptures: for why may we not grant what they say as true in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse respect? seeing the beleeuer is by nature the child of wrath, by the grace of regeneration renewed indeed but in part: and yet by the gift of Christs righteousnes, of whom he is a member, perfectly iust in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Hence we learne, how to conceiue such texts as wherein some infused grace is said to iustifie vs, as faith is often said so to doe: but not for the worke, nor the worthines of it; but only as it is a means apprehending this righteousnesse and grace of God mentioned which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed iustifieth.

Where our iustification is ascribed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent grace and workes of righteousnesse; as where Abraham is said to be <hi>iustified by workes</hi>; such places cannot be meant of the iustification of the <hi>person himselfe</hi> before God, but of the <hi>faith of the person</hi> before men: for if any worke iustifie before God, of necessitie it must bee a perfect worke, and proceede from a person perfectly iustified and sanct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If it be said, the difference is not so great as you make it; I answer, that we differ not in circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but in such a fundamentall point, as if the Apostle may be iudge, one of vs must needes be fallen from Christ, and haue no part in him: what then will it availe to professe the articles of faith, and to be the Church of God? vnl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now whereas children are either <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall</hi> or <hi>adopted,</hi> our title to this inheritance commeth in by the grace of adoption, seeing Christ is the onely naturall sonne as we confesse in our Creed; and the phrase of the text is obseruable, which saith, we are <hi>made</hi> heires, but not so borne: so as this inheritance belongeth properly vnto Christ the naturall sonne, the heire, and first borne of many brethren: and consequently through him communicated vnto vs, who are sonnes by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption: Ioh. 1.12. <hi>whosoeuer receiued him, to them he gaue power,</hi> that
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:18792:345"/>
is, right, title, prerogatiue, <hi>to be the sonnes of God.</hi> Now if we would distinctly knowe the manner and meanes of our title, in a word this it is: All the right of our sonneship is by Christ, for the foundation of it is Gods loue embracing men in his beloued,<note place="margin">The ciuill law accounteth the heire, and him that so maketh him but one &amp; the same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> who beeing the naturall sonne of God, must become our brother by taking our flesh, that therein we beeing vnited vnto him, might also after a sort be vnited vnto the Father, and the blessed spirit: the which vnion, because it could neuer be knit so long as our sinnes were in sight, necessarily in our flesh must the Sonne of God giue himselfe vp vnto the death to satisfie the iustice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to remooue all the guilt and curse of our sinne, and to giue vs belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in him perfect righteousnesse: that thus beeing iustified, we might become heires no otherwise, then if we had beene borne of God himself: and that thus by Iesus Christ beeing set againe into the liberty of sonnes, the inheritance might as certainely belong vnto vs, as it doth to himselfe beeing the naturall Sonne.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how we come to be heires, now if we would knowe of what we are heires, the text telleth vs, of life <hi>eternall:</hi> which what it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it standeth in immediate fellowship and coniunction with God, we are not able to conceiue, for it neuer entred into the heart of man. This we know of it, that beeing the state of the elect with God hereafter, that beleeuers haue a right vnto it, yea and by faith haue entred into some part and degree of it alreadie, hauing receiued as it were a turfe to assure them of the possession of the whole. It is called <hi>life,</hi> which is the most pretious thing a man can desire, farre aboue goods, and lands, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comfort: Satan said, that <hi>skinne for skinne, and all that euer a man hath will he giue for his</hi> (euen naturall) <hi>life.</hi> And <hi>eternall,</hi> Heb. 9.15. <hi>of the eternall inheritance:</hi> 1. Pet. 1.4. <hi>an inheritance which is immortall, vndefiled:</hi> it hath indeede in regard of the godly a beginning, but it hath no ende, for it <hi>fadeth not away,</hi> but is reserued in the heauens: neuer was there such an inheritance vpon earth; for as it falleth not by the death of our father as others doe, so it faileth not vs by our owne death, but wee are thereby rather put into more full state of it. And because if it were an vncomfortable life, the continuance of it were the greatest miserie of it, therefore elsewhere the Scripture calleth it <hi>Paradise,</hi> a place of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and pleasure, yea where the Saints enioy fulnes of pleasures at Gods right hand, alluding to that Paradise planted by Gods own hand, to make it a delight for the innocent estate of man. And <hi>Abrahams bosome,</hi> wherein the Saints receiue refreshing: which is a borrowed speach, taken from fathers, whom as they carrying and cherishing their little ones in their bosome: euen so the elect freed from the miseries of the world, are cherished as in the bosome of the father of all the faithfull. And the <hi>ioy
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:18792:346"/>
of the Lord,</hi> into which the faithfull seruant shall enter: And for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of this estate, Paul can scarce tell how to expresse it, but calleth it the <hi>riches of the glorie of the inheritance:</hi>

Pet. 5.4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the present tenure of this inheritance is <hi>by hope:</hi> for our inheritance is not so much set before our bodily eyes, as the eyes of our faith, which is not of things present, but of things to come. And yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be an estate to come, the Lord would not leaue vs without such graces as beeing conuersant about it might serue vs in this life to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our hold and comfort therein: such as are faith, hope, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Now hope signifieth two things, 1. the thing hoped for, Rom. 8.24. <hi>hope which is seene is not hope.</hi> Eph. 1.18. <hi>What is the hope of the calling.</hi> 2. For the gift whereby we hope and expect good things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: and this must of necessitie here be meant, because <hi>life eternall</hi> of which we haue spoken, is the thing hoped for. This grace hath the Lord for our incouragement and comfort in and for the state of this life onely put into the hearts of his elect, that they might hereby haue a certaine hold and expectation of all that good which God of his mercie through the merit of his Christ hath promised: the which shall cease when they come once to see that which they now hope for: seeing hereafter can be no hope, not in heauen, for the godly shall enioye all blessednesse their hearts can wish: not in hell, for the damned can neuer hope for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> The blessed condition which the elect are raysed vnto beeing once absolued from sinne, is, to haue the priuiledges of Gods children, and to become heyres of eternall glorie. This honour haue all his Saints, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he rayseth from the dust and dunghill <hi>to set them among Princes:</hi> and the reason is, because he hath giuen them his Sonne, in with merits for their righteousnesse: he hath giuen them the gift of faith which is the very portall of heauen: and the grace of hope which is as a staffe to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold them vnto the end of their pilgrimage. The doctrine beeing the verie words of the Apostle here and in so many places, we will rather labour in the excellent vse, then in the further proofe of it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Eternal life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance must needs be most free.</note>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. That which the Apostle specially aymeth at, is that heauen is not merited but a free gift: here it is called <hi>eternall life,</hi> which is the <hi>gift of God,</hi> Rom. 6.23. It is called here an inheritance in that the elect are called heyres: it is against the nature of an inheritance to come any way but by free gift: legacies we know are most free without desert,
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:18792:346"/>
without procurement, and what an absurd thing were it for a child to go to his Father to offer to buy his inheritance? it is said here further that we are <hi>made heyres,</hi> that is, adopted, not borne to the inheritance, and therefore it is so much the more free. And lastly, it is here called an <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> inheritance, which if it so, be how can it be merited, beeing so far disproportionable to any thing we can doe. What place in the Scripture can more effectually exclude the merit of life? and yet what part of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall writing is it not most consonant vnto? The Apostle Peter speaking of this inheritance, calleth it the <hi>grace of life,</hi> 1. Pet. 3.7. The Apostle Paul through the whole Epistle to the Galatians opposeth these two, to be heyres by the law, and heyres by promise, and faith whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer are Christs, are <hi>Abrahams children and heyres by promise:</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.29.</note> we who are Gentiles must receiue the inheritance no otherwise then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham did, and thus become Abrahams sonnes, but he was heyre by promise and not by merit, and so must we. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But we are Gentiles, how can we become Abrahams sonnes? <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ was Abrahams sonne, and we beeing in Christ are one with him, and so in him become Abrahams sonnes, and therefore must inherit by promise as he did.

                  <hi>Noah by faith was made heyre of the righteousnesse which is by faith.</hi> Faith in the sonne of God is it which maketh thee the Kings sonne, and free borne: this is the meanes of thy freedome, here commeth in thy title, if thou reliest only vpon the mercie of God in Christ for thy saluation:
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:18792:347"/>
which proper worke of faith casteth out the bondwoman with all her sonnes, who shall not be heyres with the sonnes of the freewoman: for whosoeuer will be iustified in whole or in part by the workes of the law, as Turkes, Iewes, and that Romish Agar with all her obstinate children, are by this one doctrine, if there were no moe in the Scripture disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. By the presence of sanctification of heart, and sanctimonie of life: for as only iustified persons are intitled and written heyres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; so only sanctified persons are iustified. Hence is it that we read this inheritance to be entayled to them, Act. 20.32. <hi>Inheritance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them that are sanctified:</hi> by which note mocking Ismael is cast out, close hypocrites lurking in the bosome of the Church, and open profane Esaus: the childrens bread is not cast to such dogges. Read for this 1. Cor. 6.10.11.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This doctrine teacheth vs to set our hearts vpon this inheritance: a man that hath any possibilitie to befall him cannot keepe his mind, but it will be running after it, insomuch as many wicked children in regard of their patrimonie, will enquire into their fathers yeares, and grow sicke of their mothers: and it is ordinarie that such as looke for windfalls by decease, will be feeding their hearts with their hopes: so should it be with vs, who may without iniurie to our Father, long after our inheritance in heauen: and as wee see men take no content in any part of the earth, no nor in the whole, comparable to that peece or portion which is their owne: euen so should not we suffer our hearts so to wander after earth or earthly things, as that we settle our contentment any where but where our inheritance,<note place="margin">Set thine heart vpon this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase.</note> and our treasure is. The which desire if it filled our hearts, <hi>three</hi> worthy fruits of it would manifest themselues through our liues. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. It would moderate the eagar cares of this life, and would not suffer men to become drudges, or sell themselues as slaues vnto the earth: for he that taketh himselfe to be an heyre of heauen, is well inough proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and cared for alreadie: his father hath left him so well as he need not basely shift for himselfe. 2. It would content the minde with any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> condition. This it was which contented Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, with their continuall pilgrimage vpon earth, because <hi>they looked for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter citie:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hebr. 11.8.9.</note> when as once this tooke vp their hearts, they could cheereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sit themselues downe in their tents, they could dwell in strange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries contentedly, they could receiue the promises a farre off thankfully, they could goe on in obedience to God, what way soeuer he called rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily; and in all this they did not for the present desire a better outward condition, but thought that the best portion which their heauenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther allotted out vnto them. So we see how men expecting reuersions are content for the time to liue bare, and goe neere the wind, and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:18792:347"/>
vp their present wants in hope of that to which they are heyres: they thinke the time of their further enlargement is not farre off, and this helpeth well to put off the present. 3. It would strengthen the heart in induring chastisments and corrections vnder Gods hand, or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from mans; for they know they are heyres indeede, but as yet in their minoritie, and for the time must be put vnder Tutors, and the rodde as well as others: but the time commeth which will bring their lands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their owne hand, and then they shall be at their owne hand, and haue libertie inough, and herewith may the children of God raise their hearts from vnder the heauiest afflictions.</p>

can knowe and apprehend thee, and this will be thy saluation. 2. Gods children beeing such heires, they cannot but in the meane time be well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> prouided for till their patrimonie fall. We know, that great heires in their minoritie are well and honestly maintained; their fathers beeing rich and kinde, will not suffer them to want things fit for them; and what they want in the purse they haue in their education: and if they be any way scanted for the present, they shall afterward find it with much aduantage. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. In any want thou beeing thy fathers heire, mayst boldly repaire to thy Father, with good hope to speede in any request which he seeth fit for thee, and making for thy good; and he will be so farre from sending thee away emptie, that it will be his ioy that thou canst discerne and make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest for things good for thee: this wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whatsoeuer losse may befall thee, beeing the child of God thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest not thine inheritance. Thou maist loose thy libertie, thy living, thy friends, thy life, but thine inheritance is reserued in the heauens: thou shalt cease sooner to be a man, then an heire: yea when other by death loose all, thou shalt by it be entred into thy full estate. This expectation of a durable substance caused the Saints to endure with ioy the spoyling <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of their goods, Heb. 10.34. 5. In the enduring of afflictions comfort thy selfe herein, thy Father may frowne, chide, buffet and scourge thee, but he will neuer disinherit thee. Other fathers sometimes out of their owne displeasure, and sometimes out of their sonnes misdemeanours doe disinherit their heires, but the Lord cannot growe into such displeasure with his children, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now of the tenure by which we hold life eternall, namely of hope, I haue spoken twise before in this Epistle at large, chap. 1.2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.13. to which the reader may looke backe: onely in a word note, that it is a mark of a man set into this new condition, to hope and wait for the blessed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in heauen: 2. Cor. 5.2. <hi>We sigh, desiring to be clothed with our house from heauen:</hi> 2. Tim. 4.8. the description of the godly, to be <hi>those that loue the appearing of Christ.</hi> And if all creatures groane with vs for the time of their deliuerance, how ought we much more for whom such things are prepared. Hence it followeth, 1. that it will not stand with a conuerted heart to linger after the things of this life, or to make his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon earth, or to haue equall affection to earth as heauen. 2. nor to neglect the meanes whereby this hope is confirmed: whether outward offring, as the Gospel, ministerie, word, Sacraments; or inward recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:18792:348"/>
as faith vnfained working in obedience.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Ver. 8.</hi> This is a faithfull saying, and these things I will thou shouldst affirme, that they which haue beleeued in God might be carefull to shew forth good workes.</q>
               <p>The first words of this verse beeing as it were a finger pointing to some excellent matter, some take to be a preface making way and win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning attention to the sequel of the verse: others thinke it to be an <hi>epipho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nema,</hi> or graue shutting vp of that matter which immediately goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; as giuing consent and acclamation vnto the most weightie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie doctrine of free iustification by the grace of God in Christ: which doctrine because the Apostle by the spirit of prophesie did foresee, would be most strongly opposed, he purposely by a vehement asseueration strengtheneth: as also the doctrine of Christian hope, which although it be not of things seene, yet is it of things so faithfull and firme in respect of the promise, as the Christian soule may without wauering and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, relie and leane it selfe vpon the faithfull accomplishment of it. But I take it, the words may not vnfitly be referred to the whole doctrine propounded both before and after, there beeing the same scope of both: for what new thing is the Apostle to teach which he had not taught and vrged before? and what particular is expressed in the verse, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly hath not beene deliuered to young and old, men and women, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and other; all which estates after their conuersion vnto the faith, are in speciall called to <hi>readines in euerie good worke,</hi> vers. 1. and to what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ende are those large descriptions of our twofold estate, but to strike on the same string, that howsoeuer we could not in the former attaine to any fruitfull conuersation; yet now in the latter it were a shame not to adorne our profession and calling? and what other end learned we of the appearing of grace, but that vngodlines and wordly lusts beeing denied, we should liue soberly, and righteously, and godly in this present world? So as I say, the Apostle setteth a seale vnto his whole doctrine; that it is true and faithfull, most vndoubted and certaine in it selfe, and most wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of all our credit and faith; seeing nothing can be truelyer spoken, nothing more profitably beleeued, nothing more comfortably practised, then the truth here deliuered vnto vs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But are not other doctrines true and faithfull, yea as true as this? and is not all Scripture of diuine inspiration? <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth our Apostle oppose the truths of Scripture, as though one were more or lesse true then another, but in more necessarie or more questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable truths, he setteth here and there a marke or pointng hand, both to vrge the authoritie and necessitie of the one, and also to force men more easily to yeeld vnto the truth of the other. Example hereof we haue, 1.
<pb n="680" facs="tcp:18792:349"/>
Tim. 1.15. in such a fundamentall point as is saluation onely by Christ, to be opposed by so many hundreth heretikes, it is no maruell if we see some starre set by it, or a light held ouer it, that none may passe by it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they haue diligently waighed, and fully resolued vpon the truth of it. In like manner beeing to entreat of the difficult labour, care, and work of the ministerie, from which women as not beeing capable of it are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, and of the excellencie of the function, which no man might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther rashly take vpon him, or negligently execute beeing lawfully called: and beeing further to set downe a certaine rule, vnto which all the lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full callings in the Church are to be conformed. In such a waightie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as is the preseruation of the Church and pietie, he prefixeth a worthie preface, 1. Tim. 3.1. <hi>This is a true saying,</hi> if any man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a worthie worke. But where the Apostle doth all these things (as in this place) he could with lesse reason depart from his ordinarie manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">All truths of God must be deliuered, but some more dwelt vpon.</note>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> The Ministers of God must teach euerie truth, reueale the whole counsell of God, and keepe nothing backe; but some truths must be dwelt vpon and more auouched then others, and namely, such as are either more necessarie or more contradicted. This is the wisedome of the spirit of God himselfe, who by his penmen distinguisheth of truthes, and hath neither prefixed <hi>Behold,</hi> in the beginning of euerie sentence; nor affixed his <hi>Selah</hi> in euerie ones ende, but onely in truths more obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable and remarkeable then the rest. Which point may receiue a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall confirmation from this obseruation, that the penmen of Scripture beeing to write the historie of things past, because they were of facts more vndeniable as things running into the sences of men; they stand not so much vpon ratifications and asseuerations; yea a number of histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall books there are, the authors of which are not known to the church. But when they come to write prophesies of things to come, and things in reason more improbable; then the authors name, his kinred, his calling, with other circumstances of time, place, and persons seruing to confirme and conuince the truth of prophesies are registred. And if these truthes were either more necessarily then ordinarie concerning the Church, or more liable to opposition and exception, then was much more caution and confirmation vsed. To avoide multitude of examples whereby this point might be strengthened, I will onely insist in that prophesie which more neerely concerneth vs that liue now in the newe Testament; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Reuelation:</hi> The which booke because it describeth the state of the Church from the time of Iohn the last of the Apostles, vntill Christs comming againe: and especially the proceedings, pride, and fall of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon the great whore, with all the kingdomes of Antichrist: the holy

Ghost could not but foresee, what labours and trauailes Satan and his instruments would take to weaken and impaire the credit and authoritie of this aboue all other books, wherein he preuailed so farre, as euen some true Churches called the truth and authoritie of it into question: and therefore it is worth the marking with what a number of confirmations this booke aboue all other in the Scriptures is backed.

               <p>The like we might teach out of particular examples.

God himselfe hath left vs his owne example in this point of wisdome, who was wont in his teaching vnto diuerse more necessarie truths to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix his <hi>Amen, Amen I say vnto you</hi>; which is in sence all one with this of our Apostle if we consider the speach, though in the speaker and manner of speaking was wonderful difference; himselfe beeing the author and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it selfe, euen the faithfull and true witnesse, and all other so farre only true as they testified from him. And so he often shutteth vp his speach with, <hi>he that hath eares to heare let him heare:</hi> and then let him that heareth or readeth consider,<note place="margin">Greenam.</note> such sayings carrie salt with them, and for such the Lord planted the eare more especially.</p>

And the rather, because two things are implied. 1. That it is a most true and necessarie doctrine, because the holy Ghost is so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in it. 2.

I should in euerie action glorifie God, testifie my faith, beautifie my profession, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difie my brethren: I ought to winne the ignorant, bring on the weake, or at least stoppe the mouth of the enemie who will be readie to say, You may see what a slight excuse will serue any of them all to misse a sermon: what a slight profit will make them forget themselues, their father whom they professe, and their Fathers house: what a slender busines will inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and breake off for the time their family duties: what a trifle will make them at oddes, and suites with others, yea themselues: for they can be as contentious as any other. Alas, am not I a Christian, a beleeuer, am I not called to better things, haue I not promised better? should I make the deuill glad, his instruments reioyce, Gods spirit sad, his children heauie? should I occasion profane ones through my sides to wound all my profession? should I open a Papists mouth, or harden him against the truth? should I cast backe weake ones by such fruites in me a profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor? should I cast off the care of my brethren, and bring shame on all my fathers house? Haue I faith, or are these the fruits of it? would it not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be fed still in the ministerie? would it not vpon all good occasions be working by loue? can a beleeuer be so slacke, so heauie, so idle, so secure, so couetous, so contentious, so scandalous as I am? oh I must looke better to the matter. When I first entred into the wayes of God, I said, I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed I would looke to my waies, I would not offend in my tongue, in my hand, in my eye, in my life and conuersation; and by Gods grace hereafter I will pay these vowes to the Lord, in the sight of all his people.</p>
               <p>Now for watching opportunities &amp; seeking occasions of doing good, we feare them, we flie them, we avoid charitable motions, and repute it our wisdome not to heare them: selfe loue and selfe ease slaieth our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, deadeth our faith, and burieth our loue to God, and to men: can working faith be so idle, or beleeuing persons so workles, or trees of Gods orchyard so fruitles? shall greene leaues make vs good trees, or

good words good Christians? Let vs pull out our hands out of our warme bosomes and fall to worke, and leaue idle iangling. It would bee more for the honour of God and his Gospell, if professors would either doe more or say lesse; practise something like or professe nothing at all. Where is the communion of Saints become? when doe professors meet together to edifie themselues by godly conference? when enquire they one of an other, where is a poore christian either sicke, or in other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse, that we may gather him a little releefe? were not such a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship as this likest vnto the purest Primitiue Church in the dayes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles themselues? and were it not now fitter for beleeuers,<note place="margin">The Popish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was most without for the shew, whereas none was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their walls.

In that the Apostle willeth Titus to affirme these things deliuered, and addeth this as a reason, because they are <hi>good</hi> and <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> we obserue, that Ministers in their teaching must haue respect to these two things. 1. That they deliuer true, sound, and <hi>good</hi> matter in it selfe. 2. That it be <hi>profitable</hi> for the hearers. First, it must be true and sound, else are they not of Gods sending, for whom he sendeth, he furnisheth with a word of truth: as on the contrarie, Satan is a lying spirit in the mouthes of seducers. Now then is it true when it is deuided aright, and then deuided aright when it is truly and properly grounded on the place whence it is raysed; as also when it is truly and rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Ayming 1. to please God, and not men, or the times: 2. to beate downe sinne, and not open a doore to libertie or licentiousnesse: 3. to comfort and encourage such as walke vprightly,<note place="margin">Doctrine must be both true &amp; truly dealt with.</note> and not make the hearts of those heauy, to whom the Lord speaketh peace.

               <p>Secondly, it must be profitable as well as true. For 1. euery thing in the Church must be done to edifie, and consequently spoken also. 2.

If we shall meete with doctrines giuing libertie to profane gaming and pastimes on the Lords sabboath; and then hauing gotten in a finger, go on to make it an indifferent thing, to keepe or not to keepe but only the times of Church required by law: and further, make it questionable whether we ought to keepe this present Sabboath or devise some other; is not this as great a blow to the truth as she can receiue, &amp; more then she looketh for in the house of her freinds? which let it preuaile, we shall see a poore star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen pietie among men in very few daies.

               <p>Although Titus hath beene in the former verse commanded to teach, and beat home such true and profitable points of doctrine as we haue heard, yet must he know, that he hath receiued but halfe his errand, and is but halfe way in his dutie; wherein if he would be compleat, he must further circumspectly watch against and represse all vaine and fruitles tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, especially those kinds here mentioned: either suffering them not to breake out at all; or if they doe, to nippe and blast them quickly and betimes: if he can he must stoppe them in the head; if he cannot do that, he must stay them in the streame.</p>
               <p>The verse standeth on two parts, 1. a precept, <hi>to stay foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and brawlings about the law.</hi> 2. a reason of it, <hi>for they are vnprofitable and vaine.</hi> For the meaning of the words we must knowe, that our Apostle condemneth not the moouing of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie question in handling the word; for there are many necessarie ones in diuinitie, which for our instruction and edification we may enquire and dispute: thus we reade that Paul disputed often: and thus we are trained and furnished in the diuinitie schoole, to defend the truth of God against the aduersaries of it: and where Salomon brandeth him with a note of follie that maketh no question but beleeueth euery thing, he sheweth that there is a wise inquisition into necessarie truths tending to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

               <p>The second thing which Titus must resist, are <hi>genealogies,</hi> which also must be rightly taken, because there alwaies was and yet is an excellent vse of them in Scripture. Before Christ they were so necessarie, as the Iewes were commanded to keepe publike and priuate records of their tribes and families, yea and if there were any that could not tell or finde his genealogie, he was not to be admitted; or if inconsiderately he were, was to be deposed from publike office, Numb. 1.18. Nehem. 7.62. and to this purpose some holy writers of Scripture haue set downe for the vse of the Church to the ende whole bookes of genealogies; but especially that the Iewes might be able to bring their descent from the Patriarks, as we reade of Paul, who no doubt could bring his line downe from Benia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Philip. 3.5.</p>
               <p>The vse of these genealogies was manifold, I will note two. First, to manifest the truth of God in the Scriptures.<note place="margin">Vse of Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies in the Scriptures.</note> 1. In the accomplishment of many speciall prophesies to particular persons: For example; God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> promised to Abraham that he should be a mightie man: that this truth might be fully known, must be set downe the whole descent and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and Princes that came of him although neuer so wicked from Isma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el himselfe. Rebecca also had a promise of two mightie peoples in her wombe, and that the elder should serue the younger: how should this be knowne to be accomplished, but by the genealogie of them both, for which purpose euen the dukes that came of Esau were all recorded. The like of Iacobs prophesie concerning Ephraim and Manasseh; for otherwise the wicked should haue no name nor register in the booke of God: it is not for their owne sakes whose memories should rot, but for the honour of God and his seruants they are there rolled; to shewe that the godly were not only inwardly but euen outwardly blessed according to promise with such a fruitfull race and posteritie. 2. It is a great light to the truth of Scripture, when it setteth downe the persons by whom, and the times in which euery worthy thing was done; what also and by whome the Church suffered: how all nations were euer enemies to religion but one little point or corner of the world: how God had euer a Church in the world, euen in the corruptedst times a litle remnant of Israel that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped him in spirit and truth, which things are cleared by genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> The second and principall vse of genealogie is to manifest the true
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:18792:356"/>
Messiah vnto the world. As, 1. to shewe that because God would be appeased in the same nature that had sinned, therefore he was true man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and not in shew: and that his humanitie, incarnation, and natiuitie should not be obscure, his naturall descent is by the Euangelists brought downe from Abraham, yea from <hi>Adam,</hi> shewing vs thereby what is the proper end of all genealogie in the Scriptures. 2. The nobilitie of his birth, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> worthines of his parentage, and that he was the right heire to the Iewish kingdome. 3. The truth of the prophesies concerning him that he was the sonne of Abraham, and of Dauid, and that the scepter departed not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from Iudah till his appearing. 4. The blessing wherewith that family out of which he came was advanced and distinct from al the tribes of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> earth. 5. His humilitie who came of all sorts of men and women, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuate, poore and rich, good and bad, that he might be a fit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> of all sorts of men: not disdaining to place in his genealogie Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res the incestuous sonne of Iudah, and Bathsheba that was the wife of Vriah. And in these vses these genealogies may be still with sobrietie read, taught, and heard.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> What is it then the Apostle condemneth? <hi>Answ.</hi> Not any such as serue to the edification of the faith of the Church, whereof this of Christ a publicke person and Sauiour of the world is the cheife of all; neither the keeping of the descent, so farre as serueth to the preseruation of right, iustice, and ciuill peace. In which respect Kings and Nobles, yea and other inferiour persons may enquire into that right which their ancestors haue made their due: and must so hold their genealogie, as they may hold their right against all claimes. But here is condemned all that recounting of kinred and petegree in all sorts of men, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from a vaine minde, and tendeth to worldly pompe and vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorie. For this was the sinne of the Iewish teachers, that whereas now by Christs appearance all distinction of families was in religious respect abrogated: and now was no such need of genealogie as before, vnlesse it were before Infidells, and such as were not perswaded of the right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent of Christ: yet they out of their pride would be much and often in extolling of their tribes and kinred; and so not only for these acces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sories let goe the substance of religion, but as if they would build vp that politie again which now was abolished, to the great hurt of their hearers, would much busie themselues in such fruitles discourses. These genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies must Titus withstand.</p>

                  <hi>By brawling and contentions about the law,</hi> are meant those hote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions which yet many Iewes and Iudaizing teachers did trouble the puritie of religion withall; striuing still to bring backe againe the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of Iewish ceremonies; such as was circumcision, differences

of meats, and daies, and garments; as though Christ were not yet come, wherewith the Church in that tender age was much molested. But now our Apostle pointeth to another end of the law, namely, to institute the life, contain in obedience, and lead vnto Christ; but not to shadow Christ to come as before, who by his comming hath put an end to all such cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
               <p>Of all these endlesse questions, idle genealogies, and brabling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, the Apostle giueth this censure; that although they may seeme to haue a puffing kind of knowledge, and be stood for as for fire and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if the whole substance of religion were placed in them: yet are they <hi>vnprofitable and vaine,</hi> farre from instruction and edification of men in true godlines; yea indeed great hindrances thereto, as taking vp time and labour, and wits of men which should better be imploied; which as we said, is a forceable reason to auoid and represse them.

                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> 1. The Deuil is readie in the purest Churches to corrupt the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of doctrine, by stirring needles &amp; endles questions, either in substance of doctrine, or in ceremonies; wherein men will be as hote as if all religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were placed in them: And thus shall the peace of the Church be troubled, the free passage of the Gospel hindred, the godly teachers greeued, and all for things vnnecessarie and idle: things sometimes so farre from profiting the Church, as that they much hinder it, and obscure the doctrine of true religion. All this appeareth plainely in this our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. The malicious man is euer sowing tares in Gods feild, and if he cannot extinguish all the light of Christian doctrine, if he cannot pull downe as he would the substance of truth, he will doe what he can; he will make dissention in smaller matters, whereby many shall be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, many cast backe that were comming on, and many other kept back, who might come on in time. So when the Disciples of Christ and Iohn consented in the substance of doctrine; yet could he make them quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell in washings, and fastings, and such ceremonies. Paul and Barnabas consented in substance of doctrine, yet for a verie trifle and indifferent thing,<note place="margin">Act. 15.39.</note> (the companie or leauing behind of Marke) were so exasperated and deuided, that they did seperate one from the other. And if he be so forceable in good men that he taketh the aduantage of flesh in them, much more doth he effectually worke in vnconscionable men who are all flesh, and all corruption. Easie were it in all ages to discouer this emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent note of Satans mallice in false teachers, namely, that they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more earnest in vrging and constraining of men in their owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, then to the duties of the morall law. Christ charged the Pharisies that they placed more religion in washing potts, cuppes, and beddes,
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:18792:357"/>
then in keeping Gods commandements. These Iewish teachers, Act. 15.29. are branded that they troubled the Church with words and combred mens minds (euen in the Apostles daies) with things dead, and vnnecessarie, with circumcision and ceremonie. And is not Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment come vpon the Papists at this day to the vttermost, who haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led backe all these Iewish ceremonies againe, and so long contended for them, that they haue lost the substance of pure religion, and the truth hath betaken her to her wings? Their schoole diuinitie is turned away from Christs bodie, to his garments: their maine disputes are taken vp about workes of preparation, free-will, merit of workes, workes super errogatorie, purgatorie, differences of garments, meats, dayes, vowes, pilgrimages; which are such things as Christ wrapped vp together and left in his graue, when himselfe rose againe. And their doctrinall diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the people, as we read it in the postills, but schoole distinctions, and legends fables; or of latter times, bitternes against the first resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of religion, who oppose their former false doctrines. And for their heat in vrging these things aboue all the commandements of God, none is so blind but may see that they more seuerely punish him that fasteth not their lent, then such as are manslayers; more him that keepeth not one of their Saints dayes, then him that keepeth neuer a Sabboath tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the yeare: that they make it a greater sinne for some sorts of men to marie a wife, then to liue in secret filthinesse all their liues long. Thus the deuil hauing gotten in his head, easily thrusteth in all his bodie; and if he get a Church or people at this aduantage, that he can comber mens mindes with needlesse things, and stirre vp brabbling contentions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout vnprofitable and vaine deuises of men; he is in great hope and probabilitie ere long to put out that light, which he hath al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. To reprehend sundrie sorts of teachers. 1. Such as wearie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues and hearers with knotty questions, which are as parables to the people, wherein while men exercise their wits, to get a name of profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, they do no little hurt: for they fill the heads and hearts of their hearers with intricate doubts, often leading them into such labyrinths, as they cannot wind them out of; and then the deuil hath matter to worke vpon; for either he taketh vp their minds with such needlesse questions, which hinder matters leading to true pietie: or else maketh them wauer in the truth, or bringeth them on to open profannesse, when they see that euery truth may be called into question, and probably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned; and so they care for no truth, as hauing none to insist in. Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is not a tying of knots to vntie them againe, nor a schoole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, but a building vp of men in the obedience of saith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as tyre themselues with curious questions, to which corrupt nature is verie prone in vnsanctified teachers and hearers; and these as vnprofitable and vaine as the former: teachers would find out the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and inequalitie of glorie in heauen: would haue vs know whether we shall know one another in the life to come; would instruct vs in the yeare and time of Christs comming to iudgement: would find vs out the cause why God reiecteth Saul the King, and electeth Saul the perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor. But here it were good to remember the woman of Samaria her answer to Christ, <hi>The well is deepe, and I haue no vessell to draw with.</hi> Hearers likewise would faine know where Moses his bodie was buried; how and whither Elias was carried: what God did before the world was made: they will no longer stand in the outward court, but presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with Pompey, thrust into the <hi>sanctum sanctorum,</hi> to prie into Gods secret place: yea although it be sequstered from the rest, and vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, couered, and shadowed with the wings of the Cherubins. But let such beware they buy not their presumption as deare as he did his; there is danger in climbing, and our lesson giuen vs is, <hi>not to be ouerwise, but wise to sobrietie.</hi> It is a fearefull taking of Gods name in vaine, to take his word to make a ground of our owne deuise in things not reuealed. It is an high presumption to seeke to discouer that which God hath not vttered, whose glorie it is to keepe somethings secret to himselfe. In a word, it is a point of extreame folly, wheras the Lord hath deliuered such
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:18792:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>
high things in the Scriptures to exercise our vnderstandings; that (as the ancient speake) were we elephants we might swimme there; that we should leaue these and wast out our time in things not reuealed. True it is that knowledge is profitable, is sweet, and profound: But what then? although it be profitable to warme a mans hands by the fire, it is no wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to thrust ones hands into the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to vse the beames of the sunne is profitable to perfect the sight; but vnlesse we were eagles, to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the body of the sunne is to destroy it. So likewise hony is sweet, but we must so much the more beware we eate not too much. And there is a knowledge too high for Dauid himselfe: an humble ignorance is an high learning where God would not haue vs to know.</p>
               <p>Now the better to restraine our selues herein,<note place="margin">Motiues to the former dutie.</note> 1.

Secondly, acknowledging it a fruit of pride, let vs compose our hearts to humilitie, as Dauid, <hi>Lord I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> am not high minded, I walke not in things too high for me, but as a weigned child:</hi> it is a spice of pride of heart to seeme to knowe more then others. 3. Consider the vnprofitablenesse of such knowledge, it puffeth vp, it edifieth not; one compareth such curious questions to Creuises, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> haue more picking then meat. 4. The danger of it, for hereby men grow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> to scorne the simplicitie of the gospel, and so forfeit their saluation. This mother and daughter we reade of in <hi>Libanius Iulians</hi> schoolemaster, who meeting with a Christian, asked him in skorne this question, I pray thee seeing thou holdest on the carpenters sonne, tell me how he is now occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, what is he doing? The Chrstian answered him, he is on his trade, making a coffin for thy Master and scholer Iulian, who shal haue a cast of his office ere long, as a little after Iulian was slaine in battaell, carried to Antioch in a coffin and there buried. Note the fearefull ende of curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in Gods matters.

themselues. And indeede such teaching is in it selfe like some stuffes starcht and stretcht, and set out with a faire glose, but come to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or wetting it shrinkes and shriules like cobwebs: and in the hearers effecteth an admiration of the man, but no sence of the matter: aske common people, what learned you at the Sermon? oh he is a proper man and a good scholler, and this is all that the most haue learned: a iust hire of such vaine and vnprofitable things, the worke is consumed before it come to the fire.</p>

Nature desireth to change pasture often; and the eare so farre as vncircumcised is Athenian, itching after nouelties: children would be in newe lessons before the old be halfe learned; so Christians cannot away to dwell in that pure doctrine which would lead them in true godlinesse: whereby often by the iudgement of God, they forfeit their faithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and in Gods wrath haue hirelings set ouer them that feede them with wind: they desire fine words and profound matter, and are wearie of plaine doctrines; and they haue a pickt language and vaine speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they aske and haue.

Mothers must teach their young children the Scriptures, as Eunicha did Timothie: Masters of familyes should make their families petty schooles and nurseries of diuinitie: we reade how Apollos a great man proceeded a doctor in Aquilaes house: our priuate houses should be Churches or Chappels; therefore such idle and vaine questions should find neither time nor place in these our priuate Churches.</p>

<pb n="701" facs="tcp:18792:359"/>
my selfe toward such? <hi>Ans.</hi> The Apostle carefull to preuent all such things as he foresaw might be hurtfull to the Church, giueth direction in these two verses how to proceede in this businesse also. The former gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing direction and laying downe the dutie, and the latter enforcing the same by moment of reason. In the former are three things to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. 1. the persons against whom Titus is to deale, here called <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.</hi> 2. The direction how he is to behaue himselfe towards them, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect</hi> them. 3. The orderly manner of proceeding, <hi>after once or twise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</hi> The latter verse containeth the reason of this seueritie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such persons are incurable and incorrigible: which is prooued by two arguments. 1. such a one is <hi>subuerted,</hi> that is, turned or cast off the foundation. 2. he sinneth against his owne conscience, <hi>beeing damned of his owne selfe,</hi> that is, he wittingly and willingly spurneth against that truth of which his conscience is by the former admonition convinced.</p>
               <p>For the first, who is an Heretike? <hi>Answ.</hi> He that professing Christ, yet inuenteth or maintaineth any errour against the foundation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that with obstinacie. For the opening of which description three things are to be noted. First, that an heretike must professe <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Per verba le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis legem op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnat. Ambr.</note> For Iewes, Turkes, or Pagans cannot properly be Heretikes, although they fight against Christ and all religion in all the foundations of it. These are more properly called Heathens, Infidells, and Atheists without God in the world. But the person whom Titus hath here to deale withall, is one within the Church, and cast off from a foundation vpon which he seemed to stand. Secondly, he must maintaine an error in doctrine (for if men erre in practise they are rather hypocrites, and profane wretches) and this error must be fundamentall, that is ouerturning some ground or article of our faith: for it will not make a man an heretike, not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the fables of Saint Francis, although Pope Benedict 4. so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. Nay if a man should hold something wherein the Scriptures are his aduersarie, as that an oath is not to be taken, and warre is not to be made by Christians: such a one were in a grosse error, but not presently sunke into heresie. But if any man shall maintaine iustification by works, a daily sacrifice for satisfaction for sinne, or any other righteousnesse or worke to stand before God in besides Christ; the defence of this will easily prooue heresie. And hereby the Popish doctrine is clearely proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued hereticall. Thirdly, this error must be willfully and obstinatly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined; for he must reiect admonition, and striue after conuiction: and this properly maketh an heretike.<note place="margin">Aliud est haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus aliud h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="702" facs="tcp:18792:360"/>
to the perswasion of truth, he is no heretike. For these three things make vp an heretike. 1. error. 2. conuiction. 3. obstinacie or wedded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to his opinion.</p>

Indeed if our rule be their Canon law (which iudgeth him an heretike who speaketh against the Romish Church, or obeyeth not whatsoeuer the Pope decreeth) we cannot auoid that name. Or if we should teach (as they doe, and that after conuiction) that the Saints in heauen are mediators by their merit and prayer: that prayer is to be made to Saints and dead men; that we can be iustified by the merit of our workes, by fasting, prayer, pilgrimage, or any such obseruance; that concupisence is no sinne in the regenerate, that a man can perfectly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law: that Saint <hi>Dominike</hi> performed more miracles then Christ, and all his Apostles, and was farre greater then Iohn Baptist: we could not auoid but be heretikes indeed: because these and a number such are contradictory to the canon of the Scriptures, reuerse the foundation of religion, and yet are obstinatly defended by them.</p>

The like may we say of that reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full title of Scismatikes, who quickly degenerate into heretikes, who rent the coate of Christ, and make division in the Church: sometimes
<pb n="703" facs="tcp:18792:360"/>
for some opinion, but more vsually about some orderly rites and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in the Church. Now then to challenge men of scisme: 1. the Church must be prooued to agree, and to haue the vnitie of truth both for doctrine and rites. 2. men must be conuinced by the word, that the doctrine is the wholsome word, and the rites and ceremonies are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difying, orderly, inoffensiue, and not superstitious. <hi>Obiect.</hi> But some are so peeuish they will neuer be conuinced and satisfied. <hi>Answ.</hi> The reason hereof seemes to be, because the Church is sometimes a partie in such a question; and therefore it were wisedome to bring vpon such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties the iudgement of other reformed Churches, to make vp such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction. And then when all such good meanes are vsed, if men sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from the Church, let them lie iustly vnder the reproach of their sin. But farre be it, that euery one who carrieth a diuerse iudgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some rites in the Church wherein he liues, should presently become a scismatike; for such a one may still cleaue in heart, in affection, and in personall presence vnto the Church, and be farre from interrupting the vnitie of the Church. Yea farre be it that euery departure from those that call themselues the Church, yea in maine points of doctrine, should be scisme. Were Elias, and Elizeus Scismatikes, because they departed from Ieroboams worship? were our Sauiour Christ and his Apostles scismatikes in departing from the doctrines of the Pharisies and Saduces? No, it was Ieroboam; it was the Preists and Pharisies (who pretended themselues to be the Church) departing from the truth, and so from the true vnitie, that were the authors of Scisme herein. And so for rites, how can we stoppe a Papists mouth, if we shall say that those men who depart from rites tending to the weakning of faith and doctrine, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue and superstitious; are presently to be ranked amongst Scismatikes? for haue not we our selues thus departed from an hundred Romish cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and yet we say they are the authors of Scisme therein. Let this rectifie our iudgements, and keepe vs from rash censures in matters so capitall, and so difficult. If any Catholike spirit will still reproach vs as Scismatikes; surely we will reioyce herein, that we are not of them, whose canon hath taught vs, that if Christ and his Apostles would not subscribe to all their decrees, they should escape no other tearmes but be reputed Scismatikes at the least, if not burnt for heretikes.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the Lord in his iustice punisheth by such the contempt of his truth, and the careles and vnaffected intertainement of his word.

               <p>Now hauing cleared the first point who are heretikes, we come to the
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:18792:362"/>
second, namely, how Titus must carrie himselfe towards them: and that is, he must after <hi>once or twise admonition reiect them.</hi> Now because ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition is first in nature and order of proceeding, though it be not so in the placing of the words, we will consider of it somewhat in the first place. And first it will be demanded what kinde of admonition this is, I answer, that this is not meant of that <hi>priuate</hi> admonition, whereunto both priuate Christians and the Minister as a Christian are bound towards those that erre, and are knowne so to doe; but of that <hi>publike</hi> admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the face of the Church, which is a seruant and maketh way to the publike censure of excommunication. For it maketh way to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches reiection of <hi>such a one,</hi> as the next verse sheweth incurable, both because he is cast off the foundation, as also is condemned of his owne conscience. Further, this admonition must be <hi>once or twise,</hi> namely, when the Pastor hath priuately conferred with him for the conviction of his conscience, and admonished him to the reuoking of his wicked error: if now he still stand out, then generall warning is to be giuen two seuerall sabbaths, of such an offender in the congregation, not yet naming the person, or cause in particular, but threatening the sentence of excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, vnlesse the delinquent come in in the meane time, and yeelde himselfe vnto the truth. And thus shall he see that all gentle and good meanes are vsed with him, before the Church descend to such a grieuous censure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But Christ requireth three admonitions, Matth. 18.17. why doth the Apostle vrge but two: yea Paul himselfe admonished the the Curch of the Corinths three times, 2. Cor. 13. 1. <hi>this is the third time. Answ.</hi> Those places speake of the processe of priuate persons in priuate offences, which goeth before the publike notice and proceeding of the Church. 2. Paul dealeth by Epistle in a louing and fatherly manner, and prescribeth not to the Church how to proceede in their publike censures. 3. In such questions of fact, for the manner of processe, much is left to the wisedome and iudgement of the Church; which may so proceede as may make most for the good of the partie; and may vse two or three ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions at their discretion: but so as admonitions must not be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied (as we say) <hi>toties quoties,</hi> nether on the other hand must be vnder the number of two, for two must be the least.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> Hence we learne that euen heretikes and enemies to the church, must be tenderly and louingly dealt withall,<note place="margin">

Neither must they be seuerely or suddenly proceeded against by the Church, but vpon due warning and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> threatning. For herein, 1. the Church beeing the daughter of God, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> shall resemble God himselfe; who still admonisheth before he strike. 2.
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:18792:362"/>
the commandement is, that those that are spirituall must euer labour to <hi>restore offenders by the spirit of meekenes:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> and neuer to remooue till all meanes of restoring haue beene assayed: so that seueritie at first in those that are spirituall were meere crueltie. 3. This softnesse in the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of the Church, bewrayeth her loue of the partie, maketh his sinne better knowne vnto him; letteth him see the danger of it: and if all this be scorned and contemned, it heapeth coales vpon his head, and maketh the ensuing censure more iust and heauie. 4. Hereto ioyne the examples <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of Paul, who turneth not to seueritie till gentlenesse doe no good; nor vseth the <hi>rodde,</hi> so long as the spirit of meekenesse can preuaile:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 13.2.</note> yea of our Lord Iesus, who pronounced not his woe against Corazin and Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saida, till other great meanes vsed with them were reiected by them.</p>

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Hence may wee gather the meaning of sundrie places in the Scripture: as Rom. 16.17. <hi>Brethren, I beseech you marke them diligently which cause divisions and offences among you, and avoide them:</hi> 2. Io<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. 10. If any come and bring not <hi>this doctrine, receiue him not:</hi> these and such like places must be vnderstood by this our text, namely, after admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and good meanes vsed for their reclaiming, they must be avoided and reiected, and not before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If heretikes must be thus dealt with,<note place="margin">How much more freinds and bretheren.</note> how much moree are we to deale louingly with brethren, who fall not wilfully, but of frailtie? how carefull should we be to set them in ioynt againe tenderly; couering the bitter pill of reproofe with sugred perswasion? how should the spirit of Moses coole and moderate the spirit of Elias towards brethren? surely here must be louing admonition, not once not twice, but so often as they offend, so as it be not with contempt and scorne of religion and disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reiect him</hi>] There is a twofold reiecting of a man; the <hi>one more priuate,</hi> whereby euery Christian is bound to forbeare the familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing with such as are openly wicked &amp; scandalous in doctrine or life: but especially the Minister or Pastor, whose life is more remarkeable and exemplarie must be more carefull to avoide the companie of such. And this is by some thought to be here meant, as if they advised Titus, that when in his course he should meete with such a person, who after admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and good meanes of reclaiming him, should still adde pertinacie to error; he should thenceforth leaue such a one to himselfe: neither famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly conversing with such, least he should occasion others also so to doe: nor yet to neglect the Church in striuing against the streame with such a one: for all that labour were but lost; which were it taken against weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ignorance, it were hopefull; but beeing against malice and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie, is desperate; and therefore <hi>avoide him,</hi> make not nor meddle with
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:18792:363"/>
him, let him alone to Gods iudgement; what hope is there in washing an Ethiopian? to build one that is cast from his foundation, were to hang an house in the aire; and therefore vnlesse thou canst hope that he who will not yeelde vnto the voice of the Prophets and Apostles, will yeelde to thy priuate perswasion, meddle not at all with him. But as I noted in the former point, there is more included in the precept; which is to be extended to a more <hi>publike reiection</hi> of an incurable person who will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no good; but is likely to do much harme in the Church by infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if he be suffered.<note place="margin">

               <p>Now the reasons why we are thus to auoid the excommunicate, are these. 1. That the offender may be brought to soundnesse of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> for whatsoeuer power is giuen to the Pastors and Churches, is
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:18792:364"/>
giuen to edification and not for destruction, 2. Cor. 10.8. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such an offender must, 1. haue his conscience terrified, by beeing deliuered <hi>vnto Satan:</hi> that is, cast out of the Church: out of which Satan ruleth, and setteth vp his throne. 2. Another end in regard of the partie, is to shame him, both by the publike rebuke of the Church in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> proceeding against him; as also the auoiding of him as one of another societie: 2. Thess. 3.14. <hi>Withdraw your selues—that he may be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> 3. To worke sorrow in him for his sinne, for the <hi>destruction of his flesh,</hi> and fleshly corruption, which is the ground of true repentance: see <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 1. Cor. 5.5. 4. To effect a desire to be reconciled first vnto God, and then vnto the church, against which he hath offended. And thus, 5. <hi>his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> spirit shall be saued in the day of the Lord.</hi>

Which Ieroboam well conceiuing, that he might bring the people to vnitie in religion, set vp two calues, one in Dan, and the other in Bethel. How both Iewes and Gentiles wickedly resisted Christ and his Apostles, vpon this same ground that two diuerse religions were vnsafe in one countrie, and long could not continue, but the one would eate vp the other, the historie of the Gospel, and the Acts of the Apostles euidently shew. From whom we may frame a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that if they were so vigilant to keepe out whatsoeuer might disturbe their errour; how much more carefully should the truth be preserued in the puritie of it, of all such as haue any care of the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it? nay more, shall the mention of a toleration of our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Rome or Spaine be capitall; and should we by connivence at their knowne Idolatrie, giue them as good as a tolleration; and so strengthen their hopes for an alteration? These reasons if I should now in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applie vnto the Romish Church for the further euidence of them, I
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:18792:367"/>
know better where to beginne then to make an end: and should dwell too long on the question, which I purposed rather to point at, then fully to handle; as more largely out of the Scriptures, Fathers, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells I easily might. But from them all as they lie, in one word may be concluded, that the toleration of Poperie in a reformed country, where it may be cast out, is vtterly vnlawfull.</p>
               <p>The second Question is, whether Protestants may marrie with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists? <hi>Answ.</hi> For the right resoluing of this question, two things must be considered. 1. Whether the person that now professeth Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perie, will yeeld to be wonne to the embracing of true religion: which if he do, then caseth such a one to be a Papist, and may be maried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hus Isaac married Rebecca the daughter of Bethuel; and Iacob the daughters of Laban, who was an Idolater as appeareth, Gen. 31.53. On the same condition Boaz married Ruth a Moabitisse woman, but who was first conuerted to the Iewish religion. And thus the Lord himselfe yeelded vnto the mariages with Heathnish women taken in warre, but heauily after a sort, and by indulgence,<note place="margin">Deut. 21.11.</note> but on no hand vnlesse they would first entertaine the true religion, as by those many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies enioyned might more specially appeare: and by Iacob we may iudge of the other Patriarkes, who would not giue Dinah to Hemors sonne, vnlesse the whole family were circumcised.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it must be considered, whether the partie be an absolute Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, or onely Popishly affected in some points; as namely, whether he or shee erre in maine and fundamentall points of faith; or in lesse dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous opinions. If the partie prooue tractable and erre onely in smaller points; as suppose some superstitious obseruations of daies, meates, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and rash vowes, or such like, suckt in by reason of corrupt education; although I would wish a man to make a better match for himselfe, yet I cannot condemne it as vtterly vnlawfull, neither in this question com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth such a one vnder this commandement of the Apostle. But if the partie be a limbe of the Pope, drinking in with greedinesse the poysoned cuppe of his heresies; and such a one as is turned off the foundation, by holding iustification by workes, freewill to good,<note place="margin">A Protestant may not marrie a limb of the Pope.

               <q>
                  <hi>Vers. 11.</hi> Knowing that he that is such, is peruerted, and sinneth, beeing damned of his owne selfe.</q>
               <p>Hauing in the former verse, shewed both the persons to be procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against, (called heretikes) and the manner of proceeding against them; namely, after once or twice admonition to auoid them; Now in this verse our Apostle discendeth to giue some reasons of this seueritie; which are two in number. <hi>First,</hi> he is such a one as is subuerted or tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned off the foundation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> he wittingly and willingly, spurneth against the knowne truth, sparkling, and shining in his conscience, and therefore is remedilesse and desperatly incurable.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Tim. 2.19.</note>For the former. By beeing <hi>peruerted,</hi> or turned off the foundation, is not to be meant any falling off from the foundation of Gods election, which <hi>abideth so sure,</hi> as that not any one of Gods elect shall euer fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as Hymencus and Philetus did: but a falling off from some fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall points of Christian religion, held and maintained by the Church, whereof this partie yet seemeth a member. As for example: The maine foundation aymed at in the writings of the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles is, to teach; that Iesus Christ, God and man, is the alone and perfect Sauiour of his Church: and whosoeuer teacheth or holdeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doctrine tending to ouerthrowe, either of his natures, or anie of his offices; he is truely said to be turned off that foundation. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the maine grounds of all our religion, for matter either of faith or manners, are the commandements of the law, and promises of the Gospel: and whosoeuer either directly, or by direct consequent ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth any of the commandements of God, or articles of our faith, he is truly said to be turned off the foundation. Now this cannot euery error in religion doe. For (to keepe our Apostles allegorie, comparing the profession of religion to the building of a great house) some errors are lesser, and as it were besides the foundation; such as may be thought as the breaking downe of some window; some greater as the breaking downe of some side of the house, and yet the house standeth, although much defaced. But some are such as ouerturne the whole house, and
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:18792:369"/>
rase the verie foundations of all: such as is the doctrine of iustification by workes, which point alone putteth men quite out of their estate in Christ; and shutteth them out of the kingdome of heauen. Gal. 5.2.4. Whence might be obserued, how needfull a thing it is for euery one to be well grounded in points of Catechisme, which is a thing most dangerously neglected by the most: and beeing so grounded, to looke well to themselues, least they be turned off from them, and so depart from the holy commandements: for thus the end of such would be far worse then the beginning. But we will come to the latter degree of this sinne. <hi>Hee sinneth, beeing damned of himselfe,</hi> that is, he wilfully sinneth or addeth sinne to sinne: not only by maintaining an errour, but 1. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the light of the word shining in his conscience. 2. against the wholesome admonition of his faithfull pastor,<note place="margin">Quia omne sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num iudicium in terris &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiones eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae recusat.

This man if he had no other iudge, is iudged and condemned of himselfe, and sheweth that he is damned of himselfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obiect.</hi> But there is no man so monstrous and gracelesse, that will persist in error against the light of his conscience. <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes; and this commeth partly by the naturall impuritie of conscience;<note place="margin">Tit. 1.15.</note> which can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse not only intentions vnwarrantable, but euen sinnes committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law. As in the young man, Mar. 10.20. who boasted that he (though he had liued in the breach of all) had kept all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from his youth: and 2. partly by the increase of that corruption through a sencelesse numbednesse, and vnfeelingnes, which springeth from a custome of sinne: and 3. especially by the iust iudgement of God, who striketh them with a reprobate sence; by withdrawing euen the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light of nature from those who would faine put it out, or deteine it in vnrighteousnesse: and by deliuering them vp to strong delusions,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.28.</note> that they might beleeue lies, who would not embrace the truth in the loue of it.<note place="margin">2.

               </p>
               <p>Now he that is such a wilfull offender, and knowne so to be, must be auoided. But it is hard (will some say) to know any man thus to sinne. <hi>Answ.</hi> Because we speake not now of the iudgement of certaintie which is proper to God, whereby he alone can iudge of the finall estate of a man, but only of the iudgement of humane wisedome, which is giuen to the Church, who iudgeth only for the present by the present fruits, it is not so hard to doe: for such a man hath beene brought to conference, to the tryall of the Scriptures, to the analogie of faith, and to the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of the Church: by which his reasons haue bin refelled, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

               <p n="3">3. Note hence also,<note place="margin">The Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good vse of the most wicked consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</note> what vse the Lord maketh of a wicked consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, euen in desperate sinners. It shall be the accuser, witnesse, and iudge to pronounce the sentence of death against his owne soule; and so shall make way vnto the Lords most righteous iudgement. Iudas himselfe beeing surcharged with conscience of his sinne, read the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence against himselfe (there beeing no other to doe it) saying, <hi>I haue sinned in betraying innocent blood:</hi> and then went and hanged himselfe. For this purpose the Lord hath put into the soule not only a knowledge, whereby naturally euen the wicked can discerne between that which is honest, and dishonest; yea between good and euill so farre as to make them excuseles; but also an application of that knowledge vnto the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall actions of life. From which two issue two other faculties, which are the verie nature of conscience: 1. A testification that such an action is done or not done, yea although a man would not haue it so to testifie. 2. A iudgement after triall, whether it be well done or no: the fruits of which iudgement are either, ioy, peace, and glorying in things which the conscience saith are well done: or else horror in soule, as in Caine: trembling in bodie, as in Faelix: fearefull dreams and visions,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.14. Act. 24.26. Dan. 5.4.</note> as in Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazer: or despaire, as in Iudas in the sence of sinne committed. To this agreeth that of Salomon, Prov. 20.27. <hi>The light of the Lord is the spirit of man, and searcheth all the bowells of the bellie:</hi> in which words mans conscience is compared to the Lords lanthorne, that discouereth things to a mans selfe, which are as secret as his owne bowells.

                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. It letteth vs see what an intolerable torment a wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is, euen a gibbit, and a rack set vp within the wicked to vex and torment them withall: and as a fearefull hue and crie euery where o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaking them; that let them runne or ride where they will, they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themselues with a writ of apprehension; which draggeth them will they nill they, before the face of the iudge. No sooner was Adam fallen, but his conscience heard the voice of God ringing through Paradise; which made him flie from God, and hide himselfe. No sooner had Cain

slaine Abel, but the voice of the blood filled heauen and earth, and made his countenance fall.<note place="margin">Act. 24.26.</note> No sooner did Paul dispute of iustice, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and iudgement to come, but Felix trembled. And whence is that fearefull looking for of iudgement, and violent fire, which shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure the aduersarie;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.27.</note> but from the worke of conscience, fitting the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for the iudgement of the great day? What meruaile is it then, if the wicked would faine stifle and choke the noise of their conscience? but that they cannot still doe it. Which beeing so, let euery one feare to sin against the light of his conscience, and not dare to venture vpon, or foster the least sinne: for howsoeuer we may for the present thinke some sinnes light and little; if the Lord neuer so little touch the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (as the time commeth apace when he will awaken it) we shall feele euery sinne (euen the smallest) to lie as heauy as a mountaine vpon our soules: little do we thinke that that sinne which now we account as light as a feather, should prooue so heauy vpon our shoulders, as that our hearts shall not be able to sustaine vs from oppression vnder it. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, howsoeuer men may thinke to carrie their sinne so close, as the eye of the kite cannot pry into it; yet know whosoeuer thou art, that thy conscience is Gods booke, take heed what thou writest in that booke: for it carrieth a light in it selfe whereby it shall be read and discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

This further teacheth vs not to neglect the checks of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor our owne hearts reproouing vs of our wayes; as those men who are resolued to hold on their lewde courses, let the word and spirit, yea, their owne spirits suggest what they will or can against it. For the time commeth when thou canst not set the voice of thy conscience so light: &amp; then that conscience which hath checkt thee shall iudge thee, and that heart which hath reprooued thee, shall torment thee; and thou shalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be able to turne off the charge of it, but shalt by it be accused and conuicted to haue been a wilfull chooser of thine owne destruction. This is that which is secretly implyed in the text, that if these heretikes had listened but to the checks of their owne conscience, they had neuer runne on so farre into such an incurable condition.</p>

To keepe vs from errors and heresies, and containe vs in the profession of the true faith: for let good conscience be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> put a way; there must needes followe a <hi>shipwracke of faith:</hi> as is to be seen in all heretikes.<note place="margin">1.

In suffering or enduring any thing for well doing (as not the paine but the cause maketh a martyr, so) not the cause so much as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the conscience of the sufferer worketh out his boldnesse, and peace in the middest of the combat, and giueth him securitie in his conflict; whereas a bad conscience will betray the best cause. 4. In inioying any condition of this present life, a good conscience is a sweete companion: euen <hi>a drie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> morsel</hi> with peace of heart,<note place="margin">Prov. 17.1.</note> is better then an house full of sacrifices with strife and warre within.

               <p>Our Apostle hauing finished all such common precepts as respected the whole Church in Creta, he now passeth to some priuate businesse, which more specially respected the person of Titus, and commended to his practise: and it standeth of two branches: the former touching Titus his comming to Paul, in this 12. vers. the latter touching the louing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement which he should shewe towards Zenas, and Apollos, in the next verse. Concerning Titus his iourney to Paul, he is directed both for <hi>the time,</hi> when <hi>I shall send Artemas vnto thee, or Tychicus:</hi> as also for the <hi>place</hi> where, to <hi>Nicopolis:</hi> with a reason rendred why he must come thither, because Paul had <hi>a determination there to winter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, Titus is enioyned to come to Paul, who as he had power to place
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:18792:372"/>
or displace him at his pleasure, so he wanted not sufficient reason at this time to call him vnto him. 1. that he might visit Paul whose affection longed to see him, and to be refreshed by him. 2. that he might further instruct him in the doctrine of faith, and the discipline of the Church. 3. that he might elswhere send him to preach, and confirme some other Church planted by the Apostle.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for the place Nicopolis, whether Titus must come: we reade of three cities called by this name; but this was in Thracia neer Macedonia: and the reason added is not needlesly affixed to the Apostles iniunction, but to encourage Titus vnto so long a iourney; for els he might conceiue with himselfe, that the Apostles calling beeing to goe from place to place to plant Churches; he might happily misse of him there, and so loose his iourney: therefore Paul telleth him, that if God let his purpose stand, he shall be sure to finde him there; seeing he had determined there to win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And from both the precept and reason it is plaine, that Paul was not now at Nicopolis, nor writ this Epistle there, nor sent it thence (howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the subscription of the Epistle boldly, but heedelesly affirmeth it) for then he would haue said, be diligent to come to me hither: and I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined here to winter: and not; come to Nicopolis for I haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there to winter: the mistaking of this adverb in the text was the cause of the erroneous subscription added by the scribe who copied out the Epistle: the like whereof in sundrie other Epistles is confessed both by Protestants and the Papists themselues.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But when must Titus come: not before Artemas or Tychicus were sent from Paul, to supply his place in Creta. Of Artemas we reade not so much as of Tychicus, who accompanied Paul into Asia, Act. 20.4. and by whome the Apostle sent his Epistles to the Ephesians, 6.21. and to the Colossians, 4.8. in both which he is called a beloued brother, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Minister, and fellowe seruant in the Lord: and euerie where verie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiuely spoken of. But yet seeing he is here mentioned before Tychi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, and set apart for the worke and seruice of the Church by the Apostle himselfe, it is certaine he was a faithfull and sufficient man: for else would not the Apostle haue committed a matter of such trust and charge vnto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doctr.</hi> Out of this prouident care of the Apostle for the Church we learne,<note place="margin">It is dangerous for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to be left destitute of their teachers though for a short time.</note> that it is verie dangerous and hurtfull to the Church, to be left destitute of their Ministers and teachers, although for a verie small time. Paul had an earnest desire to see Titus; and as is likely some other speciall worke more commodious for the Church to employ him in elswhere: and yet he must not come til an Artemas or Tychicus come in his roome to take charge of his people: he saith not, come thou to me, and I will
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:18792:372"/>
shortly send Artemas or Tychicus; but come not till I send them. Well knewe the Apostle, 1. the weakenesse of faith without continuall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and that if there be not watering as well as planting, whatsoeuer is best begunne will easily decay, and beeing once decayed is hardly reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered. 2. the subtiltie of Satan, together with his malice, who vnces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly seeketh reentry; who if he cannot hinder the gathering of the saints he will doe what he can to hinder their building vp; that so the Lord may come short of a great part of his glorie, and his people cut short of a great part of their comfort. 3. how naked people lie without vision to all errors and dangers, and how easily the sheepe are scattered, when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor is smitten or remooued.</p>

Against which not onely this example, but other reasons drawne out of the Scripture are verie expresse. As, 1. the authoritie of Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, Act. 20.28. binding all Pastors carefully to attend vnto the flockes of which the holy Ghost hath made them ouerseers: and this not at the quarter or halfe yeare day to gather in the profits and to feede themselues, but to <hi>feede the flocke, the Church of God which Christ hath purchased with his blood.</hi> I would know whether this precept requireth the personall presence of the Pastor or no: If any man say, that he is as good as present in his sufficient substitute: I answer, that the most do not prouide so sufficiently, but some rakeshame of men, some Ieroboams Priest of the basest of the people, that cannot tell otherwise what to doe with himselfe. But if they did; the text is not satisfied, which requireth his owne attendance, neither inioyneth a Pastor to see his people fed, but to feede them. I would further here demaund whether that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen to Archippus belong not to all the Pastors of the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Take heed to the ministerie that thou hast receiued in the Lord, that thou fulfill it:</hi> which if it doe (as no forhead can denie it) then with what face can any man take a ministerie vpon him that an other may fulfill it. The like commandement is giuen by Salomon,<note place="margin">Prov. 27.23.</note> be diligent to knowe the sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. The excellencie of the obiect tieth the Pastor to more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie attendance: his calling is to <hi>watch ouer mens soules:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 13.17.</note> were it but to watch ouer mens bodies or goods, it were no lesse then capitall, for any man to leaue his station at his owne pleasure wherein his captaine hath set him: and how then can this vnfaithfulnesse in them who are set in the

Lords watch towers, but be by so much the more perillous then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by how much the soule is more pretious then the bodie, and the losse of the soule infinitely surpassing the losse of the bodie?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The straitnes of the account that is to be made for the people, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but binde him that hath any conscience left in him to ordinarie resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and attendance in his owne person. Hence the Apostle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews saith, they watch ouer mens soules as they that must giue account. And the Apostle Peter wisheth them so to feed the flocke depending vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them,<note place="margin">1. Pet 5.4.</note> that when the cheife sheepeheard shall appeare, they may giue vp their accounts with ioy.</p>
               <p>Now with what ioy can he giue vp his accounts, who with the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling hath left his people to the wolfe: who neuer knew their estate, who neuer came but as a stranger among them: neuer or seldome knowne by voyce vnto them: yea scarce knowne by face to many of them: <hi>That which will die, let it die,</hi> Zachar. 11.9. he is <hi>none</hi> of his <hi>brothers kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Slender is that account which that Captaine can make to his Prince, who hauing receiued his paie to guid and traine such a number of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,<note place="margin">Negligenter pascens convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur non ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re summum pastorem.

The loue of Christ were it present, would constraine men to feed his sheepe: <hi>Peter,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>louest thou mee? feede my sheepe.</hi> Were there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>

Right reason would also shew him how impossible a thing it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for one shepheard to keepe more flocks then one: how vnreasonable a thing it is, for any man to performe seruice in one place, and take wages in another. What a shamefull thing it were to marrie a wife in hope to beget children by another mans helpe: what an equall thing it is, that he who doth not his dutie in his owne person, but by a deputie, should also goe to heauen by a deputie, but not in his owne person; as merily and wittily, <hi>Iodocus</hi> a famous French preacher, witnessed by <hi>Espenceus.</hi> From all which I may conclude this reason with the words of a Papist,<note place="margin">Perald. 2. tom. tract. 4. in avar. part. 2. cap. 11.</note> that seeing neither nature is the principle or ground of nonresidencie; for that is contented with a little; nor yet grace, which is contented with lesse; therefore the corruption of the heart of man is the cheefe counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and perswader vnto it. Neither is his reason to be neglected: for though a man (saith he) dare liue a nonresident, yet would he not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly die one. And as for the matter of substitution whereon the whole frame of nonresidencie is set, as on a foundation; he saith, he seeth not why one man might not haue as well an hundreth liuings as one by this plea, for he might get substitutes inough: neither doth he see any reason but women might also be capable of Church liuings (by this plea) as well as men, for they also might performe the duties by substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. But I remit the reader to the author, as also to other of our later Diuines,<note place="margin">D. Willet in 1.

               <p n="5">5. We may adde hereunto the example of the Preists vnder the law, who were fixed in their courses neere the Temple, and had their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:18792:374"/>
and roomes adioyned vnto the Temple, that they might waite on their offices,<note place="margin">1. Chr. 28.12, 13.</note> and be readie for their seruices: and there is no reason why the Ministers of the Gospel, should not now as diligently waite on their office as they vnder the law: vnlesse we will say, that the <hi>standing</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of the new Testament is not so necessarie, not so certaine as that <hi>walking</hi> Ministerie of the old. Let Ministers therefore see, that the occasions of leauing their flockes for a time, be vrgent and weightie; not pretences proceeding from couetousnesse, nor ambition, nor any other sinister respect: neither let them dare to remooue themselues (no not for a while) but for some occasions which are more necessarie then the attending of the flocke: for howsoeuer they may shroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by the protection of humane laws, yet in the court of conscience only such necessary and weighty occasions wil beare plea, and giue a man leaue for a time to be absent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As it must not be a small matter, that must draw a Minister from his charge, so if such weightie occasions fall out, as require the gifts of some men to be otherwise employed for the time for the greater good of the Church, then in his priuate charge; then we see what must be our rule. If Titus be remooued, an Artemas, or Tychicus, a faithfull and furnished man must be sent in his roome; that while the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die is cared for, no particular member be lost or neglected. Where al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so great and noble men may be put in minde, what a grieuous sinne they bring vpon themselues, when they call Ministers from their charges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their houses, or vnto the seas, or any such employment, and in the meane time neglect to prouide sufficiently for their flockes: and the sinne is the greater, in that they might be ordinarily better serued by such as haue no charges; and why should they not rather send to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities, then to the Churches, if they did not chuse to wrong them both, when as yet no necessitie vrgeth or forceth them hereunto?</p>

<pb n="731" facs="tcp:18792:374"/>
was a poore man, and had wanted but for the churches contribution: For Apollos we reade of him, Act. 18.24. that he was borne at Alexandria, that he was an eloquent man, mightie in the Scriptures, and feruent in the spirit: yea so powerfull in his doctrine, as that of some he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted not inferiour to the cheife Apostles: for as some said they were Pauls, so some cleaued to Apollos, as other some to Cephas:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.12.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both of them were worthy to be respected by Titus, who therefore must performe vnto them this part of Christian curtesie, to lead them forth on their way.</p>

For 1. whatsoeuer pertaineth to loue and good report, that must beleeuers thinke on and doe, Philip. 4. Secondly, the wisedome which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue is gentle, peaceable, full of mercie and good fruits, Iames. 3.17. Thirdly, those many commandements, that Christians should salute and greete one an other, and that with an holy kisse, 1. Thes. 5.26. called by Peter the kisse <hi>of loue</hi>; vsuall in those East countries,<note place="margin">1. Pet 5.14.</note> by which outward testimonie they declared mutuall loue and kindnesse. Fourthly, outward curtesie is a necessarie vertue euen for the maintaining of the bond of Christian peace: yea availeth much for the nourishing and encreasing the communion of Saints, and societie with Gods people. Fifthly, how dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracefull a thing were it for the profession of Christ, that such as professe faith in the Lord Iesus, should shew themselues inhumane or hoggish; who should be as <hi>lambes,</hi> and <hi>little children,</hi> for such are they who haue entred into the kingdome of Christ, as the Prophet witnesseth. Let this point therefore be well thought of, that as faith and loue cannot be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate; so must good conscience and good manners goe together.</p>
               <p>Now for this speciall branch of curtesie, to bring the seruants of God and the Church on in their iourney; it is from an inferiour to a superiour a dutie of honour: as we see in Barzillai, 2. Sam. 19.36. who would go o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Iordan with king Dauid, &amp; set him so farre on his way to Ierusalem, &amp; then returne back to Gilead. And of the equall to the equall it is a dutie of kindnes; and towards the teacher of both: and as it seemeth, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie common among beleeuers in the Apostles times. Thus we read how the Elders of the Church of Ephesus accompanied Paul to the ship, Act. 20.38. so the disciples whom he found at Tyrus, with their wiues and children accompanied him out of the citie, Act. 21.5. yea so ordinarie was this custome among them, that he maketh full account of it before hand: Rom. 15.24. <hi>When I shall take my iourney into Spaine, I will come by you, for I trust to see you, and be brought on my way by you:</hi> and commendeth as a semely dutie among the Saints, 3.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Such as are in the Lords work must be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prouided for that they want nothing. 1. Cor. 9.11.</note>The second dutie enioyned Titus concerning them is, that he suffer them to want nothing. They were employed in the Lords worke, and therefore must be cared for so much the more. For 1. what can be more equall then that he that laboureth in the Gospel should liue of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel? or that those who sow spirituall things should reape temporall? The law of nature bindeth to releeue the parents in time of want. The law of God chargeth in moe places then one, neuer to forsake the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite all the daies of thy life. The lawes of all nations allow their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and standart bearers a liberall and honourable stipend: and suffer not any common soldier to goe to warrefare vpon his owne charge. And very vnequall were it that any should feed a flocke and not eate of the milke, or plant a vinyard and not tast of the fruite. And how much more are these spirituall Fathers to be releeued? how much lesse should the Ministers who are the Lords Souldiers, Captaines, and Standart bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers goe to warre of their owne costs? how much more should the Lords shepheard eate of the milke of his flocke? and the labourers in his vinyard eate of the fruite? 2. If we goe from the men to their tydings, these be such as ought to bring their persons into acceptance with vs: That as Dauid said of Ahimaaz, <hi>hee is a good man, and bringeth good ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings:</hi> so because of their good tydings we must entertaine Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters as good men. Hence the Apostle commandeth vs, <hi>to receiue such, and haue them in singular loue, for their workes sake.</hi> Phil. 2.29. 3. The godly who professe loue vnto the truth, may not neglect such as are the publishers of it, but cheerefully minister vnto their necessities, to the end that thereby themselues <hi>may be helpers to the truth.</hi> 3. Epist. Ioh. 7. But especially if any suffer for bearing witnesse vnto any part of Gods truth; towards such Gods people must enlarge their bowells, and euen stretch their best abillitie to helpe vp that part of the truth, which Satan and his instruments seeke with violence to obscure or suppesse: and the rather, because these sufferings are endured for the truth; and for them, who haue as good a right in it, as their teachers themselues. 4. For this cause also ought the faithfull to comfort and encourage the messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God; that therein they may reape a sweet fruite of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and may reioyce in them, not in there gift so much; as in that <hi>it is a fruite which furthereth their owne reckoning.</hi> Phil. 4.17.</p>
               <p>Now all these reasons are such as suffer not any professor to shut vp his loue in his owne Pastor (although he is first bound vnto him) but cal for the dutie in generall to euerie one that worketh in the same worke, according as their necessitie and occasions shall be: not onely our owne

               <p>The Apostle hauing enioyned Titus to make so franke a supply for Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, and Apollos, that they should not want any thing for their iourney; Titus might demaund, but where should I haue to prouide for them; (for it is certaine, that Titus was not now a man of such state and wealth,<note place="margin">Si non habes provideant sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diti tui. Aquin. in locum.</note> as those who say they are like him:) the Apostle therefore answereth that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret obiection in these words, <hi>Let ours learne to shewe forth good workes</hi> the fruites of their faith, especially for such necessarie <hi>vses of the Church</hi> as this is: straine them not in vnnecessarie things, but for such necessarie vses let them straine themselues; that they may be rich in good workes and not <hi>vnfruitfull.</hi> The verse standeth of a <hi>precept,</hi> and a <hi>reason.</hi> In the precept three points are to be considered, 1. what are these <hi>good workes</hi> meant. 2. who are bound especially vnto them, <hi>Let ours learne.</hi> 3. what are the <hi>necessarie vses</hi> of these and such like good workes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> by good workes are not properly here meant, all such actions in generall as are thus stiled in the Scripture: but in speciall those of bountifulnes and beneficence: both because those former were called for in the 8. ver. of this Chapter, as also in that these are especially suited vnto this argument. Now these are commended to the practise of the faithfull by the title of dignitie, in that they are called <hi>good workes:</hi> not that they are so absolutely and perfectly good, as that there is no sinne in them;<note place="margin">Bellarm. de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis. l. 4. c. 15.17.</note> (as the Papists contend) for the best workes are good only in part so farre as they proceed from the spirit, and from grace: and in part corrupt as they come from flesh and corrupt nature: of which two (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, flesh and spirit) euery regenerate man consisteth: and therefore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry action cannot but sauour of the fountaine from whence it streameth.

                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32.4.</note> which he doth in and by himselfe, yet such as he doth in and by man, who is another author, and actor of them, cannot but drawe imperfection from him. And whereas it is said, if good workes were sinnefull, then ought we not to doe them: the answer is, that we must not therefore refuse to do them, because they are not simply euill: but in themselues good, and partly good in the doer: commended to our
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:18792:376"/>
practise by God, of whom they are reputed good workes; and in his Christ pardoning the defects of them for our incouragement, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of them as if there were no sinne at all in them. Whence note, that good workes are so farre from iustifying, as that we are not able to answer one for ten thousand of them: and that it is the mercie of God, and not the dignitie of them, which bringeth this stile vpon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> of whom good workes are called for; <hi>Let ours,</hi> called in the 8. verse <hi>beleeuers in God. Ours,</hi> who are conuerted and confirmed in the faith by thy labour and mine; of these call for good workes. For this is the first condition of any good worke, that the worker must be a beleeuer in Christ.<note place="margin">Vbi Christus non est funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentumibi nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum est boni o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peris aedificium. Gregor. decr.</note> For 1. make the tree good, and then the fruit will be good: he must be a man that hath <hi>learned</hi> by the doctrine of the Gospel to doe a good worke, as the words of the verse imply. 2. the heart, the fountaine of all actions is naturally corrupt with originall sin, and the members are weapons of vnrighteousnesse: and therefore before the heart be purified by faith, the best actions passing through our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, wills, affections, and parts, can no more auoid tainture and pollution, then can the sweetest water running through a muddie channell, or the purest liquor standing in a fustie vessell. 3. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an vnbeleeuer hath not the sonne; neither hath the spirit of the Sonne; and consequently cannot send forth any <hi>fruites of the spirit:</hi> the Sonne hath not set him free, but he is bound hand and foote, and not able to mooue in any one action of spirituall life. 4. Hee that cannot pray by the spirit, cannot bring forth any worke truely good; nothing can be done without prayer; the Lord must giue strength, the will, and the deed: he must teach vs to worke, set vs in, and hold vs on in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: he must giue it successe and blessing, and make it fruitfull to our selues and others: and without the prayer of faith, nothing of this is obtained.<note place="margin">Rom. 14. Heb. 11. Faith doth fiue actions to make any worke good.</note> 5. Without faith it is impossible to please God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for to euery good worke are required many actions of faith. For 1. generall faith must make and warrant it good in the <hi>matter</hi>; and know it to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded or allowed in the word: for that is a good work which God will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> haue done: and good intentions if they roue without a word, make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good. 2. Speciall faith must know the action to be good in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>worker</hi> renewed in part, and accepted in Christ; who couereth the spots and imperfections of the worke: for the Lord first respecteth the person, and then the worke; first Abel, and then his sacrifice. 3. Faith loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the worke be good in the <hi>endes</hi> of it; a bad end spoileth the best action. Now the right ends of a good worke are, 1. <hi>Gods glorie:</hi> for as all riuers goe out of the sea, and returne againe into the sea; so all good actions as they come from God, so they tend vnto him againe: be
<pb n="735" facs="tcp:18792:376"/>
they the least and lowest, euen <hi>eating, drinking, or what soeuer else, all must be done to the glorie of God.</hi> 2. <hi>The good of our brethren,</hi> and edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men: for this end Christians must make their light to shine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad before men: and the <hi>whole law is fulfilled in this one word,</hi> Thou <hi>shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> 3. The <hi>exercise of our owne graces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.14.</note> by doing our owne duties to God and man: not selfe-pleasing, profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, praise, feare, shame, or such other sinister ends, as sway with the vnregenerate: but as is the end of the commandement, so must it be of our obedience, which is <hi>loue out of a pure heart, and faith vnfained,</hi> 1. Tim. 1.5. 4. Faith will prouide that good actions be compassed by good meanes: we may <hi>not doe euill that good may come of it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> It was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Rebecca her sinne to draw the promised blessing vpon Iacob by deceit: and Lots infirmitie to seeke deliuerance from the Sodomites by prosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting his daughters. And though sometimes bad meanes succeed,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> and the Lord by an ouerruling power bring light out of darkenesse, yet is there alwaies iust matter of mourning and humiliation. 5. Faith will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> haue respect to good circumstances, as times, places, persons, &amp;c. the fayling wherein, often blemisheth most bewtifull actions, and cause them to miscarie and prooue vnsuccesfull. In a word, faith in the heart is most carefull to doe good things well: and because it knoweth that when it hath done the best it can, yet all that seruice is vnprofitable, it claspeth fast hold vpon the righteousnesse of Christ, and will be found in that <hi>righteousnesse which is by faith in him,</hi> Phil. 3. And therefore as for all other, so for this good worke of beneficence and loue to the Saints, the Apostle wisheth Titus to goe to beleeuers, with whom he might be bold: as who had receiued a spirit of effectuall faith, working in obedience to God, and loue to Gods people, and could not suffer them to be either idle, or vnfruitfull in the worke of the Lord.<note place="margin">Nemo compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet bona opera sua ante fidem, vbi fides non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat bonum o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus non erat. in Psal. 30. praefat.</note> Well knew the Apostle that to haue sent him elsewhere on this errand, it had bin but the losse of both their labors; here he knew he should speed or no where. So as we may conclude this point with that speach of <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, where faith is not, no good worke can be.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third point in the precept is, that these good works must be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth for <hi>necessarie vses:</hi> why Christians should shewe forth good workes I haue formerly shewed in handling the 8. verse of this Chapter, and therefore will come to declare what are the necessare vses in generall of such good workes as are here called for. And here we must know that the Romish Church hath not more boldly then blasphemously pretended many necessarie vses of good workes, which the Scriptures (neuer inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to set them vp in the place of Christ) are far from acknowledging: a tast whereof I haue giuen in a fewe positions which are stiffely defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:18792:377"/>
by the pillars of that Church. As, 1. That good workes prepare a man to his iustification, whereas the former point shewed, that a man must be a iustified person before he can doe a good worke. 2. That they doe iustifie the person of the worker before God: notwithstanding the Apostle saith, that <hi>by the workes of the Lawe no flesh can be iustified.</hi> 3. That they make men more iust by a second iustification:<note place="margin">Gal. 2 16. Loquitur Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolus de omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus operibus tam ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alibus quam moralibus.

That they sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Gods iustice for temporall punishment. 5. That they merit heauen, yea a greater degree of glorie in heauen. 6. That they purge away sinnes, 7. That they apply Christs merit to purge them. 8. That they merit at Gods hand for ones selfe and others. 9. That they free from purgatorie paines. 10. That a man may raise his trust in God from them. All which with many other blasphemous tenures of this kind, directly thrust Christ from his throne, and make him but halfe a Sauiour at the most, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently no Sauiour at all. It would draw this point further then would well fit a commentarie to dispute here these positions with them, and therefore intending our busines in hand, and taking the mention of such hereticall blasphemies in this auditorie to be no small refutation: we come to those necessarie vses which are warranted by expresse Scripture, yea and thence commended vnto vs both in regard of 1. God, 2. our neighbour, 3. our selues.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Necessarie vses of good works. 1. In respect of God.</note>First, in regard of God good workes haue their necessarie vses. As, 1. that his name may be glorified by the professors of it; for it tends greatly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to his praise when in such workes as himselfe hath commanded his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> testifie their obedience and thankefulnesse. 2. that his Gospel may be beautified and adorned: of which see, cap. 2.10. 3. that himselfe may <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> be pleased and delighted (as men with sweete smels) with such <hi>sweete smelling sacrifices</hi> as these be, Heb. 13.16. Philip. 4.18. these are the myrrhe, and the spice which Christ gathereth when he commeth into his garden, Cant. 5.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2. Of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</note>Secondly, in respect of our neighbour these good workes of mercie and beneficence haue their excellent and necessarie vses; for euerie Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is a fruitfull branch of that vine, whereby both God and man is cheared. And whereas our neighbour is either <hi>vnconuerted</hi> or <hi>converted,</hi> they want not their speciall vse in regard of them both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> for the <hi>vnconuerted,</hi> they are either <hi>elect</hi> or <hi>reprobate.</hi> If they be <hi>elect,</hi> they may hence be prepared to their conuersion, and woone euen without the word, to the liking of the word and profession, which they see so holy, so charitable, and so plentifull in good works. Thus saith the
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:18792:377"/>
Apostle, that vnbeleeuing husbands may <hi>without the word</hi> be wonne <hi>by the godly conversation of their wiues:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.1.</note> and the same Apostle exhorteth the scattered and conuerted Iewes, to haue their <hi>conuersation honest</hi> among the Gentiles, that they which now did speake euill of them as euill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, might by <hi>their good workes be prouoked to glorifie God</hi> in the day of their visitation. But if they be <hi>wicked and belong not to God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.12.</note> yet by the godly liues of professors they shall be, 1. restrained, that they cannot so boldly rush into and tumble in their sinnes as they would: no more then Herodias could quietly enioy her sinne so long as Iohn Baptist was aliue, Mark. 6.19. 2. they shall haue their mouthes stopt and put to silence, when they would gladly open them wide against the truth, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors of it: <hi>And this is the will of God that by weldoing we put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.15.</note> 3. they shall be convinced and condemned in their consciences, and so prepared for the iudgement of God: and thus the Queene of the South condemned the Iewes; and Noah by buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Arke condemned the old world, Heb. 11.7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If the neighbour be <hi>conuerted,</hi> he is either <hi>weake,</hi> and then he is hereby confirmed, strengthed, and brought on: or else he is <hi>strong,</hi> and then he is further prouoked, yea his heart is gladded, and further knit to such a one, as in whom he seeth such sparkles of Gods image to shine. And thus was Titus his <hi>inward affection more aboundant</hi> toward the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinths, when he remembred <hi>the obedience of them all:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.15.</note> so was Pauls also by the faith and grace of the Philippians, 1.5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in regard of <hi>our selues,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3. Of our selues.</note> they haue many necessarie and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vses: As, 1. to make our election sure to our selues, 2. Pet. 1.10.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 2. we may by them discerne the soundnesse of our owne graces: as sauing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> knowledge will be operatiue, liuely faith will be working, effectuall loue will be an hand giuing out, sound hope will be purging, Christian thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse wil appeare in good works, which are called sacrifices of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, true charitie and mercifulnesse will go beyond that mouth-mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of which Iames speaketh: for else all is vnsound; whosoeuer, saith he,<note place="margin">Iam. 2.16.</note> loueth God and keepeth not his commandements, is a lyar, 1. Ioh. 2.3. for that loue of God or men is vnsound which is in tongue &amp; word, but not indeed and truth, as witnesseth the Apostle, 1. Ioh. 3.18. 3. by these <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fruits other men also may discerne the soundnes of our faith and graces:<note place="margin">Opera non sunt causa quod ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis sit iustus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pud deum sed potius execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones &amp; mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festationes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitiae. Aquin in Gal. 3. lect. 4. Iam. 2.18.</note> for although good workes cannot iustifie the person before God, yet they must iustifie the faith of the person before men: and therefore Iames saith, <hi>shewe me thy faith by thy workes:</hi> and of Abel is said, that he <hi>obtained witnes</hi> that he was righteous, in that he offred a better sacrifice then Cain, Heb. 11.4. 4. They doe our selues good both <hi>in this life, and in the life to come.</hi> 1. In this life they profit vs in our <hi>outward</hi> estate and <hi>inward.</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                  <pb n="738" facs="tcp:18792:378"/>
They bring blessing to our <hi>outward estate:</hi> for God hath promised, that he that <hi>watereth shal haue raine,</hi> and <hi>that the mercifull man shall not want:</hi> yea, they drawe vpon vs not onely the blessing of God, but of men also, who blesse the mercifull man by many prayers, which Iob made no small account of; when in the depth of his distresse, hereby he comforted him selfe, that the blessing of the poore came vpon him. Thus Onesiphorus his mercie towards Paul, beeing at Rome in trouble, brought the feruent prayers of so great an Apostle vpon himselfe and his house, 2. Tim. 1.18. Besides this they doe our names good, and helpe to purchase a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,<note place="margin">Prov. 22.1.</note> which is better then a <hi>pretious oyntment.</hi> Abraham by his workes was commended that he was iust, Iam. 2.21. and of the good and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull man it is said, that his name shall not be put out. As for our <hi>inward estate,</hi> they make that farre more thriuing, for euerie grace is strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the execrcise of it, as no talent was vsed but to encrease; for as prayer is increased by praying, and knowledge by instructing, so is loue by almes, and mercie by distributing; without which exercise all would rust, and become as a sword kept in the scabbard, till the heart become like the sluggards field, ouergrowne with thornes and briars, but most vnreadie to any good worke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the life to come they are profitable, for they procure a mercifull reward: and beeing a <hi>sowing to the spirit,</hi> we shall reape of them in the haruest life euerlasting: yea and more, they procure a proportionable measure of glorie; for according to the measure of faith and grace in the worke, the recompence may well be thought to be: a cuppe of cold water shall not loose the reward; but yet he that soweth more liberally shall more liberally reape. And as in hell are degrees of torments, for some shall be beaten <hi>with more stripes,</hi> some with fewer: and it shall be easier with some then other, and yet both condemned: so is it probably held that in heauen shall be degrees of glorie,<note place="margin">Dan. 12.3.</note> (for some shall shine as the firmament, some as the starres, in which is greater light; yea one starre differeth from another in glorie) and this according to the gayning of talents,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note> for he that gaineth fiue talents shall rule ouer fiue cities, and he shall rule ouer tenne cities that hath gayned tenne talents. Not that the gayning of the talents meriteth any such recompence; no more then a cup of cold water giuen to a disciple in the name of a disciple, or a mite cast into the treasurie: neither of which shall loose their reward; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause faithfull is he which hath promised.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. This doctrine meeteth with that slanderous imputation of the Church of Rome against our doctrine: who beare the world in hand that our religion is a destroyer of good workes, and an enemie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all charitable actions: whereas we call for them as fruits of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="739" facs="tcp:18792:378"/>
as ornaments to our calling, as pledges of our election, as witnesses of our sound faith and graces, and as the very <hi>way which God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to walke to heauen in.</hi> Our religion permitteth not any to stand idle in the vinyard; we say let him not eate that will not worke; yea we teach a necessitie of good workes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> beleeuers, as well as the Papists do:<note place="margin">Necessitas haec est praesentiae, non efficientiae.</note> howsoeuer not as causes of saluation and iustification, yet as insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble companions of liuely and sauing faith: only let Christ hold his place, and they shall not set them higher then wee; and let them giue them no more then the Scriptures doe, and we will giue them neuer a whit lesse.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. Seeing by good workes we glorifie God, edifie our brethren, and doe our selues so much good, let vs be prouoked to the diligent practise thereof. Neither let any man thinke himselfe exempt from this doctrine, be he neuer so poore: for we are not of the Popish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> beleefe, who thinke that only such great and glorious workes, as building Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, Colledges, high-waies, or giuing goods and Lands to the Church, or almes deeds, and such like, deserue the name of good workes: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man hath a double calling, namely, the generall calling of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and the speciall calling of life wherein God hath set him; and there is neuer a dutie of either of these (be it neuer so base or seruill) if performed in saith and obedience, but it is a good worke, and pleasing vnto God. But what shall we say of them, who by open wicked life, professe contempt of God and his word, hatred of the light and the bringers of it? that cast backe, yea pull backe many others who might be brought on: and so accustome themselues to graceles courses, as they can no more change them then the Ethiopian his skin? certainly these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they also will bragge of a good faith to God-ward; yet is it no better then the deuils haue; who shall as soone be saued by their faith, as these by this, if timely they repent not.</p>
               <q>That they be not vnfruitfull]</q>
               <p>These words containe in them the reason of the former precept, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by an excellent metaphor, or borrowed speach, he prouoketh Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to the practise of good workes. The metaphor implieth that as the Church is Gods orchard <hi>or garden,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 4.16.</note> and his Ministers are his <hi>planters</hi> and <hi>waterers</hi>; so the faithfull are the trees, euen <hi>trees of righteousnesse,</hi> the <hi>planting of the Lord,</hi> and planted by the <hi>riuers of waters,</hi>

                     <hi>Doctr.</hi> Christianitie is no barren and fruitlesse pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession.</note> vnto which Christians are euery where called. In Ezech. 47.12. we haue a notable resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of those manifold fruits, which by the power of the Gospell should be by beleeuers produced in the Church of the new Testament.
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:18792:379"/>
The vision was of waters which runne from the Temple, and from vnder the threshold of the sanctuarie. And wheresoeuer these waters should runne, they should cause admirable fruitfulnesse, in so much as on both sides of the riuer shall grow all kind of fruitfull trees, whose leafe shall not fade, and their fruite shall not falle. These waters are the Gospel which issue from vnder the threshold: that is, from Christ the doore, typified by that bewtifull gate of the Temple; from the Temple at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem these waters were with swift current to runne not only ouer Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, but all the world in a short space: hence was the Church mightily increased, for though these waters runne into the dead sea, wherein (if we beleeue Histories) abideth no liuing thing:<note place="margin">Plin. nat. hist. lib. 2. cap. 103.</note> yet such a quickning pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they carrie with them, as euen there euery thing shall liue: such as were dead in trespasses and sinnes, are hereby quickned, and become trees of righteousnesse greene and flourishing, yea and constantly fruitfull in all godly conuersation. And this is the same which our Sauiour noteth, Ioh. 15.1. that his Father is the husbandman, himselfe is the vine, Christians are the branches of that vine: who if they be sound, his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purgeth that they may bring forth more fruite: teaching vs hereby, that it is the Lords scope and ayme, that Christians should be abundant in fruits beseeming their profession. The Apostle Paul accordingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth the Philippians to be <hi>much</hi> in goodnesse, to <hi>abound</hi> in loue, in knowledge,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.11.</note> and in all iudgement; yea to be <hi>filled with fruits of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which are by Iesus Christ vnto the glorie and praise of God.</hi> And the same Apostle calleth rich men to <hi>be rich in good workes.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. If we consider our time, we shall confesse it more then time to yeild vp our fruits: our Master hath suffred vs our first yeare already, yea &amp; our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> second, nay we are in our third yeare (or rather beyond our third score of yeares) if this be not the yeare of our fruit, can we look to stand longer, &amp; not be stocked vp? Furthermore, this is our summer, our Autumne: neuer had our fathers before vs such a season, so fitted to fruitfulnesse, as this

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 4. The barren condition hath little comfort in it, and the danger of vnfruitfulnes is verie great. For Gods fearefull displeasure disburdeneth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it selfe, and seaseth on such persons by sundrie degrees. 1. The Lord <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecteth them:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 5.6.</note> for if the Lords labour be not answered, he will <hi>pull downe the fence, breake downe the wall,</hi> leaue his owne vineyard to wast, owne it who will: and what can be more fearefull, then for a man to be left by God, to become a lodge for deuills, and lusts, and wasting sinnes; which yet is the state of many a man, who is vtterly vnfeeling and sensles of it. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Degree of Gods curse on such fruitlesse branches, is the <hi>withering,</hi> which presently followeth <hi>their casting forth:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.6.</note> and this the Lord bringeth on them two wayes; sometimes by remoouing meanes of fruitfulnesse; and so hauing laid his vineyard wast, hee threatneth in the next place, that <hi>the clouds should not raine vpon it,</hi> Isa. 5.6. And sometimes by blowing vpon the gifts he had giuen; he shall loose his sappe and greennes he once had: the vnprofitable seruant after conuiction must haue his <hi>talent taken from him:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 19.</note> and this curse is so eminent vpon many men, that comparing them with themselues not long since, a man may say as the disciples of the figge tree, against which the curse was passed from the mouth of Christ,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.20.</note> 
                  <hi>how soone is the figge tree withered?</hi> 3. An other degree is, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> no meanes shall be able henceforth to doe such a person any good; but the curse being passed against him, this is one branch of it, that he shall be like <hi>the heath in the wildernes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 17.6.</note> 
                  <hi>which shall not see when any good commeth.</hi> Now the heath it hath good comming vpon it, the raine falleth, the sun shineth, the spring and summer season returneth vpon it, but it seeth none of this good, but remaineth a drie and parched heath still: euen so is it with a barren soule, which God hath begunne to curse, the raine, the sunne, the season, the word, Sacraments, dayes of grace, Iesu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doe him no good; he sees no good towards him in all those: nay, the word iudgeth him, the Sacraments are poyson vnto him, and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is a rocke of offence to him, on whom he breaketh the necke of his soule. Hence was it, that after the Lord had reiected his vineyard, he
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:18792:380"/>
sends his Prophet with his word among them, but to what ende: <hi>Goe, make the heart of this people fat, and their eares heauie, and shut their eies,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isa. 6.10.</note> 
                  <hi>least they see with their eies, and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their hearts, and conuert, and I heale them:</hi> so as the good meanes of saluation doe such persons no good. And let no man thinke that this message onely concerned the Iewes; for it is repeated sixe times in the newe Testament, that we should not slightly passe it ouer, but feare the like iudgement, if we be found in the like sinne. 4. After all these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the heauie sentence, vnto which by all these this sinner hath beene <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> prepared; Cut him downe, bring now the axe, for the pruning knife hath done him no good; hewe him downe by death from the ministerie vnder which he hath beene so long fruitlesse, bind him hand and foote, make a faggot of him, and cast him into hel fire: cast I say that vnprofitable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant into vtter darkenesse, there shall be wayling and gnashing of teeth: and this is the wofull hire of vnfruitfulnesse.</p>
               <p>The third point is the hindrances of this fruitfulnesse,<note place="margin">Hindrances of this fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes three.</note> the cheefe of which are these. 1. superfluitie of lusts, and inordinate desires which are as dead branches, and therefore must be lopped off before fruit can be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> expected: the deniall of a mans selfe so farre as corrupt is the first lesson in Christianitie. 2. The vnfitnesse of the soyle, as if it be stonie or neere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> vnto a rocke where it cannot take deepe roots; the hard and stonie heart suffereth not any good seed to take roote, and much lesse rise vp to fruite. Or if the soyle be a drie ground on which the raine falls not, or an hie and hillie ground on which the raine staieth not; so the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and proud heart shutteth off the raine as fast as it commeth, it moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth the crust and outside a little, but it staieth not to get within it to prepare it to fruitfulnesse. Or if the ground be shaded that the sunne cannot or seldome looke vpon it: if the minde and affections are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise distracted, that seldome men set themselues vnder the meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; the sunne of righteousnesse shining in his Church, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning, not warming nor cherishing them, not bringing backe a new spring vpon them, how can we expect fruit from such vnlesse we can looke that a tree which hath beene fruitlesse all the summer, should be laden with fruit in the midst of winter. 3. Sundrie vaine conceits sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by the Deuil, and assented vnto by men to keepe them in vnfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full courses. As 1. many will not sticke to obiect, I hope notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I haue not beene hitherto so fruitfull as you speake of, yet I haue done well inough all this while, and why may not I doe so still; and thus resolue because God hath vsed patience and spared them, he will therefore spare them still in their vnfruitfulnesse. But this is the Deuils logicke: the cleane contrarie whereof is the conclusion of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<pb n="744" facs="tcp:18792:381"/>
Hath God spared thee the second and third yeare, and art thou still fruitles, he must now needs call for the axe; &amp; this is that which thou must expect. 2. Another saith, oh but I am a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Church, &amp; what talke you to mee, I heare the word, receiue the Sacram<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nts, and though I be not so forward and strict, I hope I shall doe wel inough. Which is all one, as if a fruitles tree should reply to the master and say; I hope master, thou wilt not cut mee downe, I am in thy orchard, and stand neere thy house; if I were in the wast I should thinke thou should care lesse for me: but will not the master reply and say, that thou must rather goe downe becase thou standest vnprofitable in mine orchard, I cannot endure thou shouldst keepe any part of that ground barren: if thou wert in the wast thou mighst haue stood longer; but mine eye is next my house; if thou wilt be still vnprofitable get the into thee wast, here is no more place or roome for thee. 3. Others replie and say, oh but we are not so fruitlesse as you take vs, and what desire you more? whereunto I say, that such haue great need to desire better euidences to alledge for themselues then this, if this be all: it is not inough if a tree could say, I bring no bad fruit as thistles, and thornes; and therefore must needs be a good tree: no, for a good tree constantly bringeth much good fruit. So is it not inough for thee to alleage what thou hast not, or what thou art not; thou must not be a priuate but a positiue Christian laden with the fruits of the spirit, else hast thou lost all thy labour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. It is not sufficient to be harmelesse men, which many rest in as sound fruits of religion; seeing that for all this they shall be cast out as drie branches, and men shall gather them to the fire: there goe two things to the beeing of a good Christian,<note place="margin">Psal 34.</note> 1. to eschew euill: and 2. to doe good; and the sentence of condemnation in the iudgement day shal run against not only those that haue done euill, but those also who haue done no good: see Matth. 25.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will not goe for payment to be a Christian by profession if fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: it is the constitution, and I may say the destynie of the Church to haue in it painted sepulchres, such as the Prophets in their times were troubled with, who had nothing in their mouthes but the Temple, the Temple; and yet remained in their liues most wicked men: and others there were that pretending outward holinesse aboue others, would ioyne fasting to their prayer, but yet rotten and withered branches: such were they that were Iewes without, in the face, and in the lette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>: But the sound Christian is discerned not by leaues but fruits of the spirit: and they are the true Israelities who are so within, whose praise is of God and not of men. The figge tree had leaues inough; and by the flourishing &amp; greennes seemed to promise great store of fruit: but when Christ drew
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:18792:381"/>
neere, looked for fruit and found none: he said, neuer more fruit grow vpon thee. Let vs take heed in time of such a wofull sentence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Euery man must by this doctrine take occasion to enter into the examination of himselfe by the fruits of his faith and profession: and by vnpartiall sifting of themselues. Some will doubtlesse say; I find some fruites in my selfe (I praise God) but so much corruption as vtterly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayeth me, that I know not what I may thinke of my estate. But let such be of good cheare, seeing the promise is, that if there be any fruit at all God will purge that branch, and helpe it against corruption,<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.2.</note> so as it groane still vnder corruption, and after grace; the least bud of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>mination shall find that they haue had better fruits then now, that they are become copper Christians, now compared to their former golden times; and beeing fallen from their first loue, may say with shame in their faces, and sorrow in their soules; alas I was thus and thus. But let such be aduised to looke well to their standing; for sure it is that either such were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ingrafted into the stocke by effectuall calling, but rather tyed (as a science to a tree) by a threed of outward calling and profession: or else a dangerous disease hath seased on them, which threatneth the death of the soule, if it be not timely preuented. True grace is not as nature which beeing past the vigor decayeth: but a man in grace is still grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and can be a child no more. Others by examining shall find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues laden with bitter clusters of couetousnesse, pride, contention, and sundrie other lusts; who notwithstanding they professe the Gospel are resolued to grow sowrer and sowrer, more loathsome to God, and loathing goodnes; but these are strange fruits of their profession, and argue them to be but seare and rotten wood already, and are not far from burning.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>All that are with mee</hi>] In these words our Apostle would haue Titus to knowe, that all the Christians that were with him, embraced him with all Christian and louing affection, and would haue their mindfulnesse of him witnessed by a kind and familiar salutation. The vse whereof was, 1. to testifie their loue towards him. 2. to knit the bond of it more firme
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:18792:382"/>
and closely. 3. to encourage Titus in his godly course; when he should heare from the Apostles mouth, that for the same all good men approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him and wished him all good proceedings. And hence we may note, 1. what is the vse of this most auncient and approoued custome of saluting one another by writing; namely, to signifie a louing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the partie saluted, with an earnest desire of their good and welfare: for that is a common affection to all salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to signifie such a desire. And yet there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one salutation and an other, which riseth from the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the persons saluting. Whereof some are meerely ciuill men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all religion; and these could not reach to wish their friends the best blessings, although they wished them the best they could reach; as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie formes both of the Greekes and Latines testifie.<note place="margin">

Salutem. lat.</note> Others haue more in them then humanitie, in that they apprehend the higher graces of God in his Christ reuealed in the Gospel; and hauing their owne parts therein, they most freely &amp; feelingly in their salutations wish their friends to partake with them; first in such graces as may accompanie their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then in all that outward prosperitie that shall make for their good: and these are the salutations of the Apostles, and of good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they be no court holy water; nor <hi>salutare libenter,</hi> from teeth out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but heartie and vnfained testimonies of loue, much making for the encrease of mutuall loue, yea and the strengthening of the bond of the communion of Saints. Now if this be the vse of salutations; we may see how grossely the Papists are besotted in <hi>martyring</hi> (that I may vse Luthers word) the Angels salutation to Marie. For, 1. whereas a salutation is a ciuil thing, they haue turned this into a deuout praier. 2. not to Marie whome the words concerned alone, but vnto God at whose hands the repeating of it meriteth pardon of many sinnes. 3. whereas salutation is to be done to a partie present among vs, this saluteth one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. 4. whereas it was the angels dutie to carrie this message once to Marie; they thrust euerie man and woman into the Angels office, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the same message euerie moment; as if it were a thing not alreadie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. 5. what further good can they wish to Marie now in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: But they haue despised the wisedome of God; and what wisedom can be in them?</p>

                  <hi>Quest.</hi> May we not salute any but beleeuers? <hi>Answ.</hi> There is a common salutation, which is due from euery man to euery man; and that is a ciuill curtesie and kind of honour which is to be shewed to <hi>all men:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.17.</note> our Sauiour Christ commanded his Disciples whensoeuer they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into an house they <hi>should salute</hi> the same, Matth. 10.12. and gaue them a forme of salutation which they must vse whether <hi>the sonne of peace</hi> were there or no, saying, <hi>peace be to this house.</hi>

                     </gap>0.5.</note> Yea if men be our enemies and will not vouchsafe to salute vs againe, yet we must not omit this branch of courteous behauiour towards them, Matth. 5.47. If <hi>yee be freindly to your brethren only, what singular thing doe yee? doe not euen the Publicans the same.</hi> The word tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="748" facs="tcp:18792:383"/>
more, we must not expect to see whether we be saluted first, but kindly salute our enemies, although we be not saluted againe. And the reason is, because it was counted a signe of hatred not to salute a man. 2. Sam. 13.22. Absolon said <hi>neither good nor bad</hi> to his brother; for <hi>Absolon</hi> hated <hi>Amnon.</hi> Whereas Christians on the contrarie must thinke on such things as may preuent offence, procure loue, and winne if it may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen estran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> But yet howsoeuer this salutation is generally due from equall to equall; yet there are some excepted cases in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. such a one as lyeth in some open sinne, and hateth to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; not yeelding to godly counsell out of the word: a superiour here may forbeare to speake to such a one by way of correction; but so as he must haue care that he aime at the fault, and not at the person, and make it so known to the person, that he testifieth not the hatred of his person but of his sinne.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 14.24.</note> Thus Dauid banished Absolon from the court for killing Amnon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There are open enemies of God, and of his truth, &amp; of his Church, who haue sold themselues to maligne it; such sworne enemies wee may not thus embrace: 2. Ioh. 10. <hi>If any man bring not this doctrine, bid him not God speede:</hi> and 2. King. 3.14. Elisha telleth Iehoram an idolatrous king, that had it not beene for <hi>the good king Iehosaphat, he would not haue looked vpon him, nor seene him.</hi> And yet this hindreth nothing but that we must salute our owne priuate enemies, though we may not the open enemies of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If any haue sinned the sinne vnto death, we may not pray for them, &amp; therfore not salute them, 1. Ioh. 5.16. This is the former kind of saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but not that which the Apostle speaketh of in the text, but the latter: which is a more inward and entire affection betweene such as are of the houshold of faith; who are straitlye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> knit together then by the bonds of humanitie and ciuill conuersation: for besides these, they are tyed by the bond of the spirit, of faith, of a most holy profession, and are brethren not in the flesh, but in the faith, yea heires of the selfe same inheritance in glorie. These are said to loue <hi>one another in the faith.</hi> If they therefore be to be kindly saluted which hate vs, much more they which loue vs; and if they which loue vs in the flesh, much more they which loue vs in the faith; and that with a most heartie and large affection.</p>
               <p>Hence note, 1. that religion bindeth man to man in the straitest bond: for 1. the spirit is the tye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eph. 4.3.</note> and hence is it called <hi>the vnitie of the spirit</hi> in the bond of peace: and indeede it must be a wonderfull bond that can reconcile such deadly enemies as men are before they come into the kingdome of Christ, Isa. 11.6. 2. Gods image wheresoeuer it is, is exceeding beautifull, and a great binder; especially where renewed and
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:18792:383"/>
repaired; which beeing once espied, let the outward condition be what it can be, a religious heart seeth sufficient matter of loue, and will knit the soule vnto the soule of such a one. 3. It addeth strength and firmenesse to all other bonds of nature, affinitie, desert, &amp;c. and maketh them more naturall. What a true friend was Ionathan to Dauid, because he saw that God was with him, his soule claue vnto him; though the kingdome was to be rent from him for it, yet could he not rent his heart from Dauid. If Ioseph had not had more then nature; he could not but haue reuenged such infinite wrongs vpon his brethren; whereas the grace of his heart made him say, <hi>It was not you my brethren, but God sent me before you.</hi> Consider also of the example beyond all imitation of our Lord Iesus Christ, who gaue himselfe to the death for vs when we were yet his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. 4. This loue must needes be most lasting;<note place="margin">2. Ioh. 2.</note> for beeing <hi>loue in the truth for the truthes sake,</hi> it shall continue so long as the truth doth: but the <hi>truth abideth with vs, and shall abide with vs for euer</hi>· and this is the cause, that whereas the loue of nature dieth with it, and the loue of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men dieth with their persons, this loue liueth in death, yea when goeth to heauen with a man,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.</note> and getteth strength and perfection then faith ceaseth, and hope vanisheth away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> 1. Whence we are taught most familiarly to embrace them that loue vs in the faith, and to make most account of their loue.<note place="margin">Verus amicus qui vere &amp; in Deo diligit.</note> Many loue in the face, many in the flesh, many in nature, onely the loue of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans is a fruit of faith, a worke of the spirit, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>herefore a surer bond then they all. Well knew the Apostle that none was in comparison worth ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but this, he calleth for no other, he careth for no other, he mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as set into any societie with others; if he would haue it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable vnto him, let him strengthen all other naturall or ciuill bonds by this bond of religion, let him labour to begin his loue in the faith, or if he haue begunne elsewhere alreadie, let him reforme the same hereby if he looke for any sound comfort in his estate: for this is the cause that men often haue so little returne of loue from their wiues, so little obedience from their children, so little dutie from their seruants, so slender respect from their equalls, because they begin their loue and duties at a wrong ende: and haue for other respects affected those with whome they liue, but the least if at all for grace and religion, which of all is the soundest, most profitable, and most comfortable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But how may I knowe whether I loue an other in the faith o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no? <hi>Answ.</hi> By these notes, 1. If thou loue him because he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christ: for this loue must be a fruit of faith; and knitteth him that hath it to the members, as faith doth to the head. 2. If thou loue his
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:18792:384"/>
soule first, and will not suffer sinne vpon it. 3. If thou spyest, and dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence the image of God in him, and louest him that is begotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of him that begat, and preferrest the grace of his heart aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward parts and respects. 4. If thou aboue all other things wish him, yea if it be in thy power, helpe him to a further part in the better part which shall neuer be taken from him. 5. If the more thou seest grace to growe in him, the more entire thy loue groweth towards him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This point sheweth their fearefull condition, that make religion the verie cause of their hatred and malice against the godly: an apparant marke of the deuill is stamped vpon them, who for this cause compasseth the earth, that if it were possible, he might chase the image of God from off the face of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that the Apostle saluteth such as <hi>loued them</hi> in the faith, we may note what a mighty power the Gospel carrieth with it where the Lord will haue it effectuall. These Cretians had beene a vile people, and of most bruitish behauiour, as we haue at large heard in the first Chapter: but now there were amongst them such as loued Paul, and such as claue vnto him in the faith: the Gospel had tamed and subdued them, had tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them out of their sauage and cruell natures: had made them tractable and docible, and of <hi>euill beasts,</hi> had reduced them to Christian affection and conversation: but of this we haue spoken before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grace be with you all, Amen.</hi>] This is Pauls ordinarie farwell, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own hand in all his Epistles, whereas the Epistles themselues were written out by some of his Scribes: And it is added, 1. as the marke of his owne Epistle, that he might preuent counterfeit writings: for well knew he how neerely it concerned the Church to cleaue vnto those wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which were indited by the holy Ghost, inspiring the Prophets and and Apostles, and not to haue any other bastard writings obtruded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, in which practise the deuill was restlesse euen in those times. 2. As a testimonie of singular affection and good will, which can be by no better meanes expressed then by frequent and earnest prayers: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his bowells were not straitned toward Titus and the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him; seeing he wisheth the verie fountaine of <hi>grace,</hi> to be opened vnto them: for this word (as we shewed in the beginning) sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth both the free loue and fauour of God towards vs in Christ, as also all other spirituall blessings flowing from that fountaine: such as are remission of sinnes, reconciliation with God, iustification, sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, life eternall, and all the meanes tending thereunto. 3. That beeing an Apostolicall prayer, it might also be a meanes of obtaining, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaying vpon them the grace requested: and although he had made the same request for them before, yet it is no vaine repetition; for partly he
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:18792:384"/>
prayeth for the encrease and further feeling of this grace for them: and partly teacheth vs thereby that it is the only blessing to be prayed for, the cheife, if not only grace, which our selues are to labour for; and which we must by all meanes endeauour, that others may haue their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in with vs. 4. To shew that all our greeting must beginne and end in grace, and that our formes of salutation should fauour of grace, and not be profane, gracelesse, or formall as the most are. 5. Beeing a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of grace, he beginneth and endeth with it: and teacheth Ministers that their first and last action of the day, and of their Ministeriall dutie should be the commending of their people vnto the grace of God in their praiers; and besides, if ordinarie letters, much more other more weightie actions of men, must be vndertaken and performed with praier and praise.</p>
               <p>Secondly in that he saith, Grace be <hi>with you:</hi> he sheweth that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer this Epistle was inscribed to <hi>Titus</hi> alone, yet was it intended to be of common vse to the whole Church:<note place="margin">Scribit vni sed propter totam ecclesiam. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin.</note> and therefore we haue not vnfitly applied the most of the doctrines to the vse, not of Ministers only, but of all sorts of men so farre as they concerned them.</p>
               <p>Last of all, in that he saith, grace be with <hi>you all,</hi> he meaneth all the elect, and only they: for only they are effectuall partakers of this sauing <hi>grace,</hi> called often elsewhere the <hi>grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> the treasurie and fountaine of it. The wicked are indeede endued with excellent gifts of Gods spirit; but they want this <hi>grace</hi> of God in Christ, which is the only foundation of our election to the grace of life, of our effectuall vocation to the grace of God wherein we stand, and of that assured hope of that heauenly inheritance which he hath purchased <hi>of his grace.</hi> By this grace we are happily reconciled vnto God, and adopted to be <hi>heyres of grace:</hi> hereby also we haue receiued the word of <hi>grace,</hi> which is made fruitfull to the planting and watering of all other sauing <hi>graces</hi> in vs, and so to the furthering and finishing of the whole worke of our saluation in glorie.</p>
               <p>This grace be euer with vs, and all them that loue the comming of our Lord Iesus Christ to their immortalitie. Amen. So shall it be. And so be it.</p>
               <p>To God the <hi>Father of lights,</hi> and to Iesus Christ that <hi>eternall word,</hi> together with that <hi>annoynting</hi> euen the blessed spirit, the only, one, true and wise God (who hath happily led vs through these labours) be all praise and glorie in all the Churches for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. Amen.</p>
