            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ee had certaine newes of the taking the <hi>Newry</hi> by the Lord <hi>Conway</hi> on the one ſide, and Sir <hi>Henry Tichborne,</hi> where were relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome Priſoners of note, as Sir <hi>Arthur Trevor,</hi> Sir <hi>Charles Poynes,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Priſoners ſince the beginning of this rebellion, not many Rebels were killed for they fled.</p>
            <p>Alſo, that <hi>Carlneigford</hi> was taken from the Rebels by one of our Ships comming in with French Colours: the Enemy thinking it to bee ſome Ship of <hi>Munſter,</hi> for the chiefeſt came aboord and ſo were kept, and the ſhip entred further and tooke the Towne.</p>
            <p>We had news that young Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> had done good ſervice about <hi>Iames</hi> towne in killing ſome Rebels, and releeving ſome Caſtles.</p>
            <p>That day the Lord <hi>Loyer</hi> came with his Troope from him to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten more reliefe to Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> that was there.</p>
            <p>The ſixth day Colonell <hi>Craford</hi> went out ſome twelve miles with 300 foot toward a place called <hi>Kilcocke</hi> to forrage.</p>
            <p>The 7. day, 1200 men were ſent to <hi>Trim</hi> to Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> but many of them threw downe their Armes, and refuſed and mutined for want of pay, and when one was taken out to be hanged for example, the reſt reſcued him, and with much a doe this Mutiny was alayed, and they went, but wee are in much feare of ſuch a riſing, here being no money to pay them.</p>
            <p>Newes alſo that the Lord <hi>Mongarrat</hi> had gathered his forces to the number of 10000 and was marching againe to the <hi>Naaſe,</hi> where we have a garriſon, two Troopes were ſent to ſtrengthen the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon.</p>

8. Day Colonell <hi>Craford</hi> returned home, having falne upon the enemie the day before at <hi>Kilkocke,</hi> and killed ſome 50, the reſt runne a way, and he brought a way from them 300 Cowes, and 600 ſheep, a great ſervice as things goe now.</p>
            <p>The ninth day was moſt unhappy newes to us, for newes came that Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> being at <hi>Trim,</hi> ſome, or all the Lords of the <hi>Pale</hi> had on the Sunday (before thoſe forces of ours were come to Sir <hi>Charles)</hi> gathered a multitude of 3000. or more, intending to take <hi>Trim</hi> from Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> who was at that time but weake, having but 120. horſe, and 200 foot; in the morning they ſet on the Towne, and Sir <hi>Charles</hi> ruſhed out againſt them, becauſe his men were not ſo quicke in making them ready, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> entred the thickeſt of them with but 17 Horſe and himſelfe, and routed the whole body of the enemies Army, a wonder; and the reſt came in and they fell to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and the enemy to running. Some 200 of the enemies were killed, but moſt unhappily was Sir <hi>Charles Coot</hi> ſhot and killed by one of our men, whether wilfully by ſome Papiſt or otherwiſe, it is not knowne, but the glory of our battell is gone, every one is beclou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: the moſt unhappie day ever befell the Proteſtants: and ſuch joy to Papiſts that no other thing was deſired of them more then this, whoſe name was their terrour: for hee with 100 men could doe more againſt them then others with a 1000. often have the enemys confeſt they could not hold up their heads to fight againſt him; who know not what we have loſt in him, a <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his valour, and a <hi>Gate</hi> for honeſty to his Countrey, a father to us all; that ſought not ſo much as for plunder, for his Countreys good, a man ſo well read in the nature and courſe of the Iriſh men and Countrey none like him left us, every day bemoaning him, and the enemy rejoycing; Never to much can bee ſaid of him, ſuch wonders he hath done ſince theſe times, for under God he hath beene the inſtrument of our delivery.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Day a Garriſon departed to <hi>Butoke</hi> of 50. to keepe a Caſtle there; Alſo, a Lievtenant was ſhot to death with us for killing a woman.</p>
            <p>Alſo, newes that Sir <hi>William Coules</hi> had done very good ſervice, Who in the middle of the Enemy hath held out ſince the firſt of this, and now had burnt all 13. miles about him in the North; Alſo, that the Scots were gone to releeve <hi>Coulreain</hi> and <hi>Derry</hi> beſieged by the enemie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64740:3"/>
This 11 day we had news that the Lord <hi>Mongarral</hi> advanced nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the <hi>Naaſe</hi> being incouraged by Sir <hi>Charles</hi> his death, but little feare they him there. Alſo, certaine newes that the Earle of <hi>Fingall</hi> was killed by Sir <hi>Charles,</hi> the day before his death, and <hi>Gormiſton</hi> a Lord wounded.</p>
            <p>Alſo, newes that the forenamed 1200 were got well into <hi>Trim,</hi> and had made out againſt the enemie ſix miles beyond and killed many.</p>

               <hi>May</hi> 12. 1642.</head>
            <p>This day we had newes from the North, that the Scots bent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for to releeve <hi>Couleraine</hi> beſieged by the Rebels, and that Sir Sit <hi>Philem O'Neall</hi> had burnt <hi>Armagh</hi> to the ground Church and all, alſo <hi>Charlemont</hi> and <hi>Caſtle Blanny,</hi> and fled to the woods and bogges for feare of the Engliſh and Scots forces in the North.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Trim</hi> we heard that Colonell <hi>Gibſon,</hi> in Sir <hi>Simon Harcourts</hi> time had broke upon the enemy, killed 200. and more, chaſed them to a bay foure miles, they run and burnt the <hi>Naven</hi> for feare, and other places ſome 7. miles from <hi>Trim,</hi> and departed further into the North.

            <p n="14">14. Day, Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> was buried with much lamentation to Proteſtants, and much joy to Papiſts.</p>
            <p>Alſo a Troope went to the <hi>Naas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That day one Captaine <hi>Sterling</hi> a Scot, being in Garriſon at a plaine called <hi>Kilſh<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

            <p>That day Colonell <hi>Craford</hi> went out to recover his body, and did ſo, and killed of all ſorts in revenge neere a 100. even protected and all, and juſtly.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Day being Sunday, every Pulpit was filled with funerall Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons and Prayers, For Sir <hi>Charles</hi> was buried the day before, for he is not to us like other dead men, which dying are forgot, but ſtill more daily remembred, and juſtly our want of him calls for it.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Day we heard ſome ſcattering newes of a Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

the Scots and Iriſh in the North at <hi>Coulerane,</hi> but as yet it remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine how true.</p>
            <p>That day ſome few Horſe went out for us to plunder and were ſome of them loſt, about two and not more.</p>
            <p>About 12. a clocke that night on the North part of this City being on the other ſide of the River, was an alarm by ſome of the enemies horſemen, ſome ſay more then a 100. which charged our Sentinell, but our men charging them againe with a few foot they ſet ſpurs and run without loſſe on any ſide, but ſome cattell they drove away from a place called <hi>Tilow,</hi> ſome two miles from us, that were the Biſhop of <hi>Dublins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. Day were a 100. Horſe ſent under the command of Captaine <hi>Armſtrong</hi> to ſeeke after the fore night troublers.</p>
            <p>Alſo a Troope went to <hi>Tredagh,</hi> and another Convoy to the <hi>Naas</hi> to fetch ſome Wagons home, and brought them ſafe and left all quiet in the <hi>Naas,</hi> but brought home Captaine <hi>Rochford</hi> ſicke, a Captaine of Sir <hi>Charles Cootes</hi> Regiment, a valiant man; I thinke Sir <hi>Charles</hi> his death troubleth the hearts of his Regiment much with ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Alſo, that day Captaine <hi>Stering</hi> was buried.</p>
            <p>News alſo came, that in moſt part of the County of <hi>Earmanagh</hi> the Rebels have burnt, as they do every where, an evill prognoſtick to bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie buſineſſe neere Winter, but all muſt be burnt, that is not by one ſide or other.</p>
            <p>Alſo, we had news that the Lord <hi>Mongarat</hi> had beſieged <hi>Carlow</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle with 3000. men, in which, and in the Church adjoyning are a great number of diſtreſſed Engliſh Families of that County, which if the Caſtle be taken, will be all put to the ſword, and hard it is to releeve it, Sir <hi>Charles</hi> being the only man for ſuch purchaſes, that knew all paſſages, and very hardly can they hold out, much feare is of it. This day ſome 300. foot landed from <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="18">18. Day news came from the County of <hi>Cavan</hi> that Sir <hi>Francis Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iames Crage</hi> having kept their cattell-from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and done good ſervice againſt the Rebels daily, they hearing that great ſtore of Gentlemen of the ſept of Maſter <hi>Dering</hi> were met at <hi>Cavan,</hi> at a kind of a Seſſion ſome 7 miles from their two Caſtles that are neere together, Sir <hi>Francis Hamilton's</hi> is called <hi>Kilſandry.</hi> Sir <hi>Iames Carge, Croſhan;</hi> they both upon this report made, what ſtrength they could, and came upon this Maſter <hi>Doring</hi> unexpected,

and cut them all off, being the chiefe of that ſect, not leſſe then 20. or more Gentlemen the chiefe of that name, and having ſo done, they tooke away a great part of their cattell, and returned to their Caſtles; This was good ſervice the truth was averred: by men of truſt to the State.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Day newes from <hi>Trim Colonell Gibſon</hi> who came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and brought two priſoners of note, the one <hi>Weſly</hi> of <hi>Dangod</hi> and his Sonne, a man of 18 hundred <hi>par annum,</hi> many Alarmes they have had in <hi>Trim,</hi> but the Rebels never ſtood to it, but ſtil run</p>
            <p>Much diſcontent is here among the Souldiers for want of pay, and little hopes of living in place for want of it there is not leſſe due to them then 100000. beſides all ſtrange taxes one the Citie.</p>
