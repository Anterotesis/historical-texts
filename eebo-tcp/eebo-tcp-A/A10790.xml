         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

sometimes Consull,
a man every way worthy
that high title, of a Spirit
moulded for great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes,
that would breake
through all interruptions
to advance his Honour:
Hee, a faithfull friend to
<hi>Scribonianus,</hi> in whose fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1336:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he had engaged his
life and fortunes; after
his overthrow was taken
prisoner by the Souldiers
of <hi>Claudius Nero.</hi> When
hee was taking Ship, <hi>(a
Triumph for Rome)</hi> he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the Officers that
<hi>Arria</hi> his Wife might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie
him; holding
it a grand discourtesie,
since shee had shared his
prosperous fortunes, to
deny her his miseries: but
the Souldiers, of men the
best studied in crueltie,
were more ambitious to
tyrannize over his mind
(the greater Triumph)
than his body; and well
advised how sorrowes are
substracted by being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
denyed his most pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1336:7"/>
prayers, and hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
saile. Many of them
were flies engendred from
his heat, who now fled him
as an inhospitable clyme,
too cold to nourish flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.
They beheld him
as one whose misfortunes
were infectious, not to bee
sympathiz'd; or as a Rock
that stands the shock of
the impetuous Wind, to
ruine those that touch it.
<hi>Adversity</hi> is the true
touchstone of Vertue
and Friendship; Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
followes the good
fortune, but Vertue the
bad. That calmenesse of
mind which attends some
high fortunes, is grounded
rather upon Policie than
Vertue: hee that swels
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1336:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he is full, intends to
break himselfe; who then
will be proud when he is
prosperous? As it is an
argument of basenesse to
bee elated; so it is true
magnanimity, not to bee
dejected. Friendly offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
like Rivulets to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,
are tributes reflecting
to the fortunes, not the
men: let these once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
the other like Frie
will swimme against the
sinking streame: or like
Mice, shelter themselves
from the approaching
storme. So <hi>Paetus</hi> out liv'd
his happinesse, and his
friends: onely his deare
<hi>Arria,</hi> having hired a Fish-boat,
followed along by
the Shore of <hi>Sclavonia;</hi> so
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1336:8"/>
noble was her piety; as if
shee did congratulate
those extremities, as the
tryall of that unshaken
faith, that well-knit affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
not to bee ravel'd
from her <hi>Paetus</hi> by the
strongest battery of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
With so meane ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
as one small Bark,
so small attendance as
one mean Fisherman, no
Saile but Resolution, no
Pilot but that high Spirit
that threatned destinie,
and dar'd the utmost pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Fate, shee imbarqu'd
her selfe into the dangers
of the Seas. When shee
was arriv'd at Rome, and
in the Emperours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<hi>Iunia</hi> the Widow
of <hi>Scribonianus,</hi> chiefe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1336:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
partner in her captivity,
did familiarly accost her:
to whom with words
made for disdaine, shee
made reply; doest thou
live, (said shee) shame of
our sexe, and monument
of our shame! Thou, in
whose armes <hi>Scribonianus</hi>
thy Husband was slaine!
What stands between thee
and death, now hee is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
that hindred thy
prospect? Unworthy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that prizest loathed
life above thine honour,
and lovest thy selfe above
thy Lord! <hi>Arria,</hi> thy
courage (said <hi>Iunia)</hi> is ill
plac'd: the Gods that
sent us hither, gave us life
as their greatest blessing,
not to be appropriated to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1336:9"/>
our selves, but communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to our friends and
Countrey; if wee should
live onely to our selves,
wee should live onely to
undoe all; since this great
All subsists by each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular:
is then the whole
of us our owne, when the
least part of us is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ours? Grant our lives
were intirely ours; yet are
they not of that small
consequence, that like our
clothes wee may devest
us of them when our mis-guided
fancies tell us they
are out of fashion. Then
if <hi>Scribonianus</hi> (to whose
departed soule thou slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest
my affection) had
held an end like this, an
end of misery, or a way to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1336:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
happinesse and honour;
hee had counsel'd mee to
die, and had not liv'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to have been slaine.
Fond Woman (replyed
<hi>Arria)</hi> how thine owne
arguments condemn thee!
If the Gods give us life as
their greatest blessing,
then surely blessednesse is
the quality and vertue of
life: when they withdraw
this, they call us (if our
faint soules could heare
them) nay, even nature
her selfe whispers to us to
bee gone to some better
place. If our Friends and
Countrey have part, or all
of us, to whom do we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long,
if they discard us?
must wee live wretched
till the decay of nature
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1336:10"/>
doth remove us? So pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
the poor silly Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager
awaites the good
houre his house shall fall
upon his head. If <hi>Scribo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus</hi>
thy Husband had
not dyed honourably in
the Camp, (so great an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
have I of his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue)
hee had dyed as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
in his Tent: but
when thou leav'st the
World, the World shall
not leave to say of thee,
that <hi>Iunia</hi> outliv'd her
Vertue, and her Love di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sooner then her selfe.</p>
            <p>The Emperour by these
passages perceiv'd where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
shee tended, that shee
would live no longer then
till shee had a power to
die; commanded her to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1336:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be streightly guarded: but
this restraint was rather a
spur then a bridle to her
actions travelling to fame:
for shee enraged that her
death was denyed her,
flung out of the Chaire
where shee sate, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
ranne her head a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Wall, with
which blow, shee much
wounded, fell into a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
swoone: but as soon as
her keepers had recall'd
the unwelcom'd life to
her, the life that griev'd
her, not that it was gone,
but returned; she thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spake
them: You see how
vainly you imploy your
care to keep a prisoner
that will be free; you may
make mee die with more
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1336:11"/>
paine, and lesse honour;
but not to die at all, this
is beyond your power:
whilst I wear a hand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by a heart that
knowes no feare, I shall
not despaire of death, nor
shall I long protract a
loathed breath in such
wretched times that make
life but the nursery of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes,
and seminary of
misfortunes. Some few
dayes she wasted in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting,
and condoling
with her friends the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
calamities wherein
the most vertuous were
involv'd, under that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of men, <hi>Nero,</hi> then ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannizing.
Then she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
into <hi>Paetus</hi> lodging,
and there thus spake her
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1336:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
last: The soule impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
in a necessity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
miserable, must break
through all fence of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into an honourable
end. This very precept
nature her selfe imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
in us; shee denyeth
not the iron-bound Slave
a death to free him from
the toylsome Oare; doth
she deny the Sun-scorch'd
Pilgrim his nights sleep?
no, nor the world-beaten
man his eternall rest. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then, shee allowes us to
shake off her interest,
when we are sunke below
her succour. <hi>Paetus,</hi> thy
life is not link'd to nature,
but to fame: fall then by
thine owne sword, and thy
spirit wound up in thine
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1336:12"/>
honour, mounts to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces
of the immortall
Gods: If thou faintest
under so brave a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or enviest thy selfe the
glory of thy end; know,
that ere two dayes expire,
thou thy selfe expirest:
but how? by whose hands?
beheaded by a base hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
offered up a tame sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
to insated tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
Awake the Roman in
thee; shall high <hi>Paetus</hi>
(whom when the World
unworthy of his Vertue,
ingratefully flung off)
claspe broken hopes and
fortunes, to save himselfe
with the shipwrack of his
fame? shall hee, to whom
thousand servile necks did
bow, stoop to the base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1336:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to beg life, while his
death is in his hands?
<hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> (whom
this age is more prone to
adore then admire) held
it not honourable to begg
life, though they might
expect more from <hi>Caesars</hi>
Vertue. But what canst
thou hope for from a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
abjur'd by all the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
one that approves
nothing in Soveraigntie
but Power, and that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by Passion to insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
revenge? Then (as if
shee had distrusted her
Husbands spirit) shee
drew out the poyniard
from his side: <hi>Paetus,</hi> (said
shee) how I have not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
life, nor death but
for thy sake, this last act
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1336:13"/>
of honour be my witnesse.
Doe this <hi>Paetus:</hi> then she
plung'd the dagger into
her heart, and having
drawne it out, shee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
it to him againe;
trust my departing breath,
<hi>Paetus,</hi> (said shee) not the
wound it gives mee, but
thee, afflicts mee. There
died the noble <hi>Arria,</hi>
there did that soule flie
to eternity; that soule
that was too great to owe
her liberty to any power
but to her owne. <hi>Paetus</hi>
blushing to be indebted
to a president for his
death, especially his
Wife; took to him the
dagger that was so lately
guilded in his <hi>Arria</hi>'s
bloud, and with these
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1336:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
words hastned to his end.
Had fortune answered my
resolution, and crown'd
my enterprize with hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse;
I had entered
Rome, envied by the most
noble, not pitied by the
basest. I now see how the
successe of humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
depends not upon
valour, but uncertain fates;
and our actions elevated
by the height of spirit,
do but intrench us deeper
into misery. But though
I am bereft of all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
of fortune, and
of honour: yet am I Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of a mind unconquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
over which nor Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
nor Fate shall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.
Then embracing
her dead, hee sigh'd, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1336:14"/>
said; Pardon, blest spirit,
my too long absence from
thee; I have borrowed
this little leave of life but
to admire thy Vertue,
which being above my
wonder, I must soare unto
that height where it is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
to search out her
true perfection: Pardon
my soule that she ascends
not to thee in an extasie;
faine would shee: but this
dagger claimes her liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that gave thee thine.
Then he thrust it into his
heart, and there the dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
acted his last and most
faithfull service; slew his
Master.</p>

to which his vertue,

his mind was richly

a good part of his

striv'd which should with

was devanced and disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
In all these extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<hi>Seneca</hi> in himself was

Courtier into flattery:
nor did he know any man
great enough to make
him lesse; nor could his
mind, which Philosophie
had plac'd above the

In his old age hee
married <hi>Pompea Paulina</hi> a

to him hee sends his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellites
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1336:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to denounce his

those times was, when
a person of qualitie
was condemn'd to die;
hee was allowed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to chuse his death,
and a time proportion'd
according to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours

his affaires: but if his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
flowed so high, that
it would brook no delay:
then hee enjoyd no time
to doe any thing but die:
if the condemned resisted
his decrees; then he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
appointed, that
by some slave hee should
bee barbarously murdered:
but the nobler Romans
held it nearer way to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

staid not the enforcement

Then he commanded his
Surgeon to cut the veins
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1336:22"/>
of both their armes, that
they might bleed to death:
but <hi>Seneca</hi>'s veines, shrunk

his thighs were also
launced: but lest his pains
might insinuate too farre
into <hi>Paulina</hi>'s torments,
and a new addition of
sorrow meeting with her
losse of bloud, might make
her faint, hee sought to
mitigate her feares by the
discourse of death.</p>
            <p>Why should (said he)
this monster <hi>nothing</hi> so
affright us? while we are
living, wee are dying, for
life is but a dying being;
when we are dead, wee are
after death: where then,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1336:22"/>
or what is death? It is
that inconsiderable atome
of time that divides the
body from the soule:
what is it then in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
us? Not the rarity,
for all the world that is
not gone before, will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
us: is it the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and tyed to that the
jealousie how we shall bee
dealt with? upon this
hinge, I confesse, turnes
the wickeds fear: but the
Stoick, whom Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
hath taught the art
of living well, death frees
from misery, and wafts
him to the haven of his
happinesse. For this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of death, wee are
bound to thank the Gods;
for it redeems from a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1336:23"/>
worse of being eternally
miserable. The separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it is naturall, so it is
the only meanes condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
to our better being.
The body being the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
and ponderous
part, falls naturally to the
earth whence it was first
elemented: the soul ethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
gaines by this losse;
for being purg'd from the
drosse of weight, and of
corruption, is made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
richest ore; so refin'd,
that the great Gods image
may bee stamp'd upon it,
and ascends unto the skies
from whence it first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended.
Nor doe I hold
this dis-junction to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal;
for when the world
by the revolution of times
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1336:23"/>
and ages, whirls about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her first <hi>Chaos,</hi> then
shall they meet again ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to bee sundred. The
soul shal be so purified by
the immortall Gods: that
it shall neither hope, nor
feare, nor grieve; that it
shall bee freed from all
those discording passions,
and affections, that here
transport it from it selfe.
The body so spirited that
it shall know no necessity
of nourishment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no weight, alteration,
or mortality. Of great
consequence then is death
to our wel-being; since be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it wee can account
none happy; we see it end
all miseries; we see it make
none miserable; why then
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1336:24"/>
should we feare it, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
it? What have the
wisest thought it, but the
Port wee all must touch?
He that scarce arrives at
half a man hath as little to
quarrell at his fate, as hee
that in a weeke reacheth
his haven, whereas by the
troubled winds he might
bee bound up in the more
troubled seas a year. Nor
is hee that is his owne
death, being condemn'd to
die, shipwrack'd even at
the very shoare: for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and the Emperour
allow the liberty, and to
die by the most abject of
men, an hangman, is to die
dishonourable. For this
boone I gratulate the
Gods: but more that they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1336:24"/>
are pleas'd to call the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>Seneca</hi> unto their
joyes, the <hi>Seneca</hi> that hath
not yet outliv'd himselfe,
nor return'd into his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.
There <hi>Paulina,</hi> not
through feare (knowing
none but what proceeded
from her love) but through
decaying nature fainted;
therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> taking
his leave caus'd her to be
remov'd into the next
chamber. In <hi>Seneca</hi> all
these incisions were not of
force to force out life;
he therefore commanded
his Physitian to poyson
him; but wanting naturall
heat to convey it to his
heart, the poyson was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a nourishment then a
destruction to his nature:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1336:25"/>
then he was laid in warme
bathes, by this forc'd heat
the poyson in his full
source, and violence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in his witherd body.
While he had life he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd
freely of life and
death; his end approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
all bloudy in his bath
hee bath'd his head, and
said, <hi>I vow this to Iupiter

of her fortune, witnesse that
shee did live; how she valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her Husbands death,
that shee would die. Fame
and vertue did both attend
her in the progresse of her
actions: had she died, it had
been thought the wretched
times had interest in her
end: but in her life shee
conquer'd the extremities of
life and death. The rule
of vertue ties us to live so
long as we ought, not as we
list: then is the fittest time
to die, when we can live no
longer. To die, is at the
height but like a Roman:
but to dare to live when life
is tedious, this is as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Roman, as the
true substance of vertue, that
false shade of honour. Had
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1336:27"/>
shee then died, she had acted
but the Roman: but she liv'd
to exceed the noblest of all
Romans, but her selfe.</p>

this period; for having
tyed their vowes to her
revenge, her soule too

it selfe of clay,
and broke the vault of
mortalitie. So riseth day
disrob'd of night: so did
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1336:34"/>
her soule ascend to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.
It is beyond
the art of words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
what valiant sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
what noble rage,
this cruelty of hers had
stamp'd upon these two
princely brests. Silence
at the instant had tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied
all language, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
had pent up all teares,
immensitie of furie had
transcended all bounds of
passion: so much had
they to speak, they could
not speak; so great was
their sorrow they could
not sorrow; so were all
the powers of the soule
knit and contracted into
the project of revenge,
that till they were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into their offices,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1336:35"/>
passion was not discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
then the object les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened,
wonder descended
to passion, passion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;
then discolour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the crimson floud,
and with their teares wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
her body white as

presents to your wonder
a fact of that height of

You see a monument of
that miserie that vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
the pitie of Tygers,
or Tyrants: much more
of minds ennobled with
vertuous actions. The
Tragedie (not long to
wrack your expectation)
I will briefely declare.
<hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi> (I know
not with what coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
excuses hee painted
his designes) left <hi>Ardea</hi>
for <hi>Rome;</hi> honour could
not bridle his false furie
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1336:36"/>
of affection, nor the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
interest in the State
overpoize his private pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;
I say, hee posted
to <hi>Rome. Rome!</hi> where the
Gods have their Temples,
the Vertues their Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries,
that thou shouldst
breed a Monster to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
thee! No sooner
had hee entred <hi>Rome,</hi> but
hee entred my house;
where like a Prince, a
kinsman, like the happie
messenger of <hi>Collatines</hi>
happinesse, (oh, that vice
should bee so bravely dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis'd!)
hee was receiv'd
by <hi>Lucrecia,</hi> receiv'd in
a bravery of affection too
high for the apostate
from vertue; his face did
not discover the false
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1336:36"/>
heart that lay in ambush
to surprize her honour,
nor his vertue shew it
selfe, as it was, the staul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
horse to his covert.
The ceremonies of hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality
finished, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires
to his lodging,
though not to himselfe;
now when the brother of
death had summon'd to
still musick all but foule
ravishers, theeves, and
cares; with his drawne
sword hee leaps from his
owne, enters <hi>Lucrecia's</hi>
bed, her hee ravisheth.
Shee having possess'd us
with a full relation of her
mis-fortunes: Shee Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

had made loathed; And
now O Countrimen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
your Roman vertue,
flesh your swords and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
upon the revenge
of the proud usurper of
publick liberty, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell

you cannot of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the Gods a more
gratefull sacrifice; nor
will they ever in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
forsake that State that
forsakes not the defence
of vertue.</p>
            <p>Such impression strikes
Thunder upon Oakes,
Earthquakes on Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
as <hi>Collatine</hi> on the
Roman hearts. Their
thoughts were torne, and
divided from themselves,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1336:37"/>
anger boyled into malice
the policie of passion,
both flowed into resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
then like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent

her innocence to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1336:38"/>
world, and confirmes it
by her death. There were
two in the act, one in the
sinne; one adulterer, and
one chast; her body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd,
her mind truely he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roicall,
not stooping to the
lure of false pleasure; that
remained as untainted, as
unforced. Why dyed shee
being innocent? to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent.
Why received shee
her death from her owne
hands? haply to prevent it
from anothers; then had
shee subscribed to guilt, and
not left life without staine.
For a Roman to outlive ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
was dishonourable,
for her to survive her infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
was to act it. <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
spur'd on by honour,
did ride into the Gulfe.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1336:38"/>
                  <hi>Regulus,</hi> rather then his
faith, would prostitute him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the witty cruelty of
the Carthaginians. To ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
did the three hundred
<hi>Fabii</hi> sacrifice their lives.
Honour chased the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi>
out of <hi>Rome;</hi> but
<hi>Lucrece</hi> out of life. To
wipe off all thought of guilt
which maligne censure
might imprint upon the act,
she slew her selfe. Hee that
condemnes her for the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
accuseth her of the
adultery; life had been her
guilt, whereas death was
her innocence; through her
life shee made way to her
fame, to which life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune

farther then they
tend to her advancement.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1336:39"/>
I confesse, torne haire and
face, and eyes bankrupt of
teares, and her owne vertue
was of force to possesse the
world shee had been ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed

her death: why then died
shee? Her shame was too

due to innocence, or to adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie?
was it that her crime

The body might
be purg'd by the adultery:
not soule of the adultery by
murder. This revenge may
argue chastitie before and
after: but not in the nick
of the act, which yeelding
to some secret enticement,
might staine her thought;
then loathing her selfe for
the act, held death a more
satisfactory revenge then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
But, it was <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi>

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1336:40"/>
it was <hi>Lucrece;</hi> if <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi>

not <hi>Tarquins,</hi> but her own.
The will left free by divine
providence, is not constraind
by humane power. If her
will was ravished, why doe
wee extoll her for murder
who died for adultery? had
she slaine <hi>Tarquin,</hi> her act
had been no way to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied;

<hi>Lucrece</hi> is her chast
and innocent self; <hi>Tarquin</hi>
her foul ravisher, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
enemy. She then did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
her life to her honour:
could not her insatiate
thirst of glory bee slak'd but
by her bloud? Was it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy

solely to him
not of years to write man.
<hi>Dido</hi> was married to her
Uncle <hi>Sichaeus, Hercules</hi>
Priest: this <hi>Sichaeus</hi> the
sponge of Fortune, filled
only to be squeesed; was
slaine by his Nephew and
Brother <hi>Pigmalion.</hi> Hee
a man of treasure vast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1336:42"/>
to betray his life,
jealous of the security of
his greatnesse, trusted it
to the earth: but Fame
(the most injurious Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbole)
drew it up (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
greater then it was)
the many fathomes of
earth, where it lay ramm'd
from the eye, not the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
of the Prince. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
Fortune, that deal'st
with us as the Persian
with their slaves, crownest
us for a Sacrifice! <hi>Dido</hi>
a Dowager by her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
tyranny, begins to
feele a tyranny of sorrow;
that (had not nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to keep perfect as
much of her as was hers)
had made her a Widdow
also to her beauty; her
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1336:42"/>
faire face clouded with
discontent: but her fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
soule with no more
passion, then betraid mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality;
shee betakes her
to the male contented of
the Tyrian Lords. Since
Brothers (said shee) are
enemies, let us seeke to
our enemies for Brothers;
since pitie is fled humane
brests, let us seeke it (for
such a creature there is,
nature tels mee) among
salvages. Though we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expect it from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet his youth might
enfeeble him to it: but
his very infancy is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;
what then will his
riper yeares produce but
the exile of all humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
What distant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1336:43"/>
will hee know that
wades through his owne
bloud to his ends? if an
innocent Uncle and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be slaine; if a Sister
be not, where is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
secure? Miserable
<hi>Strato,</hi> thou wert a Prince
by thy slave, to beget a
Prince to make slaves of
Princes! Miserable <hi>Tyre,</hi>
now more oppress'd by
one Tyrant, then before
by a thousand slaves!
Wretched wealth, to thee
quiet poverty is a Prince;
thou hast divorced mee
from my <hi>Sichaeus,</hi> thou
hast made mee the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
of a Tyrant Brother,
toss'd from his Kingdome,
into what unhappy shore
is not yet knowne unto
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1336:43"/>
my thoughts. My Lords,
I speake to minds too no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to be stifled in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
confines of fear: fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
your Princesse, whose
vertue the spite of Fortune
shall not wrack into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire.
Her words pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
from the height
and sweetnes of her mind,
were as great a spur as the
hope of liberty to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
them into action:
then as in a thoughtfull
mind refresh'd with wine,
<hi>Care</hi> it selfe keeps her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels:
so were their
thoughts (before deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted)
now lifted to that
pitch, that valiantly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts
the hard affronts
of Fortune; then with
all speed they rig'd a fleet,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1336:44"/>
and <hi>Dido</hi> with her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and the Tyrian Lords
in the advantage of night
hoised saile. The Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
was the first shore
they touched; where (as
the fashion of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
was) their Virgins
were assembled, to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
for their chastities to
<hi>Venus,</hi> before their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
Fourscore of these
untouch'd <hi>Dido</hi> ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
from the barbarous sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
and sailes with
them into <hi>Affrica;</hi> where
when she was arriv'd, shee
purchased as much land
of the Inhabitants as
might bee covered by an
Oxes hide, which cut in
thin pieces, made a great
extent of ground: but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1336:44"/>
scarce to containe a City
two and twenty miles in
compasse. There was the
famous <hi>Carthage</hi> built by
<hi>Dido,</hi> which after times
dilated into a great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
By the consent of
all there was a yearly rent
paid for the land on
which the City was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
The concourse of
Affricans (which hope of
gaine brought thither)
was great as their gaine
they received by traffick,
which invited them to
settle themselves there.
The many conspiring
hands in no great space of
time wrought it to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Citie: but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim,
their wealth that
flowed thither in high
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1336:45"/>
tide, made <hi>Carthage</hi> the
envie of <hi>Hiarbus</hi> King of
the Mauritanians. Hee
summons ten of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginian</hi>
Princes, and
with them treats of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with their Queen;
which if fairely may not
bee obtain'd, hee resolves
to try the force of armes.
<hi>Dido</hi> hearing this unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
message, desires re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of resolution till the
City was finished: which
accomplished, shee in no
wise would yeeld unto
<hi>Hiarbus,</hi> whom lust linkt
to rage and avarice, had
arm'd against her and his
honour. <hi>Dido</hi> now the
creature which melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
divorceth from so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
desires three months
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1336:45"/>
absence from her friends,
whom shee tels she must
goe whither her owne and
the Cities fate did drive
her: in which time a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
remote from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
shee erected a stately
Pyre, which having kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and invok'd <hi>Sichae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
ghost; shee a little
eased her selfe against her
fortune. What a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of misery (said shee)
received life with <hi>Dido?</hi>
The World hath dealt
with mee, as Love with
those it hath distracted;
allowed mee happinesse
but by some short inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals.
First I was borne
Princesse of <hi>Tyre,</hi> then by
my Brothers tyranny I
was exil'd; after long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1336:46"/>
with the Winds and
Seas, I arrived here in <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica;</hi>
here I built this
great <hi>Carthage,</hi> of which
I am intitled Queene;
then I thought me plac'd
above my envie, or my
fate: but as those wretched
creatures that are drawne
higher, the more to bee
strapado'd: so was I made
great, great for <hi>Hiarbus</hi>
envie; so was I wound up
to the height of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and honour, only to
fall never to rise againe.
Prosperity and adversity
might bee termed the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of life, did not our best
dayes aflict us more then
our worst. In our happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the feares that doe
attend it make us misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1336:46"/>
the hopes that await
our unhappinesse, make us
happy in our lowest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happinesse;
which estate
would a wise man chuse,
that which will be better,
or that which will bee
worse? then to be happy,
is to bee miserable. As
the pain of the soule tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
the paine of sense:
so is misery to be valued
above happinesse. For as
<hi>what shall be</hi> is the greatest
wrack of thought; so <hi>what
is,</hi> is the clearest reliefe,
the clearest satisfaction.
In our height of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
we know wee shall
bee, in our lowest misery
wee know wee cannot bee
worse; then to bee mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
is to bee happy. If
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1336:47"/>
I desire felicitie, I desire
misery; for I rise onely
to fall. If misery, then
happinesse; this makes
me Fortune's, that makes
Fortune my triumph.
Where is then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
since banished the
height of State? If
in the low estate, then
must I seek it in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse,
and in some un-sun-seen
Cave waste out
the remnant of my dayes;
there <hi>Pigmalion</hi> and <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbus</hi>
follow mee; there
reignes as great a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of thoughts as at the
Court: then welcome
Death, thou didst divorce
mee, thou shalt unite mee
to my Love. Purged from
earth, to the Skies I flie,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1336:47"/>
and intwine my soule for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to my lov'd <hi>Sichaeus.</hi>
Then she leap'd into the
Pyre, and there consum'd.</p>
            <p>The meeting of <hi>Dido</hi>
and <hi>Aeneas</hi> (in which <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gils</hi>
Muse hath sweat to
the dishonour of them
both; her for love, him
for ingratitude) is so meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fabulous, that it is scarce
worth the expence of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to disprove it, onely
I am bound to vindicate
her honour. <hi>Rome</hi> (as
<hi>Eutropius</hi> writes) was
built three hundred nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
foure yeares after the
destruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> none
computes the time lesse.
<hi>Carthage</hi> was built seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
two years before <hi>Rome,</hi>
so <hi>Iustine</hi> writes. So there
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1336:48"/>
must bee of necessity two
hundred yeares betweene
the Trojan Prince and
the Carthaginian Queen.
Seven hundred yeares this
Citie stood unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
so long they sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to <hi>Dido</hi> as their tute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Goddesse; at last by
<hi>Scipio,</hi> thence called <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricanus,</hi>
it was burnt,
there their devotion en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with their fortune, and
themselves.</p>
            <div type="favorable_view">

               <p>WAS it the Queen
of <hi>Carthage,</hi> or the
Queen of beauty that <hi>Hiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi>
coveted? If <hi>Carthage</hi>
was his end, money was his
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1336:48"/>
matrimony; if beauty, hee
sought a woman, not a wife;
if a wife, to make his lust
warrantable. <hi>Dido</hi> in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeus</hi>
buried all husband,
in <hi>Hiarbus</hi> all man. Love
is the good which by being
diffused, is corrupted; shee
that loves one, another, and
a third, takes men in at the
coile, and loves only for her
pleasure. The object of
true love is but one; from
the infancy of time to her
decrepitude the love between
two hath been held most ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable.
Hee that tooke
from the first man his wife,
did not make every rib a
wife; not onely to shew us
how out of the least of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
he could draw infinites
upon infinites: but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1336:49"/>
that our desires might
move within the narrow
compasse of love, not expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate
themselves to lust; that
as the first man was all the
men in the world to his
wife: so now the husband
should bee the wives Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon,
that where ere shee is
plac'd, hee may bee all shee
sees. The objects of lust are
as various as numerous: as
there are lovely beauties,
and to attend them, fond de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
The wanton woman
darts forth her unruly heats
more freely then the lesse-offending
Sun his beams; he
with the day, in courtesie to
nature, withdrawes his fires:
shee day and night carries
the rage of dog-dayes in her
breast, and never sets but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1336:49"/>
then when shee can rise no
more. <hi>Dido</hi> would not wed
<hi>Hiarbus,</hi> because she thought
all nuptiall rites had not
their period in <hi>Sichaeus.</hi>
Death is the divorce of man
and woman, not of husband
and wife; that contract flesh
ties and unties: but this is
that of soules, which eternity
cannot undoe; it is as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
as themselves, not
deaded in being singled from
earth, but reviv'd to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perfection: if then her
soule did intirely love, the
soule of her soule must be her
only love. But <hi>Hiarbus</hi>
sought lawfull marriage.
Why did he force it? <hi>Dido</hi>
refused marriage, shee could
not love. Marriage to her
had been a rape, another had
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1336:50"/>
enjoy'd her against her will:
if a rape must bee avoyded
with the losse of life; through
how many death must she flie
a loathed bed, where every
night she shall be ravished?
Did her vertue attract <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arbus?</hi>
why did he not covet
her vertue in her prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as in her misery? He that
hath lost the effect and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of vertue in himselfe,
will not value it in another,
and with reason; for her
vertue was his greatest ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
forc'd her chastity so to
whom she had been married,
that like the <hi>Phoenix</hi> shee
would marry to nothing but
her ashes.</p>

of strange blouds, not of the
same. Nature bids us affect,

is unnaturall: could she then
marry <hi>Sichaeus,</hi> and not

let her birth bee strangled

Shee was Natures
fairest paper, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of the rags of
common mortality: but
so searsed and refined, that
it could receive no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression

In summe, hee was what a

the time pointed at in

(the slave of his sense)
dancing and floating like
a toast in his wine, was
seiz'd on by sleepe; the

can it accuse the act?
Thou murdrest a poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent

brand mee with

say, that not able to stand
under the miseries of life,
I was press'd down by the
hard extremity of fortune
to despaire to death? No,
my tide of furie flowes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

is a revenge fit for thy
spirit, fit for thine arme;
thine honour shall bee
proud to riot in his bloud,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1336:57"/>
whose bloud would riot
in thine honour. Thus
then I shake off woman,
and her frailtie; thus doe
I strangle the monster lust
that revels in thy veines;
and to complete my ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance,
send thy sin-sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetted
soule into the land
of endlesse night, where it
hath already tane sure
footing, With that, her
spirit restlesse in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
of words, eager of
action, directed her arme,
which gave <hi>Amalius</hi> so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
a wound, that it seem'd
her hot-metled fury was
bridled with exactest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
and nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Bravest <hi>Theutilla,</hi>
sooner shall the Fathers
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1336:57"/>

Sonne, then posterity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
thy name. <hi>Amalius</hi>
now miserably groaning,
now miserably opening
his eyes to shut them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
more miserably, had
little more of life then
what could give her life,
in appeasing the fury of
his servants that rushed in
to her destruction. What
means (said he) is <hi>Chaos</hi>
of confounding noise;
this unwelcome Traine,
to the more unwelcome
Pomp of death? Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rush yee, yee betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

find a grave as soone
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:1336:58"/>
as life; and you sooner:
that the world may want
a witnesse of it. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
you by the relation
that ties you to my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and this last; spare
her life, whose chastitie
the Gods are pleas'd to
spare. Then, to make
a minute of his life fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
hee contemplated
on mortality.</p>
            <p>Nature (said hee) that
first digested this All into
an exact method of parts,
preserves it likewise by a
constant concordance of
the same, without the
which it would soone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve

revolting from

her allegeance, deposes
her Lieutenant Reason,
lets in the Usurper, Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to untune the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that preserves the soul.
Hence is it that death,
the privation of being, in
this disorder seizes the
Fort, hurries the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
captive to an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
a never redeem'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment.
The Sunne,
the Sea, have both their
bounds, and man his stage
from life to death, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
length to all, though
one runs faster then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The world whirles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
continually till it be
dissolv'd; and mans brain
not satisfied in the bare
necessaries of life, moves
in an unbounded motion,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1336:59"/>
till stil'd by the period of
action, the undoer of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Death. There is but
one doore at which wee
enter this Labyrinth of
life: but infinite are the
waies wee turne and wind
out of it. The infant no

rak'd out of the

Mothers guilt of his
short-liv'd misery) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
the Tombe, flashing
through the world, being
but a lightning of life.
Pleasure or businesse wears
out the riper mans vitals,
and forceth out life, let
Nature block it up never
so strongly. The aged
man, because a burden to
himselfe, sinks under his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1336:59"/>
own weight. These are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
waies out of this
world into the next: but
to bee hurld out by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of Fate, this is the
doom of strictest Justice
that makes eternity our
curse. This is the hard
fate my just merit hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred,
to be punish'd
by the sex I have so much
abus'd. This was his last:
for Nature, though shee
could not tell him he had
liv'd long enough; told
him hee had been long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

withdrew her selfe from

It was that mind that stoop'd

her of consequence; not her

that hee discernes not even

onely to resolve not to yeeld:
but to prevent occasions that
might prejudice her vertue,

Because shee would
not yeeld; because she should

<hi>Turk</hi> or shee more
cruell? he slew his enemies,
and strangers: shee, her
friends, kindred, and her
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1336:71"/>
self. Had she life to revenge
it with self-murder? or were
she wronged by another, must
she therefore be reveng'd on
her selfe? Was a life freely
given bought at too dear a
rate? or because shee might
feel their power, must she use
her owne? What was it that
look'd on her more terrible
then death, or that she look'd
on through a multiplying
glasse? was it slavery? that
is the common fate of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
that stands unmov'd by
misery, unshaken by despair.
Had the <hi>Turk</hi> slaine her, he
had not depriv'd the world
of the opinion of her vertue:
but the very substance is
shipwrack'd by her selfe. The
<hi>Turks</hi> cruelty was her cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie:
for though hee tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph'd
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1336:72"/>
over her; yet hee
gave her the opportunity to
triumph over misery, and
shew that height of spirit
that scornes any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
her should afflict her:
but shee disdain'd to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
to their courtesie, or
her owne vertue. Was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
the thing beyond
death or captivity? had she
asmuch of woman as not to
feare a death from her selfe,
and not asmuch, as not to
feare a dishonour from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Could shee hate her
vertue, and her sin? could
she better revenge her of her
vertue, then by her disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour?
Why should she feare
what might befall her in life,
who was regardlesse what
might befall her after death.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1336:72"/>
Then was slavery the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
joyn'd with dishonour
her twin sister. Had she been
transported to a Nunnery,
where vertue is necessitated,
had not that been a slavery?
would not her will break in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a thousand sins, who broke
through life into a false li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?
But lesse then death,
slavery, or dishonour, onely
sense of her dishonour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
her of her sense; why
should she be affrighted by a
shadow, when her sense could
bee wrong'd by none but her
selfe?</p>

the last
rank'd in these
Stories, but first in my
thoughts, which by the
order of birth may claim
the priviledge to do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
As some things are
lesse curiously perform'd
which are ordain'd for
common use, not for the
ornament or wonder of
the world: so have I, like
a French Volunteir on a
Lute, all this while scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
slight aires, which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1336:74"/>
may perchance surprize an
indifferent eye: but now
like the glasse that twists
the Sun-beames to steale
fire from heaven, I must
in writing her, so lessen
and contract so much of
her as may sinke into our
narrow faith, or narrower
reason. If our Poets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely
rake heaven for
comparisons, for each part
of a rotten Mistris that
shall nere bee part of it;
one whom sinne, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
age, hath carcass'd in
her cradle: to what heights
must I ascend to reach a
Subject fit for all fancy to
work, not play upon; one
that is above all heights?
Sometimes she is pleas'd
to stoop to bee admir'd,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1336:74"/>
ador'd; not that shee
falls lower to rebound
higher: but that wee are
admir'd for admiring her,
and we her prisoners feast
our selves with the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie
offalls of her
Fame. Thus doe I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
her, till I admire my
selfe out of breath; then
shee beckens to my soule
(the reason I cannot
reach; but I obey) to
come, whither I will not
tell you: but now I am
return'd a re-transmigra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted-mountebank-Pedler,
I will open to your Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
that which shall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blind
the whole art; at
your two nostrils you shal
snuffe in both the Indies;
for your pallats, (because
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:1336:75"/>
the cleanest feeders are the
cleanest meat) you shall
have the whole sect of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picures;
if their opinions
stick in your stomacks,
you shall take all the
sumes of <hi>Arabia</hi> in a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco-pipe
to concoct
them: Here is that will
chaine your care to the
perpetuall sound of <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphila:</hi>
For your touch,
are you a <hi>Midas?</hi> here is
a Diamond set in gold,
within two dayes it will
bee a <hi>Rhodian</hi> Colosse;
then will it magnifie to
an Escuriall; then to a

Worlds; then to <hi>Areta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phila:</hi>
thus Fortune blows
dust up to a Lady, then to
a Countesse, then to a

Diamonds at length come
to be <hi>Aretaphila,</hi> in whose
name they have been va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued.
Please you to look

you shall see all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets

the ebb and flow of Seas,

The wounded Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

The Aegyptian Dropsie is

but the Ague onely
an Ague. It is an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

then (like a Prince's ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheir'd

hath been a tenant to this
heart for many years, and
hath now left it like a

of <hi>Almanacks.</hi> But oh!
whilst I am quacking, my
<hi>Aretaphila</hi> is fled; fled
like the last age; or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
like yesterday; and
my soul, like a skie-climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Falcon, sprited as
the ayre shee flies in, hath
gotten height, and wind,
and thinkes to seize her:
but oh! shee is height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible;
shee is lessened
into the invisible; shee
is greatned to the un-by-any—fancie—fathomable.
Shall we aske Sense what
she is? Sense will tell us;
her face is the unclouded
Welkin in the infancy of
day: her eyes the Sunne
and Moon that sleepe by
turnes, lest they should
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1336:78"/>
leave the World in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
her tongue the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Sphears and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
her brests Heavens
milkie way, spangled with
azure Starres: her armes
<hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux:</hi> her o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts, because of low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
function, are but the
Symmetry of all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of her sexe: shee is
too much first to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
second; from the third,
fourth, and fifth forme of
women, from a million, or
all of them you may take
some piece of her, not all,
for she herself is the All.
Aske Reason what shee
is; Reason will tell you,
shee is her Directresse,
that shee keeps the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
at peace within us:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1336:78"/>
our fire she confines to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
zeale, and suffers
it not to inflame either
to lust or superstition:
our watry element shee
hath design'd to quench
unlawfull flames: our sighs
to drie our blubbred eyes,
when teares have tyred
them: our earth like the
earth to tread upon, or
make no other account
of it then of a skin-purse
that holds ten thousand
pound: the money outed,
the purse is laid aside till
it bee refill'd by the same
treasure. Aske Faith
what shee is: Faith that
ties us morally to riddles,
religiouslly to mysteries;
and Faith will tell you,
shee hath yours, and mine,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1336:79"/>
&amp; an hundred other souls
in one soule: nor doth
her soule receive extensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for a soule fils no
roome, though shee bee
all over the body, and she
all over ours; yet none
knowes where, nor how.
If with some Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
wee will give them
but such dimensions, that
twenty of them cannot
stand upon the point of
a needle; then may it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that two or three
thousand of them may bee
circumscrib'd (in which
compasse I think so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
misers soules may) in
a locall inch: if they have
any dimensions, they may
bee circumscrib'd; if cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscrib'd,
then followes
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:1336:79"/>
the unheard-of absurdity'
that they are bodies. We
are circumscriptive; other
Angels definitive: but
her, immortall fame hath
made ubiquitive, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletive.
There are orders
of Angels, the first of
higher knowledge, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of nobler function;
the knowledge of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
but derived from
the first: yet those and
these Angels know no
more of each other then
they are pleas'd to reveale
to one another: but shee,
first of the first ranke,
knowes all of them and us,
and wee weakely enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
have so much of her,
as the watry elements of
the Sun, but bare reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1336:80"/>
Some Angels protect
Cities, others Countries;
but the noblest are Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
to us frail and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
men; all these offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
were by her undergone
on earth; to what high
flights of exercise is shee
now soared? But I must
stoop, and draw neer her
into her low estate. Faith
tels us she stands one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
without another:
were there, or were there
no night: yet were shee
an everlasting day. Were
there none bad: yet were
shee unparalleldly good.
Were there any or none
to be compar'd to her: yet
were she superlative. All
of her is an even proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of extremes. Faith tels
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1336:80"/>
us, now she is beyond our
apprehension, that shee is
nothing, yet all of every
thing. But now since she
is, let us see what made
her this all; she was Wife
to <hi>Phedimus,</hi> a <hi>Cyrenaean</hi>
Citizen. As when we see
the Eastern Morn shoot
his fiery-pointed darts, we
say they are the Tipstaves
to usher into the World
the approaching Snnne;
presently we see himselfe
attended by his Page, the
Day; anon he goes to bed,
then it is night: So shall
you see the <hi>Aretaphila</hi> in
her glimmering, Wife to
<hi>Phedimus;</hi> then in the
bright of day, Queen and
protectresse of the <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeans;</hi>
after that her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1336:81"/>
to the solitary di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffe:
then like a man that
hath lost the other eye,
I'le bid good night to all
the World. <hi>Nicocrates</hi>
the Tyrant having made
the sword his Oratour to
plead his Title, usurp'd do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over the <hi>Cyrenae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi>
among other his blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
butcheries, hee put to
death the innocent <hi>Phedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi>
and then forc'd the
incomparable <hi>Aretaphila</hi>
to be his Queen. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the publick cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
more then her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
injuries, meditates a
remedy for both, and by
advise of her nearest
friends, attempts the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
of the King. The
Tyrant had an old woman
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1336:81"/>
to his mother, named <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia;</hi>
this carcasse, a better
name I can hardly afford
her outside, was the inside
of a Sepulchre; her head
was unthatch'd as an old
Parsonage; her eyes (like
lights at the last snuffe,
when the extinguisher is
readie to make their Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs)
sunk low into their
candlesticks; her eares
now deaf, now happy (such
was her tongue) they have
lost their sense; her nose
worm'd like a peice of
<hi>Homer</hi> of the first bind,
offended with her breath,
bowed to her chinne to
damme it up; her cheeks
hol'd as the earth in dog-dayes
drouth; her lips fit
to bee kiss'd by none but
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1336:82"/>
by themselves; her teeth
rotten as her soul, hollow
as her heart, loose as the
shingles of an old silenc'd
steeple, scragged as a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parked
pale, stood at that
distance one could not
bite another; her tongue
so weakly guarded, scolds
like the alarm of a clock;
her chin was down'd with
a <hi>China</hi> beard of twenty
haires; her brest lanke as
a quicksand, wasted as an
hour-glasse at the eleventh
use; one arme, one legge,
one foot shee doff'd with
day, and as a resurrection,
dond with the morrow;
her bones (pithlesse as a
Stallion for seven Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities)
the slightest feares
might now make rattle in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1336:82"/>
her skinne; her body (wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
to no waste, blasted
with lust as an Oak with
lightning) was as famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
with diseases, as a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician:
to conclude; she is
odious beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison:
one sight of her
would make the heat of
youth recoile into an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
continence. Yet she
maintaines two Painters
&amp; three Apothecaries to
maintain this old-old ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse,
as the rare thing
shee hath been these four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
yeares in getting.
But I have too long, like
a Sexton, convers'd with
rottennesse. She was <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia,</hi>
and in that, her soule
was a wel acquainted with
sin as a Confessor: shee
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1336:83"/>
was <hi>Nicocrates</hi> Mother,
and in that name she car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the faire and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<hi>Aretaphila,</hi> the envy
of age, the wormwood of
a mother-in-law; a word
that is the originall that
signifies all that is ill in
the sexe: yet for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe
of some few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
read it like Hebrew,
and it yeelds something
that is good. This <hi>Calbia</hi>
discovers the poison-plot.
Then, as eagerly as my
young Master in the
Countrey fastens on the
red-Deere-pie (tougher
then <hi>Drakes</hi> biskets that
went round the world,
hoary as <hi>Methusalem)</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taild
by his Grandsire to
the house for ever; shee
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1336:83"/>
seizes the faire <hi>Aretaphila</hi>
into her tallons, more gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
then poverty it selfe;
nails that scratch like the
law, and are as good a
cure for the itch as the
Goale for theeves; her she
brings to the rack, there
intending, after confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
with most subtle tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to let out her life.
Oh, that Love in his Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piads
should bee drown'd
in those faire eyes! those
eyes, more eloquent then
all Rhetorick, that would
raise an Anchoret from
his grave, and turne the
Fiend <hi>Fury</hi> into the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin
<hi>Pity,</hi> that those eyes
should be of no other use
then to vent sorrow to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable
ears! that those
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1336:84"/>
white and red roses (which
no rain but what fell from
those heavenly eies) could
colour or sweeten, should
wither in their prime!
those lips that staine the
rubies, and make the roses
blush! those lips that
command the scarlet-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
morn into a cloud
to hide his shame, should
kisse a mercilesse and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new-sundring
rack! that
breath which makes us all
Chamaelions should bee
wasted into unregarded
sighs! that those brests
eternally chast, and white
as the Alps; those legs,
columnes of the fairest
<hi>Parian</hi> marble, columnes
that support this monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all pens, should
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1336:84"/>
bee stretch'd into anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies!
that her body that
would call a soule from
heaven into it, should bee
mangled like one that
hath hang'd in chaines
these three years! that her
skin, smooth as the face
of youth, soft as a bed of
violets, white as the
queen of innocence, sweet
as the bean-blossomes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
raine; that that skin,
the casket of that body,
the karkanet of that soul,
should be jag'd and torne
with that remorselesse pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
we commonly bestow
upon a scare-crow! After
long racking, when <hi>Calbia</hi>
saw shee could rack no
confession; then when
more torment would have
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1336:85"/>
been a reliefe; she was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
down from the rack,
and her body was pinn'd,
as an unwelcome courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
upon her soule. Thus
noble and pious guilt is
twin-brother, and carries
the same face with inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:
so was she spirited,
that those tortures could
scarce trie her patience,
lesse her truth; and though
<hi>Calbia</hi> was not fully pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
of any course to put
her to death; yet had shee
cruelty enough to doe
worse then kill her to
make a cause. But, <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphila,</hi>
though her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
liberty, and her owne
honour lifted higher then
the flatteries of life, or
feare of death; resolv'd in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1336:85"/>
spite of cruelty or fate, to
live whilst shee had offred
<hi>Nicocrates</hi> and <hi>Calbia</hi> to
her oppress'd Countries
rage: therefore the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time she was brought
to the rack, when fearing
she should be sacrific'd to
<hi>Calbia,</hi> not <hi>Calbia</hi> to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renaea,</hi>
to calm <hi>Nicocrates,</hi>
shee thus bespake him:</p>
            <p>Great Sir, when you
were pleas'd to lift my
humble fortunes up to
those glories that willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
engage a womans pride;
when by kind fate, and
kinder <hi>Nicocrates,</hi> I was
snatch'd from base private
arms, to the embraces of a
Prince: were these cheeks
dy'd into ingratitude and
crueltie to make them
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1336:86"/>
lovely? can your brest har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
such a thought; that
this brest which you were
pleas'd to think worthy to
harbour yours, can swell
with those two monsters
abandon'd by the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
of our sexe? But
since (such is my hard
fortune) I am reduc'd to
that misery as to defend
mine innocence; hear me
<hi>Nicocrates;</hi> not that I beg
life; for I scorne to stoop
(now I am suspected) so
low as to take it honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably.
This potion (which
the comments of envie
interpreted a poyson) is
a confection, not of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharides</hi>
for thy lust: but
of all those ingredients
that may strengthen ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1336:86"/>
love. This ture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence
had no designe
upon thy life, which (oh
thou all-seeing Skie wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse)
I value as much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
mine owne, as mine
honour above mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
but fearing lest like
a needle betweene two
loadstarres, the stronger
might attract thee; and
my unworthinesse (how
happy am I in it since it
pleads mine innocence!)
might betray me to a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyer
Love; I devis'd this
potion to make thy love
lasting as mine, which else
would soon consume, fed
with such withred fewell
as this poore declining
face; this face that can
boast nothing but her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1336:87"/>
which (since deriv'd

let <hi>Aretaphila,</hi> the <hi>Areta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phila</hi>
that is (since she)—</p>
            <p>There (though no
tongue could praise her
but her owne) the Tyrant
impatient (such oratory
have teares in a faire face)
to heare more, tearing his
haire, his rage too hastie
to be silent; hee express'd
as much spleen to <hi>Calbia,</hi>
as shee to <hi>Aretaphila.</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:1336:87"/>
What furies (said hee)
fled from their black regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
have possest thy black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
soule (fir to lend rage
to all the horrid haggs of
<hi>Tartarie)</hi> to act a deed,
which, oh you Heavens!
can you behold without
raine and thunder, your
combin'd sorrow &amp; rage?
can you rend the clouds
which are but the suck'd
up vapours of the earth;
and not her that takes in
all the poysonous sin of
hell to fortifie her wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ednesse?
Accurs'd fury!
curs'd from the cradle to
the tombe, curs'd above
all that ever Heaven and
Earth yet curs'd! May all
the sins of me, my Name,
and House returne into
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1336:88"/>
thy venom'd soule, till
they have press'd it into
the low despaire of nere-below-repenting
sinners.
Then in his fury, too
great for more words; he
had rack'd his Mother <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia;</hi>
had not the vertuous
<hi>Aretaphila</hi> stepp'd in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
him and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.
<hi>Nicocrates</hi> now
gladly possest of her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
endeavours by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
favours to raze out
all the injuries imprinted
on her body and her soule:
but shee like an Anvile,
too much heated by the
last blowes to coole sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly;
meditates upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and more safe way
for the Tyrants death. She
had a Daughter, every way
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1336:88"/>
exactly perfect, for she was
Daughter to <hi>Aretaphila.</hi>
The Tyrant had a brother
called <hi>Leander;</hi> you have
already all that commends
him; hee was an haire-braind,
wild-headed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein'd
young man; one
whom lust or ambition
might flatter into the
most desperate attempts.
<hi>Aretaphila</hi> wrought so far
with the King, that a
match between her <hi>Hero</hi>-Daughter
and the young
<hi>Leander</hi> was by his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
concluded; her shee
counsels to insinuate into
her Husbands rashnesse,
and perswade him (and oh
what will not this pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous
night-geare doe!)
to besiege his brothers
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1336:89"/>
Crown. <hi>Leander</hi> not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
hee enjoyd in her;
thought now nothing lesse
then to raise himselfe as
high as his ambition,
brib'd his Swiz—servant
<hi>Diapheries,</hi> who in the
first nick of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
murthred <hi>Nicocrates.</hi>
Whither do these crowns
and scepters, the worlds
<hi>magnalia,</hi> but indeed the
balls of Fortune, hurrie
thee, fond <hi>Leander?</hi> thou
hast not kill'd the Tyrant
for the Countrey: but
slaine thy brother for the
Crowne. Through how
many restlesse nights, and
lesse restlesse thoughts do
we encounter these sweet-bitter
joyes: and as the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1336:89"/>
more we graspe the water
into our hands, the lesse
wee hold: so is content
the farther from us, the
more we seeke it in these
fading glories of the
World; which like an <hi>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnis
fatuus,</hi> first lights us
through wild untrodden
pathes unto themselves;
then through vaste ayrie
thoughts they lead us up
to that precipice, from
whence we fall, and there
they leave us. <hi>Aretaphila</hi>
could not appease her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
till she had pluck'd
up the Tyrant by the
roots. First shee incenc'd
the Citizens against <hi>Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
the Traitour to his
Prince, the parricide of
his Countrey, the fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:1336:90"/>
and lastly the muder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of her Husband. They
with one consent adjud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him to bee sowed up
into a sack, and cast into
the sea. Then judgement
proceeded to <hi>Calbia,</hi> whom
they condemned to the
fire, and shee was burnt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.
<hi>Diapheries</hi> not worth
naming, and therefore I
think not worth hanging,
the Storie mentions not
his punishment. The <hi>Cyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeans</hi>
now prostrate their
lives and fortunes to the
devotion of <hi>Aretaphila,</hi>
that was owner of them
both; they offer her divine
honours, and beseech her
to take further protection
of the Countrey. But she
who to doe her Countrey
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1336:90"/>
service, could subdue her
thoughts to be a Queen;
can fall from that height,
to rise above all Crowns,
into her owne content;
she shaking off those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
loades of State, reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from all the crowding
tumults of the Court, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a solitary and truely
happy countrey-conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
there to spinne out
her thread of life at her
homely distaffe: where we
will leave her a veryer
wonder then the <hi>Phoenix</hi>
in the Desart, the alone
Paragon of all peerlesse
perfections. Her actions
(so above the criticisme
of my purblind judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
I am not able to
comprehend, much lesse
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1336:91"/>
contradict, or controvert.
I am silent, lest you should
passe that censure upon
me for her; which <hi>Famia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
Strada</hi> did upon <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>
for <hi>Plautus;</hi> that my
judgement is <hi>judicium si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne

Pride or weaknesse makes
her chast. She understands
not the common conceit of
love, nor entertaines that

inseparable companion of
Love, she scorns, though she

marry, it is onely to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate;
the very act tending

the reward of her Vertue;
her soule is not so servile, as
to be tyed by the hope of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse,

Shee entertains pitie as an

ungall'd, and can endure the
