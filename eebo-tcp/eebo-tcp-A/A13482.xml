            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE OCCASION OF this Old Man's being brought out of Shropshiere to <hi>London.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS it is impossible for the Sun to be without light, or fire to have no heate; so is it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable that true Honour is as inseparably addicted to Vertue, as the Steele to the Load-stone; and without great violence neither the one or the other can be sundred. Which manifestly appeares, in the conveying out of the Countrey, of this poore ancient Man (Monument I may say, and almost Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Nature.) For the Right Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <hi>Thomas</hi> Earle of <hi>Arundell</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> Earle Marshall of <hi>England,</hi> &amp;c. being lately in <hi>Shropshiere</hi> to visit some Lands and Maners which his Lordship holds
<pb facs="tcp:2787:4"/>
in that County, or, for some other occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of Importance, which caused his Lordship to be there. The Report of this Aged Man was certified to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; who hearing of so remarkable a Piece of Antiquity, his Lordship was pleased to see him, and in his Innated No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Christian Piety, hee tooke him into his charitable tuition and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; Commanding that a Litter and two Horses (for the more easie carriage of a man so enfeebled and worne with Age) to be provided for him; Also, that a Daughter-in-Law of his (named <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye</hi>) should likewise attend him, and have a Horse for her owne riding with him; And (to cheere up the Old Man, and make him merry) there was an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique-fac'd-fellow, called <hi>Iacke,</hi> or <hi>Iohn the Foole,</hi> with a high and mighty no Beard, that had also a Horse for his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. These all were to be brought out of the Countrey to <hi>London,</hi> by easie Iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes; the Charges being allowed by his
<pb facs="tcp:2787:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lordship, and likewise one of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours owne Servants, named <hi>Brian Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> to ride on horseback with them, and to attend and defray all manner of Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings and Expences; all which was done accordingly, as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Winnington</hi> is a Hamlet in the Parish of <hi>Alberbury,</hi> neere a place called the <hi>Welsh Poole,</hi> eight miles from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> from whence hee was carried to <hi>Wim,</hi> a Towne of the Earles aforesaid; and the next day to <hi>Shefnall,</hi> (a Mannour House of his Lordships) where they likewise staied one night; from <hi>Shefnall</hi> they came to <hi>Woolverhampton,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Brimicham,</hi> from thence to <hi>Coventry</hi>; and although Master <hi>Kelley</hi> had much to do to keepe the people off that pressed upon him in all places where hee came, yet at <hi>Coventry</hi> hee was most opprest: for they came in such multitudes to see the Olde Man, that those that defended him, were almost quite tyred and spent, and the aged man in danger to have bin stife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
<pb facs="tcp:2787:5"/>
and in a word, the rabble were so unruly, that <hi>Bryan</hi> was in doubt hee should bring his Charge no further; (so greedy are the Vulgar to hearken to, or gaze after novelties.) The trouble being over, the next day they past to <hi>Daventry,</hi> to stony <hi>Stratford,</hi> to <hi>Redburn,</hi> and so to <hi>London,</hi> where he is well entertain'd and accomodated with all things, having all the aforesaid Attendants, at the sole Charge and Cost of his Lordship.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>One Remarkable Passage of the Old mans Pollicie must not bee omitted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, which is thus.</head>
               <p>His three Leases of 63. yeares being expired, hee tooke his last Lease of his Landlord (one Master <hi>Iohn Porter</hi>) for his Life, with which Lease, hee hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved more then 50. yeares (as is further hereafter declared;) but this Old Man would (for his wives sake) renew his Lease for yeares, which his Landlord
<pb facs="tcp:2787:5"/>
would not consent unto; wherefore old <hi>Parr,</hi> (having beene long blind) sitting in his chaire by the fire, his wife look'd out of the window, and perceiv'd Master <hi>Edward Porter,</hi> the Son of his Landlord, to come towards their house, which she told her husband, saying, Husband, our young Land-lord is comming hither: Is he so, said old <hi>Parr</hi>; I prethee wife lay a Pin on the ground neere my foot, or at my right toe; which, she did; and when yong Master <hi>Porter</hi> (yet forty yeares old) was come into the house, after salutations between them, the Old Man said, Wife, is not that a Pin which lyes at my foot? Truly husband, quoth she, it is a Pin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, so she tooke up the Pin, and Master <hi>Porter</hi> was halfe in a maze that the Old Man had recovered his sight againe; but it was quickly found to be a witty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, therby to have them to suppose him to be more lively than hee was, because hee hop'd to have his Lease renew'd for his wives sake, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2787:6"/>Hee hath had two Children by his first wife, a Son and a Daughter, the Boyes name was <hi>Iohn,</hi> and lived but ten weekes; the Girle was named <hi>Ioan,</hi> and shee lived but three weekes. So that it appeares hee hath out-lived the most part of the people that are living neere there, three times over.</p>
