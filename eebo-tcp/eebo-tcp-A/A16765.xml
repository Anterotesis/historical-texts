            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

if not, God blesse me from yee;
for the world is so full of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that a man can meete with
little goodnesse: Maye it please
you to vnderstand, that it was my happe of late,
passing through Paules Church yarde, to looke
vpon certaine pieces of Poetrye, where I found
(that it greeues me to speake of) one writer so
<pb facs="tcp:9595:3"/>
straungely inueigh against another, that many
shallow wits stoode and laught at their follies.
Now, findinge their labours so toucht with ill
tearms, as befitted not the learned to lay open,
I thought good, hauing little to doe, to write
vnto all such writers, as take pleasure to see
their wits plaie with the world, that they will
henceforth, before they fall to worke, haue in
minde this good prouerbe: <hi>Play with mee; but
hurt me not: and iest with me; but disgrace
me not;</hi> Least that the world this iest do kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of Charitie, that I wish to finde at all their
handes that see and will reprooue my folly: for
I am none of the seauen wise men, and for the
eight, I knowe not where to seeke him. Beare
with me then, if out of the principles of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
cloth I haue pickt out matter to mooue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience.
And if there be any thing out of that
poore library, that may take place in any of your
good likings, I will honour your good spirits for
your kinde acceptations. But, in any wise, what
ere you think, giue me no word of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation:
least, too glad of such a mischaunce, I trust the

better to my euill fortune. Well, in earnest, I
will entreat all good schollers to beare with
my lacke of learning, and wise men with my
lacke of witte, and my creditors with my lacke
of mony. Which, though it haue nothing to doe
in this Treatise, yet entreaty sometime doeth
well with honest mindes: which I wish, and hope
of in them, yea, and all the world that I shall
haue to doe withall. Leauing therefore the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
