         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>ALthough we have been of all
Nations the moſt ſinful, yet
from time to time, God in
Mercy did deal with us, that we Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans
might be a People ſaved to the
Glory and Honour of his free Grace:
as it is written, <hi>Iſa. 43. 2. This people
have I formed for my ſelf: they ſhall
ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> And as it is
ſeen from age to age, Gods Juſtice
is ſuch, that it will not paſs by the
ſins of any people, but eſpecially his
own people, as you ſee, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 2.
ſo he owning us, did ſeverely puniſh
us for our ſins at all times: Firſt,
by the Grecians, when our Royal
City of <hi>Troy</hi> was deſtroyed; and
then after we came hither, by the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:64040:3"/>
Romans, Saxons, Danes, Normans;
yea; God made uſe of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
round about us, when we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to puniſh us for our ſins, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as our enemies willed, who
would have utterly deſtroyed us, nor
according to our deſerts, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
no leſs then utter deſtruction;
but God, according to his purpoſe,
corrected us in mercy and meaſure.</p>
            <p>And when our City of <hi>Troy</hi> was
deſtroyed, and we ſcattered from
thence, to ſeek a new habitation;
ſome of us came to <hi>Italy</hi> (which
Country long after gloried in being
Trojans) but the Nobles followed
<hi>Brute</hi> their Prince, and from all parts
as they were informed, came unto
him, into <hi>Grecia,</hi> where in time, <hi>Brute</hi>
became potent, having with him in
Towns, Woods and Deſarts a ſtrong
Party: &amp; when at the Requeſt of <hi>Brute,
Pandraſus</hi> King of <hi>Greece</hi> would not
grant them Liberty in his Countrey,
or leave to depart out of his Country,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64040:3"/>
but went about to puniſh them; <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
overthrew the King in battle,
took him priſoner; that <hi>Pandraſus</hi>
King of <hi>Greece,</hi> to reedeem himſelf
according to agreement made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, was glad to furniſh him
with a Navy and much Treaſure,
and give him his Daughter to wife:
whereupon <hi>Brute</hi> and his company
leaving <hi>Grecia,</hi> came through many
Countries, found many more of the
diſperſed Trojans, fought many
Battels victoriouſly, got much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and riches, and made no ſtay
until he came to this Land, which
God had promiſed him in a Viſion
at <hi>Leogitia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And coming, by Gods Providence,
to this Land, we found here certain
Giants deſcended from <hi>Ham</hi> the ſon
of <hi>Noah,</hi> who then called the Name
of this Land <hi>Albion;</hi> from <hi>Albion</hi>
the fourth ſon of <hi>Neptune,</hi> that was
the firſt King which reigned here of
that Race: thoſe Giants did oppoſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64040:4"/>
us; but we deſtroyed them all; and
the name of the Land we called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the name of <hi>Brute, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi>
and as we ſearched the Land,
we found in many places of it, but
moſt of them inhabiting <hi>North-Wales,</hi>
a people deſcended from <hi>Japhet</hi> the
ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> called <hi>Samotheans.</hi> This
<hi>Samothea</hi> by <hi>Moſes, Gen.</hi> 10. 2. is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Meſhech,</hi> and he came here with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
200 years after the Flood; he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
all the men of that age in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
learning and knowledge, both
in Divinity and Philoſophy; and
being skilful in the Law of God and
Man, he was exceedingly given to
the Religion of his Grandfather
<hi>Noah,</hi> which he upheld in his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and when the earth was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 5, 25. he had for his
portion in <hi>Europe</hi> all the Country
lying between the River of <hi>Rhene</hi>
and the Pirenian Mountains; which
Lands he peopled with ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
as could be gotten in thoſe days:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64040:4"/>
but he choſe for his own habitation
this Iſland, and called it <hi>Samothe:</hi>
he dwelt in <hi>North-Wales;</hi> and <hi>Samothea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Sarron, Drius, Bardy,</hi> reigned here
long time before <hi>Albion</hi> came; and
they were ſo famous for learning,
that every one of theſe erected a
Colledge of himſelf; ſo that the
Greeks, Perſians, Athenians, even
all the Gentiles, had their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
and Learning from theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
firſt; which then was pure
Knowledge, though afterward cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
by new deviſes among them
of other Countries, who thought
they were no body if they did not
adde to it.</p>
            <p>When we <hi>Britains</hi> being deſcended
of <hi>Gomer</hi> the ſon of <hi>Japhet&amp;</hi> found theſe
Samotheans our Brethren, not onely
becauſe of kinde, but alſo for their
Learning and Vertue, we were right
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64040:5"/>
glad to meet with them, ſo that we
joyned with them, and became one
people; and in ſhort time after,
things in <hi>Britain</hi> were ſo ſettled, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
in matters of Religion, that
as I may ſo ſay, we were Chriſtians
above a thouſand years before Chriſt
was born.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we believed in the onely
true ever-living God, Maker of all
things.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we had three Names to
the ſame God, by which we called
upon him, and did worſhip him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that he was three in One, and
One in Three.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we believed that the
ſoul is immortal; and that when
one died, his ſoul entred into another
body prepared of God for him: ſo
that if he that died was a good man,
his ſoul was raiſed and went into a
more honourable and glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
but if he that dyed was a bad
man, his ſoul deſcended and went
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64040:5"/>
into a more diſhonourable and baſe
body: God in this caſe judging e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man according to his works
done in his body: thus we believed
the Reſurrection; and ſurely it doth
in ſome meaſure agree with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
as may be proved by many
Texts; and was not the ſoul of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
in <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> which made
our Saviour affirm that <hi>John</hi> was <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah?
Mat.</hi> 11. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for the Government of
this Religion, the Land was divided
into 28 parts, where were ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
28 <hi>Flamines,</hi> whereof three of
them were called <hi>Archflamines,</hi> which
were then as the Biſhops and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops
of our time, but after a more
perfect manner; for then there was
three <hi>Archflamines</hi> over the Britains,
which did ſignifie the Trinity and
Perſonalty of the Godhead; but our
Church of <hi>England</hi> had but two
Archbiſhops.</p>
            <p>Therefore it was not a hard thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64040:6"/>
for <hi>Lucius</hi> King of the Britains to
ſtabliſh the Chriſtian Faith in his
Kingdom, it being all one with that
they had in Doctrine and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
onely differing in Names and
Ceremonies; ſo that <hi>Lucius</hi> which
was the firſt Chriſtian King in the
world, quickly, and without violence,
brought the Britains to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith: who hearing Chriſt prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
immediately believed, and
were baptized: that <hi>Lucius</hi> change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the word <hi>Flamine</hi> into <hi>Biſhop,</hi>
thus altering few Names and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
the work of reformation in
Britain is done quickly.</p>
            <p>And in Contemplation of theſe
things, I ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> while he was on
earth viewing the Daughters of the
Gentiles, to finde out his Spouſe;
and among them all, concludes Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to be the moſt amiable; and
being in love with her beauty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>Solomon, ſong</hi> 4. is reſolved to
take her to wife, that he might beget
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:64040:6"/>
a ſon of her body to inherit his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:
therefore <hi>Jeſus</hi> the King, after
the manner of Kings, ſends the moſt
honourable of all his Diſciples, <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
of <hi>Arimathea</hi> by Name, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour
to <hi>Britain;</hi> and he coming
to <hi>Arviragus</hi> then King of <hi>Britain,</hi>
was ſo courteouſly received, that the
King gave him ſome Land to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
and liberty to declare his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to the Britiſh Lady, ſo called for
method ſake: but the ſaid Lady,
notwithſtanding the Kings conſent,
for modeſty ſake, as prudent Ladies
uſe to do in ſuch a caſe, doth not
ſeem to grant her love to her beloved
at the firſt motion, becauſe ſhe
might have been judged to be of an
unconſtant minde, for altering her e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
ſuddenly, and without mature
deliberation: for theſe cauſes the
ſuit continueth; ſo that the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is not fully made between <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt</hi> and the Britiſh Lady until
King <hi>Lucius</hi> time, and then they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:64040:7"/>
were married with great joy: and
not long after, the Britiſh Lady
brings forth a ſon to Jeſus Chriſt,
namely, <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great, who
gave ſuch a wound to the enemies of
Jeſus Chriſt, that they could never
recover it: we then being aſſured
that the Britiſh Lady ſhould bring
forth another ſon to deſtroy all the
enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and receive
of his glory, for this cauſe <hi>Britain</hi>
had many enemies that envied her,
becauſe of this honour that God
was pleaſed to give her: which is
worth your conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Britain</hi> being thus exalted, and
her ſon made Emperour, Satans
Friends fell into a tottering conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
therefore he ſtirreth all his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
againſt the Britiſh Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
as the Saxons, Danes, Normans,
and all the Nations round about
ſought to deſtroy them, till they
drove the <hi>Britains</hi> into <hi>Wales;</hi> and at
laſt, after much Wars for a long
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:64040:7"/>
time, through a guile uſed in their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement
with <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, who
privately ſent his Queen to <hi>Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi>
where the firſt Prince of the
Engliſh Race was born; and the
<hi>Britains</hi> ſubmitting to him, brought
themſelves into ſuch miſery, that
from <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to <hi>Henry</hi> the
ſevenths time, the <hi>Britains</hi> were
in great ſlavery; the Engliſh uſing
them cruelly, deſtroying their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Records, prohibiting them to
bring their Children up in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
intending to extinguiſh their
ancient Language, and bring the
propheſies and promiſes written in
the ſame Language to none effect:
but for all that, the <hi>Britains</hi> through
Gods Providence preſerved their
Language, and ſo much of their
Writings as is needful to hold forth
the truth for them.</p>
            <p>And of all the enemies that we
had ſince our coming to <hi>Britain,</hi> the
Romans were the moſt honeſt and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:64040:8"/>
nobleſt Enemy; for they indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
the <hi>Britains</hi> according to
their worth and quality, making a
difference between us and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
people round about us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Romans found the <hi>Britains</hi>
to be as good men as themſelves
were: for all the Countries herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſubmitted to <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any great reſiſtance: but when
he ſent to <hi>Caſſibelan</hi> King of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
to have him ſubmit, <hi>Caſſibelan</hi>
ſent him word, That he and the
<hi>Britains</hi> had not learned as yet to
live in ſervitude; and that <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſhould find it a hard matter to bring
them to it: whereupon <hi>Caeſar</hi> being
in wrath, came to <hi>Britain</hi> with all
his Power; but he found <hi>Britain</hi> ſo
hot, that he was forced to go back
into <hi>France</hi> from whence he came;
and after many returns to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
being half aſhamed, <hi>Caeſar</hi>
ſought to gaine the <hi>Britains</hi> by love,
and at laſt came to an agreement
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:64040:8"/>
with them, that the Romans and the
Britains ſhould become one people.
Thus they concluded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So that you
may ſee in the Chronicles (as many
more were) <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great
was a <hi>Britain</hi> by the one ſide, and a
<hi>Roman</hi> by the other; for which cauſe
<hi>Pompey</hi> who was ſent from <hi>Rome</hi> to
conquer the other ſide of the world,
ſent a jeere to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> for that he
could not otherways overcome ſuch
a ſmall handful of people as he judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the <hi>Britains</hi> to be: therefore <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
bore him a grudge for it to his
dying day; ſo that before <hi>Pompey</hi>
came to <hi>Rome, Caeſar</hi> having many of
the <hi>Britains</hi> with him, met him, and
ſhewed him the <hi>Britains</hi> Valour in
a Battel where <hi>Pompey</hi> was ſlain, and
<hi>Caeſar</hi> made Conqueror of the
World.</p>
            <p>And know this alſo, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
ſhould never have had footing
in <hi>Britain,</hi> had <hi>Britain</hi> then been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within it ſelf: for King <hi>Lud</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64040:9"/>
and left behind him under age
four ſons: <hi>Caſſibellan</hi> his Brother
was made Protector; and uſurping
the Throne, <hi>Androgeus</hi> ſon and heir
to <hi>Lud,</hi> being deprived of his right,
agreed and ſided with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and
went to <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore many towns
not ſubmitting to <hi>Caſſibellan,</hi> becauſe
he was not their lawful King, made
much for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and brought in the
Romans as aboveſaid: ſo that <hi>Caeſars</hi>
report is true, ſaying, That <hi>Britain
was divided when he invaded it:</hi> but
had he come in King <hi>Luds</hi> time, he
had found no entrance into <hi>Britain.</hi>
Yet as the truth is, our Confedracie
with the Romans did us much evil:
for our men going out of the Land
to maintain the Romiſh intereſt,
made our number decreaſe, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boldened
our pilfring Enemies to ſet
upon us, ſpecially after they ſaw that
huge hoſt go out of <hi>Britain</hi> for the
ſervice of Chriſt under <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
the Great. Thus much touching the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64040:9"/>
Romans, as being worthy of note, I
thought good to ſhew you.</p>
            <p>And now to return where I left:
The <hi>Britains,</hi> as before you ſee,
were in great diſtreſs, from the time
of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, to the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the ſeventh; that is to ſay, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
two hundred years; and for
all their enemies could do to them,
the <hi>Britains</hi> kept their Language, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
and Propheſies: ſo that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the ſeventh being a <hi>Britain</hi>-promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Prince, had them Propheſies as
his guide; and he obſerving them,
came accordingly to the Throne, to
the comfort of all people: for he
united <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> redeemed
<hi>Wales,</hi> and was the means to bring
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> under one head;
and from that time to this day, the
Welch Britiſh blood, according to
the Welch Propheſies, hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
on the Throne of great <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:64040:10"/>
Thus far God hath done for us in
fulfilling our propheſies; bleſſed be
his Name for ever: and more is yet
to be fulfilled of the ſaid Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
which will infallibly come to
paſs as the reſt did; for God is come
in his promiſes, therefore now it is
time for you Engliſh-men to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it, (and not henceforth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,
deride and ſcorn the Welch)
that ye may as <hi>Britains</hi> be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the bleſſing with us, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your Engliſh or Saxon intereſt;
for ſurely the Saxons ſhall vaniſh, as
God hath determined it by our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies.</p>
            <p>The myſtery of our Propheſies
and Knowledge was delivered to us
of old, by <hi>Samothea,</hi> or, as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls
him, <hi>Gen. 10. 2. Meſhech,</hi> that is, a
Meſſenger or Angel of God: others
call him, <hi>Dieſe,</hi> that is, God; they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
the Godhead to him, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the light come from him to
the world: but we call him <hi>Samothea,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:64040:10"/>
that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a man endued with wiſdome
or ſapience above others; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
at firſt laid the platform of
true Knowledge among us; by which
Evangelical Divine Rules, our Bards
were guided to propheſie: and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
having the myſtery opened by
the coming of Jeſus Chriſt, they
were the more informed by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
ſo that they became undoubtful
and certain in what they ſaid and
delivered to the <hi>Britains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a Book of one Mr.
<hi>Thomas Pugh,</hi> called, <hi>Britiſh and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landiſh
Propheſies,</hi> printed 1658, for
<hi>Lodowick Lloyd</hi> at the Caſtle in <hi>Gorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil</hi>
in <hi>London;</hi> In which Book you
ſhall finde much of our Welch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies,
(though miſ-applyed by
the Author) to which Book I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
you: for in that Book you are to
look upon a thing done according to
the pattern, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 5. that is, a thing
in form like the old Teſtament, and
beginning the 540 year of Chriſt,
page 1.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:64040:11"/>
Firſt of all, you ſhall finde there
a ſecond <hi>Moſes,</hi> or an Angelical
Child taken out of the water, called
<hi>Talieſin,</hi> whom many our Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
much honour: for the ſaid <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſin</hi>
tells you many things that were
in the beginning, as <hi>Moſes</hi> doth; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
woes againſt all ſorts of
ſinners; ſheweth you his belief in
Jeſus Chriſt; warns you of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
Faction; and tells you a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
of the <hi>Britain</hi> Captivity being
overcome by the Saxons, and of
their Reſtoration in due time by the
ſeed of the woman, whom he calls
by name <hi>Angharad,</hi> many hundred
years before ſhe was born, pag. 13.
and pag. 20. and that out of the ſaid
woman ſhould come a valiant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour
called <hi>Kar,</hi> that is, <hi>Karolus</hi>
or <hi>Charles,</hi> pag. 24. This <hi>Talieſin,</hi>
and the Prophets or wiſe men that
followed, do foretel you the death
of King <hi>Charles,</hi> the place of it, the
manner of it, and ſhew you by whom
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:64040:11"/>
it is done, pag. 43. and who for a
time ſhall enjoy his Territories,
pag. 37.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you ſhall finde that
<hi>Charles</hi> the King, and <hi>Oliver</hi> that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys
his Kingdoms, are both the ſeed
of the ſame <hi>Angharad,</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> and
<hi>Eſau</hi> were, <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. See for this, pag.
151, and 252, and 168.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, you ſhall find that theſe
Prophets do agree, and teſtifie that
the ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> called by them <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronog
vaban;</hi> in Engliſh, the crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſon of <hi>Anne,</hi> ſhall riſe again, and
not onely conquer <hi>Britain,</hi> or recover
his own, but alſo ſhall conquer the
whole world: that is, the Line and
Race of the ſaid <hi>Charles,</hi> ſhall do it:
for you muſt underſtand it in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
way: See for this, pag. 37,
38. and alſo pag. 47, 48, 49, 50,
51.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, for a miraculous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that that Race and Line of <hi>Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronog
vaban</hi> ſhall be raiſed again to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:64040:12"/>
conquer, as aboveſaid, you ſhall find,
pag. 104. <hi>Talieſin</hi>'s Propheſie of
great ſtones raiſed from a bottom,
and ſet on a hill (which ſtones are
ſo big, that no creature can move
them) when the head of <hi>Koronog
Faban</hi> was to be raiſed; and that
came to paſs at the Coronation of
King <hi>James</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who had
been crowned many years afore in
<hi>Scotland</hi> while he was in his Cradle;
which being in that regard a crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
baby, is alſo upon that account
<hi>Coronog Faban:</hi> for <hi>Koronog Vaban</hi> in
Engliſh, is either the crowned ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
or the crowned ſon of <hi>Anne;</hi> both
are included in the word. And the
Author confeſſeth it to be a word of
a double ſignification, 47. neither
durſt he put out ſuch propheſies,
had he not ſeemed to be exceedingly
for <hi>Oliver:</hi> therefore he wreſteth
the propheſies to ſpeak for him; and
it was GOD's Providence that
brought them forth: for <hi>Oliver</hi> was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:64040:12"/>
rather more angry then pleaſed
with the Author for ſuch a diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, you ſhall find that after <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſin</hi>
had ſet forth <hi>Olivers</hi> deeds, p.
22. he termineth and limiteth his
time; and then pag. 23. he ſaluteth
<hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond by name, though
myſtically; and there the Author
is at a ſtand, not daring to interpret
it, nor knowing what to ſay: but
pag. 149. he ſeemeth to ſhew the
time of the beginning of the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of <hi>Oliver</hi> and coming of <hi>Charles,</hi>
and of his deeds, as followeth, pag.
50.</p>
            <p>This is the whole ſubſtance of
<hi>Pughs</hi> Book, and it is agreeable to the
Scripture; it is agreeable to the Jews
Expectation, and agreeable to our
Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>And theſe propheſies did never
fail hitherto, as our Countrey-men
know; but at one time our Country-men
and Bards were amazed, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:64040:13"/>
thought they had failed: for in
1623. the golden number being 9.
the Moon alſo changing on Lower
Sunday-Eve, there was a propheſie
that pronounced a wo to <hi>Britain</hi> in
that year; and moreover, bidding
us beware of a fire upon the Land
(that year) the ſecond Thurſday after
<hi>Midſummer</hi> day; and therefore they
looked for that day to be the day of
Judgement: but finding nothing
come to paſs then, they thought all
their propheſies were lies, and that
no more credit was to be given to
them.</p>
            <p>But, as I was informed, upon that
very Thurſday, in that very year, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
Cromwel</hi> preſented a Petition to
King <hi>James</hi> touching the Fens in
<hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and about <hi>Eli,</hi> he being
backt with abundance of Country-men,
on ſtilts; and as ſoon as King
<hi>James</hi> took the Petition, his Noſe fell
a bleeding, that he ſwore it was an
ill Omen, ſaying, <hi>If he could tell how,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:64040:13"/>
he would hang that fellow that had given
him that paper.</hi> But <hi>Oliver</hi> had a ſtrong
party with him, ſo that the King
was pacified, and thought it beſt to
be quiet. Thus the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
began to jar about the Fens,
which the King had ſold from the
Countrey to ſome Dutchmen; &amp; <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
at the firſt began to gain the love
of the people by this means: for none
durſt head them then but he. Now
you ſee how the fire began between
the King and Country on that very
day: ſo that the propheſie was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
though our Country were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it: which fire burned
the King and his party to nothing;
ſo that as <hi>S. Clement</hi> ſaith, <hi>They ſhall be
renewed, and riſe as the Phoenix doth, out
of its own aſhes:</hi> and for this Nation,
I believe that the generality of the
people of this Land are <hi>Britains</hi> (or
Welch, as now we call them) by
deſcent: for though they loſt their
Language by reaſon of their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64040:14"/>
with Romans, Saxons, Danes,
Normans, and other Nations which
came to this Land from time to
time; yet they did not loſe their
Conſanguinity: and you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
thus much, that though this
Land was many times conquered by
forrainers, yet none of the poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Husband-men, nor any that
did ſubmit to the conquering party,
were removed; and that it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the chief Nobility, being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome,
fled to <hi>Wales,</hi> or to any
place where they could finde a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge.
Therefore we, whoſe noble
deſcent you ſee, ought not to be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
truly <hi>Wales</hi> had never been
brought under <hi>England,</hi> but for its
diviſion: and now what danger are
we in, being divided, and do no
righteous things? we cannot ſtand
long if we have not a King. But
you will ſay, Who ſhall be King?
If you go in a righteous way, I will
ſhew you that <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> is the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64040:14"/>
man who by right ſhould enjoy it
according to our ancient cuſtome:
for he is the true heir of all; for in
him runs that ſtream of Royal Blood
that ſhall make glad the City of
God: for all the Blood-Royal of the
Britains, Scots, Saxons, Normans, is
primary in him. I could make this
out, and ſhew you his lineal deſcent,
if I thought you would queſtion it:
I could alſo make it appear abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
by their propheſies in Mr.
<hi>Pughs</hi> Book, that God long before
this time hath determined and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his Fall and his Reſtorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that word <hi>Koronog vaban,</hi>
which is the Key of all our prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
belongs to him; and that it
cannot be brought to ſpeak for <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Cromwel,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pugh</hi> would have
it. But what ſhould I trouble you
with theſe things which you cannot
reliſh? I ſhall ſhew you a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
way; for God did not caſt down
<hi>Charles,</hi> to the end that he ſhould be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64040:15"/>
ſet up again upon the ſame ſlipery
foundation: for he had better he a
ſtep lower then he was, that he
might ſtand ſurer: Therefore take
this as followeth.</p>

            <p>I Having read Hiſtories, and ſeen the
courſe of the world from time to
time, I finde that from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this day, there is troubles in the
world about ſuperiority, and that much
innocent blood hath been ſpilt by Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors
to maintain their worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts;
yet for all that, could they never
make themſelves and poſterity ſure to hold
long, nor finde a way to govern, that was
not defective in the Iſſue: their Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being bloody, could not ſtay them
from falling: they would not come to
judgement, nor be called to an account
for what they did, and their ſhedding of
innocent blood: but they could not ſhun
it when Gods time came. I might prove
this, not onely from Hiſtories, but alſo
from the holy Scripture, that it is ſo now,
and hath been ſo at all times, in all the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64040:16"/>
world, among all nations from the
beginning: but my buſineſs is not to make
great Volumes to ſhew all that might be
ſaid in this Caſe: onely I ſay, that all ſorts
of Government, yet known and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
among men, whether by Kings Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary,
(counted beſt) or by Elective
Kings, or by States, or whatſoever elſe is
or hath been, it is nought, and deſtructive
to men: therefore I through Gods help
briefly ſhall ſhew you a Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that hath not been yet made known
to the world, though figured forth in the
Goſpel by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles,
this ſixteen hundred yeers: And now our
neceſſity requireth me to hold it forth:
we have had much talk of the Kingdom of
Jeſus-Chriſt, but we are ignorant of it all
this while; none ſheweth it, though it be
time: for if the Protector, Army, and
Parliament, ſtriving about the Militia (as
they did with the late King) fall to War
again (as it is like they will) then wo to
<hi>England,</hi> that ever the Goſpel ſhined
ſo bright in it, and that by it, it could not
finde the way of peace: therefore take
this as followeth for your direction.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:64040:16"/>

Church and State: namely, the <hi>Militia,</hi>
or whatſoever elſe is appointed for the
good and defence of the Nation, ſhall

            <p n="4">4. Let all Writs go, and whatſoever

he muſt give account before the King
and Parliament every third year; for all
that is done amiſſe in ruling, by him or
his Officers under him (though done by

            <p n="7">7. The King every third year, upon

he be that ſought not to the Protector

after his complaint made, though the

yet ſhall he not be heard by the King and

            <p n="11">11. The Deputy, or Protector, every

and make his complaint to him, clearing
it by evidence; and after that, he muſt
give juſt judgement ſpeedily in a weeks

ſhall call him to account for it: neither is
it intended that the Protector muſt judge
all cauſes between man and man, but to
judge the wrong done by any in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

            <p n="12">12. If by chance there come into the

Countrey and City, as one man, upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

ſome do) that is diligent in his calling,
yet his getting being ſo ſmall, that he is

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:64040:19"/>
ſhall queſtion them one by one, and
take out of them eight in number, two of

               <p>FIrſt, take notice of <hi>Matthew 20. 20,
21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
Mark 10. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. 43,
44, 45. Luke</hi> 22. 24, 25, 26, 27. All which
ſheweth, that when the Apoſtles ſtrove
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:64040:20"/>
for greatneſſe in his Kingdome, he tells
them that they muſt not be as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
were, who did alwayes exalt their
great and rich ones to reign over them;
but they contrariwiſe, are commanded to
exalt the low and poore to reign over
them. And indeed, there is weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why it ſhould be ſo, that the great
ones ſhould be kept down: for the great
ones alwayes ſtriving to be greater, and
to have more wealth and honour, they
being never ſatisfied, was the deſtruction
of themſelves and followers; and were
the diſquieting and ruine of good, meek,
innocent, peaceable men: and is it not ſo
to this day among us, and all them who
would be accounted Chriſtians?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
expounding the aboveſaid words of
our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor. 1.
27, 28, 29. God hath choſen the fooliſh
things of the world to confound the wiſe, and
God hath choſen the Weak things of the world
to confound the things which are mighty:
And baſe things of the world, and things
which are deſpiſed, hath God choſen: Yea,
and things which are not, to bring to nought
things that are, that no fleſh ſhould glory in
his preſence.</hi> And further he ſheweth, who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64040:20"/>
are thoſe choſen ones; and that they are
not them whom the world onely count
baſe, but alſo ſuch as the Church do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
and undervalue: even ſuch men as
is above mentioned in the Election, poor,
yet wiſe men; as you ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4, 5. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>If then ye have judgement of things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to this life, ſet them to judge which are
leaſt eſteemed in the Church:</hi> So that it is
clear, the holy Apoſtle would have the
Chriſtians (according to Chriſts words)
to make them Judges, or Kings, of poor
weak old men, which never had any ſtate
in the world, nor look for any thing of
the world, but food and raiment. And
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24. he there tells you,
that there is a neceſſity of ſuch men for
this purpoſe; and that upon ſuch ye
ſhould put the greateſt honour, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
godly and wiſe in a juſt way.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The holy Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> clears
it further, ſhewing you, that ſuch poor
men are the Royall ſeed of Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>James 2. 5. Hearken my beloved,</hi>
(ſaith he, regard what I ſay) <hi>hath not God
choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith,
and heirs to the kingdome which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to them that love him?</hi> Chriſtians, this
is the kingdome that ye dayly pray for,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64040:21"/>
when ye ſay to God, <hi>Thy kingdome come,
Thy will be done on earth,</hi> &amp;c. And yet you
will not have it come on earth: for (ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the generality or middle ſort of
men) ſaith he, <hi>James 2. 6. Ye have deſpiſed
the poor: Do not the rich men oppreſſe you,
and draw you before the judgement-ſeat?</hi>
As if he ſhould ſay, I appeal to your
own knowledge, whether it be not the
rich ones that bring all evil upon you: ye
deſpiſe the poor harmleſſe men, which
love God and not the world; and ye
would not have them which by Gods
apointment ſhould reign over you, and
ye have choſen the rich to reign over
you, that love the world and not God;
but what do you get by it? do they not
make war among you; &amp; to maintain their
humours, draw you, drive you, yea, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
you to nothing many times? this
you ſee is true. And again, theſe poor
muſt not be ſuch poor as make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
voluntarily poor; you know ſome
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do ſo, and glory
in it; but alas, it is a vain glory. Neither
are they ſuch as become poor by prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality
and evil-husbandry; but ſuch
poor as the Lord doth delight in, and
which follow him, and have been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64040:21"/>
alſo: yet through croſſes and
temptations have been kept alwayes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
by the power of God, ſo that they
could not attain to any ſtate in the world,
for they do not deſire it; much being
content with what God ſends them: for
they know riches is a tempting thing that
doth cauſe many to forget God, and be
as ſtrangers to him; and that of this ſort
is the tempting love of riches, to which
moſt mens wills are inclinable; and
therefore it is a dangerous temptation,
1 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 6. 9, 10. buried in oblivion by
them: for the temptation they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with, is their ſufferings, and
their adverſaries reproaching of them,
becauſe of their godlineſſe and low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
and to ſuch poor our Saviour
ſaith, <hi>Luke 22. 28, 29, 30. Ye are they
which have continued with me in my tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
and I appoint unto you a kingdome,
as my Father hath appointed me; That ye
may eat and drink at my table in my king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and ſit on thrones judging the twelve
tribes of Iſrael:</hi> And as Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith,
<hi>James 1. 12. Bleſſed is the man that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
temptation; for when he is tried, he
ſhall receive the crown of life, which the
Lord hath promiſed to them that love him:</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:64040:22"/>
for you muſt underſtand, that theſe poor
muſt be juſt and holy ones; and that no
wicked ones ſhall inherit this kingdome
of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. Let this ſuffice
to prove, that Chriſts kingdome is that
which I have ſhewed you in the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paſſage: Now I ſay unto you, It is in
vain for any to think of ſetting up any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Government (as ſaith the Angel to
<hi>Ezra, 2 Eſdras</hi> 10. 54.) for in the place
wherein the higheſt beginneth to ſhew
his kingdome or citie, there can no mans
building be able to ſtand; and God hath
begun here to ſhew it this many years;
therefore your buildings fall.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Reaſons why this kingdome ſhould be ſet
up among us.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is of Chriſt founded:
Therefore it is his kingdome, which is
moſt perfect (though contrary to the
kingdomes of men) which ſhall ſtand
for ever, to his glory.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe we were taught by Chriſt
to pray, ſaying, <hi>Thy kingdome come:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we ought to endeavour to fulfill
our prayers in ſetting it up, for our
good.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64040:22"/>
3. Becauſe ſuch a King, being old, and
hath not long to live here, and but a poor
allowance of a hundred pound a year;
one that fears God, and is choſen of God
by lot; one whoſe integrity is known to
men before he is choſen, ſo that he never
was for the world: I ſay, ſuch a one will
do right, and cannot do wrong; for the
fear of God, his age, weakneſſe, diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in money, and the Law, will bind
him to it. There is none elſe can do us
right, but ſuch a one as Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
and I, do ſhew you: for our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Kings had mighty Revenues and
power, therefore they did what they liſted
againſt Law and Reaſon, for which cauſe
they came to deſtruction many times:
Our former Parliaments being up, were
worſe then our Kings, laying heavier bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
on us: Therefore the Generall of
our Army pulls them down, and he ſets
up himſelf under the name of Protector:
but nothing is mended; therefore the
Army pulls him down, and are in confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not knowing what to do; and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall ſtand but this kingdome that I
ſhew you, becauſe it is of God: it is in
vain for you to ſet up any other form of
Government; for it ſhall fall, it ſhall be
pull'd down by others.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64040:23"/>
4. This Kingdom is not any way againſt
the Kings of the earth, but of much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to ſecure both great and ſmal in their
juſt Rights: for whereas now, they, through
their corrupt and boundleſſe reſolution,
hazard ſouls, bodies, &amp; States, to maintain
their prodigall unjuſt deeds, untill they
loſe all for it; this kingdome and King will
keep them in ſafety and ſure poſſeſſion:
for underſtanding that they are to give
account every third year, they will take
heed what they do, and not run in ſuch
extravagant, unjuſt courſes, and ungodly
wayes, and have much more comfort by it
then now they have: for God &amp; the people
will bleſſe them, and there is no other
way to eſtabliſh and confirm every one in
his juſt right but this: for Chriſt is the
Prince of peace, and will not disinherit
any line, yet will puniſh offenders, and
preſerve their ſeed that amend.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It prevents all treaſon: for to what
end ſhould any conſpire againſt this King,
that hath but a hundred pound a year,
which they ſhall not enjoy, if they kill,
him? the Law goes on, another is choſen,
and they are to ſuffer the moſt infamous
and cruel death as can be deviſed, and
none can come that way to reign in this
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64040:23"/>
kingdome. It ſhall not be here as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
it was, or as the ſaying is, Treaſon
never proſpereth: for if it proſper, who
dare call it treaſon? They ſhall not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
themſelves thereby: all treaſon
aims at ſome good advantage and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but here is nothing to be had; if
any do it, death and damnation is their
reward, which none living can deſire:
therefore this King needs no guard, God
and his innocency is ſufficient for his
guard; and let not his Deputy have any
guard to encourage him in wickedneſſe,
but let him have officers, perſons to keep
order about him, as the Lord Major of
<hi>London</hi> hath now about him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Becauſe in ſuch a King Chriſt
comes to reign upon earth; for Chriſts
coming muſt be as the coming of <hi>Eliah</hi>
was in <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> for <hi>Eliah</hi> was taken up
to heaven, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. 10, 11. as Chriſt
was, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 9, 10, 11. and it was as hard
a thing to ſee him aſcend, as it was to ſee
<hi>Eliah</hi> aſcend; and as there was a promiſe
that <hi>Eliah</hi> ſhould come on earth again,
<hi>Malachi</hi> 4. 5. So he came in <hi>John Baptiſt,
Luke</hi> 1. 17. and Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>John</hi> was
that <hi>Eliah,</hi> Matth. 11. 14, 15. Therefore
Chriſt comes not as men imagine, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64040:24"/>
to the Scripture, as I ſhew you
here; and they that look for his coming
in this way, ſhall ſee him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28,
and the reſt ſhall never ſee him, but ſhall
be ſhut up in darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>There is abundance more reaſons that I
could give you, to ſhew the beauty and
excellency of this kingdome: which I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
for the preſent; becauſe I intend to
be brief, and the time doth require it:
Therefore now I ſhall ſhew you ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to ſhew why this kingdome was not
ſet up afore this time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe our Saviour Chriſt foreſaw,
that the Kings of the Gentiles would not
have ſuffered the Goſpel to be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their kingdomes, if ſo be that the
Apoſtles had gone then to put them
down, and ſet up of the poor to be kings
over them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Goſpel of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
was firſt to be preached in all the
world for a witneſſe to all Nations; and
then (which is now) comes the end of
their kingdomes, and Chriſts kingdome
takes place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 14, 30. and the
Princes of the Gentiles ſhall mourn, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they muſt bow to this kingdome, and
become ſervants to the poor.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64040:24"/>
3. Becauſe the Gentiles have their
times limited, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. and though
known then to none but the Father, <hi>Acts</hi>
1. 6, 7. So that the Apoſtle then ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it, puts a certain time for an uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>Revel.</hi> 11. 2. but now the tokens
are come, the time is manifeſted, <hi>Matth.</hi>
24. 32, 33. that all may ſee it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe the Scripture was ingroſſed
heretofore in the great mens hands, ſo
that they might do as they pleaſed with the
people that knew little or nothing of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture;
but when the Art of Printing was
found, and they had liberty to have the
Scripture, knowledge is increaſed among
the People, and ſhall increaſe: So that they
will not be ruled by the Kings ſet up after
the manner of the Gentiles any more. Here
is the <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> that God raiſed our
Army to ſtand for; and if they will not
ſtand for this kingdome and government
of Chriſts own inſtitution, which I do
ſhew here, they ſhall fall: and thoſe that
take up this Intereſt ſhall prevail.</p>
               <p>Here you ſee the Reaſons why this
kingdome ought to be ſet up, and Reaſons
why it was not ſet up before this time.
And if you ask me the reaſon why King
<hi>Charles</hi> is ſo unfortunate, ſince I make
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:64040:25"/>
him to be the beſt of all Kings: truely I
anſwer, Becauſe his reſolution is not
right, for he would come in and ſettle all
things as formerly we had them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he cannot proſper; but let him leave
that reſolution, and reſolve to ſtand for
this way, ſurely he ſhall find better for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and be more glorious, and more
ſurer in his throne then any of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors,
though he ſeem to be a ſtep lower
then they were: For I ſay to him that
ſhall be King, and to him that is Deputy
and King alſo, for a Deputy was King,
1 <hi>Kings 22. 47. Let the brother of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
rejoice in that he is exalted: But the
rich, in that he is made low,</hi> James 1. 9, 10.
Here is matter of joy for both.</p>
               <p>Mens <hi>Good Old Cauſe</hi> ſhall fall: indeed
Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> doth ſhew the right cauſe of this
War, as at firſt it was declared, and that
was but a pretence, for they quickly rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſuch as ſtuck to that: their Cauſe was
to get all from the King, Countrey, and
Church, and to keep it; and this they call
the <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> and they that ſtand
for this, are counted the good people and
well-affected; but I am ſure their Cauſe
is neither good nor old: and if the long
Parliament come together, and ſit to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:64040:25"/>
maintain it, according to their invitation;
let them beware of <hi>John,</hi> leſt they alſo
be ſerved as <hi>Baal's</hi> worſhippers were,
2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 25. and it was a wiſe ſaying
of the Philiſtines to their King, 1 <hi>Sam.
29. 4. Wherewith ſhould he reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unto his maſter? ſhould it not be with the
heads of theſe men?</hi> Thus you ſee mens
Cauſe, and Gods Cauſe; mens end, and
Gods end and intention.</p>
               <p>Therefore let the Parliament at their
next meeting ſettle this government, for
none elſe will ſtand: for if the long Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
go ſettle themſelves as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
their Generall in time will break
them, and ſet up himſelf, ſo that there
ſhall be nothing but toſſing the Nations
to and fro in bloud, until this way of
Chriſt be ſetled.</p>
               <p>And if you deſire to know who hath
wrote theſe lines, you may come to know
me by my face, and form of my viſage,
which of late hath been changed: I nor
any other can give a reaſon for it, but
this, that it's a Sign of God, and a Seal to
this work of God, that ſhould ſtop the
Kings of the Gentiles mouths, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 52.
13, 14, 15. But methinks I hear ſome
ſay, The Jews will have no ſuch poor
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:64040:26"/>
King as you ſet forth; they refuſed King
Jeſus, becauſe he was outwardly poor.
I ſay, God hath provided one that is ſo
noble in birth and parentage for them,

               <p>ANd truely the people are now
in ſuch amazement, that they
know not who to obey with ſafety:
for <hi>Lenthals</hi> Parliament ſits, though
few in number, to maintain (as they
call it) a Free State; but the main
end of it is to hugge and make ſure
to themſelves the unrighteous Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
gotten by deceit. Chiefly,
Church and Crown-Lands; and this
is a matter of joy to their party:
<hi>Bampfields</hi> Parliament, as report goes,
look upon themſelves as yet not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
but rejourned, and have in
their meetings more members then
<hi>Lenthal:</hi> But <hi>Prins</hi> Parliament ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
both, in regard of its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
and Right Cauſe; which truth
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:64040:27"/>
the Records of the times, and all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
people can witneſſe, that the
Army was raiſed for the defence of
the King and Parliament, as Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>
maintains. Theſe Parliaments ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
nothing, no nor the head-Officers
of the Army; but the noble ſpirits
of the under-Officers and Agitators
doth all: Therefore you brave Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
ſtand up for Chriſts kingdom,
let not ſelf-intereſt blinde your eyes;
the glory is yours, for you are Chriſts
chief Inſtruments; Kings or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are as nothing before you:
yea, you Souldiers can take down
your head-Officers, if they ſtand
between you and Chriſt: O go on
as ye are Chriſtians, and go on as
ye are bold Britains of a noble
ſtock (as ye have it in the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Book) to ſet up Chriſts
Kingdom. Was it not a bold Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
Souldier, under King <hi>Belinus</hi> the
Britain, that ſtruck one of the
grave Senators of <hi>Romes</hi> beard, while
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64040:27"/>
yet they were Gentiles? for when
<hi>Belinus</hi> King of the Britains had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
all ſo far as <hi>Rome,</hi> the Roman
Senators ſaid, and ſent to him, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That he muſt not come there,
for it was the ſeat of the Gods: and
when <hi>Belinus</hi> boldly reſolved to try
whether they were Gods or no, he
marched to them, and found no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance,
becauſe they were not able
to fight him: for the Senators
thought, they being ſet on Thrones
in a gallant poſture, to daunt &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the Souldiers, that they were
Gods that could deſtroy the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
in a moment; but the undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Britiſh Souldiers being not afraid
of their preſence, came to ſee them;
and a bold Souldier, to try their Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
taking one of them by the beard,
made them all flee, and be glad to
give of their gold to ſerve the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
need. Here were gallant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
and much more gallant were the
Britains that went with <hi>Constantine</hi>

the great to raiſe up Chriſts Church,
and make it famous in the World;

ſet up Chriſts kingdome.</p>

me, ſaying, He ſet a time for the
Kings coming in 1653. and it came

the honourable Colonel <hi>John Jones,</hi>

and as I ſtood upon the water, I ſaw
a company of black Foxes purſuing
a young Lion; and as they followed
the Lion, they ran round about me,
ſometimes on the water, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
on the high way, that is on the
North-ſide of the pool: I pitied
the Lion, and caſt ſtones at the
Foxes with all my might: but as I
was throwing ſtones at the Foxes,
immediately they appeared to be
young children, that ſtood ſtill a

while on the way, the North ſide of
the pool; and a voice ſaid to me, Why
doſt thou caſt ſtones at the children?
and as I came to land, immediately
they turned to be black Foxes, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
the Lion again: but on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
the Foxes being on the water,
became white Lambs, ſtood ſtill; and
the Lion being on the water turned
to them; and they, as it ſeemed to
me, kiſſed each other: Thus the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

            <head>The Poſtſcript.</head>
            <p>ANd to ſhew you all in a word:
Firſt, you ſee that Jeſus Chriſt
is for a Single perſon, and not for a
Free State (as you call it:) <hi>He that is
chief,</hi> Luke 22. 26. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies
which would not that I ſhould reign,</hi> Luk.
19. 27. So that Jeſus when he ſpeaks
of theſe things, he is for a King, and a
kingdome; as you may ſee through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Goſpel. Secondly, you ſee
that he would not have the great and
rich to be his Kings (like as the
Gentiles have) but would have the
poor and low exalted to the Throne,
<hi>Lu.</hi> 22. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. Thirdly,
you ſee, that (as I ſaid before) there
muſt be two exalted in his kingdom,
yet one above the other muſt be the
Chief: for when the mother of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedees</hi>
children petitioned our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Jeſus Chriſt, for her two ſonnes
<hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Grant that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64040:31"/>
theſe my two ſons may ſit, the one on thy
right hand, the other on thy left, in thy
kingdome;</hi> he doth not anſwer her,
ſaying, There is no ſuch thing to be
in my kingdome; but ſaith, <hi>To ſit on my
right hand and on my left, is not mine to
give; but it ſhall be given to them for
whom it is prepared of my Father,</hi> Matth.
20. 21, 22, 23. Here you ſee that
two are to be exalted, yet differ in
power one above the other, as the
right hand is above the left: and if
you conſider this word, prepared and
promiſed, you ſhall find the harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of it touching this kingdome,
and admire it: for, ſaith the King,
<hi>Inherit the kingdome prepared for you,</hi>
Matth. 25. 34. and Saint <hi>James</hi> calls
it, <hi>The crown of life, and kingdome promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
of God to them that love him,</hi> James
1. 12. James 2. 7. And to you, I ſay,
the Parliament that now ſit (for I
have not addreſſed my ſelf to any
other power before, though I had
this knowledge long before now) Do
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64040:31"/>
you ſet up this kingdome, for you are
thoſe like <hi>Zorobabel</hi> that began the
work, do you alſo finiſh it, <hi>Zachar.</hi> 4.
9. Do you make an agreement with
<hi>Charles Stuart,</hi> and call him in (if
you think fit) to rule, and inherit his
own, and ſet a King above him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this diſcovery: for I do
believe, ſeeing things going on ſince
as they did, many of you repented
that you did not agree with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you were diſſolved; but then
you had not this way to propound to
him, which being obſerved, will
ſecure every man in his right, after
the agreement, ſo that none ſhall
wrong another: for Chriſt in the
poor man being exalted to the right
hand, having the ſole power, will
keep all in order and ſubjection. And
as God hath been preparing this
kingdome for us, from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the world: So you, after your
late repulſe, are better prepared to
ſet it up, then you were before: and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64040:32"/>
do it: let no ſelf-intereſt hinder it;
for you may ſecure all ye have thus
in peace, better then to keep up your
free State (as ye call it) by war and
fear, untill at laſt you loſe all: and
it is neceſſary that ye are now in ſuch
a ſtate, elſe you could never have
power to make agreement, and to ſet
up Chriſts kingdom; but have a care
that ye loſe it not again before you
do the work: for our noble Army,
whoſe wiſdome and valour you
know, whoſe deſcent I ſhew from the
Original, may have a deſign which
ye cannot apprehend.</p>
