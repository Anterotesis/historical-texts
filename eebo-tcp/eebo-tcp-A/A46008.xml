            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>By The SVPREAME COVNCELL OF THE CONFEDERAT CATHOLICKS OF IRELAND</head>
            <p>ALthough wee find our ſelues much afflicted, for the expreſſions wee are forced to make, of the <hi>Lord Nuncio</hi> his violent proceedings, againſt the gouernment of the Kingdome, &amp; the iuſt liberties of the Nation; yet being obliged to render an accompt to God and man, of the truſt repoſed in vs, &amp; ſeeing his Lopp: ſquares his actions by principles, apparantly contrary to the intreſt of this Nation: Wee muſt (in oppoſition to the Courſe hee ſteeres) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt to the world our dislike of his actions, and expreſs ſome parte of thoſe Iellouſies and diſtrusts, which (vpon iuſt grounds) wee haue entertained of his proceedings, in the enſuing reaſons, by which wee are induced at preſent to inhibitt the meeting of a <hi>Nationall Synod</hi> appointed by his Lopp:to be held at <hi>Galway</hi> the fifteenth of Auguſt next.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Firſt, it is not vnknowen, that the <hi>Lord Nuncio</hi> hath made ſuch vſe of a declaration drawen from a few Prelats againſt the Ceſſation concluded with the Lord Barton of <hi>Inchiquin,</hi> and of the vniuſt Cenſurs temerariously iſſued there vpon, that hee hath introduced a Ciuill <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar among the Confederatts, &amp; thereby expoſed the Catholick Religion and this Kingdome to apparant hazard of deſtruction. And now obſeruing many Prelatts, all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and men of intreſt, and all the Citties and Townes Corporat with in our Quarters, reſolued with vs to ſuppreſs thoſe in Armes oppoſing the Gouerment, who are ſupported by his Countenance, &amp; the ayds ſent for maintenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of our cauſe, which (contrary to his <hi>Holines</hi> pious intentions) are applyed to foment and encreaſe diſſentions, hee (by the aſſiſtance of a few ſeditious perſons) calls this <hi>Nationall Synod,</hi> intending [by that vnlimited power which hee aſſumes vnto himſelfe] and the terror of his Iudgements, which are already extended [to the vttermoſt of ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on the perſons of <hi>Father George Dillon,</hi> and <hi>Father Valentine Browne,</hi> for no other reaſon, then that they are not of his opinion, concearning the Ceſſation; to force an approbation of his moſt vniuſt and vnexampled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedings againſt thoſe adhering to the Gouernment, and to anticipat [aſmuch as in him lyeth) his <hi>Holineſs,</hi> [to whom wee haue appealed) his iudgment of our Cauſe.</item>
               <item>2. Secondly, hee conuenes it at <hi>Galway,</hi> a place inconuenient, as being ſeated in a remote parte of the Kingdome, vnſafe in the way to it, &amp; in a Prouince, which is now made the ſeate of warr: A place where inuectiues, againſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, are frequently preached by his allowance, where his Lopp:by his, and the influence of ſome ſeditious Cleargy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vpon a parte of the ignorant and misled multitude, haue already affronted the <hi>Magiſtrat,</hi> and beſt men of that <hi>Towne.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. T<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>dly, wee haue iuſt cauſe to feare ſome practize for ſurprizall of the Towne, at ſuch a tyme, when ſome ill affected perſons in the neighbourhood of it, haue rebelliously taken armes, in oppoſition to our authority; and are countenaced in it, &amp; (already by ſeizing &amp; piladging ſome Caſtles belonging to men of <hi>Gallway</hi>) do expreſs their diſaffection to the inhabitants, and their inclinations to the plunder of that <hi>Towne.</hi> What opportunity will ſuch a meeting (to which all men are promiſſcuously inuited by offer of ſafe Conduct, in the ſummons) affoard to ſuch a deſigne in theſe diſtracted tymes, when perhapps the <hi>Towne</hi> may be declared to haue incurred the Cenſures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſubmitts to our authority; and the act of plundering it, therefore eſteemed meritorious.</item>
               <item>4. Fowrthly, the <hi>Lord Nuntio,</hi> haueing made himſelfe a partie, and adhereing to <hi>Owne ô Neill,</hi> now actually in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes againſt the authority eſtablished by the Confederat Catholicks, what indifferency can be expected by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a <hi>Synod</hi> wherein hee is to praeſide?</item>
               <item>5. It is improper a <hi>Synod,</hi> should be called at ſuch atyme, when noe corner of the Kingdome is freed from the horrid effects of warr, and all places are full of inexpreſſable diſtractions, and none exempt from the miſery of famine wherein that <hi>Towne,</hi> and the adioyneing Countrey, ſuffer in a high meaſure.</item>
               <item>6. The <hi>Generall Aſſembly</hi> (the hig heſt authority among the Confederat Catholicks) being now conuen'd, and the body of the Kingdome being to meete, the <hi>fowrth of September next,</hi> wee hould it neceſſary they should be firſt conſulted with, in ſo great an affaire.</item>
               <item>7. Wherefore, <hi>It is ordered,</hi> and (by vertue of their oath of Aſſociation) it is ſtraightly charged and enioyned, that no <hi>Confederat Catholick,</hi> either of the <hi>Cleargy</hi> or of the <hi>Layety,</hi> of what degree, quaility, or Condition ſouer, do repaire to the <hi>Synod</hi> or meeting, ſummoned by the <hi>Lord Nuncio,</hi> to be held at <hi>Gallway</hi> the fifteenth of <hi>Auguſt next,</hi> or shall remaine there (if alredy gon thither, but shall depart thence imediatly, and shall not ſend his, or their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xies thither; and shall reuoke his or their ſaid Proxie (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
