         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following Practical and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental Treatiſe of the <hi>New-Birth,</hi> was Writ and Publiſh'd by the Author in his Youth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Fourty Years ſince; and having been long out of Print, and deſired by many, has put thoſe who are entruſted with his Writings to communicate it to the Publick a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, with ſome Alterations and Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the Authors own hand, to prevent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occaſion of Offence or Miſtake. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it hath pleaſed the Lord, not long ſince, to take his Servant up into that <hi>Reſt,</hi> whereof ſo many Years ago he had given him ſo raviſhing a <hi>Piſgah</hi> ſight (as will in part appear from the following Sheets) it has, been the deſire of many of his Friends (to whom his Memory is and ever ſhall be moſt ſweet and pretious) that this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Diſcourſe might be uſher'd-in with a ſhort Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:103754:3"/>
concerning Him, and ſome of his laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, till a fuller Relation of his Holy Life be prepared for publick View, which is a thing much deſired by many, to the end, that ſo Saint-like and Exemplary a Life might ſerve for a Copy and Encouragement of the Godly, and for the Reclaiming and Converting of the Wicked and Profane in theſe Dregs of Time, wherein we have ſo great a Scarcity of ſuch Examples, and in which true <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Fear of God</hi> ſeem to have left the <hi>Earth.</hi> But in the mean time, till ſome or other undertake this Task, be pleaſed <hi>Reader,</hi> to accept of theſe ſhort Hints, concerning the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> by whom our good God has been pleas'd to reach forth the following Truths and Directions, in the <hi>Way and Progreſs to the New-Birth</hi> (that Land of Reſt and Peace) unto thee, and all thoſe who have <hi>Ears to hear what the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſaith to the Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Bromley</hi> was born at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pton</hi> upon <hi>Severne</hi> in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Honourable Family, according to the Worlds Account (but methinks in menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning this, I ſink below the Subject I am ſpeaking of; for what's this to one who by his better Birth, was a Son and Heir of God, and Coheir with the King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, the Holy and ever Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus?</hi>) He was in his younger Years religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Educated, and after he had gone through
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:103754:3"/>
the Learning of the Schools, became a Member of <hi>All-Souls Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> where God was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his Son in him, and to make great and glorious Diſcoveries of himſelf unto him, ſuch, as it may be, ſhould they be here related, ſome would ſcarce be able to underſtand or bear. And from that time forwards the <hi>Supreme Love</hi> having raviſh'd his Heart with his All-ſurpaſſing Beauty, became a Vail to his Eyes, keeping him from beholding Vanity, or luſting after it; and he again in return of this ſpecial Divine Grace and Favour, wholly Dedicated himſelf to his Service from his Youth; and parting with all, and denying himſelf, became a faithful Follower and Diſciple of his great Lord and Maſter, the Holy <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> and a true Miniſter of the Goſpel, <hi>not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, one that needed not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But having ſpoke a few words of the <hi>Riſing</hi> of this <hi>Bright Star,</hi> I muſt next lead you to it's <hi>Setting,</hi> paſſing by it's whole Courſe; he therefore having thus for many Years <hi>walked with God,</hi> the Lord was pleaſed (before he took him to himſelf) to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe him with a long continued Weakneſs, which yet did not hinder him from exerciſing the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of an Evangelical Preacher. About three Weeks before his Departure, he preach'd his laſt Sermon from theſe Words; <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. the latter part of the Verſe, <hi>That we muſt through much Tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God</hi>; from whence he took
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:103754:4"/>
occaſion to diſcourſe not only concerning the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> but more eſpecially concerning the <hi>great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Spiritual Sufferings and Combats of Gods People.</hi> After this <hi>Sermon</hi> he grew ſo weak that he could not Preach, and but ſeldom Pray in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: Yet at ſometimes when he felt the Power of God upon him, he would have them call'd into his Chamber, and would pray with great Fervency and Strength of Voice, as if he had been in perfect Health. During this time (for his <hi>Setting</hi> was of one piece with his <hi>Riſing</hi> and <hi>whole Courſe</hi>) he gave many holy Exhortations to thoſe that came to viſit him; and would often ſay, <hi>He could take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in nothing but God, as having been dead to the World theſe many Years.</hi> He declar'd to a familiar Friend of his more than once, <hi>That except the Lord would be pleas'd to reſtore him to ſuch a degree of Health, that he might Preach the Goſpel, and ſo help to Edify the Church of God, he had rather (if he might chooſe for himſelf) die than live, for he knew whither he ſhould go,</hi> viz. <hi>to God and Chriſt, and all the Bleſſed Angels,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But that he muſt reſign.</hi> And would often ſay, <hi>That he lived in the Will of God.</hi> He was obſerved to be much introverted and exerciſed in Mental Prayer, or Prayer of Silence; and when he heard too much talk in his Chamber, he would ſay, <hi>Be ſilent, be ſilent; for Silence and Stilneſs is beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had one Evening (being about Ten Days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:103754:4"/>
he died, ſuch a mighty Power of God upon him, as many Years ago he had experienced in the Company and Communion of his ſpecial Spiritual Friends, ſo that having call'd ſome dear Friends up to his <hi>Chamber,</hi> he broke forth into ſinging and praiſing of God, to the great joy, comfort and refreſhment of all that heard him; and ſo likewiſe did about four or five days before his deceaſe. Sometime before this, he diſcours'd to ſome Friends of the <hi>Difficulty of Salvation, which was not to be ſecur'd but by giving our Hearts wholly up to God, without any reſerve whatſoever.</hi> And then mentioned the great <hi>Love</hi> he had to <hi>Souls,</hi> and deſire that they might not miſs of <hi>Salvation</hi>; and teſtified his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Charity</hi> to all that fear'd God, of what Perſuaſion or Diviſion ſoever.</p>
            <p>The day before he dyed, ſome Friends being come ſome Miles to Viſit him, he with great earneſtneſs and demonſtration of Truth diſcours'd to them of <hi>God, of the Immortality of the Soul, the Excellency of the Holy Scriptures, and how much thoſe who profeſs to believe the Chriſtian Doctrines, are bound to live a holy Life; and ſo gave a ſhort, but powerful Exhortation to Holyneſs, as the only way to Happineſs.</hi> And then ſaid, <hi>I have Peace of Conſcience, I have lived up to my Light, and loved God above all things.</hi> And at another time he ſaid to two intimate Friends, <hi>I have Peace of Conſcience, I have walk'd with God, tho I have made no Noiſe in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame day he died (which was on <hi>Eaſter-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, April</hi> 13th. 1691.) he oft cryed, <hi>Come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:103754:5"/>
come quickly! O when! when!</hi> And one time he ſaid, <hi>My Lord! my Rock! and my ſtrong Habitation!</hi> Which words came from him with great Power. The laſt words that ever he ſpoke were, <hi>Watch, watch</hi>; whereupon he fell into a ſweet Slumber for an hour, and in it departed; thus truly falling aſleep in him, to whom, for whom and in whom he had lived, to whom be Glory and Praiſe for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>This was the End, <hi>Reader,</hi> of that pretious <hi>Saint,</hi> who from the Light and Grace of God confer'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, pen'd the following <hi>Treatiſe</hi>; concerning which I ſhall not need to add any thing further, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the following <hi>Advertiſement</hi> of the Author gives a full Account of the Deſign and Uſefulneſs thereof. The <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> in Verſe upon the 13th. of the Firſt of <hi>Corinthians</hi> (printed at the end of the Treatiſe) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found amongſt the Authors looſe Papers, was thought fit to be publiſh'd herewith, becauſe it expreſſeth much of his Spirit and Temper.</p>
            <p>But I muſt conclude after that I have inform'd the <hi>Reader,</hi> that the Author has left ſeveral other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Spiritual Diſcourſes behind him, which if this be well received, are intended to be made Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick for the uſe of the Church in her preſent Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Condition. The great and glorious God, who hath given this <hi>Seed</hi> to the <hi>Sower,</hi> make it with all Fruitfulneſs to ſpring up in the Hearts of all that are of Good-will to the Regeneration in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Amen.</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT FROM THE AUTHOR. To all that ſhall read this following Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>I Have written this Experimental Diſcourſe of the New-Birth, not for the Wiſe and Rich, who think they ſee, and enjoy enough, but for the Poor in Spirit, who enquiring the way to <hi>Sion,</hi> are ſenſible of their Defects, and breath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Supply. Let none then come with Prejudice, for that will give a falſe Tincture to the Eye of the Mind, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſight of Truth, by a prepoſſeſſion that 'tis Error. If any have attained, and enjoy as much, or more than is here expreſſed, let them bleſs God for his Goodneſs, both to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and me: If not, let them not be aſhamed to learn and practice more than they have already; for, <hi>Teach a wiſe Man, and he will be yet wiſer,</hi> Prov. 9.9. And 'tis no diminiſhing of Eſteem, to grow in true Knowledge, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement of Age, to gain Wiſdom from thoſe that are Young; becauſe true Wiſdom is the Gift of God, who is no reſpecter of Perſons, beſtowing his Gifts on whom he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But think not, I have here chalked out a Way for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one to walk in; for I have only wrote my own Experience: And I know there may be great variety in Gods Works upon
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:103754:6"/>
Souls; ſo that none are to be confined to one exact Path, though all are to be informed, That we muſt turn, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little Children, and be wholly dead with Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be as the Angels in the Reſurrection, delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves in the Light and Life of Eternity: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Perfect Death ſhould be aimed at by all, for nothing leſs can fit us for Glory. For how can any Imperfection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there, where is nothing but Perfection? or any thing of Darkneſs dwell with him, who is Light, and in whom there is no Darkneſs at all? 'Tis true, <hi>many</hi> (from maſtaking that Principle, of Gods being the Root of all things) have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to reconcile Light and Darkneſs, Good and Evil, Fleſh and Spirit, Chriſt and Belial; and ſo to laugh Tall Mortification and Self-denial out of the Church. But alas! what have the Practices and Notions of ſuch ended in, but ſhame and confuſion of Face? for they have ſowed to the Wind, and reaped the Whirl-wind, graſped at an Imaginary Heaven, and Perfection; but have fallen like Lucifer into Hell, and palpable Darkneſs, having like fooliſh Virgins, ſpent their Oyl, and received Poyſon into their Lamps, and ſo made themſelves unfit to meet and entertain the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. <hi>Others</hi> there are, who come forth in ſuch Outward Strictneſs and Severity, as they are ready to judge all that are not in their peculiar Mode, and Form; and ſo refuſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſome, who have attained much further in the true Death and Reſurrection (and are more acquainted with the Renewal of Gods Image, and the State of Reſtoration) than themſelves. And there be many <hi>others,</hi> who though not owning the firſt ſort, and much diſguſting the laſt, yet give themſelves too much to Earthly Indulgements, under the notion of Chriſtian Liberty, and ſo make no real Progreſs in the Change of their Souls. Some of which, are cheated with falſe Notions of their being in Chriſt; and others of, them with ſublime apprehenſions of falſe Imaginary Deaths, and ways of Self-denial, which they much feed upon, inſtead

of that Death and Croſs, which ſhould work their Spirits and Natures out of Fleſh into the true ſpiritual Divine Image. There are <hi>another ſort,</hi> who are too much offended at Forms, and all uſual ways of enjoying, and ſpeaking of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying them as Cheats, and empty things, though they be uſed never ſo ſpiritually and advantagiouſly to thoſe that appear in them; which is a great miſtake, flowing from Ignorance; and the want of a clear ſight, which could not ſo confine the great and infinite <hi>Jehovah</hi> within the limits of No-forms, and exclude him from appearing and working in and through Forms; being it is at his own pleaſure, to ſhew himſelf how<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in what he pleaſeth. But laſtly, <hi>a great part</hi> of thoſe that profeſs Religion, are ſuch who reſt too much upon the firſt work of Regeneration, and two much eye their firſt Change, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward running in a Circle of Duties and Performances, without making that Progreſs and Growth toward Perfection, which the frequent Exhortations and Examples of the Holy Scriptures call and incite us to. Now the work of <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> renewing both the Will and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, will bring thoſe who perſevere in it, to a clear ſight of the foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Miſtakes; by which they will be able to diſcern betwixt Light and Darkneſs (Chaff and Wheat) and come to own the Good Seed in all; and endeavour by walking according to the Royal Law of Love and Charity, to cheriſh it. Now this <hi>Law of Love,</hi> is the Rule of Perfection, being the Scope and end of a Chriſtians Progreſs; a true Conformity to which makes us like God, who is Love, and delights to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his own eternal Character of Love upon his Children, who are nearer to, or further from Perfection, as they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more or leſs of this Eſſential Love, which is the Spirit and Life of Chriſtianity; without which, all Duties and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervances are but as ſounding Braſs, and periſhing Shadows: In which, all have their worth and uſe. From the Dictates and Impulſes of this Law, I have written this ſmall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, as believing it may be inſtrumental to undeceive

We are to be ſtript of all the Riches of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature, before we can paſs through the laſt Gate into the City. A naked Spirit quickly enters. Hence that of Chriſt, <hi>Bleſſed be the poor in Spirit, for their's is the Kingdom of God.</hi> An empty Spirit God will fill. For, God is Love, and delights (through his Son) to communicate of his own Fulneſs, to all that can receive it. The Soul cannot be emptyed, but through Regeneration; nor filled, if not firſt emptyed. We part with Darkneſs, Vanity and Luſt; We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Light, Subſtance, and Love. A complete exchange brings complete Happineſs. How few are willing to ſell all for Chriſt? How many Diſtinctions are created by Reaſon, to avoid the Croſs and Death of Chriſt? But it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to take up ſuch Principles, that may indulge any part of that which muſt be deſtroyed. It may make us fall ſhort of Heaven, when we expect to enter into it.

once beholds this, Oh how it begins to be amazed! How it wonders at it's ſelf! What Tumults begin to be raiſed in it! What Earthquakes diſcover themſelves!

Here the Soul is driven to Chriſt, the only Mediator betwixt God and Man, who long waited for this time, that ſo he might diſcover himſelf, having long ſtood in the midſt of it <note n="(g)" place="margin">Ioh. 1.26.</note> unknown, and unregarded; who upon the melting of the Soul into Tears of Repentance, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Fleſh and Blood, with all corrupt Objects, and upon the opening of the Will (in the Thirſt and deſire of Faith) enters <note n="(h)" place="margin">Rev. 3.20.</note> into the Heart, or rather ſhews himſelf to be There, by oppoſing Hell, by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding abroad his holy Blood, to quench the fire of Gods Wrath, and waſh <note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1.7.</note> the Soul from thoſe ſad Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments it then lyes under: Here he quiets the Soul, gives the wings of Faith to it, by which it flies above the reach of deſpairing Fears, and by little and little enters into Peace and Stilneſs, and ſhrouds it's ſelf in ſome meaſure, from the awakened Storms of wrathful Terror. Now, ſo far as the Soul can get by Faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, ſo far it finds Eaſe, Refreſhment and Peace, and a ceſſation from the ſenſe of Guilt, with cheriſhing Belief of the preſent Pardon of Sin, as finding at ſuch a time no ſtirring of the Will to that which had ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd it before, by it's poyſonous Inſinuations.

therefore beginning to hate Evil as a Monſter, and to love Chriſt as a Saviour, it feels the Effects of Chriſts Meditation, by ſatisfying Gods Juſtice, taking away the Enmity in the <note n="(k)" place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> Soul, by the Blood of his Cróſs, by the meltings of Love which it feels towards God, and ſweet Refreſhments it receives from him.

Hence flow Tears of Love, and Soul-melting Groans, with the Mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Turtle: Now it imbraces Jeſus, weeps over Him whom it hath pierced, and is wounded the more, the kinder He ſeems in Returns of Love; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he was before ſo much diſobliged by the Souls Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs; now the Soul wants ways of expreſſing Love <note n="(n)" place="margin">Cant. 2.5.</note> overwhelmed with the ſenſe of Goodneſs.

               <p>WHen the Soul after its ſhakings, attains this Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Chriſts Love, freely ſtreaming to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it, uſually 'tis much carried out in the ſight and opening of Free-Grade, which for a time, ſtrongly work upon it, and induce it to yield ſuitable Returns, in conſtant Obedience. And this is commonly a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of much Joy and Refreſhment; the Soul feeling that ſenſible Conſolation, and Divine Sweetneſs, that cauſes it to break forth into continual Praiſes and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah's</hi> to God. Now, as this flows from the lively apprehenſion of Gods Love in Chriſt, ſo likewiſe from the clear ſight of Chriſt in us, and of that myſtical tranſcendent Union,<note n="(p)" place="margin">Coloſ. 2.27.</note> betwixt him and the inward Man; the Soul now beholding him in the ground and centre of her own pure humanity (there thence darting forth the Rays of Love upon her,) whom before ſhe look'd upon as at a diſtance, without her, as only ſitting at the right hand of God in Heaven. Now whilſt this Diſpenſation laſts, the Soul is in a <note n="(q)" place="margin">Cant. 2.4, 11, 13.</note> perpetual Spring, and a kind of delightful Paradiſe, bathing and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſelf in the ſweet <note n="(r)" place="margin">Cant. 1.2.</note> Fruition of Chriſts Love, who in this time, expreſſeth much kindneſs to it, and gives frequent Teſtimonies of his Divine Preſence. But this day ſeldom continues very long, and this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer by little and little uſually inclines toward an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, in which the Flowers of ſenſible Comfort, and love-Raptures, begin a little to wither, and benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fleſh again ſhews its power, in ſecret (almoſt inſenſible) dullings of the Souls Affection, till by little and little, it comes to a ſenſible <note n="(s)" place="margin">Rev. 3.1.</note> Deadneſs, which is the more tedious and burdenſom, the more the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer diſpenſation was pleaſant and Joyous. Now
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103754:10"/>
what may be the reaſon of this declining in the Souls Enjoyments, I ſhall not poſitively determine, for it may proceed from different cauſes, in different perſons: In ſome it may flow from the want of <note n="(t)" place="margin">Rev. 3.2.</note> Watchfulneſs over their Hearts; thorough the great Elevations of Free Grace, in which time the fleſh by little and little may collect Strength; Gifts then being more eyed then Graces: It may alſo flow from the decay of the Souls lively apprehenſions of Gods Love, which it felt in freeing it from the poyſon and Guilt of Sin, when it groaned ſadly under them; for ſo long as the ſtrong <note n="(u)" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.19.</note> impreſſions of that ſtate remained, Gods mercy eminently diſcovered, forced the Soul into ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able meltings at the ſight of it, but theſe ſomewhat va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing in time the effects likewiſe might ceaſe by litle and little. It may alſo come from want of practiſing the way of the Croſs, through our miſapprehenſions of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dead when we are not, or accidentally through the ſenſible overflowings of new Comforts, which may carry the Soul out of that watchful Exerciſe of the Croſs, which at ſuch a time is moſt needful. But whatever is the Cauſe of it, the Soul ought to enter into a ſtrict Examination of it's ſelf, to ſift every corner of it's inward Chambers, and to pray for a clearer Light to view all ſubtil Corruptions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that may gull it and hinder its Progreſs, and make it ſet up a Standard as though all were done. Oh! 'tis dangerous ſticking here, and reſting upon former Changes; for this tends to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging of ſpiritual Drowſineſs and Stupidity, and may bring the Soul in danger of loſing <note n="(x)" place="margin">2 Ioh. <hi>ver.</hi> 8.</note> it's former Works, by preſent Idleneſs and Relapſes: For God looks not at what we were, but what we are; our preſent State making us either capable of Gods out-flowing Love, or obnoxious to his chaſtiſing Juſtice.</p>

               <p>THe Soul having arrived ſo far as to ſee the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a complete Death, and of a perfect Conformity to the Croſs of Chriſt, and diſcovering much Selfiſhneſs which before it ſaw not, as matter of this Death and Croſs, begins afreſh the ſerious Practice of the Croſs, with great earneſtneſs and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Spirit,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> to indulge (i) nothing that ſtands betwixt it and God. Now it enters upon a ſtrict En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into its own Heart, ſearching its own Jeruſalem with the Candle of the Lord, that ſo all Selfiſhneſs may be diſcovered and extirpated; and now it finds, that although (before this Diſpenſation) the chief Bent of the Will inclined habitually toward the Good,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103754:13"/>
yet it was not ſtrong enough to bear down that Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Fleſh that hindred its conſtant Aſcent toward Heaven, and had therefore need of a new Alarm from thence to awaken it, and raiſe it from that Bed of Drowſineſs, and arm it with Power and Reſolution to caſt out the <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> Relicks of the Fleſh, and Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and defend its ſelf againſt the Aſſaults of the Devil, who having long poſſeſſed the unregenerate part of the Heart, is loath to quit his hold, leaſt the Soul ſhould get wholly out of his Kingdom and reach. At this remove therefore the Spirits of Darkneſs <note n="(l)" place="margin">Rev. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7.</note> exceedingly oppoſe and uſe all their art and ſtrength to betray and weaken the Souls Endeavours. Here then begins a new and great War in the Soul between the Seed of the Woman and the Serpent. <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels fight againſt the Dragon and his Angels; Chriſt and Anti-Chriſt ſtrongly oppoſe each other. The Wrath and Love bring forth their mighty won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, being both ſtirred and awakened afreſh in the Soul. But the Soul being now ſenſible of its preſent ſtate, and ſeeing that there's no Safety where the Devils have ſuch acceſs and influence, ſinks down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Mercy and Love of God, and flies to the Croſs, imbracing and delighting in it; that ſo the <note n="(m)" place="margin">1 Ioh. 1.7.</note> Blood of the Croſs may be ſhed into it, to cleanſe it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and to take away thoſe Stains, which are the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Manſions.

In this way, there may much Diſcouragement ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeize on the Soul, through the ſtrength of Satans working and the reluctancy of Fleſh, and the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Man, which is loath to ſubject his Neck to the ſharp Axe of Death. But this Bitterneſs is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103754:13"/>
with that Refreſhment the Soul finds in its Conſtancy of Self-denial, which is attended with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny glances of Divine Comfort darting in upon the Soul to encourage it, and though it ſhould, for a while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this Progreſs, which is bitter to the Fleſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſible Comfort (which may well be, through that great oppoſition the Dragon will make at this remove of the Soul;) yet when Patience hath had its Work, and the Soul is come to be wrapt up in Contentation and Paſſiveneſs, as to any Change of its Condition, and ſo fitted for Enlargement, the ſhowers of God's Love will ſeaſonably and ſweetly deſcend to the ſtrength and bleſſed Support of the Heart; ſo that it will be forced to cry out, <hi>It is good that a Man ſhould both hope and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</hi>: And what the Spirit ſometimes now enjoys, ſo ſweetens the Croſs that it cannot but thus break forth.</p>
               <l>Why ſhould the Soul refuſe that Croſs</l>

the Croſs of God's pure Will: and now it begins to be aſhamed of all Paſſions and Affections that flow from the Animal Man; and therefore much reſtrains it, and keeps it in ſubjection to the Angelical; which is according to that Order God himſelf ſet at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Now it likewiſe ſees how the Animal Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part (with its Motions and Paſſions) is too much imbraced by moſt; few underſtanding how it was in the Beginning; or how it is to be changed, and again ſubjected to the Angelical Part, in the Children of the Reſurrection: But the Soul having now ſome Sight and Enjoyment of the inward Spiritual Body, raiſed from the dead, is much aſhamed of the outward Body, which ſtands in the Curſe, under awakened Wrath; ſeeing what Temptation Spirits are expoſed to, by Union with this, which ſhould continually be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law of Mortification, till its Change; leſt through its Earthly Inclination, it ſhould infect the Intellect (and draw the Immortal Soul into Defilement) which now dares not hearken to the Allurements of the ſenſitive Spirit, which as tempting <hi>Eve</hi> oft pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents the Apples of Mortality, as thoſe which are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the Eye, and good for Food.

For by the <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the Internal Senſes,</hi> we ſee Spiritual Objects, as the Internal Light-World, Viſions of Angels, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Repreſentation. In this ſtate we likewiſe hear the Songs, Voices, and Harmony of Angels, with the Harpers upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> who there continually praiſe the Lord: We ſmell the Perfumes of Chriſt's

We touch and feel the powerful tincture of Chriſt's Body which many times ſtrongly affects the Heart with powerful delight: We alſo oft taſte the Heavenly Manna, and thoſe Dews of Paradiſe which are ſweeter than Honey, to that Part which receives them. I could here more largely particularize the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Objects, Delights, and Enjoyments of the inward Spiritual ſenſes; but becauſe there may be great <note n="(s)" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5.</note> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, according to the different Gifts and Capacities of ſeveral Perſons; and in regard ſome (for ought I know) may paſs far in the Progreſs of the New Birth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular knowledge of thoſe Enjoyments; I ſhall not inſtance in many particulars, I could; nor ſet down my own (with ſome others) peculiar, and various Experiences. Yet in general, I cannot but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the unlocking the Sences of the inward Man, is a great Priviledge: and that the Soul by it attains many great Supports and Refreſhments to uphold it, and give it incouragement to hold out to the end.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103754:15"/>
cannot be attained but by a Death to that which was the chief Ingagement of the Soul to the World, and the primary Chain that hindred its gradual Aſcent towards God. And we may find there is ſomething in every one, which is the <note n="(w)" place="margin">

And I know many are exceedingly troubled with the working of their Imaginations on inconſiderable trifling Objects, when as they dare not entertain any Thoughts groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil; and where this State is grown into a long habit, it will be difficult to come out of it, though a Soul be very ſenſible of the Vanity of it, and long to be freed from it, as finding the Imagination in theſe workings to be like the Witch of <hi>Endor,</hi> raiſing up the Old Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi> or the Inward Man from the ſleep of Silence, and innocent Stilneſs, to be diſquieted with vain Earthly things, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.15. In this caſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it concerns the Soul to ſtand continually upon its
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103754:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Watch, leſt it be ſometimes ſnatcht away unawares, and ingaged in Vanity, before it ſees where it is. Here the continual Exerciſe of the Croſs is very neceſſary, that by it we may <note n="(k)" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> caſt down imaginations, and lead Captive every thought into the Obedience of Chriſt: ſo that the chief work now, is the reducing this move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sea into Subjection to the illuminated Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: therefore the Soul prays and ſtrives continually againſt the Power of Imagination and Activity of Thoughts, which hinder the ſilent actings of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect upon Eternity, and ſupernatural Truths. And here Faith and Perſeverance are very needful: We need Faith to believe that by the Power and ſtrength of Chriſt we may overcome theſe Imaginations; and Perſeverance, that we may not faint in the Way, and give off the conſtant Exerciſe of the Croſs in rejecting, beating down, and ceaſing from theſe Motions of the imaginary faculty, till we come to be conquerors, and to Command them; which is poſſible through Chriſt, who is come into our World, to deſtroy the Works of the Devil, and to rule till he hath put all his Enemies under his Feet, of which theſe idle Thoughts are a part. And as the Soul here uſes the Power it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Chriſt in checking, rejecting, and beating down all idle thoughts, as a means to overcome them; ſo likewiſe it is oft Exerciſing of its Underſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Eternal Love and free Grace of God, and in conſidering the myſtery of that <note n="(l)" place="margin">Phil. 3.20.</note> Paradiſical World, in which the Angels and Spirits of the juſt are: It much alſo reflects upon the Preſence of its Saviour who hath promiſed to be with us to the <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.</note> end of the World, filling <note n="(n)" place="margin">Eph. 4.10.</note> all things in his Divine Nature, for he continually ſtands at the Door and knocks, ſo that the Soul waits every moment for the fulfilling of that Promiſe of his coming into it, and ſupping with it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103754:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And this conſtant attending upon God with the Eye of the Underſtanding, proves a very effectual mean to the deſtroying of thoſe Imaginations which come to Entangle the Soul in unprofitable diverſions. In this practice the Underſtanding gets ſuch power over the Imaginations, that it enjoys almoſt a continual ſight or <note n="(o)" place="margin">Heb. 11.27.</note> apprehenſion of God's Preſence, and ſees beyond the working of Imagination, by the <note n="(p)" place="margin">Epheſ. 1.18.</note> Eye of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding enlightned, and by little and little attains that ſtrength, that although we ſhould have neceſſary occaſion to take up our thoughts in ſome external Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, yet the Underſtanding pierceth thorough it, and in the very time of exerciſing its reaſon on that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, it hath ſtrong and clear Apprehenſions of the Preſence of God, and the Spiritual World: which clearly ſhews that Intellection, or the true acting of the Underſtanding, is ſomewhat beyond Reaſon, which is not able to do two things at once, and Act upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Objects, at the ſame inſtant. And this conſtant Apprehenſion or Senſe of the divine Preſence is without any Fantaſm, it being in that Moment when the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms are employed upon another Object, and they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſomewhat of materiality, cannot afford that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Sight and Apprehenſion ſuch a Soul hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly of God, which is without <note n="(q)" place="margin">

Though I confeſs this is far below the true Intellection of the Underſtanding, informed with the preſence of Divine Light, in regard theſe Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms, being generally drawn from Corporeal Objects,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103754:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot reach the eſſence of a Spirit.

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>THe Soul having arrived ſo far, as to enjoy almoſt a continual apprehenſion of the Preſence of God and Angels, finds its ſelf much freed from thoſe vain thoughts, which in former Diſpenſations were very troubleſom: But being Conquerour over theſe, it muſt <hi>take heed</hi> leſt the new Objects of Heaven, Angels, and ſpiritual Gifts, ſet the Imagination too much a work, in repreſenting their Excellencies, and picturing forth ſuch a State of the Soul enriched with them, which may yield too much imaginary Delight, and draw the Spirit into the admiration of fine pleaſant <note n="(x)" place="margin">Iſaiah 2.16.</note> Pictures inſtead of the true Subſtance. Therefore we are ſtrictly to <hi>watch</hi> over the Phantaſie, which may eaſily err in this particular, and not without great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices following upon it; for firſt, by ſuch working of Imagination, we come to ſlacken the Exerciſe of the Croſs, both upon Imagination its ſelf, (which <note n="(y)" place="margin">2 Cor. 10.5.</note> is continually to be reſtrained, and as much as is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reduced unto ſubjection, to the illuminated Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) and alſo upon the Relicks of the Old Man in any other Faculty, which are always to be ſlain in their firſt Buddings; and therefore to be ſtrictly eyed, which cannot be, whil'ſt Imagination is ſo buſie in its motions.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that Complacency which the Soul may take, by repreſenting its ſelf adorned with, and enjoying the Gifts of Hearing, Seeing, Touching, Taſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Smelling, in a ſpiritual Way, (with all the Beauty and Sweetneſs of the Objects of thoſe Faculties) both in its ſelf ſo proviledged, and in the Objects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; moſt of which being but Streams, and not
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103754:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Fountain it ſelf, the Soul may be in danger of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much delight, and ſo of being entangled in them.</p>
               <p>The third inconvenience is, the obſtructing that <hi>Still Silence</hi> of the Soul, in which it <note n="(z)" place="margin">Pſal. 40.10.</note> ſhould be oft wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up, as a mean to thoſe extraordinary effuſions of Light and Power which God many times affords the Soul in its paſſive quiet waiting; Whereas this labour of Imagination too much keeps the Soul in action, and ſo in an unfitneſs for thoſe Divine Impreſſions, which very ſeldom come down but into a Spirit profoundly ſilent. Seeing then there may be ſo much danger in indulging Imagination, even in theſe pure Objects, we ſhall find it very requiſite, oft to ceaſe from all Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and to act no Thought upon any thing, in the heights above, or the depths below; I ſay no Thought, Thoughts being but Images, which reach not the Eſſence of ſpiritual Objects. But this Practice excludes not that general, conſtant, intellectual ſight and apprehenſion of God, which the Soul (thus far arrived) enjoys: Therefore I ſpeak not here to thoſe who have not attained a continual, habitual apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Divine Preſence; for if they ſhould ſtrive to ceaſe from their good Thoughts, they might fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of Stupidity, far worſe. But I here give Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to thoſe who having attained conſtant habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Communion with God, preſs after Perfection in their conſtant Progreſs, through all Impediments; of which, this working of Imagination being one, we here give experimental Directions to over come it: And certainly there is no better way than the Annihilation of all Thoughts, and the retiring from the Phantaſie into the ſilent <note n="(a)" place="margin">Rev. 1.10.</note> Mind, which more fits the Soul for Divine Irradiation, and ſpiritual Imbraces; for the more quiet we are, the leſs reſiſtance we make againſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103754:20"/>
a ſupernatural Impreſſion, and the eaſier we perceive the Beginnings of Divine Attraction, and ſo yield our ſelves to it. And truly, when the Soul hath attained the Power to throw its ſelf (as oft as it is meet) into the ſilent ſuper imaginary State (which muſt be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the habitual conſtant Practice of it) it will then come to internal <note n="(b)" place="margin">Rev. 4.2.</note> Openings, and intellectual Sights of the Inviſible worlds, and many times receive quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Glances from the Eternity, with thoſe ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of Love that bring the Soul many times near to a Rapture: And truly, the enjoyment we have in this State fully recompenceth all that Self-denial, we paſs through to the attainment of it.</p>
               <p>Here then the falſe <note n="(c)" place="margin">Rev. 16, 13, &amp; 19, 20.</note> Prophet (which is irregular Imagination) comes to be conquered, being command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the inward Mind, that now oft draws up the Soul into the Paradiſical World,<note rend="inter">Though I here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to the falſe Prophet mention'd in the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> yet I exclude not the External Prophetick ſenſe of this or any other part of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which is a Prophetick Hiſtory of the Church to the end of the World.</note> from the motion of Phantaſie and Imagination.</p>

               <p>IMagination being now over-come, and the Animal Man mortified, the Soul cannot but clearly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver its growth in the Image of God, and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Angelical Man, which now evidently perceives its ſelf ſpringing up in a new Principle, above the Spirit of the <note n="(d)" place="margin">1 Cor. 2.12.</note> World, and its mixt Laws: And here we come to own and receive <hi>new Relations,</hi> contracted by our Progreſs in the New-Birth, and our tendency from the Spirit of the World toward Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And as through the Act of Generation we came to be inveſted with Earthly Relations, ſo by the Work of Regeneration we come to poſſeſs thoſe that are Spiritual. Here we come to honour God, as our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Spirit, (not excluding any other of his beloved Ones, who have been inſtrumental to beget us into the Divine Image and Wiſdom,) or Jeruſalem above, as our true <note n="(e)" place="margin">Gal. 4.26.</note> Mother: And ſo all other Saints who have been begotten by the ſame Power into the ſame Nature, become our true Brothers and Siſters; all ſtanding upon one Root, drawing one nouriſhment, and knit together by <note n="(f)" place="margin">Eph. 4.4.</note> one Spirit, which is the Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Leader and Comforter of all. But we ſhall here find a <hi>nearer <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion and Communion</hi> amongſt thoſe who have been by one particular Inſtrument begotten into the Life of Chriſt, having a peculiar Vein of Spiritual Enjoyment running through them; which others, who received not that particular Tincture, do not partake of. And had we lived in the Apoſtles times, we ſhould have ſeen this among the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for certainly they that were begotten by <hi>Paul,</hi> had a particular endearment to him, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103754:21"/>
and ſo it may be ſaid of thoſe that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by <hi>Apollo, Cephas,</hi> and others: Which is clear by that Scripture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 12. <hi>Ev<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="(g)" place="margin">Iam. 5.20.</note> 
                  <hi>and covers a Multitude of Sins.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf in ſome places ſpeaks of himſelf, as a Spiritual Father, requiring of thoſe he had begotten into the Faith, due Reſpect, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Love. But amongſt thoſe who are thus peculiarly united, we ſhall ſee ſome more cloſely knit in Spiritual agreement than others, and eſſenſed into one anothers Spirits; as may appear by that great Union which Chriſt had with <hi>John,</hi> and that particular Affection he bare towards him, which was the reaſon why <hi>John</hi> was called (by way of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency and diſtinction from the reſt) <hi>The Diſciple whom Jeſus Loved.</hi> Now when we come to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence this, we ſhall know the meaning of that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where <hi>Bone</hi> is ſaid to come <note n="(h)" place="margin">Ezek. 37.7.</note> to <hi>His Bone:</hi> For as ſome Bones are locked one in another, and ſome Members grow more immediately one out of another, though all make up but one Organical Body: ſo ſome Spirits are nearer united in Chriſts body then others, and ſtand cloſer joynted, and more intrinſecally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted, but all make up but one ſpiritual and myſtical Body. And this we ſhall find to flow from the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and agreement of Spirits and Natures, as they were ſignatured in the firſt moment of Exiſtency: For Grace and the work of Regeneration do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Our Natural ſignatures, only rectifie them by that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103754:22"/>
Heavenly Principle which reduceth all our Spirits into the higheſt perfection they are capable of, by their primary Model and Frame. Hence it appears that they are more Truly Brethren (even according to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Nature,) who thus agree, and correſpond their Eſſences, then they that are ordinarily called ſo, who are many times very contrary ſignatur'd: And the reaſon of this aſſertion is in that when our Natures come to their perfect rectitude, and reſtauration by Union with God; this ſecret propenſion and harmonious cloſing with thoſe that are like-eſſenced, remains; whereas from meer natural Relation, there nothing continues; though in thoſe who are related, there may be this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement too: But meer Relation is not the cauſe of it, but that ſecret Law of influence which God hath eſtabliſhed to ſignature ſome one way, ſome another; ſome in much agreement and proportion; others more differing, tho' all repreſenting ſomething of that variety which is wrapt up in the Unity of the Eternal Nature. I could not but give an hint of this, becauſe It may open ſome things concerning Relations, which may lye dark to thoſe who know not the deepeſt ground and Root of them. But I ſhall proceed to the further opening of thoſe Enjoyments, which flow from Union with new Relations, which come now to be very dear, becauſe the ground of their Relation is ſo pure and good, being <note n="(i)" place="margin">Ioh. 1.13.</note> not of Man, or the Will of Man, but of God. Here we ſhall experience the happy effects of our pure Union, which produces that Divine Love, that none can know, but thoſe that enjoy it. But this will be ſtrongeſt, where there is moſt Harmony and Agreement in Spirits and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; becauſe the Eternal Tincture works upon, and through every thing occording to its Nature and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: Hence we come to enjoy more from ſome,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103754:22"/>
than others; and ſome from us receive more than others: But that Brotherly-love and friendſhip, which now come to be renewed in Spirit, far tranſcend any enjoyments meerly Natural: And whatſoever we parted with, in dying to all Earthly affection and its Objects, we regain in the Reſurrection of our Spirits, in this pure Love, which is not Affection but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing above it, not conſiſting in ſudden out-flowings and eruptions, but in a conſtant ſweet inclination, and ſecret propenſion of the Spirit, to thoſe which are one with it in the pure Life: And this good-willingneſs is ſo great, that from it the Soul could give <note n="(k)" place="margin">1 Joh. 3.16.</note> its Life (or if there were any <note n="(l)" place="margin">Gal. 4.15.</note> thing dearer than Life) for its Brother; and chooſe Sufferings, to free others from them: In this ſtate there will be a ſympathizing in Joy and Sorrow; and where the Union is eminently great, there may be ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of each others Conditions, at a <note n="(m)" place="margin">Col. 2.5.</note> diſtance, which comes from their being eſſenced in each others Spirits and Tinctures, which is the cauſe of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Sympathy: And they that are in this near Union, feel a mutual in-dwelling in the pure Tincture and Life <note n="(n)" place="margin">2 Cor. 3.2.</note> of each other; and ſo, the further we come out of the animal Nature, the more univerſal we are, and nearer both to Heaven, and to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Internal; and the ſitter Inſtrumentally to convey the pure ſtreams of the Heavenly Life to each other, which no external diſtance can hinder: For the Divine Tincture (being ſuch a ſpiritual Virtue, as Chriſt imprinted into the Heart of the Diſciples, with whom he talked after his Reſurrection, making their <hi>hearts to burn within them,</hi> is able to pierce through all diſtance, and reach thoſe that are far abſent; becauſe it is not Corporeal, nor Subject to the Laws of place or time.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:103754:23"/>Now this is known to ſome by Experience, who in abſence enjoy ſuch influences of Spirit, and ſecret Inſinuations of Spiritual Virtue from one another, that they cannot but value this Spiritual Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, above all Enjoyments in the World; which compared to it, ſeem but like the baſeſt Metal to the pureſt Gold.</p>

               <p>THE Love which in this Spiritual Union, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſcribed) we come to enjoy, is unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly refreſhing, proving to be ſweeter than the Hony or the Hony Comb, and continually raiſeth the Soul to the true Fountain of it, who being the true cauſe of all pure Union, both preſerves and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth it: But the Soul now having a View, and Experience of the Beauty and Sweetneſs of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of other Chriſtians, and of the Excellency of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103754:23"/>
that Love which may be enjoyed through them may (if it be not prevented by much ſelf-denyal and Watchfulneſs) ſuffer very much <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> to ſpring up in a new Dreſs; for here may ariſe Spiritual Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, or a deſire of engroſſing Spirits to ones ſelf. Here Spiritual Pride may alſo diſcover it ſelf in deſiring much eſteem of ſuch: Envy likewiſe may ſtart up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe we fear may draw them from us, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy more Love from them than our ſelves: and ſo all other Selfiſh Affections may here croud in, in a refined dreſs: And as theſe <hi>Spiritual Evils</hi> may flow from the ſight of the Excellency and ſuitableneſs of the Spirits of other Chriſtians; ſo alſo they may break in upon us from large and Eminent Gifts of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. For we ſeeing the Amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Worth of theſe may come immoderately to deſire them; may fear to have them Eclipſed; may reflect too much upon <note n="(n)" place="margin">Ezek. 16.15.</note> our ſelves in the enjoying of them; may look too much after Eminency in the uſe of them; and (in a word) may take too much Complacency in the pleaſant fruition of them; even to an hindrance of our looking up to the Fountain, as all in all: If then the Soul be here entangled (as it is hard totally to eſcape) it muſt fly to the <note n="(p)" place="margin">Gal. 6.14.</note> Croſs, and lay the Ax to the Root of the Tree of Self, that ſo it may be hewn down and caſt into the Fire: And it muſt pray for the Sword of Power, to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe and cut off this refined Selfiſhneſs, as it did the groſſer part: And to take away this Propriety, and Self-ownment of all Spirits, Gifts and Graces. Here we muſt come to offer up the very Good it ſelf, (as <note n="(r)" place="margin">Gen. 22.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> did <hi>Iſaac</hi>) to God the Fountain and Beſtower. Here we muſt dye to the Coveting of any Spirit, Grace, Viſion, Revelation, Rapture, or ſenſible Comfort. Here we muſt come to be nothing
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103754:24"/>
in all theſe; to enjoy them as though we enjoyed them not, and not to reflect upon our ſelves on any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; to rejoyce to ſee others <note n="(s)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.25, 26.</note> flouriſh in the Riches of thoſe; and to have far more Light, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Comfort and Honour, than our ſelves; to be willing when we are rich in Gifts (and eſteem of the Saints) <note n="(t)" place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> to part with them, if God ſo pleaſe, and to hang ſo looſe from all things below God, as that nothing may the leaſt hinder our Conformity to the Death of Chriſt, or our riſing again in the pure Life of Love and Innocency. And truly when we have known the Glory of thoſe Spiritual Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and have been rich in poſſeſſing them, we may find it exceeding difficult wholly to give up, and to own no Propriety of Will in them, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing in the greateſt Union of Spirits, frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gifts and Spiritual Honour; keeping a ſweet innocent Spirit free from Selfiſhneſs in all theſe. Now the Reaſon of the difficulty in being wholly freed from Self here, is the Excellency of the Objects, and the ſweetneſs of their Enjoyments: For their Nature and Effects being very ſuitable to the Soul, they have the ſtronger Influence upon it, to cloſe with them in too much delight and adherency: Whence it may be more difficult, totally to give them up, than it was to leave outward groſs things, which could not be ſo pleaſing to the nature of the Soul: And though ſome (who think they have paſſed far in the New-Birth) never experienced this; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look upon it as a thing not much to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet let all ſuch know that the Reaſon may be in that they never yet paſſed clear out of the Spirit of the World; nor overcame their Animal Nature by a Compleat Circumciſion and Renunciation; and ſo were not capable to receive any extraordinary Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103754:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Viſions, Revelations, In-ſpeakings, Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Unions of Spirits; and being not come into the Inward Wilderneſs, where the Soul is fitted for ſuch things, and where theſe Spiritual Temptations ariſe to try it: Whereas being in the outward Senſitive (Spirit) and detained in Fleſh and Blood, as Iſrael in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the inward ſpiritual Faculties of Senſation lie lock'd up and can have no knowledge of thoſe Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Operations and Enjoyments: But they that are come ſo far in the Work of the New-birth, as to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and to live to theſe things, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity dye to them, and come to be <note n="(a)" place="margin">2 Cor. 6.10.</note> Nothing in them, giving up all to God, and forſaking the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their own Wills. Now this is a parting with our own Lives, and the giving up the Ghoſt of refined ſelfiſhneſs, which ſtrikes at the Root of Sin and Evil, and brings us to the Death of the Croſs, in Conformity to the Example of our Saviour's Progreſs, who was Crucified betwixt two Thieves, One of which was loſt, tho' the other went with him into Paradiſe, which we in the Myſtery likewiſe fulfil; for our Wills are Crucified betwixt the outward Animal Man, and the Inward Old Man, or ſinful Nature; The firſt of which in the Reſurrection, ſhall be received (after Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) into Paradiſe; but the laſt, muſt be deſtroyed and ſwallowed up into the fire of Wrath.</p>

               <p>AFter this death upon the Myſtical Croſs, the Soul in Conformity to Chriſts progreſs, paſſeth through a ſtate Analogous to that of Chriſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent into Hell, being that Principle which ſtands as a ſmoaking Furnace before the Entrance of Paradiſe, into which none can paſs, but thoſe that are dead with Chriſt, and waſhed from the Pollutions of fleſh and Spirit by the Blood of the Lamb: For whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver retain the ſpots of <hi>Guilt</hi> will be kept back by Gods Wrath, which in this principle, burns like fire, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.33. This alſo is ſpread (at leaſt potentially as to its Root) through the whole World, yet inviſible to the outward Eye. In this the Dragon and all Evil Angels and Spirits are, for <hi>Jud.

The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the fallen Angels in <hi>everlaſting Chains under Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>hath caſt them into Hell, and delivered them into Chains of Darkneſs, to be reſerved unto Judgment.</hi> Now though the fallen Angels are every where tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Saints, yet they are always in the Chains of this inviſible Darkneſs, which could not be if this were not every where in this World. Whence, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. it is called, <hi>the Darkneſs of this World</hi>: of which the chief Devils are the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

or Wordly Rulers. And although evil Spirits receive ſome Refreſhment by mixing with the Souls of Men, which are cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Animal ſenſitive Nature, and live in the Spirit of the World! yet they are ſtill in Chains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103754:25"/>
this Darkneſs, as in their proper Center. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.31. That the Devils, whoſe name was Legion, beſought Chriſt, (after they were caſt out of the Man) that he would not command them <hi>to go out into the Deep,</hi> as though the Deep or bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Pit, had been at a diſtance from them: Yet the meaning is, that they might not wholly go out of the Spirit of the World, and out of Union with it, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the Center of Darkneſs and Wrath; for in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either with Men or Beaſts, who live in the Spirit of the World, they receive ſome mitigation of their Torment, which they have not, when they are naked and uncloathed in the Abyſs: Therefore their going into the Abyſs from union with the Spirits of Men or Beaſts, is not as we depart from one Room into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother (which are diſjoyned by outward diſtance) but a ſinking deeper from the Circumference toward the Center, from the outward to the inward, which we call the <hi>Dark World,</hi> and <hi>Hell</hi>; which (according to the ſight and experience of ſome deep myſtical Men) is made up of Spiritual <hi>Sulphur, Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> not united and harmonized in ſweet proportion, for then they would be Paradiſe; but as in diſcord and diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion working in contrary Motions, through the abſence of that pure <hi>Balſamical</hi> Oil, which flowing from the heart of God, makes Paradiſe ſo delightful. Now as all things in this viſible World are compounded of theſe three Material principles, <hi>Sulphur, Mercury</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> ſo are the Inviſible Worlds, in their ſpiritual nature, from whence the Viſible World proceeded, and in which it is erected; for (<hi>Heb.</hi> 7.3.)

But to proceed, the dark World (<hi>Rev.</hi> 9.2.) is called the Abyſs or Bottomleſs Pit; and whoſoever go down into this Sea, ſee Gods Wonders in the Deep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.24. for there is the great <hi>Leviathan,</hi> the crooked Serpent, the Dragon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.1.

Into this Region, Chriſt deſcended after his giving up of the Ghoſt upon the Croſs; for this is a diſtinct Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Ancient Creed and agrees with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell,</hi> which was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically ſpoken by the Pſalmiſt, of Chriſt's deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Hell, and of his Redemption from it; and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.9.

may be called the heart of the Earth, 1. In alluſion to that large Sphere or Lake of Fire, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and ſome learned Hermetick Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, is ſeated in and about the Center of the Earth.</p>
               <p>2<hi>dly.</hi> In that acording to the eternal Gradation of Beings and Principles, it may be ſaid to be within, in the middle or Center of it; the Earth and all Terreſtrial Matter being more outward, in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference. And though Hell is called <gap reason="foreign">

The utter or more outward darkneſs, yet that's ſpoken in relation to Paradiſe, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal World, not in reference to the Earth and this World.

out of this dark grave, into the joys of Paradiſe. But we muſt know that in our Progreſs we may many times be caſt into Terror and Anguiſh; Yea feel Hell awakened in us, and afterwards be delivered by ſome influence of Chriſts Spirit, and infuſions of his Love, and yet be ſhort of this Reſurrection, and of paſſing through Hell as Conquerors, which can never be till we deſcend thither without Guilt, in Child-like Innocency, with the Candle of the Lord in our hands, which is the Pillar of Fire which alone can lead us through this Night, into the Day of Paradiſe.

               <p>BY this time the Soul experienceth the happy ſtate of being freed from the principle of Selfneſs, in returning to God from the Spirit of the World, and ſees the real progreſs it hath made from the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through the Inward Dark World, into the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Paradiſe; where <hi>Adam</hi> lived before his Fall, and where Chriſt converſed, betwixt the time of his Reſurrection and Aſcention. In this ſpiritual Region the Curſe is not manifeſt, there being a perpetual Spring. Here are the Idea's of all viſible bodies, in much Beauty and appearing, luſtre. Here are thoſe bright Clouds which overſhadowed Chriſt on the Mount, and when he was received up into Heaven; in which he will deſcend <note n="(d)" place="margin">Rev. 1.7.</note> when he comes again to judge the Earth.

continually refreſhed with the Dews of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Heavens, and quickened by the Beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and cheriſhed with the enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gales of the Holy Spirit. All that are in this ſtate are like the harmleſs flowers in a fruitful Garden, ſpringing from the ſame ground, yet differing in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, Virtue, Smell, and growth, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Natures, and times of Planting; yet all ſerving to expreſs the Power, Love, and Wiſdom of their Creator, without any Strife or Contention for Eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Place or Eſteem, being all ſatisfyed with what God affords them, and their different Capacities fit them for. O what a ſweet Harmony is here! What a beautiful conſent in expreſſing the goodneſs of the great Creator of all things? How far are Spirits here from envying the different Beauties and Ornaments one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? How ſweetly do they incline to mutual love and agreement? as being the Branches of one pure Root, as enjoying the ſame kind of nouriſhment, and receiving Life from the ſame <note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> quickening Spirit? How is all Wrath and Contention here forgot? How amiable do Spirits now begin to grow in the Eyes of Chriſt, by their innocent Childiſhneſs? And truly in this diſpenſation, we come to be cloathed with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, wrap'd up in meekneſs; expreſſing nothing but the bleſſed Effects of Heaven upon Earth; here we are full of Love-meltings towards Chriſt, who baptiſeth us in the ſoft Water of Spiritual Meekneſs; which overſpreads the Soul, not ſuffering any of the fire of Paſſion to ſpring up. In this ſtate the Soul is very watchful over every motion, in the outward and inward Man, fearing to ſtep down again into Nature, where before it had ſo much Trouble and <note n="(l)" place="margin">Heb. 12 15.</note> Bitterneſs; whereas now it is in a ſweet pleaſant Reſt, lying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bed of Innocency, ſolacing its ſelf in the ſweet

               <p>BY this time the Soul begins to draw near the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World, in its fixed ſtation and habitual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, lying under the ſhowers of Love, which deſcend from the heart of God and the boſom of <hi>Sophia</hi>: Here the bleſſed Tincture of Jeſus coming ſo powerfully, as though it ſtreamed from his glorifyed Humanity, flows into the Soul like a River of Oyl mixed with fire, which affords that unutterable Delight, which cannot be conceived by thoſe that know it not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally.

upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For Chriſt many times toucheth the Soul with a piercing Beam of Love, which by this, is ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly drawn to a quick return; and this gives freer paſſage for a new Impreſſion, which more exciting the Powers of the Soul to a new Imbrace, opens the way more for the King of Glory to enter with that power and unutterable force of Divine Love, that the Soul becomes filled, ſwallowed up, and tranſported in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of Rapture, not being able to expreſs thoſe Pleaſures, Guſts, Imbraces, Love-Extaſies, which then are piercing thorough it; nor ſufficient Praiſes and Hallelujahs to the great King of Saints, who beſtows ſuch Royal tokens of Love upon it. And as in this ſtate there is ſuch holy Commerce in pure Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and the Soul, ſo there is betwixt the Soul and <note n="(c)" place="margin">Pſal. 16.3.</note> other Saints, who cannot but wonderfully own and love one another, and delight in that likeneſs of God, which they ſee in each other, and bleſs him for thoſe living Powers of Grace and Love that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated in the Worſhip of God, by which they exceedingly refreſh each others Spirits. (Now this mutual love chiefly flows from a <note n="(d)" place="margin">Ioh. 17.21.</note> ſight and ſenſe of Oneneſs, which exceedingly enforceth this great cloſing and out-ſlowing of Spirit to delight, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and refreſh one another. And here is that ſtrength of Love that we could give our <note n="(e)" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.15.</note> lives for the Brethren, and endure much Affliction to flee them from ſufferings: Here we bear one anothers Burdens, and ſo fulfil the Royal Law of Love; for we can keep nothing as our own, but what we heartily communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and make our Brethren partakers of, becauſe they are part of our ſelves. Here we come to practice that heavenly Law, of loving our Neighbours as our Selves, and of doing Gods Will on Earth as it is done in Heaven; for which end Man and the viſible World

were brought forth. For the breaking forth of ſin and wrath, was not according to Gods moſt pure and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Will, which is good, and tends to Salvation and Bleſſing, and the keeping of his Creatures in that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Harmony, in which they came out of Gods hands as fitted to glorifie him through mutual Love, and regular Obedience. And this is the end of Chriſts Coming into the World of Mans Nature, even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it from the Diſcord of Sin and Wrath, to the Harmony of pure Love and Righteouſneſs; therefore 'tis a happy ſtate to have attained this Habit of Love before deſcribed, which will not terminate within the Sphere of our Neighbours and Brethren, but in ſome meaſure flow out to all; cauſing us to breath after, endeavour, and <note n="(f)" place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.</note> pray for their Change: for it is the Nature of true Love to communicate it ſelf and to delight in propagating its own heavenly Image, that ſo many may come to partake of Bliſs and Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs through it: And in this Enjoyment, if we find any that know and poſſes but little, yet thirſt much after God, O how will our hearts burn within us! How ready ſhall we be to employ our Talents for their good, and to diſcover that Way which leads through Nature into the Kingdom of the Love? What labour and pains could we take to be inſtrumental in changing, and quickning them, and in bringing them through the Croſs to our ovvn ſtate of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo that this Diſpenſation abounds much in Love, both to God and our Neighbour, fitting the Soul for Aſcention into Eternity, there to ſee and know with Satisfaction and Delight, thoſe Wonders which the holy Angels and glorifyed Saints are continually viewing with Joy and Admiration.</p>

               <p>THE Soul being brought thus far in the Heart-Work by the Power of Jeſus, through the practice of the Croſs, in Self-denial and Reſignation, lives in habitual ſpringings up of the Love in the Centre of it's Spirit, where the work is near finiſhed, the Will being conſtantly drawn toward the Heart of God in the Chariot of Love. And in this State the Soul is completely fitted for Aſcenſion, and the opening of the Eternal World, which is part of the Head-work; for in that the ſpiritual Eye is ſeated, which is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſee and know the wonders of Eternity. And though ſome in a rapture may be taken up into that World long before the work in their Hearts, Wills, and Affections is finiſhed; yet ſuch muſt afterward go through the work in Nature, of rectifying all their Properties, and of bringing their Wills into
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:103754:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Death, and pure Reſignation, that ſo they may be fitted for the Birth of the Love; whence its clear that this State of Regeneration, attained in the Will through the Death, is far more conſiderable, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Perfection than the higheſt Rapture without ſuch a foregoing work; and the Aſcenſion after this work of Regeneration in the Heart, is more weighty, and more tending to Perfection, than any Rapture of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation before, can be; becauſe by ſuch a Work, the Will is wrought up into a conſtant Union with Chriſt, which by Aſcenſion, is more confirmed and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Heart through that, being more raiſed above <note n="(g)" place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> all mortal corruptible Objects, and more reduced into a paſſive ſilent waiting for the Opening of the <hi>Eternal Temple,</hi> whence the infallible Voice proceeds, and where the great High-Prieſt ſparkles with the moſt bright Beams of divine Glory. But the manner of the Souls Aſcending from the Internal to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal World, is very remarkable and wonderful. It <note n="(h)" place="margin">John 15.5.</note> cannot of its ſelf move one degree upward; That ſame hand of power which carried it downward, to ſee the Wonders of God in the Depths, muſt carry it upward to ſee his Wonders in the high places above. So that in this the Soul is meerly paſſive; The Spirit of Chriſt being the Agent, which deſcending with an over-ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing Vertue upon it, wraps <note n="(i)" place="margin">2 Cor. 12.</note> it up ſwiftly, and in a ſtrong force (by which the Souls Acts are for a while ſuſpended) tranſlates it, as it were, in a ſtrait Line from the Inward, toward the Inmoſt. In this Tranſlation or Aſcenſion, what Wonders are ſeen and felt, I ſhall not particularly expreſs: But in general, this I muſt declare, That there is an unutterable Power transfuſing the Soul in this Aſcent, which firſt comes into the Womb of the Inviſible Worlds (out of which they iſſue) in which it finds an Univerſal Silence or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103754:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Stilneſs; and above which, it diſcovers a great Glory, inhabited by glorified Spirits, who there live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Harmony and Joy, ſinging Halelujahs to the Lamb of God; and continually waiting upon the Infallible Voice proceeding from the Throne of God. To be taken into this, is a further degree of Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being the ſecond Manſion in the Eternal World; where <note n="(k)" place="margin">Rev. 5.11. and 7.</note> Myriads of Angels attend thoſe Commands, which come out of the Moſt holy place, which is the laſt and higheſt Manſion in that World, anſwering to <hi>Love,</hi> as the ſecond to <hi>Life,</hi> and the firſt to <hi>Light,</hi> correſponding with the threefold manifeſtation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. But to ſpeak much of the two laſt, requires greater Experience than yet I have enjoyed. Neither is it expedient to deſcribe the firſt, nor thoſe Wonders which are in it, in regard of that Blindneſs and general Enmity which is in Mens hearts againſt the deep My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of God in Inviſible Nature. But after Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion into the firſt, the Soul becomes ſo much indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſenſe and apprehenſion of thoſe Spiritual Myſteries it was there acquainted with; and hath ſuch a clear View of the outward World, and of the Miſery that moſt there lye in, that it cannot but weep over the greateſt part of Men, as Chriſt did over <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> as ſeeing them exceeding Ignorant of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſo of their own Everlaſting happineſs; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the Spirit of the outward World, where the Prince of the World holds them Captive, and makes them Enemies to the Kingdom of Love, in which there is no Enmity, Covetouſneſs, Luſt nor Deceit, nor any ſuch things as thoſe are, which in the World are moſt courted and admired. After this alſo, the Soul begins to diſcover the Evil Properties and Habits of Mens Spirits, very much portrayed in their Faces, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103754:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in their very Aſpects and Signatures, thoſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial and devilliſh Paſſions by which they are ſwayed and captivated within, ſo that the Eye many times af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Heart with grief, in viewing the ſad Eſtate of Souls eſtranged from the Life of Innocency and pure Virginity, and impriſoned in the dark Chains of Corrupt fleſh and blood. Here likewiſe the Soul is exceeding Paſſive, and much comprehended in deep abſtract Silence, by which it much enjoys unutterable Pleaſures and Guſts from the inward ground of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, having much ſenſe of the nearneſs of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, where the Angelical Thrones ſing Hallelujahs, and ſport themſelves in the Innocent delights of their Eternal Spheres and Luminous Manſions. And as the Soul paſſeth from the firſt Manſion towards the ſecond and third, Jeſus <note n="(m)" place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 22 &amp; 1. 23.</note> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> (in his glorified Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity) begins to give great demonſtrations of his Preſence; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.</note> and to viſit the inward Man with frequent and very great impreſſions; ſo that it cannot doubt but that he is ſome times perſonally preſent, infuſing the Tincture of his glorified Body into the Heart, which is ſweeter than Hony, and burns like Oil and fire mixed together. And truly this Diſpenſation is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing comfortable and very weighty; for the diſcovery of Chriſts preſence ſometimes ſwallows up the Soul into unſpeakable Joy, being transfuſed with the breath of his Mouth which is moſt Odoriferous; and quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the touch of his Body, which is moſt Delightful; and pierced through with the Sound of his Voice, which is moſt harmonious and powerful; cauſing the Soul deeply to admire the Grace of God, and to cry out with <hi>Thomas,</hi> my Lord, and my God. <hi>In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation Chriſt ſhews very powerfully the neceſſity of his Mediation, as God-Man; and that whatever we receive is through him, who ſtanding in the deepeſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103754:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Father, conveys all Light, Life and Love from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, into us, who at the time of the Reſtitution of all things,</hi> Act. 3.21. <hi>will again Breath the Holy Ghoſt on his choſen Veſſels, of which thoſe in the Primitive time received but the firſt Fruits.</hi> He alſo reveals in this ſtate how the Myſtery of Iniquity (even the Spirit of Anti-Chriſt) works in moſt Sects of Chriſtians; carrying them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deny or ſlight the great Myſtery of his Mediatory Office: Or by miſconceptions, to cry up his Blood and Merits, to the prejudice of Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Self-denyal, and the Imitating of his moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Life, as our Pattern to walk by in this World. Moreover in this Diſpenſation, the Soul enjoys very great Openings of Eternity in the Heart, which are different from Openings in the Head, where the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes of hearing and ſeeing are reſident; for whatever in a Divine Sight (Eternity opening in the Head) we clearly and diſtinctly view and behold the ſame (in a Heart-opening) we really feel and handle in a Spiritual way; for in it we come experimentally to know and perceive the Motions and Adminiſtring In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of Angels, the Vertue and Efficacy of Chriſts univerſal and particular Body: The Harmony, Love, and Enjoyments of the Spirits of Juſt Men made Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; with much of the Glory and Majeſty of that Kingdom prepared for us, from the beginning of the World, into which none can enter, but thoſe who have <note n="(n)" place="margin">

               <l>It perſeveres in Patience, and is kind,</l>

               <l>By that imperfect Gifts abſorpt muſt be,</l>

               <l>Eternal Truths in Riddles do appear,</l>
               <l>Much is obſcure, but very little clear.</l>
               <l>Yet when the perfect Love we ſhall poſſeſs,</l>

               <l>Without which Heaven could not Heaven be,</l>
               <l>Neither a Place of Reſt, nor Unity.</l>
               <l>'Tis this that links Eternity to Time,</l>

               <l>'Tis this that knits <hi>Eternal Souls</hi> in one,</l>
               <l>And bind's the <hi>Angels</hi> in Conjunction.</l>
               <l>'Tis this that draws down the Almighty Powers</l>
               <l>To over-ſhadow us in Golden Showr's,</l>
               <l>That ſo our Hearts might more enriched be</l>
