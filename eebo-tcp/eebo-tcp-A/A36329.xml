            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

It was the ſaying of
<pb facs="tcp:103627:3"/>
a Learned Divine, who had the honour of being made a Priſoner, as well as Miniſter of the Lord, That it was great pitty there were no more Priſoners of Jeſus Chriſt, to write ſongs of his love: I will not ſay I could wiſh that more of our Citizens had in this late Dreadful Plague, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this, then Doleful place, which to the Countries ſeemed more formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable than a Priſon; but I believe that many of you whoſe Calling and Duty did tye your hands and feet, and ſhut you up in the City, have found ſuch ſweet experiences of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love of God, that they will be recorded; And —<hi>65.</hi> will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by you with thankefulneſs ſo long as you live.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen the Deſtroying An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel entering the City, and Death riding upon the Pale Horſe Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in the ſtreets, Arrows flying, the
<pb facs="tcp:103627:3"/>
ſword bathed, Garments rouling in blood, and this grim Conqueror breaking in upon Houſes without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, taking Captive, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Children, and clapping them up in the Priſon of the Grave, where they muſt remain faſt bound in his chains of darkeneſs, untill the opening of the doors, by him who hath the keys of the Grave, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Conquered Death himſelf, will at his appearance looſen the Bonds of all Deaths priſoners, that they may ſtand before his Judgement Seat, to receive their Final Dooms. In the midſt of which ſlaughter and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, the Captain of your Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath ſtood by you, held his ſhield over you; ſet his mark upon you, and given you ſingular experience of his Power and Goodneſs in your preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. You have been in a ſtorm, God hath ſhown you his wonders in
<pb facs="tcp:103627:4"/>
the Deep, and when ſo many Ships have been caſt away before your eyes, and ſo many Perſons have been devoured by the cruel Waters, and your ſelves inviron'd with waves on every ſide, yet the Lord hath kept you alive, like <hi>Jonah</hi> in the Belly of the Sea, or made a way for you to paſs through, when ſo many not onely <hi>Egyptians,</hi> but <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have been drowned; you have been in the water, but the Lord hath been an Arke about you: You have been in the fire like the three Children, but the Son of God hath walked with you, and ſuppreſſed the violence of the fire, that it hath not prevailed over you; you have been like the Buſh which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw burning, but was not burn't, becauſe God was in it. And when you look back upon thoſe dark days, and black Bills of Mortality, where you have had account of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:103627:4"/>
thouſands dying for ſo many weeks together: Do you not wonder at your ſtrange eſcape? Do you not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your ſelves, as Brands pluckt out of the fire? And muſt you not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it is the Lords mercy you are not conſumed? You who have continued in the City in the time of the Plague, when ſuch throngs of people have been crouding out of this world daily into another, have had ſingular advantages of looking into and preparing for Eternity, which few think of with fixed ſeriouſneſs, till they be awakened by ſome dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſickneſs, whereby withal they are uſually ſo weakened in body and ſpirit, that they are rendred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for ſuch cogitations; but to be in ſuch danger, whilſt in ſo good health, and in ſuch Leaſure from encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring employments, I doubt not but it hath effectually moved many of
<pb facs="tcp:103627:5"/>
you to ſoar a loft in your thoughts and Meditations, that you might take a view of the other Country, which the Scripture doth ſet forth, of the City which hath foundations, whoſe buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Maker is God. I believe the wicked have had dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the burning lake, of the Ocean of Gods wrath, which every day they were ready to launch forth into, and that however ſome have been hardened, and are as bad, yea worſe than before; yet I hope others have been ſo awakened with this dreadful Providence, that they have been effectually perſwaded to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith in Chriſt, who alone can deliver from the wrath which is to come; I believe that others have had deeper impreſſions of Eternity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, than ever they had in their lives, which the borders thereof, on which they have been walking have
<pb facs="tcp:103627:5"/>
given them ſo near &amp; frequent a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of; and I doubt not but all of you have made vows and promiſes to the Lord of a Holy converſation, of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe ſins your conſcience at that time upbraided you withal, and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating your lives to the Lord, if he would be pleaſed to ſpare your lives: Take heed of dropping aſleep again after you have been awakned; of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning again unto ſin after it hath been imbittered; of forgetting or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſing Gods mercy after ſuch a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful preſervation; retain the ſame thoughts of ſins evil and the worlds vanity, of the worth of true Grace and Chriſts beauty; retain the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions you had of Eternity, when you were ſo near it in your apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; hath God laid obligations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you by his preſervations and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verances?

How ſhould thoſe that have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by God from the Grave in this time of Plague, live in ſome meaſure Anſwerably to ſo great a Mercy?</head>

Oh! ſhould you not conſider with your ſelf, what it is that God expecteth at mine hands? How would he have me for to live? and what would God have me to doe? What is the ſpecial work he hath reſerved me for?

When others are dead, I live; when others muſt pray

no more, hear no more, God giveth me time as yet to do both, and all other duties in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to my eternal peace.

                  <p n="6">VI. <note place="margin">Iteration.</note>Then wicked men proceed to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>Iteration</hi> of the ſame ſin, till it becomes cuſtomary. A wicked man is drunk till it is his cuſtom to be ſo, and to ſwear till it becomes his cuſtom to do ſo. This is a great progreſs made in ſin, it is great growth, and ſuch will be hardly reclaimed. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. <hi>Can the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian change his skin, or the Leopard his ſpots? then may you who are accuſtomed to do evil, learn to do well. Aethiopem lavare</hi> is to labour in vain. Miniſters endeavour to reclaim men accuſtomed to ſwearing, and lying, and drunkenneſs, and they preach in vain, and ſtudy and pray in vain, as to any ſucceſs uſually upon ſuch mens hearts. It is the commendation of a man to be accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to a thing, if it be good, for a Chriſtian to ſay, it is his cuſtom to pray; and a Miniſter, it is his cuſtom to preach; though it is not good, that the one pray out of cuſtom, nor the other preach cuſtomarily: <hi>To have it cuſtomary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form holy dutyes is good, but to do them cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily is evil.</hi> Thus it was Chriſts cuſtom, or he was wont to preach and teach the people. But it is an aggravation to be accuſtomed to a thing if it be evil, and if it be <hi>groſs,</hi> it is a ſign of a graceleſs perſon: Though ſome carnal men
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103627:23"/>
when reproved for their often ſwearing, ſay, I thought no harm, it is only a cuſtom I have got, and I cannot leave it: A cuſtom! why that is the aggravation and growth of thy wickedneſs, and thou doſt as fooliſhly alledge that to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate thy ſin, which indeed doth aggravate thy ſin; as a Thief accuſed before the Judge for ſtealing ſhould plead, it was his cuſtom ſo to doe. Now ſin is become the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of the ſinner, and he goes to his ſin as cuſtomarily as an Artificer to his Shop or Work-houſe; but it is not the cuſtom of Gods people to make a cuſtom of committing groſs ſins. <hi>David</hi> did to the wounding of his ſoul <hi>once</hi> commit Adultery, but it was not his <hi>Cuſtome</hi> ſo to doe. <hi>Peter</hi> at one time did deny his Lord, but it was not his cuſtom ſo to do. It is not the cuſtom of a gracious perſon <hi>often</hi> to <hi>commit</hi> the ſame groſſe ſin, but it is his cuſtom <hi>often</hi> to <hi>lament</hi> a groſs ſin but <hi>once</hi> committed.

                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe they adde Incorrigibleneſs unto all their former ſins, and muſt anſwer for all thoſe Judgements that were loſt upon them. Wicked men ſhall not only anſwer for their Mercies, but for the Judgements God ſent upon them to reclaim them; Sinner, God ſent the Plague into thy houſe, and then he looked thou ſhouldeſt have haſtened to have thrown ſin out of thy heart; but thou haſt not done it: God did caſt thee upon a bed of ſickneſs, but thy bed of ſickneſs was not to thee a bed of ſorrow for thy ſin, thou howledſt, and cryedſt our of thy loathſom running-ſores, but not of thy filthy

For theſe thou ſhouldeſt look upon as means, which God doth uſe to bring thee to himſelf, and the more means thou hardeneſt thy ſelf againſt, the more is thy ſin, and the more ſhal be thy miſery.</p>
                  <p>Thus wicked men are oftentimes the worſe by Gods Providences. But if this be thy caſe that <hi>readeſt</hi> theſe Lines, that waſt a drunkard before, and wilt be drunk more frequently now; that waſt a lukewarm Formaliſt before the Plague be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, but now thou art quite cold in the matters of Religion; I charge thee in the Name and fear of the <hi>Eternal</hi> God, that thou preſently bethink thy ſelf, what an aggravation this will be of thy continued and increaſed wickedneſs, and that thou turn from it, leaſt God turn thy body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the grave by ſome other diſtemper, as an Ague, or Feaver, or Conſumption, though he did not by the Plague. Oh think with thy ſelf, God hath taken away ſome of thy ſinful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, that were wont to be drunk and ſwear with thee, who if God ſhould bring them back again from the dead, would tell thee that they are damned for their Drunkenneſs, and that they have been in Hell among Devils, and have felt the wrath of God to be heavy and intolerable, for thoſe very ſins they have committed in thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and thou with them: Would not they tell

thee, if they had thy time, they would pray, but ſwear prophanely no more, if God had ſuffered them to out-live the Plague; or would after death and tryal of the torments of Hell, entruſt them with life again, they would be better. Remember, ſome of them that the other day were drinking unto drunkenneſs in the Ale-houſe, dying in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal impenitency, are now damned with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils; that ſome of them that the other day thou hadſt by the hand, and drunkeſt unto in the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, and did ſing and roar together at your Cups, are now howling and roaring amongſt the damned, and are ſcorched in thoſe flames, and rowling in that Lake of brimſtone, where there ſhall be no mercy, no mitigation, no ceſſation of their torments: And know thou, <hi>whoever</hi> thou art, that if thou doſt not ſpeedily return to God, if thou doſt not mend thy life, and that <hi>quickly</hi> too, if thou doſt not repent and reform, and that <hi>quickly</hi> too, thou ſhalt be a companion with them in torments, with whom thou waſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſinning: It was but a few dayes <hi>ſince,</hi> that they were with thee upon the earth, and if thou art not changed, it will be but a few dayes <hi>hence,</hi> and thou ſhalt be with them in Hell, and when thou art there remember, once thou read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſuch lines that told thee ſo.

                  <p n="14">XIV. <hi>The more thou draweſt others into ſin by thy entiſements or example than before; ſo much the worſe thou art.</hi> When thou art not content to ſin alone, not to diſhonour God thy ſelf, but draweſt and incourageſt others to do ſo alſo; and ſo damneſt thy own ſoul and others too; and makeſt thy ſelf guilty of the bloud of thoſe thou allureſt with thee into ſin. The more ſins thou committeſt thy ſelf, the worſe thou art, and the more perſons thou doſt influence by thy ſin to partake with thee, the worſe thou art.

Thus if thou wilt compare thy ſelf what thou art <hi>now</hi> with what thou haſt been <hi>formerly,</hi> thou mighteſt diſcern how much more thou ſinneſt now than thou didſt before.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Miniſters</hi> of God have often wooed thee and beſeeched thee with tears in their eyes, and ſorrow in their hearts, as if their happineſs had been wrapped up in thine, and as if they could not have gone to Heaven and been ſaved without thee: while patience waited upon thee, they have been earneſt with thee, and now at laſt one unworthy to preach the Goſpel, is a ſuiter to thy ſoul, that thou wouldeſt be divorced from thy ſin and be married unto Chriſt; as <hi>yet</hi> thou art out of hell, and art not yet reckoned among the dead, nor numbred amongſt the damned, as <hi>yet</hi> thou art not irrecoverably loſt, <hi>this</hi> day Chriſt is once more tendred to thee, in the name of God I once more offer thee pardon and eternall life, upon thy repenting of thy ſin, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto God.</p>
                  <p>Oh that I could perſwade thee, or if I cannot, as indeed I cannot; oh that God would yet perſwade thee? If I might be ſerviceable to thy ſoule, oh how ſhould I rejoyce; if I did but know where thou doſt dwell, that haſt been wicked all thy dayes, and now art reading of theſe lines, having a purpoſe in thy heart to come to Chriſt, I would come to thee (as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

                  <p>I beſeech thee by the mercies of God, by the death of Chriſt, by the coming of our Lord, by the love thou beareſt to thy ſelf, as ever thou wouldeſt ſee the face of Chriſt with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as ever thou wouldeſt eſcape the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hell, return at laſt, and though it be late, yet return at laſt. But if thou wilt not, let God be my witneſs, let as many as read theſe lines be my witneſſes, let thy own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be my witneſs, that thou haſt been asked, entreated, yea earneſtly entreated to reform, and mend, and turn to God. But in hopes that I may prevail, I beſeech thee in the fear of God, give in a ſober and deliberate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer unto theſe following Queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether art thou going, while thou art waxing worſe and worſe?</hi> Doſt thou know that Hell is at the end of the way in which thou art daily walking? Doſt thou know, that if thou doſt proceed a little further, a little longer in this courſe, thou wilt be among the Devils, thoſe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103627:44"/>
curſed Fiends of Hell? Or doſt thou know it, and yet wilt venture to dance about the brink of a bottomleſs pit? who hath bewitched thee? or what hath made thee mad, that thou ſeeſt thou art going unto Hell, and yet wilt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Doſt thou believe the Scripture to be the Word of God, or doſt thou not?</hi> And are the threatnings contained therein, true, thinkeſt thou, or are they not? Wilt thou ſay they be falſe, or that they were found out by ſome Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians, or are the workings of ſome melancholly brain? or that they were found out by ſome Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician, to keep the world in awe? I would have thee know, that to thy <hi>eternal</hi> ſorrow thou ſhalt finde them all true, even to a tittle; and to thy everlaſting woe ſhalt know the truth of Gods Word: When thou art ſhrieking in the flames of Hell, and roaring hideouſly among the damned, becauſe of Gods eternal wrath; thou ſhalt be convinced, that the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, that the Unbeliever ſhall be damned, and that it was true which thou waſt told, that without repentance there was no deliverance from eternal condemnation.</p>
                  <p>But if thou doſt believe this Word to be true, what aileth thee then to live as thou doſt? that thou acteſt quite contrary to what is contained in the Word of God? Doth not the Word of God in a thouſand places cry down ſin, and preſs to holineſs? doth it not tell thee, the drunkard, the covetous, the unbelieving, the lyar, ſhall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103627:45"/>
be damned? If thou never didſt obſerve ſuch places, take thy Bible and turn unto them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.20. to 25. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5, 6. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.3, 5. Canſt thou read and believe theſe Scriptures to be true, and yet goe on in the practice of thoſe things that the eternal, holy God doth forbid upon pain of eternal torments? Wilt thou be worſe than thy very beaſt, which thou canſt not force into the fire when he ſeeth it before him. <hi>Shall I call out thy Neighbours to behold a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſight,</hi> viz. <hi>A man that knowes he is in the way to Hell, and yet will goe on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>With what face or heart canſt thou hope (as thou doſt) that God will pardon thy ſin, or ſave thy ſoul, while thou perſiſteſt in thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and encreaſeſt therein?</hi> Shew me an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of any one man in all the Word of God, that was pardoned and ſaved, who repented not, and I will be thy ſlave for ever. I know, great ſinners have been ſaved; and I know, thoſe that have gone far have obtained mercy: <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> did, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 33.12, 13. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. But then they turned unto God. Canſt thou ſay, there is any one now in Heaven that did not repent, and believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he dyed? or doſt thou think that thou ſhalt be the only man?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Whom doſt thou ſet thy ſelf againſt?</hi> Or who is it that thou doſt provoke? whoſe anger
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103627:45"/>
and indignation art thou daily kindling againſt thy ſelf? What art thou, that thus doſt ſin? or what is God againſt whom thou ſinneſt? doſt thou know thy ſelf, and thine own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And doſt thou know God, and his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power? art thou any better than chaffe before the winde of Gods wrath? art thou, any better than ſtubble before a conſuming Fire? canſt thou make thy party good againſt God? Then why doſt thou take thy bed, when he layeth his finger light upon thee? or why doſt thou complain and art ſo reſtleſs under the pain of the tooth-ache? why doſt thou roar ſo much under the pain in thy bowels? and why doſt thou groan, when he makes thee ſick? why art thou ſick, and why wilt thou dye, if thou canſt contend with God? But if thou canſt not, <hi>poor Worm,</hi> thou canſt not; why then wilt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and increaſe thy wickedneſs more and more, to provoke him more and more?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>How canſt thou call thy ſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, while thou daily increaſeſt in thy ſin againſt God and Chriſt.</hi> Chriſtians have their denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from Chriſt, becauſe they follow his ſteps, and own him for their Lord and Maſter: Chriſt was holy, and ſo is every true Chriſtian; Chriſt hated ſin, and ſo doth every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian; Chriſt did the will of his Father, and thou art doing the will of the Fleſh and of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. That which conſiſteth of a head of one kinde, and members of another, is monſtrous.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103627:46"/>
If any creature had the head of a man, and the members were the members of a beaſt, it would be monſtrous. Chriſt is an holy head, and all his members united unto him are holy members; therefore thou art none of them: Take it as thou wilt, thou art not a Chriſtian, that ſhould not be thy Appellation; thou art more rightly called a ſinner, a Childe of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>How canſt thou goe unto thy Prayers and yet go on in thy ſin,</hi> and come to the Word preached, and hear drunkenneſs reproved, and go away and be drunk? How canſt thou ſit in thy Pew, and hear the Miniſter from God tell thee, the drunkard ſhall be damned, and all thy Neighbours know thee for a drunkard, and yet hold up thy head? Where is thy ſhame? art thou become impudent? where is thy fear of God and his Word? art thou utterly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened? where is thy Conſcience? is it quite ſeared?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Doſt thou think that God will never call thee to an account?</hi> Doſt thou think that time will alwayes laſt? doſt thou think thy ſoul ſhall live for ever, and yet do that which will bring thee to an eternity of miſery? and expoſe thy ſelf for a little <hi>momentany</hi> pleaſure unto <hi>eternal</hi> torments? Thus I have ſet before thee theſe Conſiderations, whereby thou mayſt be brought to bethink thy ſelf, and at laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103627:46"/>
What would you have me to doe? I anſwer thee:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Make a ſtand and pauſe a little with thy ſelf, whether it be not ſo with thee or no? and labour to convince thy ſelf of the hainouſneſs of thy ſins, in making ſuch an increaſe and growth in ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When thou art convinced thus, urge it upon thy heart till thou feeleſt it begin to melt, and to be diſſolved in thy breaſt. Uſe thy Reaſon for thy ſouls good, after this manner: Oh God hath been good to me, and I have been wicked againſt God; God was alwayes good to me, and I have been alwayes evil againſt God; God multiplyed his mercy upon me, and I multiplyed my ſins againſt God; if he had not given me bread to eat, I had dyed with hunger; and if he had not given me drink, I had periſhed with thirſt; but what he gave me for my nouriſhment I have abuſed to gluttony and drunkenneſs; I have fought againſt God with his own mercy, and made his goodneſs an encouragement to me in my wickedneſs: He lengthened out his mercy, and I did lengthen out mine iniquity; Oh what rich grace and patience is this, that I am not in Hell! Oh this was long-ſuffering indeed, to bear ſo long with ſuch a Swearer and Drunkard as I have been; and when the dreadfull Plague hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my Companions in ſin, yet I am left behinde; Oh that it may be, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn to God! Woe is me! I have been damning of my precious ſoul, and have
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:103627:47"/>
ſpent my dayes hitherto in diſhonouring of a good and patient God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then reſolve with thy ſelf, that by the grace of God thou wilt forſake and leave thoſe practiſes, and wilt no longer continue in thy wickedneſſe; ſay, Now I ſee this is not my <hi>Way</hi> to happineſs; ſwearing, and lying, and drunkenneſs, is not my way to the Kingdom of God: The Devil hath deceived me, and my Companions have deceived me, and my own wicked heart hath beguiled me; I will, by the grace of God, I will do ſo no more; I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved I will do ſo no more: And write down thy Reſolution, that thou mayeſt have it under thine own hand, that ſuch a day thou didſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve to do ſo no more.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Beg of God that thou mayſt be deeply humbled for what thou haſt already done, and labour that thy ſorrow may be proportionable to what thy ſins have been.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Make haſte to Chriſt, and take him and receive him for thy Lord and Saviour, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him upon his Goſpel-terms, as willing he ſhould rule thee, as ever thou waſt for ſin to rule thee.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then endeavour to be <hi>as good</hi> as thou haſt <hi>been bad,</hi> as holy as thou haſt been wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as eminent for piety, as thou haſt been exemplary for iniquity; ſpeak for Holineſſe as much as ever thou didſt ſpeak againſt it; and love the wayes of God as much as thou waſt wont to hate them, and by perſevering ſo to doe, thou ſhalt finde great mercy will
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103627:47"/>

Is it the Nature of ſin to make men worſe and worſe? and do wicked men uſually wax worſe and worſe? Then learn,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The evil that there is in ſin</hi>: There is a depth in the evil of ſin that cannot be fathomed, and a length in the evil of ſin that cannot be meaſured; that is very bad that makes men ſo in every condition, as grace is very good that turneth every thing for the beſt to them to whom it is infuſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Learn that <hi>wicked men are never from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a curſe:</hi> Let their condition be what it will, proſperity is a curſe unto them, adverſity is a curſe, and deliverances are in wrath. When they do increaſe in riches, they do increaſe in ſin; envy not the proſperity of the wicked.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Learn the <hi>bottomleſs depth of iniquity in a wicked mans heart:</hi> He was bad twenty years ago; he was a grief to all the godly in the Town and Pariſh where he lived, but yet he is many times worſe than before.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn <hi>what abundance of guilt an old ſinner goes with to his grave when he comes to dye</hi>: He was bad when he was born, and worſe while he lived, and worſt of all when he is to dye.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:103627:48"/>5. Learn <hi>the equity of Gods Juſtice in puniſhing a wicked man with eternal torments for ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in time</hi>: For he ſinned more and more as long as he lived, and if he had lived longer, he would have ſinned longer; and if he had lived for ever, he would have ſinned for ever.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Learn <hi>the over-ruling providence of God</hi>: that ſetteth bounds to wicked mens ſins; if he did not reſtrain them, they would be worſe, and do worſe than they do.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Learn, <hi>that natural men by the improvement of common grace, or the means of grace, cannot work themſelves into a state of grace,</hi> nor of themſelves that are bad, make themſelves to be good; for we have ſhewed, that without the ſpeciall and irreſiſtible operations of the Spirit of God, wicked men grow worſe under the Adminiſtrations of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>The folly of delays and procraſtinations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and turning unto God</hi>: Wicked men think they can repent when they will, and though they have no heart to turn to God for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, yet they will hereafter; but he that is not diſpoſed to turn to God and repent to day, will finde his heart more indiſpoſed to morrow, and the longer they put it off, the more unwilling and unable they will be to do it hereafter.

It may be the wicked will be worſe, but will you be ſo too?

Lay to heart the goodneſs of God in preſerving you. The City hath been an houſe of mourning, but have you learned the leſſons that are to be learned in an houſe of mourning? Have you met ſo many dead Corpſe carried in the ſtreets? have you ſeen the living laboring to carry forth their dead, and yet not learned the leſſons that are to be learned in ſuch a place of mourning? Where one is dead in a family, that before was an houſe of mirth and gladneſs, it will turn it into an houſe of mourning and ſadneſs, much more, when many dead in one family; and this is the caſe of many families. God hath been teaching you many things at ſuch a time, but is your leſſon taken out? Oh, what dull Scholars are we in the School of Chriſt that muſt thus be ſcourged to learn our leſſons, and yet have not done it?

Gods threatnings, but do not believe them, nor fear them, nor tremble at them. Many will not <hi>practically</hi> believe that they ſhall dye, though they ſin, and will not at all believe they ſhall be damned, though they ſin; but we ſee that men that have ſinned muſt dye, and wicked men ſhall feel that they ſhall be damned according to Gods threatnings, but you have learned the truth of Gods threatnings in this, and they are as true in all other reſpects; therefore do you that are Gods people, learn the truth of Gods threatnings, when he ſaith the Drunkard ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God; and let this move your heart to pity them that are ſuch, that have a threatning of God, which is of undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted verity, as a flaming ſword ſtanding in their way to keep them out of the Paradiſe of God, and be thankful unto God that you are none of theſe.

really good are not ſo many as thoſe that are ſeemingly good, and thoſe that are gradually good are not ſo many as thoſe that are really good.</hi> Ever the better the fewer, both for kinde and degree. It is ſo in Naturals; not ſo many Whales as leſſer Fiſh; not ſo many Eagles as little Birds; not ſo many Suns as Stars: And ſo it is in Spirituals; not ſo many ſtrong men in Chriſt, as babes; not ſo many tall Cedars, as there are Shrubs in Gods <hi>Lebanon.</hi> Now my purpoſe is to exhort you (eſpecially after ſuch a Providence) to be not only really good, but to be gradually good.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſit.</hi> 4. That thoſe that are <hi>gradually</hi> good, are yet <hi>imperfectly</hi> good, as appears by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of ſin in the beſt; and would be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by a particular enumeration of their Graces, which is the beſt thing in the beſt men; they know but in part, and they love but in part, and delight in God but imperfectly, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.9, 10, 11, 12.</p>

                     <hi>Poſit.</hi> 5. Thoſe that are really good though <hi>imperfectly good,</hi> are truly <hi>acceptable</hi> unto God. God will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.20. There may be a great deal of ſmoak where there is but little fire, a great deal of ſin where there is but little grace; but yet it is pleaſing unto God, if it be true; a little grace is of great value, (a Pearl of ſmall quantity might be of great worth) and better than a great deal of riches, or of gifts; better than a ſtrong Memory pregnant phantacy, ſolid Judgement, quick Apprehenſion, voluble

                  <p>
                     <hi>Poſit.</hi> 6. That when a good man doth increaſe in goodneſs, he increaſeth more or leſs <hi>in all ſaving</hi> goodneſs. When any one ſin is more mortified, every ſin is in ſome meaſure more mortified, and yet every ſin is not equally ſtrong, becauſe ſome ſins are more deeply radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, have been more ſtrengthened by frequent acts, and are more rooted in the conſtitution; ſo though addition be made in every Grace, when a Chriſtian growes better, yet every grace might not be equally ſtrong in the ſame Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, becauſe ſome grace may be more oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the contrary ſin, and ſome grace is drawn forth more into act and exerciſe than the reſt; yet as a Childe growes in all parts truely though not equally; ſo it is in a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: And this I adde, that you may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be univerſally good, and univerſally better, better in Faith, and better in Love, and Humility, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>

                     <note place="margin">Seventeen Arguments to Gods People to be better.</note>1. YOu <hi>are not ſo good as once you were</hi>; I mean in your Primitive condition and firſt creation, we had more goodneſs as we came out of the hands of God; then we had good and no evil: And when God hath reſtored us, we ſhould labour to come up as near to what we were in <hi>Adam,</hi> (though not by the ſame Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant) as we can.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You are <hi>not ſo good as you ſhall be.</hi> You were good in <hi>Adam,</hi> but you ſhall be better in Heaven: In <hi>Adam</hi> we were perfectly good, in Heaven we ſhall be perpetually good; and ſhould you not labour to get as much of Heaven into your heart as you can.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You <hi>are not ſo good as you ought to be,</hi> no, not by many degrees; you come farr ſhort of what you ſhould be in grace and goodneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. You <hi>are not ſo good as you may be</hi>: Though you cannot be ſo good as you were in <hi>Adam,</hi> as you ſhall be in Heaven, as you ought to be upon earth, yet you <hi>may</hi> be better than you are. You have not ſo many degrees of love to God, but you <hi>may</hi> have more, nor ſuch ſtrong deſires
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103627:58"/>
after Chriſt, but you may have more: How weak is thy love! how cold are thy deſires! how ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid is thy heart! not only in compariſon of what it ought to be, but of what it may be: Thou wanteſt many degrees, Oh Chriſtian, <hi>put on,</hi> there is much more that is yet attainable.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. You <hi>are not ſo good, but you need to be better.</hi> If thou be no better, and ſhouldſt come into ſome conditions, thou wouldeſt be found not good enough to go through the ſame as becomes the Goſpel. Thou mighteſt be brought into thoſe ſtraits, and aſſaulted by thoſe temptations, that except thou haſt more Patience, more Love to God, more Faith in Chriſt, thou wilt not be able to bear them, nor reſiſt them, as becomes a Childe of God to doe: Thy burdens might yet be greater, and thy Duties greater, and thy Temptations greater, therefore thou ſhouldeſt haſten to be better.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You <hi>are not ſo good as others are,</hi> that have had but the ſame time, and the ſame means, and Helps as you have had, nay ſome that have not had ſo much preaching as you have had, nor ſuch Examples as you have had, nor ſo much time, that did ſet out for Heaven after you, that were bad while you were good, yet have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken you, and gone beyond you: Oh Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, thou art lagging behinde, <hi>put on,</hi> leaſt thou ſhouldeſt be laſt of all.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. You <hi>are not ſo good, but you are as bad.</hi> You have not ſo much grace, but you have as much ſin; nay, is not your ſin more than your grace? is not your unbelief more than your faith? and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103627:58"/>
your wandring thoughts in duty more than your fixed thoughts in duty? and your dulneſs more than your livelineſs? If thou canſt ſay truely, it is not, do thou go and bleſs God that it is not ſo with thee, while I muſt go and be humbled before God, becauſe it is ſo with me.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>better you are, the more excellent you will be.</hi> Riches is not your excellency, and Learning is not your excellency, and Grace is not your <hi>utmoſt</hi> and your higheſt excellency, but the higheſt degrees of Grace is. Reaſon makes a man differ from a beaſt; and the more rational a man is (by the improvement of Reaſon) than others, the more excellent as a man (for a Fool might excell a Wiſe man in riches) he is above other men: So Grace makes a Chriſtian differ from a man <hi>as ſuch,</hi> and the better Chriſtian he is than others, the more excellent he is than other Chriſtians are.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The <hi>better you are, the more like to God,</hi> who is the greateſt, the chiefeſt, and the beſt good. When we loſt our goodneſs, we loſt our likeneſs unto God; and when God makes us good, he makes us like himſelf, and the better God doth make us, the more he makes us like himſelf: And ſhould not this provoke thee to be better? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering, to be moſt like to God, is

You may by ſeeming good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe have the approbation of men, but you muſt be really good, if you will have the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of God; and the better you are, the more he will approve you. God obſerveth the worſt of men, but approveth only of good men; and only the good actions of good men, not their ſinful actions, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.5.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The <hi>better you are, the more clearly you will ſee that you are good.</hi> Many queſtion, they are not good, and the reaſon of their doubt is, becauſe they are no better: That time you ſpend in complaining you fear you are not good, improve in endeavouring to be better, and your doubts will be ſooner anſwered, and your fear expelled.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The <hi>better you are, the more profitable you will be to all about you.</hi> The better you are in your ſelf, the better it will be for your ſelf, and the better for all about you; the better you are, the more you will lay out your ſelf for God, and for the good of ſouls. Others ſhall be the better,</p>
                  <p>For your Counſels: You will be directing them how to do good.</p>
                  <p>For your Reproofs: You will be telling them when they do evil.</p>
                  <p>For your Example: You will lead them in the good Way.</p>
                  <p>For your Experiences: You will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to them how good God hath been unto you, and what God hath done for you.</p>

                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:103627:59"/>13. The <hi>better you are, the more inward joy, and the more eſtabliſhed peace you ſhall finde.</hi> The great trouble of a Chriſtian is, becauſe he is no better; be you better and you will have the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer trouble within, though the better you are, the more trouble you might have from men; but thats not ſo great matter.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The <hi>better you are, the more glory you will bring to God. Herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit,</hi> Joh. 15.8. And what is your deſign in the world, but to glorifie God, and to do that, and be that which tendeth moſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto?</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The <hi>better you are, the more you will credit Religion,</hi> and realize the wayes of God; it will appear that Religion is a real thing, when it hath made bad men good, and good men better. If there were nothing elſe to diſgrace the ways of ſin, this would be abundantly ſufficient to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the great wickedneſs of thoſe men (how bad they be) that walk moſt therein.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The <hi>better you are while you live, the more undaunted you ſhall be when you come to dye</hi>: The reaſon why we are ſo troubled in our ſickneſs, is becauſe we were no better in our health; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then remembers at ſuch a time I ſinned, and at ſuch a place I fell, and in ſuch company I defiled my ſoul; be better in Health, you will be the better in ſickneſs and death.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The <hi>better you are upon earth, the weightier your crown ſhall be in heaven</hi>: Thoſe that be truly good, ſhall have ſure glory, but thoſe that are better, ſhall have more. There ſhall be no want
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103627:60"/>
of any thing to any one in heaven, but yet ſome ſhall ſhine more eminently in glory, than others.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have diſpatched this particular alſo, that you be better after ſuch a <hi>ſignal</hi> providence as this, for if you be not, this very thing will be a greater Plague, than the Plague upon the body; and if you ask me wherein you ſhould be better? you muſt gather up that in the following Directions, which ſhall be more particular; and ſuch as may be uſeful to prevent men from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe, which was the firſt thing, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to promote this duty of being better, which was the ſecond thing I have ſpoken to.</p>

In time of extraordinary danger, or when we are in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of ſome extraordinary Mercy, we have the example of the holy men of God in Scripture, to binde our ſelves to endeavour to walk more cloſe with God. So <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 28.20. <hi>And Jacob vowed a vow, ſaying, if God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on.</hi> Verſ. 21. <hi>So that I come again to my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe in peace, then ſhall the Lord be my God.</hi> And this he was careful to perform, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.2. <hi>Then Jacob ſaid unto his houſhold, and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange gods, and be clean, and change your garments.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>And let us ariſe and go up to Bethel, and I will make there an altar unto God, who anſwered me in the day of my diſtreſs, and was with me in the way which I went.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> made a vow to God when he was in danger of his life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.12. <hi>Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praiſes unto thee.</hi> Verſ. 13. <hi>For thou haſt delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my ſoul from death</hi> —And in the like danger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.3. <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me, and the pains of hell gate hold upon me: I found trouble and ſorrow.</hi> Verſ. 4. <hi>Then called I upon the name of the Lord, O Lord, I beſeech thee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Didſt thou not determine with thy ſelf if God would ſpare thy life, if God would give thee health again, and try thee a little longer in the world, that thou wouldeſt walk more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and act for God more zealouſly? That thou wouldeſt pray more frequently and more fervently? That thou would minde the world leſs, and heaven more? That thou wouldeſt make Religion thy buſineſs, as long as thou ſhouldeſt live? Didſt thou not reſolve that God and Chriſt, and things above ſhould have more of thy heart and hearty love? That thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt then forſake looſe and carnal company, and aſſociate thy ſelf with thoſe in whom thou couldſt diſcern moſt of God, and walked moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſly before him?

               <p>Deal plainly, <hi>man,</hi> with thy ſelf, and do not flatter thy ſoul, and daube with thy conſcience, Was there not ſome ſuch thoughts and purpoſes, and reſolutions as theſe in thy heart at ſuch a time? And didſt thou promiſe and reſolve in jeſt, and not in earneſt; God did afflict thee by the plague <hi>in good earneſt,</hi> and thou waſte then affraid of death, and the grave, and judgement, <hi>in good earnest!</hi> And didſt thou onely purpoſe <hi>in jeſt,</hi> and reſolve in jeſt, and play with holy things when thou waſt near another world? and dally with God, when thou didſt not know but within an hour thou mighteſt have appeared at his Bar? and been ſet before the terrible tribunal of the great heart-ſearching God? But if thou waſt in earneſt with God, when God was in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt with thee; if thou waſt in earneſt in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, be <hi>earneſt in earneſt</hi> to perform; if thou didſt indeed reſolve to reform when thou ſhouldſt be well, then reform indeed according to thy reſolution, ſince God hath made thee well, and ſaved thee from the Grave, to which thou waſt ſo near, ſo very near.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:103627:62"/>Or if God hath been ſo good to thee to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thee from the infection of the Plague, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the many thouſands that have been viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that thou haſt not been heart-ſick, yet thou haſt often felt ſhootings, and pains, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings up and down in ſeveral parts of thy body; and ſometimes haſt had ſuch things as thou haſt thought to be ſymptomes of the diſtemper, and haſt apprehended it to be approaching to thee, that hath made thee haſten to thy bed, and make uſe of thy preſervatives, and thy cordials, that thou thoughteſt thy ſelf in real danger, and waſt poſſeſt with real fears: What were thy purpoſes at ſuch a time as this?

paſt and done, and ſeem to others, and think verily themſelves, that they promiſe in good earneſt, and mean to do as they do ſpeak, and when they think the danger is paſt, and their fears removed, do nothing leſs than what they promiſed: I have known ſome upon ſick beds ſo to promiſe, that they would be drunk no more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet when health hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, have returned to their wickedneſs: So did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> promiſe fair when the Plagues of God were upon the Land, that he would let the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> goe; but when the Plagues have been removed, he hath hardened his heart againſt them more than before; and this he often did. <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.8, 15. &amp; 9.27, 28, 34, &amp; 10.16, 17, 20.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, The things you have purpoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to do, are <hi>preternatural.</hi> Theſe things are, that you will love God more, and that you will delight and joy in God more. Now thoſe things are praeternatural which are added to another
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103627:65"/>
thing (as an adjunct to its ſubject) ſo that it doth not conſtitute the nature of it, nor deſtroy it, but perfect it. Such a thing is Grace, that you have reſolved to get greater degrees of. Grace and Holineſs doth not conſtitute the Nature of man, for a man without grace is a man; neither doth grace and holineſs deſtroy but perfect Nature: Grace doth not deſtroy the affection of Love, but doth correct it, and place it upon its proper Object; nor deſtroy our Joy, but turns the ſtream of our Joy to empty it ſelf in God, or rather to fetch our Joyes from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The things you have reſolved to do, are <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> above Nature; it is not in the power of Nature to enable you to do what you have reſolved upon. You reſolved in your time of fears and danger, to pray to God more fervently; but Nature cannot help you to do this: To believe more ſtedfaſtly, to love God more ardently, to walk with God more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, but all theſe are above the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and muſt be wrought in you by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and almighty power of God; and yet you did well to reſolve to endeavour to do all theſe, if you did remember to make your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, in the ſtrength of Chriſt to do this, by whoſe ſtrength we can do all things, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The things you have reſolved to do are <hi>contra-natural,</hi> againſt Nature, <hi>i. e.</hi> againſt corrupt nature: For our love to God doth not deſtroy the faculty or affection of Love, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103627:66"/>
it and Innoble it, but it doth deſtroy our love to ſin, and our love to the World, and the things of the World. Now to do that which is againſt corrupt Nature is very hard, you will finde it exceeding difficult, it is ſwimming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſtream, and rowing againſt the tide, that if you do not ply your Oar, you will be carryed back.</p>

                  <p>Eighthly, That ſin is your Darling ſin, which doth moſt diſturb you at the Throne of Grace, and fill your minde moſt uſually with diſtracting thoughts.

                  <p>And next to this beloved ſin, be carefull to mortifie that ſin that is next unto it in your love.

Now that which doth alwayes argue Hatred in God to a ſinner, is worſe than thoſe things that might proceed barely from his Anger, and ſometimes from his Love: God loathes and abhorres that man, the plague of whoſe heart is not <hi>at all</hi> cured.</p>

But the effects of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſoul-ſickneſſes (except they be healed) are dreadful, and inconceivably great; great and dreadful in this world, but greater and more dreadful in the world to come; they cauſe Gods anger, they deprive the ſinner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God, they will ſeparate betwixt God and him for ever, they will bring the ſoul to the place of Devils, and the torments of the damned.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. They are worſe in regard of <hi>difficulty of Cure.</hi> Bodily diſtempers may be cured by the skill of man, in the uſe of natural means, but the ſickneſs of the ſoul with nothing but the blood of Chriſt: Of which more afterwards.</p>

If their finger doth but ake, they are ſenſible of it; but though the whole head is ſick, and the whole heart is faint, and exceedingly diſtempered, yet they are not ſenſible of it. Therefore, though God hath cured the Plague of thy body, and

Every man that is bodily ſick, and is ſenſible of it, and is unfeignedly willing to be freed from his ſickneſs, and deſireth nothing more, is not cured; but it is ſo in ſpirituals: He that is ſenſible of ſin, and is heartily, and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly willing to part with his ſin, as ever ſick man was of ſickneſs, is certainly healed by Jeſus Chriſt: But ſuch as never found ſo much ſorrow for ſin, nor ſenſe thereof, as to make them willing to part with every ſin, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet cured. How can a man that is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, have his ſore dreſſed and lanced, in order to a Cure, and not be ſenſible of the ſmart and pain thereof? Or how can he be healed, while the ſword that made the wound, abideth in it? It is as impoſſible <hi>that</hi> man ſhould be healed of his ſpiritual ſickneſs and wounds, that is not willing to part with ſin, as for a man to be healed of his bodily wound, while he will not have the ſword pulled out that did make it. Sin cauſed the wound and the ſickneſs of thy ſoul, and if thou art not willing to part with every ſin, thou art not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: thy ſoul is ſick, and if thou doſt not feel it, that is the worſe.</p>

                     <pb n="151" facs="tcp:103627:84"/>2. Where the ſoul is healed the <hi>ſin is killed</hi>; the life of ſin is the death of the ſoul, and that which is the life of the ſoul is the death of ſin; if Chriſt heal the ſoul, he wounds ſin, he never heals both; if ſin be wounded to death, the ſoul is healed unto life; as in the body, the more health is repaired, the more the diſeaſe is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; ſo the more the ſoul is cured, the more ſin is mortified.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Where the ſoul is healed, there <hi>grace is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed</hi>; ſickneſs being removed, health is reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. When Chriſt heals a ſinners ſoul, he doth not onely <hi>mortifie the ſin, but ſanctifie the ſinner</hi>; when a man is reſtored from ſickneſs to health, that which made him ſick is not onely removed, but that is introduced which maketh him well; ſo when Chriſt cures the ſoul, he doth not onely take down the power of ſin, which did make him bad, but he infuſeth that which doth make him good.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Where the ſoul is cured of the diſeaſe of ſin, it is <hi>ſick of love to Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weary of ſin, but exceedingly longeth after the preſence of Chriſt, and communion with God, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. <hi>I charge you, O daughters of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, if ye finde my beloved, that ye tell him, I am ſick of love.</hi>

From the <hi>example</hi> of the holy Men of God in Scripture, Joſh. 24.15. <hi>And, if it ſeeme evil unto you to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve; whether the Gods whom your Fathers ſerved, that were on the other ſide of the Flood, or the gods of the Amorites in whoſe land ye dwell; but, as for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Some will ſerve the God of <hi>this World,</hi> that is the Devil, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. ſome will ſerve their Bellies, which they make <hi>their</hi> God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. and ſome will ſerve their unrighteous Mammon, which they make their God; but, do you take up <hi>Joſhua's</hi> Reſolution, That you and your houſe will ſerve the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the <hi>Benefit</hi> that will come to you and your houſe, if you carefully and conſtantly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God therein: God will take care of you and your family, if you take care of his Worſhip therein. Gen. 18.17. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, ſhall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do?</hi> Ver. 19.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103627:99"/>
                     <hi>For I know him, that he will command his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to do Juſtice and Judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath ſpoken of him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the <hi>great evil</hi> that hangs over your family, if you ſhould neglect the Worſhip of God therein; God will <hi>curſe</hi> your family, and his wrath ſhall be the portion of you and your Children, if the worſhip of God be excluded from your Houſe: though God hath ſpared you and your family in this <hi>late Contagion,</hi> yet his Wrath is ſtill <hi>hovering</hi> over your houſe, if you call not upon him, Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies that call not upon thy Name.</hi>— Fury is the utmoſt of Gods wrath: and, this ſhall not be <hi>dropped</hi> only, but poured out upon your family; God will poure down ſhowres of wrath and fury upon thoſe houſes that neglect his Worſhip.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. If you neglect your duty herein, you will be <hi>guilty</hi> of the blood of the Soules of thoſe that die in your family, and are damned for ever: you
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103627:99"/>
will be <hi>bloody Butchers</hi> to the ſoules of your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Servants: God hath committed the care of their ſoules (in great meaſure) unto you, and, can you diſcharge your truſt that God hath repoſed in you, in the total neglect of your duty herein? hath not God charged you in the fourth Commandment, that neither you your ſelf ſhould prophane his day, and that you ſhould ſee that neither your ſons nor daughters, neither your men-ſervants, nor maid-ſervants ſhould prophane it; and, if they do, will not God require this at your hand?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The total neglect of Family-Worſhip will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mal. 1.6. <hi>A ſon honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Father, and a ſervant his Maſter; if then I be a Father, where is mine honour? and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if I be a Maſter, where is my Fear?</hi> — if your Family diſown God, God will diſown your Family; and, if God diſown and caſt you off, will not your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily be a miſerable family?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. If you neglect the worſhip of God in your Family, this will be a <hi>bad example to thoſe</hi> that go out of your family to conſtitute other families; when your Children ſhall have families of their own, and your Servants ſhall have families of their own, will not they be too apt to neglect them, as they have ſeen you neglect yours? and ſo your

                  <p n="8">8. God will puniſh your neglect of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to him with <hi>Family-Judgments:</hi> if you do not make your houſe a houſe of Prayer, God will make your houſe an houſe of Contention and Strife; an houſe of Railings and Quarrellings; and will puniſh you with undutiful Children, and diſobedient ſervants: for, how can you expect that they ſhould be good toward you, when you endeavour not to make them good towards God? if you would preſs your Children and Servants to love God, and obey and ſerve God, they would then obey you from a principle of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſerve you, out of fear to God; they would be more faithful to you, if you would call upon them to ſerve God: Might not God juſtly ſuffer your Servants to purloin, and ſteal from you, when you and they do ſteal from God that time for the World, which is due to God?</p>

                     <hi>SEcondly,</hi> The next Relation I conſider in a Family, is between <hi>Parents and Children,</hi> whom God hath continued after this <hi>great Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.</hi> God hath taken away Parents from <hi>others,</hi> and they are leſt <hi>Orphans,</hi> but God hath conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued thy Parents, <hi>Both,</hi> or <hi>one</hi> to thee. What doth God require from thee in anſwer to a ſutable return for this mercy? God hath taken away Children from others, and bereaved them of thoſe that were dear to them, but God hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued thine, <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>ſome</hi> to thee, what doth God require at thy hands in anſwer to a ſutable return for ſo great a mercy? It is that Parents and Children ſhould fill up the duties of this relation, elſe you can never walk worthy of this mercy. But more particularly,</p>

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Seaſonably</hi>; There is much wiſdom in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, in timeing their Correcting of their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; if you correct them for ſome faults before others, you will diſcourage them; take the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſeaſon.</p>

to pray for them when God hath given them; as though their <hi>being</hi> were a greater bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than their well-being: you muſt add Prayer to Inſtruction and Correction; for, it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly your Inſtruction, nor Correction, but Gods bleſſing given in to ſervent Prayer, that will make your Children good. When you look upon your little Infants as they are ſucking at your breaſts, or laughing in your faces, or playing in your armes; oh conſider the ſeed of ſin that they have in their hearts! that they, by Nature, are the children of wrath; and, when you go to pray for them, uſe ſuch conſiderations that might make your heart to mourn over them, and for them: When you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider they are enemies to God, can you not mourn for them upon your knees? when you conſider they are <hi>loſt</hi> children, except mercy <hi>find</hi> them; that they are damned children except free grace ſave them: Can you not mourn abundantly, and pray ſervently for them? Can you conſider they are by Nature, without the Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and not be grieved at the heart? that your child is a little Traitor againſt the King of Heaven; a little Rebel againſt the glorious God; and, will you not pray that his heart may be changed? Could you weep and grieve if your Child were a Monſter, if it had a body of one kind, and an head of another; if it had an Arme too much, or a Leg too much, or little; why, its miſery is more by Nature then all this, and yet, can you not mourn in your Prayers for him?</p>

                     <note place="margin">4 Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods view of ſecret ſins.</note>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is <hi>a clear and diſtinct view</hi>; God ſeeth all the evil there is in thy ſecret ſin. We have a confuſed ſight of ſin, and a dim ſight of ſin: we ſee not ſo much evil in the greateſt ſin as there is in the leaſt: We <hi>ſee</hi> not ſo much evil in open Prophaneneſs as indeed there <hi>is</hi> in a vain thought: But God ſeeth all diſtinctly. What a man hath before his eyes, that is a <hi>ſutable object,</hi> at an <hi>equal distance,</hi> and having a <hi>neceſſary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> he ſeeth diſtinctly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a <hi>full view</hi>; As God ſeeth all the evil in any one ſecret ſin, ſo he ſeeth all thy ſecret ſins. <hi>Man may know none of them; thou knowest ſome of them, but God knoweth all.</hi> When thou turneſt thy back to go into ſecret to commit ſin, Remember then, <hi>thou art before Gods face.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a <hi>conſtant view</hi>; What we have ſeen with our eyes might be quite razed out of our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, but not out of Gods knowledge; and when God is ſaid to remember our iniquities no more, it is not to be underſtood of real Oblivion, but gracious remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is a <hi>judicial view</hi>; If we ſpeak of the ſecret ſins of an hypocrite or a wicked man, then God ſets them in his ſight, as a Judge ſets before him the crimes of a Malefactor, that they may be read; he accuſed, convicted, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If we ſpeak of the ſecret ſins of Gods
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:103627:121"/>
people, God ſets them before him as a <hi>Father</hi> doth the miſcarriages of his child, not to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite him for it, but to correct him and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe him.</p>

                  <p n="6">6.

far as to draw them from God) than a perſon dead and buried and lying in his grave.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In reſpect of the <hi>Mortification</hi> of ſin, and theſe two laſt are our duty; and of this laſt I would ſpeak a little, following the Metaphor, in which there is ſome difference, and ſome agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the burial of our ſin, and in common burial.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2 Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of our friends and our ſins.</note>The difference in theſe Reſpects.</p>

                  </gap> that this my Friend had not died; oh that I could have kept him in life: But we muſt bury our ſin <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,</hi> as thoſe that are glad of its death; <hi>Not weeping becauſe ſin is dead, but that it once did live.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We bury our Friends with <hi>hopes that they ſhall riſe again,</hi> and live again: But we muſt bury our ſins with hopes they ſhall never live more; never return to them more.</p>
               <p>The reſemblance holds in theſe particulars:</p>
               <p n="1">1. <note place="margin">5 Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances.</note>The Burial of ſin ſuppoſeth <hi>the death of ſin</hi>; Never any man yet buried his ſins alive: For while ſin doth live, it is in the heart as in a <hi>Throne,</hi> and not as in a <hi>Grave.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Burial of ſin ſuppoſeth <hi>the ceaſing of the love of ſin,</hi> that we ſee not that beauty and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in ſin, as we did when it was alive. A man that loves his Relation, while he lived, put
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:103627:135"/>
him in his boſome, yet will not do ſo when he is dead; a man while he <hi>loves</hi> his ſin, will never bury it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Burial of ſin includeth <hi>the removal of it out of our ſight, and as much as may be out of our thoughts.</hi> We love not to look upon <hi>dead</hi> friends, nor many times to think or talk of them, who while they lived were pleaſing objects to our eyes, and the delightful matter of our diſcourſe. While <hi>Sarah</hi> lived ſhe was beautiful in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> eyes, but when dead, he deſired to have her removed out of his ſight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4. <hi>I am a ſtranger and a ſojourner with you, give me poſſeſſion of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my ſight.</hi> The preſence of ſin is a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you when it is dead, and you would have it out of your ſight; and this removal of ſin, when dead and buried hath theſe three proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is a <hi>total</hi> removal, the whole body of ſin, and all the members of it are buried; Death might ariſe from the diſeaſe of ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part, but burial covers all. He that makes a ſhew of the burial of ſin, and yet keeps any in his heart as his <hi>love</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> hath indeed bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried no ſin: For who doth ſo bury his friend as to keep any of his members in his houſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a <hi>voluntary</hi> removal; when one is dead, we make it matter of our choice to have him buried: Yea, we look upon it as a ſore evil and great annoyance to have burial denied to our dead friends: So it is your choice to bury your ſins, and the thoughts of not having them buried is a great trouble to you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:103627:136"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is a <hi>perpetual</hi> removal; we bury our friends ſo, that we would not have them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up again and brought into our houſe: So you bury ſin, never to have it brought back to live again in your heart. One that hath buried his ſin doth earneſtly deſire it might be removed out of the ſight of God, by free pardon; out of the ſight of his own eyes, by the evidence of the pardon; and out of the ſight of others, by leading a contrary Converſation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Burial of ſin includes <hi>the rotting of the old man in its grave,</hi> the mouldring of it, and the daily waſting of it, as dead Corps buried in the earth do conſume and waſt daily. Though a body buried doth not preſently <hi>totally</hi> conſume: Many years after the burial, if the grave be opened, you may find the bones and the skull; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of ſin in the heart of a Child of God, are but as the bones and the skull, but the body of ſin is deſtroyed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Burial of ſin includes, <hi>the loſs of the power and authority that ſin had in the heart while it was alive.</hi> Though a man were never ſo potent while he lived, yet when he is dead and buried, he hath no more power nor juriſdiction. Though thy ſin did ſit as a Lord, and rule in thy ſoul while it lived, yet being dead and buried, its do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ceaſeth.</p>
               <p>Now if you are buried with Chriſt, theſe things will be a comfort to you, <hi>viz,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Thoſe that are buried with Chriſt <hi>are moſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:103627:136"/>
comely in the ſight of God</hi>;<note place="margin">Comfort to thoſe that are buried with Chriſt.</note> A man that is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead and buried, is not ſo with us, but he that is ſpiritually dead to ſin, is beautiful in the eyes of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe that are buried with Chriſt <hi>have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and Communion with God</hi>; thoſe that are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally dead have no more converſe with us, but a man hath no Communion with God, till he is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe that are buried with Chriſt <hi>are paſt the hurt of death</hi>; As thoſe that are naturally dead have paſt through <hi>all</hi> that death can do unto them; if you are buried with Chriſt, though you muſt come under the <hi>ſtroke</hi> of death, yet the <hi>ſting</hi> of death is taken out.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Thoſe that are buried with Chriſt <hi>ſhall be raiſed at the laſt day,</hi> and ſhall for ever live with God and Chriſt, and with holy Angels and Saints in the Kingdom of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.8: <hi>Now if we be dead with Chriſt, we believe that we ſhall alſo live with him.</hi> Thus if you would live in ſome meaſure anſwerably to Gods mercy in preſerving of you from death and the grave, that you are not buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>yet</hi> with others, you muſt die to ſin, and be buried with Chriſt.</p>

                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Heart.</note>You muſt praiſe God with your <hi>heart</hi> as well as with your tongue; for as prayer for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with the tongue, without the heart will not be profitable to <hi>us,</hi> ſo praiſes with the tongue for mercy received, without the heart, will not be acceptable unto God. <hi>To praiſe God with the heart, is the very heart of our praiſes.</hi> Thus <hi>David,</hi> that before called upon his tongue to bleſs God, doth alſo elſewhere call upon his ſoul to do it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.1. <hi>Bleſs the Lord O my ſoul, and all that is within me, bleſs his holy name.</hi> God bleſſeth us, by giving good things unto us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. We bleſs God, when we do thankfully acknowledge the good things we receive from God. You muſt then ſtir up your ſoul, and all that is within you unto this great work of praiſe for ſo great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <note place="margin">Life.</note>You muſt praiſe God in your <hi>lives,</hi> and by

your works and converſations; You muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſpeak</hi> Gods praiſes, but you muſt <hi>live</hi> to his praiſe; you muſt do it with <hi>life,</hi> and in and by your life. <hi>Life</hi> is the mercy I call upon you to praiſe God for, and you muſt do it by your life. You may praiſe God with your lips, and not with your hearts, but if you do indeed praiſe God with your heart, you will alſo do it by your life. If you will <hi>give</hi> thanks <hi>indeed,</hi> you muſt <hi>live</hi> thanks. The beſt <hi>thanks-giving</hi> is <hi>thanks-doing.</hi> Thus if you would be thankful for the life of your children, ſhew it by your religious care in their holy Education; That God might not ſay of you, I ſpared ſuch a mans Children in time of Plague, and afterwards he brought them up to diſhonour me, and to ſin againſt me; if you would be thankful for your own life, then lay it out in holy walking with God.</p>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:103627:151"/>
what ſhall I render? What muſt I do? What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn muſt I make? And he preſſeth himſelf to this by four forcible Arguments, in theſe words, <hi>for all his benefits towards me.</hi> He conſidered,</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Perſon to whom</hi> they were given: For all his benefits to [me.] Hath God indeed given ſuch mercy to me? Hath God continued life to me, ſo vile, ſo unworthy, Oh what ſhall I render? (2.) He reſolves this caſe propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; <hi>I will take the Cup of ſalvation; I will offer the ſacrifice of praiſe.</hi> God hath taken from you (for the preſent) the <hi>Cup of death,</hi> which was to ſo many a <hi>Cup of trembling</hi>;<note place="margin">Mat. 20.22, 23.

praiſe? Do you ſee <hi>David</hi> (in the like caſe) ſo diligent and inquiſitive what to render, and ſo peremptory and reſolute, to offer praiſe to God, and will not you go and do likewiſe?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Is not this the nobleſt work you can engage in, to praiſe God,</hi> and to celebrate with thankfulneſs the greatneſs of his mercy and goodneſs? It is the work of Angels to be praiſing God; and when you take your flight into heaven, and are perfectly removed from ſin, ſorrow, ſuffering, temptation, wants, you ſhall do nothing elſe but love, and praiſe, and admire God? And will you not in the mean while accuſtome your ſelf to that work on earth, which ſhall be your imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in heaven? And will you not take occaſion hereunto, by ſo great a mercy as God at ſuch a time as this hath vouchſafed you?</p>

Is <hi>not God moſt worthy of your highest and your heartieſt praiſes?</hi> You were not worthy of Gods mercies, you were not worthy of life, but God is worthy of the beſt of your praiſes, were they as perfect as the <hi>Hallelujahs</hi> of the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Will you praiſe the efficacy of your Antidotes, and the skill of your able Phyſitian,</hi> by whoſe help you have been (under God) preſerved: And will you not be much more in praiſing of God, for your ſafety, when without his bleſſing all had been ineffectual? Will you praiſe the Inſtrument and means, and ſay, I had an <hi>able Doctor,</hi> and not the principal cauſe of your preſervation, and ſay, I had a <hi>good God.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:103627:152"/>6. Will not you praiſe God for his mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, no, not for your life, <hi>when this is all that God requireth at your hands,</hi> that you ſhould be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You cannot make a <hi>requital,</hi> but God expecteth ſome <hi>return</hi>; you cannot make a <hi>retaltation,</hi> but God looketh for ſome <hi>retribution:</hi> And will not you think an alms ill beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that beggar, that will not give you thanks? And will not life be continued to the aggravation of your ſin, if you are not thankful for it?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Is <hi>not this a duty that will well become you?</hi> A Chriſtian doth then act moſt like a Chriſtian when he is praiſing God, <hi>in tongue, in heart, and life,</hi> Pſal. 33.1, 2. and 147.1. <hi>Praiſe is comely for the upright.</hi> Three things are very comely, To weep as a Sinner, to walk as a Saint, to rejoyce as a Son.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Will not you give to God the glory of his preſerving providence, <hi>when if you do not,</hi> (that are Gods people) <hi>none elſe will?</hi> The wicked that are ſpared, they <hi>will not,</hi> they <hi>cannot</hi> praiſe God; they will diſhonour him, they will ſpeak to Gods diſhonour, and act to Gods diſhonour, ſo that if you do not praiſe God for his ſparing ſo many alive, none elſe will: And ſhall God be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all thankful acknowledgments of his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring mercy, in the midſt of judgment? God forbid: That amongſt all the thouſands that are ſpared, there ſhould be none found, making ſome thankful return to God. This number will be but ſmall; amongſt the <hi>Ten</hi> Lepers that were cleanſed there was but one found thankful. If you
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:103627:152"/>
would not have God to loſe the glory of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, then <hi>you</hi> muſt be the men that muſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him for it. Many wicked men were not found <hi>praying</hi> to be preſerved, much leſs will they be found <hi>praiſing,</hi> when they are preſerved.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Have <hi>you more cauſe to bleſs God for life than others have,</hi> and yet will not you do it? Your life is more ſweet and comfortable to you, than the lives of wicked men are, or can be, foraſmuch as you have thoſe comforts with life, and that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God in life, that wicked men have not: They live only a natural life, and have only the ſweetneſs of natural life, but you with this life have alſo the comforts of an higher life, and yet will not you bleſs God for it? They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the Grave for a while, but not from the wrath of God <hi>too</hi>; from the Grave, but not from the danger of hell <hi>too,</hi> but ſo are you: And have you ſo much cauſe to bleſs God for life, and will you want an heart to bleſs him?</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Is this the moſt effectual way to have life continued to you, and yet will not you do it?</hi> To have life continued will be, to be thankful for it; elſe God (finding you unthankful) when the Plague is over, might commiſſion death by ſome other diſtemper, to take that from you, which you would not be thankful for.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Is not life the ſweeteſt of all earthly mercies, and more to be prized, and yet will not you be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God for it that hath ſo ſignally continued it unto you? Skin for skin, and all that a man hath

What a Mercy is life to <hi>you,</hi> that are not yet certain of the Salvation of your Soules? or, if you are ſure of Heaven, yet is life to you a great Mercy; that you have time to do the Works that God hath appointed you to do.
