            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:11744:3"/>
have heard of a <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Lecture</hi> before now: and shall very shortly heare of a <hi>Crab-tree Lecture</hi> also: But for a <hi>Juniper Lecture</hi> (although the phrase or stile be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, yet the matter is new:) And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it doth take, &amp; is liked so well, I have inlarged it in many places, with many new Lectures
<pb facs="tcp:11744:3"/>
to it: But why is it called a <hi>Juniper Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>? Marry for sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry small reasons; why a Lecture, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Verse, indeed for no reason at all.</p>
            <p>But as the gagling tongue of a scold leapes and skippes (like a Squirrell from one twigge or branch to another, obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither Method or Measure) so doth

this various discourse and description of the good &amp; bad qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of women, skip from the vicious to the vertuous, &amp; back againe from the best to the worst.

<pb facs="tcp:11744:4"/>
extinguished in a yeare or more, which may bee alluded to some revengeful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who being once offended, the fire of their malice will hardly be quenched in their Ashes, or Graves. <hi>Juniper</hi> is hot and drye in the third Degree, (as <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> saith) and the tongue of a scold is altogether combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible:
<pb facs="tcp:11744:5"/>
It is full of prickles, so are a curst womans words very piercing to the eares, and sharpe to the heart. <hi>Juniper</hi> hath also some qualities and vertues of good women, for as it may be used, it is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poison against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one that is enve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed; so a vertuous woman is the honor &amp; preservation of her

husbands person and estate: the Berries &amp; Gumme is likewise good against gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and gnawings in the stomacke; so is a good wife a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable helpe to a mans aking heart: It hath a good savour, and so hath the good name of a worthy woman, the Gumme of it is called <hi>Lachry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> or <hi>Teares,</hi> and for
<pb facs="tcp:11744:6"/>
Teares, women (for the most part) have them at command; but the best is, they are like <hi>April</hi> showres, wet and dry in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <p>IN troth Husband, I can hold no longer, but I must speake: I see you still follow this veine of ill Husbandry, never keepe at home: Is the House a wild-kat to you? here I sit all the day long with the Children, sighing, and looking every minute when you will returne home: yfaith this course
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:11744:15"/>
of life must be left; Doe you thinke I can sell your Wares, or know the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of them when your Customers come? Let them looke to your shop that will, for I will not: keepe your shop, and then it will keepe you: I say, keepe home with a wani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, or else let all goe at sixe and sevens. You begin the weeke wel, for this day, and no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, so soone as you were up, and ready, then to the Ale-house to your companions, to some Game or other for your Mornings Draught of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11744:16"/>
strong liquor: when I (poore wretch) must sit at home with a cup of small Beere of foure shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings price, and be glad of it too, or else I must drinke water: I dare say, and put a Warrant to it, that I may sit at home long enough before you will send me a cup of good drinke, which you guzle downe, making your selves beasts, and not men; for a man, if he had or bore any love to his Wife at all, which hath brought him so many Children, would some time remember her, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11744:16"/>
say, carry this home to my Wife, and remember me to her: but your children and I must bee content with any thing: I would I were dead, that you might have another wife, and then you should see it, shee would not bee made such a foole as I am by you; I am sure I take no pleasure at all like my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Neighbours Wives, for they can goe abroad with their Husbands eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, but I, (poore I) once in a yeare, and glad of it then too. I would I had beene made a man, for Women are nothing
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11744:17"/>
but your Drudges and your Slaves, to make you cleane, and to wash and starch your cloaths: when you goe whither you please, and take no care at all for any thing. A womans worke is never at an end, and never done, but like a wheele, still tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round, and hath no end. I am forced as soone as I rise in the Morning, to make a fire, sweepe the house, and get the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens and your servants Breakfast; no sooner that done, and they out of the way, thinke upon Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; then no sooner Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:11744:17"/>
eaten, then I must make all the dishes cleane againe, and sweepe the House: Then because I would be thought a good Huswife, I sit me downe to spin, then thinke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Supper, and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy what will please your dainty chops, and make it ready against you come home, when you are halfe fox't; then the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren must be straight way thought upon, or else there's nothing but cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and brawling, which makes my braines ake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen. Then all being sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, put the children to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:11744:18"/>
sleepe, then to bed my selfe; and thus a womans worke is never done.</p>

No, I will have a Husband that shall be alwayes provided like a Souldier, never not with standing, but in a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell posture, with his Match lighted, and coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked bolt upright, and ready to doe execution: not like a Dormouse, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sleeping; or like a Droane in the Hyve, live idlely: but I will have a

and rise thus early every day, to worke like a horse, and you to ride a hunting, gentleman-like, every morning, and none but I left at home to look after your horses in the stable, your kine in the field, your swine in the yard, your poultry about the house, your cramming of your Capons, your brewing and your ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king: you a Husband? you a Coxecombe; a meere Lubby, a Moone-Calfe, one that hath more haire than wit: I am sure you were never brought up to take your pleasure
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11744:26"/>
in this manner, I know that: you were brought up at the plough and the Cart, and to cry Hy, Gee, Ho: out you browne bread crust, you know not how to use a woman as you ought; you know better how to Cart a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, than to Court a woman: Goe to, thou thou art an Asse, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of thee when wee are abroad together in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny company; how thou standst a tip-toe to drinke to a Gentlewoman, with your hat in your hand, and makes such a scraping legge, that the print of

thy Hob-nailes is in the Boord where thou stoodst, as if a horse had beene beating his hoofes, the scratches are so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seene: I never saw one more resemble a fellow they call the Lord of <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> that hath a party coloured Coat, than thou; if any one did see you but stand together, they would take you for brothers, you are so alike: thy gray eyes shew that thouart a greedy gut; <hi>Francis</hi> is your name, doe you remember how you fild your Guts so full of Furmatry that day you

were marryed that you were ready to bust again, and how the company were glad to cut the poynts of your britches, and to bathe your belly against the fire with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous grease, or else you had burst in sunder; and now you are mocked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver since with the name ver since with the name of <hi>Francis Fil-gut</hi> Furmitry.

what doe you thinke to cast me off, or else to kill my heart by this your lascivious do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? is this your mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding month?

there are no dogs nights: You shall lie no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I will warrant you, no, I will be no such foole, I will be no more deluded by your faire tongue and smiling lookes: I doe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile what occasion I have given you, or what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse it is that moves you thus to wrong your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bed.

you thus requite mee, to make me a looke out now in my old age, and when gravitie appeares on your cheekes? you should ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give good example and instructions to your houshold-servants, to live honestly and well, but you are quite contrarie from any good rule: thus by your lewd course and company you are made a laughing-stocke to your Neighbours, and I poor woman to be pointed at as I goe along the streete, for bearing it so patiently: if I had given you any cause thus to slight me, you

might have had a just plea; but I was ever willing to obey you in all your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: I little feared this when I was first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, but now I find it too true in an unconstant hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but I will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it any longer; You shall not stirre a foot out of doores, but I will bee at your heeles, and I will so watch you, that you shall have little joy in any wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans company but your wifes.

my deare husband did save it together, and went many a steppe for to get it, with the sweate of his browes: Ah poore husband hee is dead and gone, I shall never forget his kindnesse to mee: hee was the best conditioned man to mee that lived: hee was so kinde and loving, that he never came home empty handed to mee, but stil brought me home one knick knacke or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: oh he was the swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test husband that ever lay by a woman: for if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hee had an occasion to breake winde backwards

when he was a bed, hee would lift up the cloaths, and let it out so sweetly, so sweetly; and thou, thou carest not who heares the report, nor is any whit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed of it, thou art a very sloven, and a nasty beast to him, and art not worthy to carry guts to a Beare; but I must bee content, it was my lot: yet I have some body wil take my part, know it; nay, for all your knitting your browes, and threatning of me, I will not suffer it any longer at your hands, I have put up too much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: tread upon a poore

eight yeares most miserable slavery with him: my habite no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but old and unfashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, my dyet no other than such as hee did eate of, and I bound to no bodies bed but his: but at the last it was my happe to bee at a Gossips Feast, where other good women beganne to talke of many matters, (which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them not much) for it is no right Gossip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping where they flatter not one another to their faces, and back-bite their husbands and neighbours behind their backes: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11744:51"/>
them was an ancient Matron, that with an eye of pittie looked on mee, saying, Mistris <hi>Smalworth,</hi> mee thinkes by your Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and attire, you are grieved in mind, what is the matter? I pray you impart your cause of sorrow to mee, and I will give you such mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Counsell, as my weake ability can afford; what, is your husband un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde to you? or what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disaster is the cause of your heavinesse?</p>
               <p>Whereupon I (fetching a deepe sigh) beganne to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11744:52"/>
tell her, that I had been more than seven yeares married to a wise discreet man, but all the fault hee had was to bee a good husband, and looke to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing so narrowly, that I could not have my will in all that I desired, that I was restrained of that freedome and liberty which I had a minde to have, and debard of that predominance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which women are ambitious to aspire to, though they know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves altogether unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and uncapable of it; for indeede Gossip (quoth
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11744:52"/>
I) I doe want nothing that may suffice any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable body; nor doe I in word or deede offend him; onely the maine rule and command of all I would have: for I would faine controule, and not be controuled.</p>
               <p>With that I beganne to weepe, and the good women all pittyed my case: so that at the last the old Matron said that she was in the same pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament as I was when she was first marryed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till at the last shee met with an ancient experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd creature, who gave
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11744:53"/>
her counsell to make her Husband a foole, if ever she hoped to live a merry life: and further, that she presently gave her the same Counsell which she offered unto mee, which I so well practised on my Husband, (thy Father) that with my vexatious verbosity, fluent loquaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I brought my good man to my bow, that I could bend him which waies I listed, I hammerd him, and made him Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, I turnd him, wrought him, and Wire-draw'd him: and thus after I had liv'd long in a hard and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:11744:53"/>
miserable estate with a wise man, I, with a little good Counsell, and an apt capacity to follow it, in a yeare and a halfes space, with the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, of pride, scorne, and scolding made him a foole, so that now (in good time bee it spoken) I thanke my Starres, there is not a Lady within the Walls of <hi>Europe</hi> lives a more pleasant life than I do. And therefore (daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) I charge you on my blessing never intangle <hi>your</hi> selfe to bee marryed to a wise man; but for <hi>your</hi> owne quiet and delight,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:11744:54"/>
be sure, if you can, to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is a foole al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; for there are many stubborne fellowes as thy Father was, that are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard to be made so; and so if you embrace my counsell herein, you shall (doubtlesse) have greater pleasure, and live at more ease and liberty.</p>

This Lecture may seem strange to as many as are Batchellours, for with them the marryed life is admitted, and wisht for; but I would have them to consider, that after Marriage Huney-moone is but short, and before the Black Oxe hath trod on their foote, they will wish they had tasted the Grape, before they commended the Vine: Beware left in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Sugar you do buy Ratsbane. There's ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a man hath angled for Fish, and catch'd a Frog: Hee may bee thought to bee very unwise that
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11744:63"/>
will change his free liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for fetters of gold, or Manacles of Silver; griefe and torment of minde is <hi>better lost than found; there belongs to marriage more than foure beare legs in a bed:</hi> So likewise <hi>It is hard to wive and thrive both in a yeare;</hi> for though good matches are made in Heaven, yet some men perhaps have few or no friends there at the match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making: There are too many who are more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in seeking their <hi>Banes,</hi> than the Minister is to aske their <hi>Banes</hi> in the Church; for though
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:11744:63"/>
in some cases it is good to take Time &amp; Occasion by the fore-top, yet too often <hi>Haste and Wisedome doe vary.</hi> Indeed, <hi>All is gay that is greene,</hi> and <hi>a new Broome sweeps cleane:</hi> Therefore it is a wiser part of a provident man to be more carefull in the Choise of his wife, than of any earthly thing whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; for though it bee fit that every man should be at his owne Wedding, yet many times the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage were the better if the Woman were away. It is a hard case, that when there are but two, yet
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11744:64"/>
there is one too many. And I heard a fellow say, that his wife had but one fault, which was, that she was naught.</p>
               <p>A man may fast binde, and fast finde, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not unbind that which he hath bound so fast: hee may strike whilst the Iron is hot, and hee may wish that the Forge had been burnt to ashes, and the Anvile sunke in the sea, before he strook a stroke, he may shoote nigh the marke, and aime well, and hit the marke, which had beene better for him to have beene a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11744:64"/>
miles out of his reach: The best Wine will in time bee the sharpest Vineger; &amp; the sweetest Sugar may bee turn'd into Salt Peter.</p>
               <p>Suppose a yong man, that is but of mean estate, doe marry with an old rich Widow, he shall be sure to live in a continuall Purgatory with her; for either shee will be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of him, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, casting him alwayes in the teeth, how shee with her estate hath made him a man, or raised Jack for to be a gentleman, that shee hath set a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:11744:65"/>
on Horse-backe, and (if hee were her servant before, as many widowes doe often marry with their men) then will shee daily upbraide him, that she hath made her foote her head.</p>
               <p>If an old rich man doe Match with a poore yong woman or maide, that hath kinred as poore as her selfe, there the Divell sets in his foote of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie and suspition that his Wife doth waste his goods to helpe her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and if he hath any children, they will love their mother in law, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:11744:65"/>
she will love them againe, (al alike) so that the house will be more unquiet than hell.</p>
               <p>He that doth marry with a whore (although his lot be bad) yet age and time may make her turne honest.</p>
               <p>He that weddes a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken women (as there are too many of them that are most liquorishly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Wine, strong waters, Ale, and the like) there may bee some hope of her mending, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>He that is matched to one that will steale and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:11744:66"/>
pilfer, there may bee hope that shee may bee taken, and by admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or punishment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; or else that in the end the Hangman may take such order with her, that her husband may bee eased of his trouble.</p>
               <p>It is better for a man to have a faire Wife, that himselfe and every man else will love, (provided that shee bee not a scold withall) or a deformed wife, that would hire o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make much of her (for foule water will quench fire as well as
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11744:66"/>
faire) or a drunken Wife, that would make much of her selfe, or an old wife, that were bed-rid of her tongue, or a theevish wife, that should steale from himselfe and others, or a proud one, that would waste all his state in fashions, or a liquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish wife, a daily feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hunter, or a lazy wife, like <hi>Joane Easie,</hi> that lov'd her Bed better than her Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staffe; or a sluttish wife, that would poyson him, and end all his miseries: I say, it were better for a man to marry with any of all these fore-named
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11744:67"/>
wicked kinde of women, than to bee matched and over-matched with a scold, for a scold will be all these, and worse: shee will bee melancholy malicious, and her most study shall bee, to be ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditioned: shee will mumpe, hang the Lippe, swell, (like a Toad that hath laine a yeare under a wood-pile) pout, loure, be sullen, sad, and doged: she will knit the browes, frowne, be wayward, fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, crosse, and unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on purpose to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her husband: her delight is chiefely to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11744:67"/>
make debate abroad, and to be unquiet at home; in her house she will be was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish, peevish, teasty, tetchy and snappish. It is meat and drinke to her to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise her spleene and envy, and with her twittle twattle to sow strife, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, contention, division, and discording heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning amongst her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. I have heard a husband aske a wife such a milde question, and she hath snapt him up so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfully with an answer, that no Mistris would have us'd her prentise boy so scomfully: The
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11744:68"/>
pride of such a Jade is not to be endured, her coynesse is to bee jeered at, and her contempt to be derided, and such of them, are most to bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised, that doe make a seeming shew of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a good life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and when they are at home at dinner or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; whilst the Husband is saying Grace, sitting on one stoole, his vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vexatious wife hath sate upon another stoole by him, cursing and swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Therefore I advise all men, young and old, rich and poore, to marry
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:11744:68"/>
any woman, of any bad condition, rather than a scold.</p>
               <p>There was an old fellow once, that was not onely marryed, but almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched with a shrew, or a most excellent Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall scold, for abroad shee seemed a civill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout creature, as if But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would not melt in her mouth, but at home she would play the Divell, so that the man was amazed at her strange and unci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill behaviour, (and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede a very little wine or strong waters would make her tongue gallop,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11744:69"/>
and her hands walke) her Husband not giving her any cause, did marvaile at her unquietnesse, and gently perswaded her of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but all to no purpose, for the more he intreated, the more proud and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious she would be, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him al the names that are mentioned before in the Lecture, all which he did most patiently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure: but at last she so much trod upon his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, shee presumed that it was his duty to suffer.</p>
               <p>At last (he being loath to beat her) he conceived
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11744:69"/>
to tame her another way, so perceiving that her delight was to have her house kept cleane and neate, with her Brasse and Pewter alwayes shining, and brightly scour'd and set up; one time as shee was in her mad fit, hee tumbled all the platters &amp; kettles about the house, which with the falls from the shelves, were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what bruised and batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but that tricke would not doe; so the next time she abus'd him, hee began another course, and made her believe that he would cut and teare her best wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11744:70"/>
cloaths, both linnen, and woollen, but did smal hurt, he having wit in his anger, yet stil all was to no end; insomuch that shee grew more insolent and used him worse, reviling him beyond all reason and never snffering him to have one quiet day or houre: and at last shee grew to that height, that she would strike him over the face, either at bed or boord, or any where in the house, as the mad fit came on her; so that his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence being tyred, hee would forsake his house, and lodge abroad at some
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11744:70"/>
friends house, sometimes a weeke, and sometimes more; but at his returning home, he found her too often the same mad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shee was wont to be, and he knowing no fault in himselfe, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faire meanes nor foule will reclaime her, (as I did heare him say) he doth purpose to leave her to her divellish dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: because hee is utterly desperate that she is quite past mending.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now againe I will treate a little of some few good women.</hi>

               <p>VVHat, are you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake good man Foxe-catcher? are you in any better humour than you were last night tro? then you had your base Songs and Catches you devis'd when you were
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11744:71"/>
among your Drunken companions: and no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner come home, than to mee you had all the ill names that you could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to bestow upon mee: Well <hi>Kit</hi> well, I see thou wilt never leave these idle courses, till thou brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest all to ruine: thou dost well, dost not, thinkst thou? to goe out so soone as you have din'd so well, and hadst such good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at home, and never thinke of comming home againe, till eleven of the clocke at night, and in this pickle, more like a beast than a man? Thou shouldst
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:11744:72"/>
be ashamed, if thou hadst any shame in thee, that thy Neighbours should take notice of thy folly: You would come home in two or three houres at the most, you told me when you went out: I am sure all the businesse that thou hadst to doe, might have beene done and finished in an houre at the most: What, hast thou no measure, no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, no government in thee, when thou art in company, and a drinking Wine, to give over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till thou art overcome with Drinke? no care at
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:11744:72"/>
all left to forbeare spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thy money, but thus idly to waste thy goods? Me thinkes if thou hadst no love, respect, or regard of mee, yet for thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens sake thou shouldst have some. I marvaile whither you went, or in what new hole you had entertainement, that you could not bee found out: That little meate I had in the house I dressed it, and got it ready for your Supper, expecting your comming home, and here it stood slopping before the fire, till it was hard and dried to nothing;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:11744:73"/>
and so it remained till the Clock strook seven, eight, nine, before I touched a bit of it: Nor could I eate any part of it then for thinking on you: and let me tell you, I cannot eate my meat so alone, and without company; I was never used to it. Then I went with my Child in my armes all about, and did looke in every Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house and Taverne, where I could imagine you might bee: but no fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of my Gentleman: You were sure lost in a Fog, or else you met with some new compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11744:73"/>
that gave you bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter entertainment than either I, or any of your old consorts can do: Well, where did your Worship Sup I marvaile? would I were so happy as to know your new Ordinary; yfaith it should cost mee a few cold words, but I would bee meete with some of your new Hosts and Hostesses; but it is no great matter, keepe it so close as thou canst, Ile warrant thee before it bee long I shall have notice of all: if thou hadst beene in any honest company, or any that wished you well,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:11744:74"/>
or me well, or your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thou wouldst not be loath to tell mee: Well, well, I shall thinke on it, when you least thinke I will.</p>

               <p>SWeet Husband, I am sorry to see you are so vainly given to drinking, and to company: I pray consider with your selfe what injury you doe mee,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:11744:74"/>
and your owne credit by it, and that divers waies. First, you lose your time that is so precious, which you and every man ought to regard, and make use of while they have health and ability so to doe; I am sure you have seene how Time is pictured with a Locke of Haire before, and Bald behind; the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, we must take hold on times fore-locke while we have it, for when he is past, there is nothing to hold by, all bald behind; for when 'tis gone and past, it is not to be recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led againe: <hi>It is good to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:11744:75"/>
make Hey while the Sunne shines,</hi> tis an old Proverbe yet worthy your observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Then secondly, you spend your money, which is the marrow of the Land, and makes you to be so respected and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of all; for without money you cannot have anything, with your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney you may command all things. It is your money which makes you so wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come when you goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Taverne, it is for your money that they bee glad to see yon, and bid you farewell. If you were in necessity, and wanted
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11744:75"/>
money, trust me sweete Husband, there is none of all those places, where you have spent it so idly, that will scarce give you tenne Shillings, nay, scarcely lend it you without a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient pawne: and if you should make your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to them, what will they say doe you thinke? Alas good Sir, or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man such a one, I am sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that you are come to this passe, and driven to this urgent necessity in your old age; you were alwayes free, and very kind-hearted, I pitty your case, alacke aday, I
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:11744:76"/>
have not so much money to spare at this time, for I have newly paid the Brewer, or the Baker, or the Merchant, and I was forced to make bold with one of my Neighbours to borrow of them to make up the summe; This is the comfort and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you shall finde when you have neede of their helpe. I pray remember my words good sweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, for while your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lasts, you shall not want company, or good liquor, but once gone, then good night Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Lord; for a man without
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11744:76"/>
money is like a Pudding without sewet, dry meat; and as old <hi>Hobson</hi> said, it is money which makes my Mares to goe, so it is with them; for without money there is no abiding there: trust you they will not, though (perhaps) they may make you drink, and so bid you farewell; and thus you have <hi>Iacke Drummes</hi> entertainment for all your money. Then thirdly, consider againe my loving Husband, how you abuse the good Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Wine, Beere, or Ale by your extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry drinking, and how
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11744:77"/>
sicke and ill you are the next day, and how unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable you are of your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires and businesse, and can take no true delight in any thing you eate or drinke, whether you walke, or sit still, for two or three dayes after; it is such a bewitching thing, that you cannot leave it when you would: you must thinke you have not a body of Brasse to hold out still; no, you will in time finde the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this drinking o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much: it shortens your dayes, and makes you looke ill, as if you had
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:11744:77"/>
bin buried in a Grave, and taken up againe; doe but consider what detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your health, the aboundance and super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of Wine, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liquid stuffe doth; for you must conceive, your stomacke is the receptacle for all sorts of meate and drinke, and the best of the wine doth disperse it selfe through little veines, into all the parts of the body for its nonrishment; then the remainder of those dregs and grounds, which are left behind in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke causes Vapours to fly up into your braine,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:11744:78"/>
makes your head ake, and there injures the <hi>Pia mater</hi> and <hi>Dura mater,</hi> and so stupifies your Penicrani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, that all your vitall parts and ventricles are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most suffocated, and your life in hazard also: then some dangerous diseases or other followes; as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Agues, Inflamations, Consumptions,</hi> and such Distillations from the Braine, that it will for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after impare your health; then in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to take Physicke, to quallifie and refrigerate the extraordinary heate in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11744:78"/>
you; and moreover, if your Physicke bee not good, and well clarified, the dregs which remaine in your body, will too much coole the Naturall heate, and destroy the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicall moysture; and when those decay, then life farewell: Then if neede require you must breath a veine, and be let blood, and it may be, happen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon an unskilfull Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that cannot doe it handsomely, but mistake the veine; and perhaps when his hand shakes, pricke an Artery; and so lose the use of your arme;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:11744:79"/>
or else perchance make such an Orifice, that hee cannot stench the blood, or else so butcher your arm by often striking, that you faint and sound in the act, and so lose your life: and all this insues by your ingurgitating and exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive drinking of Wine, or such like liquor: for Wine and Tobacco being both hot, doth so heate and burne you within, that it weakens and impaires your strength very much; and especially, Tobacco weakens you; for you may reade these ensuing lines which I dare say an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11744:79"/>
man writ them, and they be true, and he was a Womans friend I will assure you.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11744:80"/>
then it can; it helpes to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuate the superfluity, and purges the Braine when it is over-charged and oppressed; as much as in her lyes: but if you lay too much upon her, the ruine will be your owne in the end, and with losse of life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and lastly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I speake to you and tell you this for your good; you know I have never falne out with you, nor given you any ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, though you came home late, and have bin disguised in drinke; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated <hi>you</hi> to have a care

mee more than all the World besides; if you would but keepe home, I should think nothing too much that I did for you, and by your faire words I would even let out my heart-blood to doe you good.

both in one case) had most plentifull store of hunger and ease; and yet though hee had neither meanes or Trade, hee was so diligent to looke out, that he would make hard shift to be drunke almost every night, and then when he came home, hee would most familiarly, and lovingly kicke mee, calling me Whore, and many other pretty Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names; and sometimes he would play with my haire, winding it about his fist, and kindly draw mee by it all about the house, and withall sometimes he
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11744:111"/>
would embrace mee in great affection (out of his owne good Nature) with a Wand, a Cudgell, or a Ropes end. I being as then not very old, began to take these kindnesses to heart; and (to requite him) I would walke as well as hee, &amp; stay abroad as late, insomuch (that for my better maintenance) I Traded so well, and had such good commings in, that I made him weare an invisible Cuckooes Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his Cap, and if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion had beene he could have made <hi>Hay</hi> with his head, as well as with a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:11744:112"/>
Pitchforke; and I would raise my voyce to him in the chiding vaine, that all the house &amp; street would have rung of it, (for I had a very shrill high voice) &amp; I would talke on purpose to no purpose but to vexe him; for women are not bound to speake sence to sencelesse fooles, nor Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to unreasonable drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Beasts; our best know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (for the most part) is not to be understood in any thing that we meane, say or doe; and yet I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thus much, that a Crowing Hen is better than a Craven Cocke; and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:11744:112"/>
truly if I could have found out but where any good behaviour was to bee had in <hi>England,</hi> I would have had my Husband bound to it as strongly as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell mended his Breeches, when he sowed them with a Bell-rope: hee had a Wife and two Children before he married me, but (as I heard say) hee was a better Husband then to them than to me, for as his house was on fire once, he was so carefull that all should not be burnt, that hee cast his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into a Well, saying he would save somewhat.
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:11744:113"/>
Indeed hee was a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, merry, sad, male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part condition'd fellow, and I lov'd him so deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it strucke him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly with such joy, that after eighteene moneths being married, he dyed of the Pippe; and I hearing that a Projector was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to get a <hi>Monop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly</hi> to have all the Goods and possessions of all such Widowes who dyed with griefe for their Husbands decease; I thought it the safest way to deceive the Projector, not so much as to grieve or shed a teare: And for his sake I vowed
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:11744:113"/>
never to bee married a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And so good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Gossips, I drinke to you all, and you are welcome all.</p>

               <p>IF you perceive her to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease her language, bee sure you give her not a word, good nor bad, but rather seeme to slight her, by doing some action or other, as singing, dancing, whistling, or clapping thy hands on thy sides; for
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:11744:114"/>
this will make her vexe extreamely, because you give her not word for word: And be sure you doe not offer to goe away, but walke still before her, or in her hearing; for if you doe thinke to avoyd her clamour by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, you are deceived; for then you doe but give her breath, and so she will have a Bill os Revivall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you when you come in againe, and so by that meanes will have another fling at your Jacket: and if you must needes goe forth about your occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, beware that shee doe

not meete with you as <hi>Xantippe</hi> the wife of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> did meet with him: for after hee had endured her railing &amp; bitter words for two or three houres together, and slighted her by his merry conceits, she studying how to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of him, as he went out of his house she pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Chamber-pot onhis head, which wet him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; whereupon he presently said, I did think that after so great a clap of Thunder, we should have some shower of raine, and so past it off merrily: but if all will not serve that you
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:11744:115"/>
can doe, to stop her rage, but she will thus every day clamour, then I wish you to buy a Drum into your house, and locke it up in some private roome or Study, that shee may not come at it, and when she doth begin to talke aloft, doe then begin to beate a loud, which shee hearing, will presently be amazed, hearing a louder voyce than her owne, and make her forbeare scolding any more for that time. And at any time if she doe talke or scold, then sing this Catch,</p>
