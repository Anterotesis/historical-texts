            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You may well think me now more deſirous of eaſe and reſt, then when you firſt knew me at <hi>Carthage,</hi> when <hi>Rogatus</hi> was alive, whom you ſucceeded. But, the <hi>Donatists</hi> are too unquiet, who ought to be <hi>Reſtrain'd</hi> and <hi>Corrected</hi> by the <hi>Powers</hi> which are <hi>Ordain'd by God:</hi> We <hi>Joy</hi> already in the <hi>Correction</hi> of many, who ſo earneſtly Hold and Defend the <hi>Catholick Unity,</hi> and Rejoyce in their Deliverance from former <hi>Error</hi>; that we, with great thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs admire them, who formerly, I know not by what force of Cuſtome, could by no means be brought to think of a Change for the better, till, affrighted with the Terrot of the Lawes, they ſet their hearts ſeriouſly to the Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration

of the Truth; leaſt, if they ſhould ſuffer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but for <hi>Stubborneſs,</hi> and <hi>Fooliſh Preſumption,</hi> their Patience would be fruitleſs and vain; and, they ſhould find afterwards no other Reward from God, but the <hi>Puniſhments</hi> due to <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> becauſe they had Deſpiſed his Gentle Admonition and Fatherly Correction; and, by this Conſideration being made Teachable, they found the Truth. Should I ſo farr envy their Salvation, as to endeavour to take off my Collegues, from uſing this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Care, by which we ſee ſo many brought to Accuſe their former Blindneſs?</p>
            <p>Theſe late Enemies of the <hi>Church,</hi> who diſturb'd our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Quiet</hi> with diverſe kinds of Crafts and violent Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, if We ſhould ſo farr Contemn and Tolerate, as not to Provide and Uſe ſome Means to <hi>Terrifie</hi> and <hi>Correct</hi> them, ſurely we ſhould Return <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Evil:</hi> For, if any Man ſhould ſee his Enemy (made Frantick by a high Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor) ſtriving to run down a Precipice, Should he not then rather be Judged to return <hi>Evil</hi> for <hi>Evil,</hi> if he ſhould wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſuffer him to run on to ruine, then if he ſhould take care to bind him faſt from running? And yet he would then appear to the diſtemper'd Man moſt troubleſome, and moſt his Enemy, when he was moſt Merciful, and kind to ſave him: But certainly, when this man had recovered his Health and Wits, he would give him the more Thanks, becauſe he was, as he thought then, ſo ſevere.</p>
            <p>O that I could ſhew you how many, even of the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Troopers, now become very good <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their former <hi>Life,</hi> and miſerable <hi>Error,</hi> whereby they thought, whatſoever they did, through their Unquiet Raſhneſs, was for the Glory of God; who, had never been brought to this preſent ſoundneſs of Belief, unleſs they had been bound like Mad-men, with the Cords of thoſe very Lawes which you find fault with.</p>

                  </gap>tion</hi> of our <hi>Fathers:</hi> Are not theſe to be awakened with fear, or ſmart of <hi>Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments,</hi> that ſo Ariſing from their <hi>Lethargick Sleep,</hi> they may Awake unto <hi>Salvation?</hi> How many are there amongſt us, of them, who, joying now with us, accuſe their former ſloth, and confeſs we did well to moleſt them thus; leſt otherwiſe they ſhould have periſhed by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe</hi> of an <hi>Old Cuſtome,</hi> as by a deadly <hi>Sleep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, theſe Penalties, you ſay, have done ſome no good: What then? Is <hi>Medicine</hi> to be neglected, becauſe ſome Mens <hi>Plague</hi> is incurable? it ſeems you take no notice of any, but thoſe, who are ſo hard, that they cannot receive this <hi>Diſcipline</hi>; of ſuch, the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vain have I ſmitten your Children, they have received no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection:</hi> and yet they were Corrected in Love, not in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. But, you ought to conſider alſo, the many, of whoſe ſafety we Rejoyce.</p>
            <p>If theſe Men were Terrify'd, and not Taught, it might ſeem wicked Tyranny: Again, if they were Taught, and not Terrify'd, they being hardned by old Cuſtome, would be ſlowly moved to take the Right Way of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many, whom we know, when we Manifeſted to them the Truth by <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scriptures,</hi> anſwered us, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be received into the Communion of the Church, but they feared the diſpleaſure of ſome of their Party; Theſe Mens Infirmities muſt be borne with a while, nor may we forget that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 13.36. <hi>Thou canſt not follow me now, but thou ſhalt follow me after.</hi> But when ſound Teaching is added to this uſeful Terror, ſo that the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi> may expel the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of <hi>Error,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:49241:5"/>
and the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Fear</hi> may break the <hi>Bonds</hi> of <hi>Evil Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> we do Joy, as I ſaid, in the <hi>Salvation</hi> of many, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing us, and Praiſing God for making good that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>That the Kings of the earth ſhall ſerve our Lord Chriſt,</hi> by thus curing the Diſeaſed, and healing the Weak. He is not alwayes our Friend who ſpares us, nor he alwayes our Enemy who ſtrikes us: <hi>Better are the wounds of a Friend, then the kiſſes of an Enemy,</hi> Prov. 27.6. It is better to love with Severity, then to deceive with Lenity; It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to take the Bread from the hungry, if feeding him makes him neglect Righteouſneſs; then to give him Bread to continue him unjuſt.</p>
            <p>He that binds a Mad-man, and awakens a Lethargick, is troubleſome to both, but loves both: Who can Love us more then God does? yet he does not only teach us kindly, but alſo profitably terrifies us; To his gentle Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives adding the bitter Medicament of Tribulation: He exerciſed the Pious and Religious <hi>Patriarchs</hi> with hunger, the ſtubborn People with greater Pains. He takes not from the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> the Thorn in the Fleſh, though Thrice intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he might perfect <hi>Strength</hi> in <hi>Weakneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us Love our Enemies, for this is juſt, and Gods Command, that we may be like our Heavenly Father, who makes his <hi>Sun to ſhine upon the good and bad.</hi> But, as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his Gifts, ſo let us think of his Stripes, wherewith he ſcourges every Son whom he loves.</p>
            <p>Think you that no man ought to be Compell'd to Goodneſs? when you read how the Father of the Family ſent out his Servants to Compel them to come in whom they found, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.23. When you read of <hi>Saul,</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Paul,</hi> compell'd by Chriſt himſelf with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to receive and defend the Truth? Is Money dearer to Men then the ſight of their Eyes, yet Chriſt ſtrook him blind, and did not reſtore him to his ſight, till he
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49241:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was Incorporated into <hi>Holy Church</hi>; and, Do you think that there is no Force to be uſed to Free Men from Dangerous Errors, when you ſee God who loves us (no one better) by diverſe Inſtances doing the ſame? and hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaying, <hi>No man comes to me unleſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther drawes him</hi>; which is done in the hearts of all, who turne to God for fear of his diſpleaſure. Have ye not ſometimes known a Thief, ſcattering Meat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sheep, to draw them away and ſteal them; and, a Shepheard with his Rod driving back the ſtrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sheep to the Fold? We read of <hi>Sarah</hi> Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her ſtubborn ſervant <hi>Hagar,</hi> expelling her and her Son; and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, That as then <hi>Iſhmael, he that was after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was after the Spirit, Gal.</hi> 4. So it is now: By which you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the <hi>Church</hi> rather ſuffers <hi>Perſecution,</hi> by the Pride and Wickedneſs of Carnal Men, whom ſhe endeavours to amend by Temporal Puniſhments and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections: Whatſoever therefore the TRUE MOTHER does in this Caſe, though it may ſeem harſh and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe does not render evil for evil, but endeavours, by wholeſome Diſcipline, to expel Sin; not out of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, or deſire to hurt, but out of a love to heal.</p>

            <p>We juſtly complain of you, who account it a Crime in us, to Complain to a Chriſtian Emperour, of the Enemies of our Communion; when as your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors put in a <hi>Libel</hi> to the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> againſt <hi>Caecilian,</hi> and contrary to the Canons of the Church; You Complain'd of him to the Emperour, before he had been Convicted by his Collegues. The <hi>Emperour</hi> proceeding more Regularly, Remitted the Cauſe back to the Biſhops; but, you would not then ſubmit, but appeal'd to the Emperour again; accuſing not <hi>Caecilian</hi> only, but all the Biſhops, whom the Emperour had appointed Judges of the Cauſe; and, when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror had determined, ye would not then yield to Truth and Peace.</p>
            <p>What could <hi>Conſtantine</hi> determine againſt <hi>Caecilian</hi> and his Party, had they been Convicted by their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, but the ſame that he did determine againſt thoſe his Accuſers, who fail'd in the Proof of their Accuſations? He determined in the Cauſe, That the Goods of thoſe who were Convicted of Falſe Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49241:8"/>
ſhould be Confiſcate. If this Sentence had been paſt againſt <hi>Caecilian,</hi> upon your Accuſation and Proof of of the Crimes laid againſt him, you would have been call'd Friends of the Church, Defenders of Peace and Unity: but, when this Sentence is paſt againſt you, who falſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd the Biſhop, and would not be entreated to ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mit to the Unity of the <hi>Church,</hi> you cryed out of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. You Contend, That no man ought to be Compel'd to the Communion of the <hi>Church:</hi> We muſt not return evil for evil. Was it not well ſaid of you long ſince, What we Will, is good and holy? It is not unreaſonable to believe, That <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Decree againſt your Anceſtors is of force againſt you; and, that all Princes, eſpecially the Chriſtian, ought to follow that Pattern, when ever your Obſtinacy compells them to it.</p>
            <p>It is better to be urged to the Embracing of the Truth, by the fear of loſing your Earthly Poſſeſſions, then to be ſuffer'd, by the Temptation of Vain-glory, to reſiſt the Truth. It is no Perſecution to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd to that which is good: It is true, no man can be made good againſt his will; but, the fear of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may make him leave off his Animoſity againſt the Truth, or make him willing to receive the Truth, which he formerly knew not, and perſiſt in it, when he knowes it.</p>
            <p>This would perhaps be ſaid to you in vain, if we could not make it evident by many examples; We know many, not ſingle perſons only, but whole Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that were <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> now become good Catholick Chriſtians, heartily Deteſting their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh <hi>Schiſme,</hi> and as heartily loving the <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> All which were made ſuch

            <p>Theſe Examples propounded to me by my Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legues, made me to change my Opinion, for I was firſt of that Opinion; That no man ought to be Compel'd to the Unity of Chriſt; That this was to be done only by Argument, and Force of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; That Men were to be Convict by Reaſon, not Compel'd by Lawes, for this I thought could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but make open <hi>Hereticks</hi> or <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and Counterfeit <hi>Catholicks:</hi> but, this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I was Convinced to be an <hi>Error,</hi> not ſo much by ſtrength of Argument, as by <hi>Experience</hi> and <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>

            <p>Mine own City, which was formerly wholly <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi> of <hi>Donatus</hi> Party, is now Converted to the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> by the fear of the Imperial Lawes, and do ſo perfectly deteſt their former ſtubborneſs, that you can hardly believe them ever to have been guilty.</p>

How many have been hindered from Communion with the Church by falſe Reports and Slanders of the <hi>Holy Service,</hi> and our Governours?
