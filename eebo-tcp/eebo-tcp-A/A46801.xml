            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>Against the Muses, sure it is a sin</l>

               <l>AS yet I had not known the rage, and force</l>
               <l>Of Love, and Passion, when I took my course</l>
               <l>Unto the Grove where I was us'd to go,</l>
               <l>And passe the time, (wish it had ne're been so.)</l>
               <l>And being come unto the place where I</l>
               <l>Was wont sometimes to walk, sometimes to lie</l>
               <l>Upon the flow'ry banks of Violet,</l>

               <l>(Who could have thought danger should be so nigh</l>
               <l>So sweet a place) when forthwith I began</l>
               <l>To read a while, the story was of <hi>Pan,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>The God of Rural Sports; where Shepherds fell</l>
               <l>In love with Shapherdesses, and to tell</l>
               <l>How some one for his love renounc'd a Crown,</l>
               <l>And spent his time with Sheep upon a Down;</l>
               <l>At which I smil'd, that man should be so vain,</l>
               <l>As from a Prince to turn a Shepherd Swain,</l>
               <l>But note what sudden chance befell, and see,</l>
               <l>I laught 'tis true, ('twas a sad laugh to me,)</l>
               <l>For having scan'd the vanity of love,</l>
               <l>I heard a fluttering noise come from above,</l>
               <l>When presently there lighted on a tree</l>
               <l>A winged-boy, (the fight was strange to me)</l>
               <l>And wondering at the sight, he forthwith took</l>
               <l>From underneath his wings a Table-book,</l>
               <l>And threw it at my feet, saying young-man</l>
               <l>Look well on this and read no more of <hi>Pan,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And saying so he took in hand his bow,</l>
               <l>And shot at me. (I since have felt the blow)</l>
               <l>At which he vanish'd from my sight, when I</l>

               <l>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:57240:10"/>Unclasp'd the Book, I took it to be so,</l>
               <l>But 'twas a Picture-case, the which did show</l>
               <l>A face which I had never seen till then,</l>
               <l>Which made me to admire it's grace, but when</l>
               <l>I'de view'd it o're, and o're, I took the case</l>
               <l>And threw it from me, but the new-seen face</l>
               <l>Had made so deep impression, that I said,</l>
               <l>Crying aloud, I am betray'd, betray'd,</l>
               <l>And rising from the place, I went away,</l>
               <l>Toward my habitation; but stay,</l>
               <l>And see my sudden change, I that before</l>
               <l>Could boast of freedome, presently I tore</l>
               <l>My Book in pieces, and began to cry</l>
               <l>Love, Tharldome, Madam, Passion, Liberty;</l>
               <l>And like a man distracted I began</l>
               <l>To curse the Winged-boy, and call on <hi>Pan,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But as I call'd, I heard a silent noise</l>
               <l>Within the Wood, and after that a voice</l>
               <l>Which came unto my ear, I heard it say,</l>
               <l>What have I seen, what have <hi>I</hi> heard to day?</l>
               <l>And looking round about me I espi'd</l>
               <l>(A sight I have repented) by the side</l>
               <l>Of a small running Brook a Nimph to lie</l>
               <l>Discoursing to her self of destinie,</l>
               <l>I heard her say, wish I had never been</l>
               <l>Abroad to day, or wish I'd never seen</l>
               <l>The Grove, nor Picture, but since it is so</l>
               <l>I will forget it all, and so i'le go;</l>
               <l>And as she spake that word I saw her face,</l>
               <l>The very same the new-found Picture case</l>
               <l>Presented me, when I cry'd out 'tis she,</l>
               <l>She fled and only said 'tis he, 'tis he.</l>

               <l>Quoth he our evils now are more then two;</l>
               <l>For if to windward of that ship we stand</l>
               <l>Then ours will be involved in the Sand</l>
               <l>To Leeward of the other should we fall,</l>
               <l>Undoubtedly we lose ship, men and all:</l>
               <l>For every side ther's danger, should we steer</l>
               <l>Betwixt them both, on every hand ther`s fear;</l>
               <l>Of falling soul, again, if we should trust</l>
               <l>Unto our Anchors, that`s the very worst.</l>
               <l>Well this is to be done (and what de`e think)</l>
               <l>We`le in betwixt them, if we sink, we sink:</l>
               <l>These were his words, and in this very Fashion</l>

               <l>My greif and sorrows quickly did prevent;</l>
               <l>It seem'd to me I saw before mine eyes</l>

               <l>Did post unto her Nine and twentieth Day,</l>
               <l>That day which first gave life unto our KING,</l>
               <l>Was double blessed by his Coming In:</l>
               <l>Should we abuse this mercy, (but 'tis fin</l>
