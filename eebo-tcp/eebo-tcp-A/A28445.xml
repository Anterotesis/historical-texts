            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Much Honoured Friend
IOHN DRYDEN Esq.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE Value I have
ever had for your
Writings, makes
me impatient to peruse all
Treatises that are crown'd
with your Name; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the last that fell into
my Hands, was your <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligio
<pb facs="tcp:55762:3"/>
Laici;</hi> whieh expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
as well your great Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in, as Value for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
a thing too rarely
found in this Age among
<hi>Gentlemen</hi> of your Parts;
and, I am confident, (with
the Blessing of God upon
your Endeavours) not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
to prove of great
Advantage to the Publick;
since, as <hi>Mr. Herbert</hi> well
observes,
<q>
                  <l>A Verse may find him, who
a Sermon flies,</l>
                  <l>And turn Delight into a
Sacrifice.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55762:3"/>
We read in Ancient
Times, before the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Moral Philosophy</hi>
by <hi>Socrates,</hi> that <hi>Poets</hi> in
general were to the People
in stead of their <hi>Sacred
Writ,</hi> from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their <hi>Divinity,</hi> and
Opinion concerning the
<hi>Gods;</hi> as, who, and how,
to be worshipped, how
pleased and pacified, by
what <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi>
together with such
<hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as
were the <hi>Dionysiaca, Cybe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaca,
Isiaca, Eleusiniaca,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:55762:4"/>
the like, Instituted by <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus.</hi>
All which were
built upon this Ground,
That there could be no
true <hi>Poet</hi> but must be Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired; and if Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
inspired, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be believed. This
we find largely disputed
and asserted even by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi>
of best Account
in those Days. But the
two main Arguments in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
them to that Belief,
were; <hi>First,</hi> That extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Motion of Mind
wherewith all good <hi>Poets</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55762:4"/>
in all Ages have been pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
and agitated: And,
<hi>secondly,</hi> The Testimony of
<hi>Poets</hi> themselves, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing
themselves Inspired,
have made particular Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of strange Visions,
Raptures, and Apparitions
to that purpose: So that
as the Beginning, Growth,
and Confirmation of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry
may be ascribed (as
by many it is) to <hi>Poets,</hi> and
their Authority; so also to
supposed <hi>Enthusiasms</hi> and
<hi>Inspirations,</hi> upon which
that Authority was chiefly
<pb facs="tcp:55762:5"/>
grounded. Hence it is,
that many Ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
as <hi>Aristotle, Strabo,</hi>
and others, affirm, That
<hi>Poetry</hi> (in matter of <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
and <hi>Composition</hi>) was
in use long before <hi>Prose:</hi>
which might seem strange,
if not incredible, did we
judge by the Disposition
of later Times; but of
those <hi>Enthusiastick Times,</hi>
not less probable, than
certain, as our Learned
<hi>Casaubon</hi> well observes.
And this I thought fitting
to premise, in Answer to
<pb facs="tcp:55762:5"/>
that Obection which your
Modesty is so apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of, <hi>viz.</hi> That being
a <hi>Laick,</hi> you interpose in
Sacred Matters.</p>
            <p>Rapin (<hi>in his</hi> Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
<hi>speaking of the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Qualities belonging
to a</hi> Poet, <hi>tells us,</hi> He must
have a <hi>Genius</hi> extaordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
great Natural Gifts, a
Wit just, fruitful, piercing,
solid, and universal; an Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
clean and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct;
an Imagination neat
and pleasant; an Elevation
<pb facs="tcp:55762:6"/>
of Soul, that depends not
only on Art or Study, but is
purely a Gift of Heaven,
which must be sustained by a
lively Sense and Vivacity;
Judgment, to consider wisely
of Things; and Vivacity,
for the beautiful Expression
of them, &amp;c. <hi>Now this</hi>
Character <hi>is so justly</hi> yours,
<hi>as I cannot but think that
he described what a great</hi>
Poet <hi>should be, by hearing
what</hi> you <hi>were; and the
rather, since I have been
informed by some</hi> English
<hi>of his Acquaintance, That</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55762:6"/>
Monsieur Rapin <hi>was studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in our Language, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for your sake: Nor
would his Pains be lost.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a Question not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to be decided, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you have been more
serviceable to the Peace of
the <hi>State</hi> in your <hi>Absolom
and Achitophel,</hi> or to the
<hi>Church</hi> in your <hi>Religio
Laici,</hi> or to the <hi>Nobility</hi>
and <hi>Gentry</hi> in the innocent
Recreation of your <hi>Plays?</hi>
A Country-Retirement,
like that of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s, to one
<pb facs="tcp:55762:7"/>
that has led the Spring
of his Age, and Vigour
of his Youth, among the
Noise and Pleasures of the
Town, is certainly a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
no less disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable,
than that which
the <hi>Poets</hi> feign of <hi>Acteon,</hi>
or <hi>Sacred Writ</hi> of the <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syrian
Monarch,</hi> who gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
with the <hi>Beasts</hi> of the
Field; and to abandon a
<hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Society for
the Insipid Dull Converse
of a Country Village,
(where the Nomination
of New Healths is the
<pb facs="tcp:55762:7"/>
heighth of their Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
would render a <hi>Rural
Life</hi> to be no less than a
<hi>Civil Death,</hi> were it not
for <hi>Mr. Dryden</hi>'s Writings,
which keep us still alive,
and, by a most Natural
Representation of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the Town, make
us flatter and fansie our
selves (like the Enjoyment
of a Lover's Dream) to be
still there.</p>
            <p>But I shall wave these
Acknowledgments to you,
as things too general to
<pb facs="tcp:55762:8"/>
be engrossed by me alone:
And will now spend the
Remainder of this <hi>Epistle</hi>
in informing you of the
Occasion of my troubling
you with this small <hi>Piece,</hi>
which I Entitle by the
Name of <hi>Religio Laici,</hi>
from a Treatise of the
<hi>Lord Herbert</hi> of <hi>Cherburie</hi>'s
so called; whose <hi>Notions</hi>
I have often made use of,
and grounded the Chief
of my Discourse upon his
<hi>Five Catholick</hi> or <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Principles:</hi> Wherein
my only Aim is, to assert
<pb facs="tcp:55762:8"/>
an <hi>Vniversal Doctrine,</hi> such
as no ways opposeth the
Religion Established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, and which may
tend both to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of Vertue, and
Extirpation of Vice, as
well as to the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of those <hi>Dissenters</hi>
now in <hi>England,</hi> who have
of late so disturbed the
Quiet of this Realm, and
who, under the Pretence
of Religion, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
all <hi>Governours</hi> but
<hi>themselves.</hi> For, as a late
<pb facs="tcp:55762:9"/>
               <hi>Author</hi> well observes, <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Opinion makes a Sect;
every Sect, a Faction; and
every Faction (when it is
able) a War: and every
such War is the Cause of
God; and the Cause of
God can never be prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with too much Violence:
So that all Sobriety is
Lukewarmness; and to be
Obedient to Government,
Carnal Compliance.</hi> Which
are the Opinions of those
that would rob <hi>Caesar</hi> of
his Due, as well as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
<pb facs="tcp:55762:9"/>
the Peoples <hi>ancient
Land-marks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for my part, as in
<hi>Civil Politicks,</hi> I would
not, in this so <hi>Ancient</hi>
and so <hi>Lineal</hi> a <hi>Monarchy,</hi>
abandon the Beams of so
fair a <hi>Sun,</hi> for the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Expectation of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Company of <hi>Stars;</hi>
so neither, in <hi>Ecclesiasticks,</hi>
do I covet to be without
the <hi>Pale</hi> of the <hi>Church:</hi>
since, though I will not
<hi>Dogmatically</hi> affirm, (as
<pb facs="tcp:55762:10"/>
some do) That <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>
is <hi>Jure Divino;</hi> yet
(with the <hi>Lord Bacon</hi>) I
say, and think <hi>ex Anim,</hi>
That it is the nearest to
<hi>Apostolical Truth,</hi> and the
most coherent with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy:</hi>
Wherein, I know,
you will not differ from
me.</p>
            <p>And therefore, <hi>Sir,</hi> at
this time, when the <hi>Name</hi>
of <hi>Christ</hi> is made use of
to palliate so great Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies
and Treasons, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb facs="tcp:55762:10"/>
the Pretext of <hi>God's
Cause,</hi> against both <hi>King</hi>
and <hi>Government,</hi> I thought
I could do no less than
snatch up all <hi>Weapons</hi> that
might defend the <hi>Publick,</hi>
and hope I have not
lighted upon one with a
<hi>double Edge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have endeavoured
that my Discourse should
be onely a Continuance
of yours; and that, as
you taught Men how to
<hi>Believe,</hi> so I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
<pb facs="tcp:55762:11"/>
struct them how to <hi>Live.</hi>
For, as Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> well
observes, Though <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
is the <hi>Fort</hi> or <hi>Citadel,</hi>
yet <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Moral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty</hi>
are its <hi>Fences</hi> and
<hi>Out-works,</hi> whereby alone
it is teneable. Wherefore,
I designed this Treatise of
mine to be onely an <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi>
or rather the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence</hi>
of yours; encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging
Men to Live up
to the <hi>Vertue</hi> of that <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
you teach. Which,
with your Pardon for the

present, and Friendship for
the future, is the highest
<hi>Ambition</hi> of,</p>

               <head>The Occasion of this Treatise.</head>
               <p>THere is not any Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
hath given me
greater trouble, than
when I think, That a
Doctrine so necessary, as the
Knowledge of God, with the
true Way to serve and worship
him, together with the Means
to attain everlasting Salvation,
should be so variously deliver'd
and taught in divers Ages and
Countries; as also urged in such
perplext and difficult terms;
(which by the many Volumes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55762:13"/>
of this Argument, in several
Languages, may appear;) and
after all this, yet to find it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to me under such terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Menaces and Execrations,
as if, among the many Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
in the World, I did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to the right, (which each
claimed to be theirs) I could
not justly hope for salvation;
but, on the contrary, expect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Torture, without any
prospect of Relief.</p>
               <p>Being therefore in this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and dangerous condition, I
did at last conclude with my
self, that one of these two things
was to be done:
<q>Methods of Enquiry into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That (notwithstanding
the Affronts and Threats where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55762:13"/>
with the Priests on every side
would deter us from all other
Religions, as well as Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Promises, and comfortable
Doctrines, by which they
would draw us to their own, in
any particular Church,) I was
bound, either to study with an
impartial mind, not only all
the several Religions; but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Controversies amongst
them in divers Ages, Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and Countries. And for this
purpose, not only to acquire
the Tongues used heretofore,
or at this present time through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Universe: But also to
read the several Authors that
have written upon these Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and together with them
to confer those Learned men,
who (though they had not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
any thing in writing)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55762:14"/>
might yet be no less able to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
me, than the former. Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> To fix upon some
Fundamental Articles agreed
upon by all that I could meet
with, and consider afterwards
how far they might conduce to
my salvation.</p>
               <p>The former of these two I
soon perceiv'd to be impossible;
for, whose private Affairs at
home, or publick Duty to his
Native Country, will permit
him to take such Journies to all
the Quarters of the World?
Whose Estate or Revenue will
furnish him with Money for so
long and great an Undertaking?
Or whose Constitution is of that
strength and ability, that, were
he to escape all the Dangers he
must inevitably meet with,
could yet undergo so immense a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55762:14"/>
travel and labour? Whose Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
could either contain all
the Works of the several Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
and Religions; or Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
decide the different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and Faiths pretended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Authority of so many
great Churches? which course
yet unless he pursued to the
end, he could not with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
say he had performed his
Duty. For since the determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
finally of any matter of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
where Parties are not
heard on all sides, is not only
against common Reason, but
contrary even to the ordinary
practice of Justice in all other
cases; he must think himself, in
that the most important and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
business that can befall
Mankind, obliged to make as
particular and exact a search
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55762:15"/>
and examination of Religions,
as is possible.</p>
               <p>But here we will suppose,
that after diligent Enquiry, one
might learn what was taught in
this or that Country, under
some general Notions; (though
no where sufficiently, according
to all the Tenents, Rites, and
Ceremonies taught or practised
amongst them,) yet how could
the knowledge of any one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
alone give him satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
especially when he should
find it controverted in some
other Country, and where as
able men, at least in all other
points of Learning, might in
great numbers be found? Shall
he, because his Birth or Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enclines him to one Country
or Religion more than another,
so factiously embrace it, as to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55762:15"/>
think no other to be good or
acceptable to God, where men
do the best they can to serve
him, and live well? Must he
prejudge all other Religions as
erroneous and false, when as
yet he hath not heard what
they can alledge for the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of their Faith? No; but
too too many are guilty of this
Partiality; for that, <hi>till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Spirit of Judgment to
discern the right way, every way
is thought to be wrong, but that
which we are brought up in:
And pious Education doth the
same in this latter Age, which
Miracles did formerly;</hi> as the
Learned <hi>Gregory</hi> well observes.</p>
               <p>Howbeit, because something
here must be attempted, lest
we should seem wholly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
our selves, I did in my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55762:16"/>
conceive nothing so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for my purpose, as to look
upon those Countries chiefly
from whence all other Learning
and Sciences did originally flow;
which consideration, as it
brought me to those Provinces
wherein the <hi>Greek Tongue</hi> did
anciently flourish, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in it self alone almost all
humane Literature: So, when I
found the Inhabitants thereof
in so miserable an Estate, that
there was little more than Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Captivity and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risme
amongst them, I did not
think fit to insist there; since,
however their wits might be
as excellent now as in former
times, they seemed to want
not only the Means which
might enable them to find out
any Learned Truth, but even
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55762:16"/>
the heart to believe it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did their Ancient or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
universally taught Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(being <hi>Ethnick</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi>)
any way affect me there, or in
any Country else: since being
now intermitted, and disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
for many Ages, I could
not but think it built in great
part upon weak and uncertain
Principles, more especially in
those Points, which are now
wholly antiquated and abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>From hence therefore I cast
mine Eye upon <hi>Italy;</hi> as the
Country wherein, not only
all the Ancient Learning of the
<hi>Greeks,</hi> but also of the <hi>Romans,</hi>
was carefully preserved and
taught; But as here again I
found almost all they produced
in point of Religion to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55762:17"/>
among other Nations
in <hi>Europe,</hi> with much acrimonie
and Bitterness; and that besides
among the several Opinions and
Sects the subequent times have
brought forth, the latter for
the most part have dissented
more from them than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
insomuch that the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
hath departed more from
them than the <hi>Protestant,</hi> and
the <hi>Protestant</hi> than the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi>
I could not so safely rely
upon them, as not to enquire,
why the Tenents of the <hi>Church</hi>
of <hi>Rome</hi> are so much deserted?
But as here again I found my
self intangled in Controversies,
I thought fit to make a pause
before I engaged my self too
far in those Tumultuous and
uncharitable Disputes. And the
rather, because I found that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55762:17"/>
even the knowledge of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Sects of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
alone, took up more time
in the study of them than I
could possibly hope to obtain,
altho' I should live beyond the
ordinary age of man; so that
whereas I thought my self ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
for the discharge of my
Conscience to study not only
all Religions that have been
or are in the World, I found
the <hi>Romanish</hi> Religion in its
divers Sects alone of greater
Intricacie, than that I could by
any Reason or Authority dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
or unty the many Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
or Knots in them: since
flying somtimes from <hi>Reason</hi> to
<hi>Faith,</hi> and then again from
<hi>Faith</hi> to <hi>Reason,</hi> with a singular
agility in both, I found my
self unable to follow them in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55762:18"/>
any one certain way. I confess,
that if they had adhered singly
to either of these two, nothing
could have scandalized me;
since that which was delivered
upon <hi>Reason,</hi> I should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and finally accepted
upon the same ground: and as
well should I have believed
those Points of <hi>Faith,</hi> which
were delivered me upon the
Reverend Authority of the
<hi>Church;</hi> especially, when it
could have been proved, that
any former <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
had under their hands and
Seals, or in any other Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
manner subscribed, as eye-Witnesses
to that they consign'd
unto Posterity, and not as
Hearers only; it being of great
moment in the affirmation of
things past, to set down what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55762:18"/>
they knew certainly, and to
come afterwards to what was
told them by others, which
they again had from others, and
so perhaps from many descents;
especially, if such things were
related, as neither they from
whom they heard it, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any mortal man by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Means could know. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would it be sufficient to
say, that their <hi>Knowledge</hi> was
<hi>Supernatural</hi> or <hi>Divine,</hi> since as
that is more than could be
known in following times, so,
when it were granted, it would
inferr little to me, but that
which I would believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it: For if any under the
name of a <hi>Prophet</hi> should bid
me do a Sin, or be Impenitent
for Sins done, I should not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
him, though he pretended
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55762:19"/>
a thousand <hi>Revelations</hi> for it:
And on the other side, if he bid
me be Vertuous and Penitent,
though he had not any shadow
of <hi>Revelation</hi> for it, I should
give entire Credit to him.</p>

               <head>The Validity of Revelation

               <p>That therefore the Certainty
of that Doctrine, which is called
<hi>Revealed,</hi> or the word of God
in any Age or Country, comes
not to me simply either from
the Authority of him that said
the holy Spirit did so dictate
the word to him: No, nor
from the Authority of them
that believed it: (how many or
great soever:) but from the
Goodness of the Doctrine it self;
without which, I should believe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55762:19"/>
but little in any extraordinary
kind. Every man, in what Age
or Country, that teacheth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
speaks the word of God
to me; and if the Contrary,
he shall never make me believe,
he knoweth God, or heard him

               <head>Four several kinds of Revelations.</head>
               <p>The Learned <hi>Tostatus</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
four several ways whereby
God is said to have made Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
in former times; as
for Example: <hi>First,</hi> when God
and his Angels assumed a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
shape, as when he appeared
to <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 6. and to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah</hi>
and his Wife, <hi>Judg. 13. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55762:20"/>
When he was not seen,
but only heard, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 7. and
when he called <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam. 3.
Thirdly,</hi> When he wrought on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the Imaginations of
men, sleeping or waking; as
when God told <hi>Abimelech</hi> in a
<hi>Dream,</hi> that he was a dead man,
for taking away another mans
Wife, <hi>Gen. 20. Fourthly,</hi> and
<hi>lastly,</hi> When God raiseth the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
to know those
things which otherwise he
could not know, either by a
kind of Extasie, or without;
and of this kind was <hi>Paul</hi>'s rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into the <hi>third Heavens;</hi>
at which time it may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
whether the Soul remained
in the Body or no.</p>
               <p>Having thus now recited his
several kinds of <hi>Revelations,</hi> it
will be necessary in the next
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55762:20"/>
place to enquire, whether there
might not be Fallacies in all
these ways? And when there
was no Fallacy, whether their
Proof was not only by single
Witnesses? The <hi>Popish Clergie</hi>
(in such a case) will tell us,
That we must believe reverent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of things delivered to us in
<hi>Holy Writ,</hi> for that they have
neither Errour nor Fraud in
them: And if that does not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
you, they will then tell
you, you must come to them
for a further Answer: Not
considering, that if the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
should require the same credit
to be given to their <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
upon their own single Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,
how we should do to
shake them off: the same Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
lying for us to believe the
one, as the other, both equally
depending on <hi>Faith.</hi>

               <head>A Dialogue concerning Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</head>
               <p>Therefore in the first place, I
should demand in a Rational and
Judicial way, how I could be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that the <hi>Priests</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a <hi>Revelation,</hi> and what
was the time, place, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
thereof? In Answer to which,
I conceive the <hi>Priests</hi> would tell
me; That <hi>Laicks</hi> ought not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to enquire into such <hi>Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
than becomes them; that if
this their <hi>Revelation</hi> were not
accepted as an unquestionable and
necessary Truth, there could be no
cause thereof, but an <hi>obdurate
heart,</hi> and want of <hi>Divine Grace</hi>
in me; that if the <hi>Sacerdotal
word</hi> might not be taken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Truth</hi> of the said <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:55762:21"/>
there was no other way to
inform me thereof: It being <hi>Gods</hi>
manner to speak to his beloved
Servants, and not to such gross
<hi>Sinners</hi> as I was; and to be
<hi>brief,</hi> that if I did not give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
credit to this <hi>Revelation</hi> of
theirs, it was for want of <hi>Faith:</hi>
And therefore, that no better
counsel could be given me, than
to pray that all obstructions
might be taken away, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of my <hi>heart</hi> of <hi>stone,</hi> that
I might receive an heart of <hi>flesh,</hi>
such as may be capable of this
<hi>heavenly Illumination. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
They would reply nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the <hi>time</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of
their <hi>Revelation,</hi> but only in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
say, that the <hi>Place</hi> was
<hi>God's holy Temple,</hi> where none
could be partakers of the <hi>Word
of God,</hi> but such only as were
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55762:22"/>
his near Servants, and did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
take their rest and sleep
therein.</p>
               <p>Now to this I should Answer,
That if I might not know the
<hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner,</hi> when and how
this their <hi>Revelation</hi> was made,
I would yet gladly be informed,
what <hi>Language</hi> was used betwixt
them, and whether the <hi>words</hi>
were of <hi>God's immediate inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
or that there were only cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Notes</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> in
use betwixt them, whereby they
understood one another? Or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
if they had not a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<hi>Language</hi> betwixt them,
which was intelligible; whether
<hi>God</hi> spake the ordinary <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi>
of that Country, and in
what <hi>Tone;</hi> whether the same
were <hi>lowder</hi> than <hi>Thunder,</hi> or
only the <hi>ordinary heighth,</hi> or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55762:22"/>
whether <hi>lower</hi> yet, by some <hi>close</hi>
or <hi>secret expression,</hi> somewhat
less than a <hi>whisper?</hi> To which
I believe the <hi>Priests</hi> would <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi>
That if a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Magistrate</hi> did send me a
<hi>Message</hi> or <hi>Command</hi> by some
one of his <hi>known Officers,</hi> I
would not then presume to make
all these <hi>Questions,</hi> they being
not only uncivil, but also imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and derogatory to the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that they who were known
<hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> did, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
further account, require Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
from me in his <hi>Name.</hi> But
notwithstanding all this, I should
again take the boldness to ask
them, (supposing they heard such
words) how yet they could know
that <hi>God</hi> spake them, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they were so familiar with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55762:23"/>
the person of that <hi>God,</hi> as to
know him by his <hi>Voice,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
him from all others?
How they could assure themselves
firmly, that it was no <hi>inferiour
Spirit</hi> that gave them this <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi>
there being <hi>Spirits</hi> of both
sorts, both <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> which
use to deliver <hi>Oracles</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi>
of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who founded
their Opinions upon that sentence,
viz. <hi>that the Devil is the God of
this world.</hi> But again, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it was a <hi>good Spirit</hi> that
spoke, whether <hi>Camillus,</hi> or his
<hi>Boy</hi> who waited on him in the
<hi>Temple,</hi> did hear or understand
the <hi>Voice</hi> as well as himself?
Here I know the <hi>Priests</hi> Answer
would be, That neither himself,
nor any else could come to the
knowledge of <hi>God's</hi> Will, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55762:23"/>
by their means and conveyance:
And for the rest would again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
my Obedience, on peril of
my being condemn'd as an <hi>Infidel;</hi>
thinking by these words at least
to overawe me.</p>
               <p>But this would be so far from
terrifying me, that it would but
put into my head more Scruples,
concerning the Truth of their
<hi>Revelation?</hi> when pursuing my
way, I should gladly demand of
him, how yet I could be assured,
that in the repeating of this their
<hi>Oracle</hi> or <hi>Revelation,</hi> they had
omitted no part thereof through
forgetfulness; or added any thing
to it by a <hi>Paraphrase,</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi>
And <hi>briefly,</hi> whether
nothing were interweaved or
changed therein?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Priests</hi> would here assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
reply, That it was but a
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55762:24"/>
prophane part in me to doubt any
thing were either added to, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi>
much less any thing mixed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
with it: and that the
same <hi>God,</hi> who gave them this
<hi>Revelation,</hi> did and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it entire in their memory;
for further proof whereof, they
were ready to set it down, and
sign it under their Hands and
Seals, that so it might be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to Posterity, as an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
Record:</hi> To which also,
the <hi>Amanuenses</hi> or <hi>Coppiers</hi> of
it might repair to correct all
that should be depraved, either
by their carelesness, or wilful
perversion of the Sense thereof,
that so their Errors might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
be rectified, attested and
subscribed by sufficient Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as agreeing with the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55762:24"/>
there being no other Means
so good to ascertain us <hi>Laicks,</hi>
that nothing therein was counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which Method (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess)
if it had been used in all
<hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> where <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velations</hi>
are said to have been
made in private to <hi>Priests,</hi> would
have been much approved; since
<hi>Copies</hi> of <hi>Copies,</hi> through many
Descents, may be subject to many
<hi>Corruptions,</hi> especially among
those who would draw all things
to their own <hi>Interest;</hi> which
might as well have become these
latter Times, as the former; since
our Modern <hi>Priests</hi> (for the most
part) turn <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Faction,</hi>
striving to render all others of
different Perswasions (though in
the least matters) odious. Which
Bitterness of Spirit we find not
evidently remarked among the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55762:25"/>
                  <hi>Heathen Priests;</hi> so that how
Ignorant and False soever they
were, yet are they not recorded
to have been <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> and
<hi>Persecutors</hi> of one another even
unto <hi>Death,</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> and
<hi>Conscience</hi> sake: No, they had
no such <hi>hellish</hi> Contrivances as
the <hi>Parisian</hi> and <hi>Hibernian Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sacres;</hi>
no such Instruments of the
<hi>Devil,</hi> as <hi>Ravilliac, Clement,</hi> and
the <hi>Priest</hi> that poyson'd our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Monarch</hi> in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi>
no such <hi>Traiterous Conspiracies</hi>
as the <hi>Powder-plot:</hi> Nor did
they use to convert one another
to their Opinions by <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi>
and <hi>Rosting Kings</hi> alive,
as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did in the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
He that compares but the
Behaviour of those of the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
among the <hi>Heathens,</hi> with the
Carriage of our <hi>Popish Bishops</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:55762:25"/>
here in <hi>England</hi> before the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
as related by our own
<hi>Christian</hi> Writers, would take the
<hi>Heathen Priests</hi> for much the
better <hi>Christians</hi> of the two.</p>
               <p>So that, notwithstanding all
this, I should not give the <hi>Priests</hi>
over so, but at least tell them, I
could have wished they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
more clearly with me; since
the more they debased my Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
in <hi>Divine Mysteries,</hi>
the more was I obliged to stand to
my <hi>Common Reason,</hi> until they
had made all things manifest or
intelligible to me, without going
about to convince me of <hi>Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
because I <hi>believed</hi> not more
than I <hi>understood:</hi> or when a
further <hi>Belief</hi> were required, I
hoped they would not charge me to
believe it any otherwise than as a
thing possible, or at most but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55762:26"/>
since this was all I could do,
when God had given me no suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Revelation</hi> for the confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theirs. And to affirm it a
good Plea in the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
to say, That a Man began at
the <hi>Faith</hi> that was taught in his
<hi>Native Country;</hi> Who might not
then excuse himself for adhering
to the <hi>grossest Superstition</hi> that
can be imagined in any <hi>Age</hi> or
<hi>Country</hi> whatever, where no less
Esteem and Veneration was given
publickly to their <hi>Sacerdotal Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege,</hi>
than is now paid to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>Spain.</hi> Finally, therefore, I
should ask them, How any <hi>Priest</hi>
could assure and satisfie my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
that the <hi>Revelation</hi> made
to him did so concern me, that I
must embrace it as an undoubted
<hi>Axiom,</hi> or <hi>Truth?</hi> To which (I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55762:26"/>
am confident) they would answer,
as formerly, That they had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
their Duty in delivering
<hi>Gods Word,</hi> and that I ought to
take heed lest I be severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for want of <hi>Faith,</hi> and so
leave me, after having with much
<hi>gravity</hi> expressed their <hi>sorrow</hi>
for my <hi>incorrigible stubborn
Heart, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, notwithstanding all this,
I do not yet deny, but that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations</hi>
may be made to Men
either <hi>sleeping</hi> or <hi>waking;</hi> but
where, I suppose, (as we find in
<hi>Holy Writ</hi>) earnest <hi>Prayers</hi> have
been made before-hand, and
some <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>miraculous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation</hi>
of the thing <hi>revealed</hi>
hath followed. However, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
the thing in it self be right
<hi>good</hi> and <hi>honest,</hi> I should not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it was <hi>God</hi> that spake, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55762:27"/>
some <hi>Evil Spirit</hi> that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me; it having pleased
God so to implant the Love of
<hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>Soul,</hi>
that he hath made them a part
of <hi>Common Reason,</hi> and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
by their own <hi>Light;</hi> from
which therefore if we recede,
we shall find our selves cast not
onely into much Errour and
Darkness, but even in the Court
of our own <hi>Consciences</hi> criminal
and condemned: For which
Cause also I believe <hi>God</hi> is so
sparing in making publick <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,</hi>
because if Men did
wholly trust to them, it might
be a means of making them
neglect their proper Duties. <hi>It
would be</hi> (as the Learned <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in his <hi>Posthuma</hi> observes) <hi>a
Stumbling-block to the</hi> Gentiles,
<hi>when they found it read in</hi> Osea,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:55762:27"/>
                  <hi>that God commanded a</hi> Prophet
<hi>to commit Adultery: and in</hi> Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,
<hi>that he taught his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
how to cozen the</hi> Egyptians:
<hi>How could they believe</hi> (saith he)
<hi>that there was no</hi> God <hi>like the</hi>
God <hi>of the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>when they
should find in the Scriptures,
that even this</hi> God <hi>had also a</hi>
Right-hand <hi>and a</hi> Son? <hi>Or that
if he had been so much better
than those of the</hi> Heathen, <hi>was
it likely that</hi> Aaron <hi>his own</hi> High
Priest, <hi>would have preferred their</hi>
Apis <hi>or</hi> Egyptian Calf <hi>before
him?</hi> But the Reason of all this
is, because to <hi>unenlightned Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
these Passages might seem
inconsistent with the Attributes
of the <hi>Deus Optimus Maximus;</hi>
and for that (as our aforesaid
Learned Author well notes)
<hi>all ways of</hi> Religion <hi>would seem
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55762:28"/>
strange, but that we are taught
betimes to fear: and till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a Spirit of Judgment to
discern the Right way, every Way
is thought to be Wrong, but that
which we are brought up in.</hi> And
thus much for <hi>Publick Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>

have been said to do <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi>
whose <hi>Egyptian Doctrines</hi> I
yet should never believe. I
might say something also of
<hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus</hi> and <hi>Simon

be believed to have done <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>)
did yet not teach any <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal

               </p>
               <p>Wherefore, it is no good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

did</hi> Miracles, <hi>and therefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
all he saith:</hi> Since those

               <p>In like manner should their

as little to any <hi>New Religion;</hi>
since one shall hardly meet with
a <hi>Prophecy</hi> delivered so clearly
and so perspicuously, as to mark
out and distinguish from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
any Person or Event in
subsequent Times. For my part,
as I could never yet esteem any
thing to be an undoubted <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,</hi>
which in the first place
was not like a <hi>Picture,</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is not enough to describe
or Paint one Member or Part of
the Face or Body, unless the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
and other Parts were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
represented with the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Stature, Colour, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion:)
so likewise I should not,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55762:31"/>
much regard the Exterior Form,
if his Actions were not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to future Times in such
manner, as the <hi>Prophecy</hi> might
be like an <hi>History,</hi> wherein it is
required that the <hi>Time, Place,</hi>
and <hi>Manner</hi> of all his Actions
should be described so particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as to distinguish the whole
Course of his Life from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
And that therefore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the doubtful and obscure
<hi>Predictions</hi> that have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to divers, who from
thence have acquired the Names
of <hi>Prophets,</hi> seem to be little
more than bold Conjectures,
which might in some Age or

nothing, I will not say,
<hi>likely</hi> or <hi>possible,</hi> but even <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,</hi>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55762:31"/>
will not have its Effect and
Fulfilling. Wherefore, if any
Man hath undertaken hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
or shall yet in this Age un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to <hi>Prophesie,</hi> upon what
vain ground soever, yet if he
get that Credit among future
Ages as to be thought a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,</hi>
he will find those that
shall apply his Words to some
Action or Event that did or will
(in all likelihood) follow;
which Motives made me as
doubtful of their <hi>Prophecies,</hi> as
of such <hi>Miracles</hi> and <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
I formerly mentioned. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopaeus</hi>
is said to have put forth
Books which spake plainer of
<hi>Christ,</hi> than the <hi>Prophets</hi> of the
<hi>Old Testament</hi> did; which our
Learned <hi>Criticks</hi> have neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
rejected as <hi>spurious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Heavenly Bodies</hi> had out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55762:32"/>
Worship given them from
the Excellency of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
but the <hi>Heathen Priests</hi>
had their chief Credit from their
<hi>Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Predictions:</hi> who
contented not themselves with
the perswading the People that
they had <hi>Revelations,</hi> unless
they could perswade them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that they could foretel
things to come, and so acquire
to themselves the Name of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</hi>
The manner of <hi>Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
among the <hi>Jews</hi> was by

               <p>Judgments made of future

<hi>Predictions</hi> made from <hi>Natural
Causes,</hi> are, without all question,
not onely lawful, but commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable,
although of little certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But the cunning <hi>Artists</hi>
the <hi>Priests,</hi> who in <hi>Egypt</hi> were
anciently <hi>Astrologers,</hi> used to
mingle with their <hi>Divinations,
Lies</hi> of their own Invention,
whereby they acquired more
than by their <hi>Truths.</hi> The word
for <hi>Divinations</hi> in general is
<hi>Mantike,</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Phaedro</hi>
derives from <hi>Munike,</hi> signifying
<hi>furious</hi> or <hi>mad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The difference between <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:55762:33"/>
and those that were in
<hi>Ecstasies</hi> or <hi>Trances,</hi> was this:
The <hi>Prophets</hi> were said to run
up and down raging and crying,
whereas the <hi>Extotekoi</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
devoid of Sense and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
seem'd little less than
dead, till they awaked out of
their <hi>Trances;</hi> wherein also they
remained so long, that they had
time enough to devise some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which might delude the
People. By this kind of <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture,
Mahomet</hi> did often prevail,
when he arose from his <hi>Fits</hi> of
the <hi>Falling Sickness.</hi> Also from
these sorts of <hi>Raptures</hi> ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it may be supposed the <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
Narration of the <hi>Elyzian
Fields,</hi> and their <hi>Separate State
of Souls after Death,</hi> together
with their manner of <hi>Reward
and Punishment,</hi> were at first
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55762:34"/>
devised, and then vented to the
People. Neither have the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
Times been without such
Saints, (I mean not the true and
holy ones:) but some that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to <hi>Sanctity,</hi> have in their
<hi>Ecstasies</hi> (whether counterfeit,
or not) feigned that they had
seen <hi>Souls</hi> in <hi>Purgatory;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Legend</hi> will inform you
more.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless, It is observed,
that the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, having
many more <hi>Faculties</hi> than what
the Representation of Worldly
Objects can excite or call up,
and sometimes freeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from their usual Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the Objects they
meet with in this Life, ascend to
the <hi>Contemplation</hi> and even <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>
of <hi>Divine Objects,</hi> making
themselves thus capable of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55762:34"/>
knowing not onely things past,
but those that are to come: to
which kind of <hi>Ecstasie,</hi> whether
<hi>St. Paul's Rapture</hi> into the <hi>third
Heavens</hi> may be referred, I leave
to others to judge. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
we read of divers strange
and incredible <hi>Ecstasies</hi> that have
hapned to Men in this kind: as
(not to mention our Modern
<hi>Voyages,</hi> which speak of <hi>Indians</hi>
that in their <hi>Trances</hi> will disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what Ships are coming to
their <hi>Islands,</hi> and from what
<hi>Ports,</hi> many Months before
their Arrival;) the like hapned
of old to <hi>Pamphilus</hi> the Son of
<hi>Neocles,</hi> who (as <hi>Plato</hi> saith)
lay ten days in a <hi>Trance,</hi> and
afterwards told Wonders. But
to credit these things is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and not
of <hi>Common Reason;</hi> from whence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55762:35"/>
I cannot recede, or build any
new <hi>Doctrine</hi> upon such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports;
especially, when there is
no Divine Authority like the
Scriptures for it, nor Original
Attestation, that the <hi>Prophecy</hi>
was consigned unto us in those
very Words wherein they are
now extant; and for the rest,
that they are more obscure than
that an unquestionable Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
may be built upon them.
But herein I am content to let
every Man use his own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and therefore shall quit
this Subject with one Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is, That by reading
<hi>Mother Shiptons Prophecies</hi> when
we are <hi>Boys,</hi> we do the better
rellish <hi>Nostredamus</hi> when we
are Men: especially since every
vain-glorious <hi>Expositor</hi> of such
<hi>Prophecies</hi> looks upon himself
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55762:35"/>
as little less than a <hi>Minor-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now All these Points having
been for a long time debated and
examined by me, to the best of
my Understanding, I did think
fit the rather to study and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
out those <hi>Common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
of <hi>Religion</hi> I could any
where meet with; onely before
I undertook this great Task, I
thought it not amiss to advise

nothing but matter of
<hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Belief</hi> concerning
Things past, questioned in any
Age or Country; so did I the
more easily pass by it, to come
to those <hi>Articles</hi> which were
grounded not onely upon <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

of all Men, which are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd

erroneous <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and (I am
sure) most deeply engraven in
mine. Which being done, I
thought it my Duty to inquire,
Whether by an apt Connexion

so solid a Foundation, that I

(as the <hi>Romans</hi> call them)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:55762:38"/>
were introduced to the <hi>Worship</hi>
of the <hi>Supreme God;</hi> yet that
there is no Universal Consent
or Agreement concerning them,
but that a pure and untainted
Mind, (as being conscious in it
self of no Unworthiness) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with a Virtuous and Pious
Life, (testified by the Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Goodness and Charity to
all Men) and accompanied with
<hi>Love, Faith,</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> in <hi>God,</hi>
were undoubted ways of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him: <hi>sit pura mente colen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus.</hi>
The Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and
Modern <hi>Christians</hi> have many
<hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> common
with the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> which is more
than vulgar <hi>Divines</hi> do ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine.
Most of the <hi>Jewish Laws</hi>
and <hi>Rites</hi> were practised indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
among the <hi>Heathens,</hi>
or at least did not much vary
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55762:39"/>
from them, as the diligent Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
into <hi>Antiquity</hi> well know.
The <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as well as the <hi>Jews,</hi>
held the most substantial Parts
of <hi>Moses</hi> his Doctrine, without
differing in much more than
certain particular Laws, more
proper for that Country than
any other; as, their not eating
<hi>Swines Flesh,</hi> and making <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
Death. If it be said, That
that Precept in the <hi>Decalogue</hi>
(against <hi>Graven Images</hi>) was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
to the <hi>Jews;</hi> It will be
found a Mistake: for that the
<hi>Persians,</hi> and otheir neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Nations, concurred therein,
as well as the <hi>Jews;</hi> as also in
most of their other <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi>
Thus <hi>Feriari Deo</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a kind of keeping a
<hi>Sabboth, &amp;c.</hi> amongst the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens:</hi>
And <hi>St. Austin (lib.</hi> 20.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55762:39"/>
                  <hi>ch.</hi> 19. against <hi>Faustus</hi>) saith,
That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not so
grievously lapsed into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of <hi>False Gods,</hi> but that they
retained the Opinion of <hi>One
True God,</hi> from whom every
Nature whatsoever is derived.
<hi>Finally,</hi> Whatsoever tends to
Mans Perfection, is eminently
and primarily in <hi>God:</hi> But the
<hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Providence, Wisdom,
Justice, Mercy, Love, &amp;c.</hi> tend
to his Perfection; <hi>Ergo,</hi> Hence
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> took their Rise
from themselves, as believing
that they were <hi>Gods Children,</hi>
and made after his <hi>Image.</hi>

and Sacrifices.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Fourth Article:</hi>
Tho <hi>Sacrifices</hi> for the abolishing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55762:40"/>
of Sin of more than one sort,
as also <hi>Expiations, Lustrations,</hi>
and divers other <hi>Rites</hi> invented
by the <hi>Sacerdotal Order,</hi> were
used for the <hi>purging</hi> of Men from
<hi>Sin;</hi> yet was there no <hi>Vniversal
Consent</hi> or Agreement concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them. But that <hi>Repentance</hi>
is a certain Sign of <hi>Gods Spirit</hi>
working in us, and the onely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
for Sin that is declared
publickly to all Mankind, and
the most rational way to return
to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Vertue,</hi> is by Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Consent established every
where, without so much as the
least Contradiction. Not that
I think <hi>God's</hi> Justice can be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
by meer <hi>Repentance,</hi> and
turning to a good Life; but
that a further <hi>Satisfaction</hi> or <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
for our Offences against
the <hi>Divine Majesty.</hi> is required.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55762:40"/>
Yet as there is no Universal
Agreement concerning the
Means how this is effected, (it
being of greater Scrutiny than
Mans Reason can attain unto)
so I shall in part wave this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse;
and the rather, for that
many do not see why (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ordinary Rules of
Justice) God should punish one
Man for the Sins of another:
or, to go further, for that Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our own Nature, which
without our Consent was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon us? To which,
give me leave to add these few
Remarques. 1. <hi>Decipimur spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
recti:</hi> We have not
a true Judgment of<note place="margin">of Good and Evil.</note>
                  <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad;</hi> esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many things Evil, which in
themselves are not so. An Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
drawn in a Picture may
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55762:41"/>
have in it Representations of
Battels, Slaughters, Drunkards,
Harlots, and Firing of Cities,
Shipwracks, or the like; and
yet may be as lovely a Piece of
Painting, as if it represented an
<hi>Assembly</hi> of <hi>Divines:</hi> And so,
perhaps, in a Natural Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
may be thought an Age
that produces such Actions, as
well as if it brought forth none
but Examples of <hi>Vertue</hi> 2. We
denominate <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from our particular Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest;
so that perhaps our <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
may prove but <hi>False Money,</hi>
of no <hi>intrinsick Value,</hi> although
it bear the Stamp of our Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
upon it. 3. A Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
is the primary Appetite
of Nature in all things; and so
as we judge any thing more or
less agreeing or contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55762:41"/>
so are we more or less incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
or averse thereto: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
our Will, either for or
against any thing, to do or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
any thing, doth always
follow our Judgment; which
Judgment is framed by several
things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Temper of our
Brain, &amp; our Education, together
with the various Encounters,
Successes, and Experiments in
the Course of our Lives: all
which (it is manifest) are not in
our own power, but proceeds
from the Temper of our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
the Diet, Climate, and
Customs of our Country, with
diversity of Occurrents and
Conjunctures of the Times;
which are produced with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
Interventions of one
another, in a continued Series of
<hi>God's Providence</hi> in the disposal
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:55762:42"/>
of them, and of such <hi>Idea's</hi> as
he thereby sets before our Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.
'Tis apparent that he does
thereby lead and guide all our
Thoughts, Words, and
Actions;<note place="margin">Of Predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Free will.</note> yet not by
any violent Protrusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but by our own
Consent, either by way of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
or as to the lesser Evil; and
ever by Opinion, whether true
or erroneous. So that our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
not being violated, but led
on by our own Choice, we just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
become liable to Praise or
Blame, and yet are in all our
Ways under the Infallible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of God. 4. As our <hi>Body</hi>
is a Portion of the <hi>Body</hi> of the
<hi>World,</hi> so is our <hi>Spirit,</hi> which
guides and acts us, a <hi>Beam</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit of God;</hi> which also, tho
in its own Nature clear, yet is
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:55762:42"/>
that Clearness in us more or
less, according to our Temper
whereinto it shines: Thus we
find our selves of different Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
when we are Phlegmatick,
or when our Blood is Black and
Gross, from what we are when
our Blood and Brain is Pure and
Thin; and accordingly our
Judgment grows more or less
perspicacious and rectified; and
by consequence the Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Will better or worse:
yet therein no violence is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
us. <hi>Spiritus in Nobis non
manet in Identitate, sed recens
ingeritur, per renovationem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuam,
sicut flamma, sed velocio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
transitu, quia res est spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lior.
Nos enim quotidie facti
sumus ex iis quae transeunt in nos:
morimur &amp; renascimur quotidie,
<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eque iidem hodie &amp; heri sumus:
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55762:43"/>
&amp; personam quam transeuntem
non sentimus, tandem pertransisse
agnoscimus. Nulla est autem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
transitio in nos nisi per viam
Alimenti: Omne Alimentum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectu
Alimentandi est consimile &amp;
debilius: Alimentantis corpus
succrescit nobis in corpus; spiritus
in spiritu: non tamen proportio
utriusque fit nobis ad proportionem
cibi &amp; potus, aut aeris, nisi a nobis
bene superantur; aliter etenim non
alunt, ingesta, sed opprimunt si
fortiora sunt, corrumpunt si dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia,
idque plus minusve pro gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du
in utroque: Ideoque quo melius
res procedat multa fieri oportet:
primum prudens electio &amp; mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
eorum, quae ingerenda sunt;
&amp; deinceps debita praeparatio
per artem, ut nobis similiora &amp;
debiliora fiant: ex parte nostri
praecipuum est exercitium fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55762:43"/>
sed modicum, quo calor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis
vigeat.</hi> Again, The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of our Judgment from
outward Occurrences is also of
great importance to present us
with new <hi>Idea's,</hi> which divert
us this way or that way, and so
into Mischief or Preservation,
yet always by our own <hi>election:</hi>
As for example, A Man going
to <hi>London,</hi> perhaps finding the
way dirty, leaves it, and takes
into a Bie way, whereby he mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
<hi>Thieves,</hi> who were then on
the <hi>Road,</hi> although he knew not
of them; or, perhaps, lights
upon another Mischance in this
Way, which he had missed in
the other: Here is <hi>God's Conduct</hi>
of him, either to his <hi>Good</hi> or
<hi>Harm,</hi> leading him by that
<hi>Idea</hi> of avoiding Dirt, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Compulsion,</hi> and by his <hi>Free
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55762:44"/>
Election;</hi> wherefore he cannot
complain but of himself: Yet
<hi>God</hi> did undoubtedly from all
Eternity both <hi>foresee</hi> and <hi>decree</hi>
this <hi>Election,</hi> with the Event
which should follow thereon.
For thus <hi>God</hi> doth ever manage
us by the Temper of our <hi>Body,</hi>
with his inoperating Spirit
therein; and by meeting us
from without in such Encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Occurrences, as will
infallibly carry us by our own
<hi>Choice</hi> into such things as from
all Eternity he had ordained.
5. Some will here object, That
if God gives us to <hi>will</hi> or to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,</hi>
and that it were not in our
own <hi>power</hi> to <hi>will</hi> or to <hi>refuse,</hi>
then how could we be praised or
punished for ought we <hi>do,</hi> or
neglect to <hi>do?</hi> To which I <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,</hi>
Just as well as it befals us
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55762:44"/>
for having <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood:</hi>
Our having <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi>
makes us subject to much <hi>Pain</hi>
and <hi>Pleasure;</hi> and yet this our
<hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> was
given us of <hi>God,</hi> when we had
no power to refuse it: And if
we put our Finger or any Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Creature by force into the
<hi>Fire,</hi> it. will smart and suffer as
much, as if it had gone in by
its own desire; for the ground
of its <hi>suffering</hi> is not in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>willing,</hi> or <hi>unwilling,</hi> but in
its <hi>disagreeableness</hi> to <hi>Fire.</hi> And
so when a Man takes into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched
intemperate Courses,
he falls into Diseases; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God or himself drive him,
that is not the Point; the true
Cause is, the venomous and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive
Humours which by
these Courses he puts into his
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:55762:45"/>
Body, destructive to its own
Nature. 6. <hi>And lastly,</hi> It was
well said of one, who having
contrived and put in execution
a great and politick Business,
and being asked, Whether it was
his own Care, or Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that had brought this
great Work to pass? he replied,
<hi>Fuit certe Providentia. Divina,
sed quae per me transiit.</hi> For if
we should see a <hi>Sun-beam</hi> in at a
Hole enlightning a <hi>dark Room,</hi>
'twould be a very shallow Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
to suppose that this
<hi>Beam</hi> did move or enlighten
one way or other, otherwise
than as it self was continually
enlightned and carried about
by its <hi>Original</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> from
whom it can never be separated,
nor have any Vertue apart:
And the very same Relation
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55762:45"/>
and Condition has each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Man's <hi>Spirit</hi> with the
<hi>Spirit of God. Dei opus sumus
nos parentibus instrumentis; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onesque
nostrae Dei sunt opera in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentis
nobis, sed per electio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
nostram agentibus: Ista vero
electio per aptas conjuncturas &amp;
Ideas adeo immissas invitatur &amp;
regitur: ideoque nos Creatureae
sumus momentaneae aeterni Dei
apparitiones, quas tantum terris
ostendunt fata, nec ultra esse si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunt:
veluti effigies in Auleis.</hi>

                  </gap>, or <hi>Divinum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid,</hi>

but our Capacity not being able

either upon <hi>Elementary Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>
do; or upon <hi>Geometrical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions,</hi>
as the Modern <hi>Descartes</hi>
doth. But notwithstanding we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55762:46"/>
are thus to seek, yet the most
probable Conjecture of the
<hi>Anima Mundi's Operation, is,</hi>
That <hi>per Condensationem &amp; Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refactionem
partes Mundi Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reoe
fiunt Spiritus, &amp; spirituales
fiunt corpora, sicque aeterne retro

cum Mundus a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cosmo

give me
leave to offer these few Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
following, which may
perhaps not be impertinent for
the directing of us in this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he generally finds
Men sin rather out of this Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
than out of any desire to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his <hi>Divine Majesty. Thirdly,</hi>
That if Man had been made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
prone to sin, and yet
destitute of all inward Means
to return to him again, he had
been not onely remediless in
himself, but more miserable than
it could be supposed an <hi>Infinite
Goodness</hi> did at first create, and
doth still perpetuate Humane
kind. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That <hi>Man</hi> can
do no more on his part, for the
satisfying of <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> than
to be <hi>heartily sorry</hi> and <hi>repent</hi>
him of his <hi>Sins,</hi> as well as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
through his Grace to
return to the Right way, from
which through his Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he had erred: Or if this did
not suffice for the making of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55762:47"/>
his Peace, that the <hi>Supreme God,</hi>
by inflicting some Temporal
Punishment in this Life, might
satisfie his own <hi>Justice. Fifthly,
and lastly,</hi> That if Temporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in this Life were too
little for the Sin committed,
he might yet inflict a greater
Punishment hereafter in the
other Life, however, without
giving <hi>eternal Damnation</hi> to
those, who (if not for the love
of Goodness) yet at least upon
sense of Punishment, would not
sin eternally. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
since these things may
again be controverted, I shall
insist only upon this one <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
acknowledged Proposition,</hi>
viz. <hi>That Repentance is the onely
known and publick Means which
on our part is required for satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
the Divine Justice, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:55762:47"/>
returning to the Right way of
serving God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>As to the Fifth and last Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
Of a Future Reward or Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:</hi>
Tho concerning the
Place, Quantity, Quality, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or Duration of Reward or
Punishment after this Life, there
is no universal Consent or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement;
yet that the <hi>Souls</hi>
of Pious, Vertuous, and Good
Men enjoy a better State after
this Life, and Vicious Wicked
Men a worse, is universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
by all Religions,
hardly any of the <hi>Indians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted;
it being congruous to
Reason, and the Notions we have
of Divine Justice, that Good
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55762:48"/>
Men (especially those who were
afflicted in this Life) should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their <hi>Reward</hi> hereafter, as
well as that Wicked Men (who
were happy here) should have in
the next World condign Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Which I say, because
there is no other Universal Rule,
whereby to guide our Belief
concerning God's Justice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
but that his Punishment
is proportionable to the Offence:
whilst <hi>Reward</hi> passing all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
is given to us, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
according to his acceptation
of our pious Endeavours and
Actions, but also according to
the Extent and Latitude of his
Infinite Goodness and Mercy,
in Creating, Redeeming, and
Preserving us.</p>
               <p>Now these <hi>Five Points</hi> may
be matter of great Joy to all
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55762:48"/>
Men; since hereby they may
perceive, that the <hi>Vniversal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God</hi> hath proceeded
thus far in giving Means for
<hi>Salvation</hi> to <hi>all Mankind,</hi> and
therein declared himself <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
Pater.</hi> Neither can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
so much as any one <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle</hi>
more in <hi>Common Reason,</hi> that
could make Man <hi>better,</hi> or <hi>more

            <div type="section">
               <head>Merits and Satisfaction of others.</head>
               <p>I did perceive indeed divers
Points added hereunto, which
gave much ease and relaxation
to Mens Minds, while they were
taught to trust chiefly to the
Merits and Satisfaction of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for the obtaining of their
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55762:49"/>
Everlasting Happiness; so that
although the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Good
Works</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
inculcated into Mens
Minds, yet it may be found,
that they did not usually so
much fix themselves there, as
on the aforesaid Satisfaction;
while they said, all their <hi>Works</hi>
were corrupt and abominable,
and that (of themselves) they
could not so much as think a
good Thought; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pretended to <hi>Heaven</hi> out of
an <hi>Implicite Faith</hi> and <hi>Belief</hi>
that this Business was done to
their Hands, rather than out of
those Works they seemed so
much to disclaim: Like two
<hi>Apprentices,</hi> both of equal Parts,
and bound to the same Master
and Trade; when, nevertheless,
one of them, for want of any
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55762:49"/>
other Relief, depending wholly
upon his Trade, follows it dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently,
and grows vastly Rich;
whereas the other (his Fellow-Prentice)
having an Expectation
of some Paternal Estate of Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
does so much depend
thereon, as makes him not only
neglect his <hi>Trade,</hi> but fall into
those vicious Courses, as makes
him out-run his Estate before he
has it: And the contrary is
rarely seen, tho not impossible.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Again,</hi> I did find in others a
<hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Predestination</hi> so
taught, that Men did chiefly
trust to <hi>God's Eternal Election</hi> of
them before all <hi>Worlds:</hi> For, as
they said, there was a certain
<hi>Mass,</hi> from which <hi>God</hi> (out of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55762:50"/>
his <hi>good Pleasure) chose</hi> some,
and <hi>reprobated</hi> others. And
these Men I noted to be rather
inquisitive (through the help of
their <hi>Teachers</hi>) whether they
were of the Number of the
<hi>Elect,</hi> than studious to work out
their <hi>Salvation</hi> by the good
Degrees above related: So that,
although their Teachers did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
exhort them to a <hi>Good
Life</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> no less than
the former, yet as Men derived
not the next Causes of their
<hi>Salvation</hi> from their own <hi>good
Endeavours</hi> or <hi>Actions,</hi> so much
as from the <hi>Secret Counsels of
God;</hi> so they commonly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
much of their proper
<hi>Duties,</hi> as believing either they
could not fall grievously, or at
least that such Remedies are
provided for them, as they
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55762:50"/>
should not finally perish; From
whence one may observe, that
<hi>Vertue</hi> hath suffered no small
Detriment thereby.</p>

            <div type="section">

               <p>Notwithstanding all which, I

Works merit any thing of <hi>God,</hi>
(any more than a <hi>Subject</hi> of

his forbearing to commit <hi>Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>

Men may assure themselves,
that when really they do the
best they can, it were better to
trust <hi>God's Infinite Mercy</hi> for the
<hi>acceptance</hi> of those <hi>Good Works,</hi>
joyned with <hi>Faith in</hi> and <hi>Love
to God,</hi> than to draw Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Certainty of their

                  <hi>Salvation</hi> from those secret and

            <div type="section">
               <head>Remission of Sins.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover,</hi> I found others,
who, though they did not say
they could tell who were <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated,</hi>
but, in stead thereof,
recommended <hi>Good Works,</hi> as
the most effectual Means on our
Parts for the coming to <hi>God,</hi>
did yet otherwise teach divers
things, which, being not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understood, derogated not a
little from the Severity of <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi>
For, (as they said) they had
Power to <hi>remit Sins;</hi> and this
<hi>Remission</hi> (again) was granted
upon no very difficult Terms:
Men did not fear to return to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55762:51"/>
                  <hi>Sin</hi> again, when they found
<hi>Pardon</hi> so easie. Which Abuse,
as also some of those above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
I conceive rather to
proceed from the <hi>proneness</hi> of
Men to <hi>Sin,</hi> than from the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
of their <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
I could enlarge my self
much upon this <hi>Argument,</hi> but
that I am unwilling to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress
my Bounds, especially since
I believe my self sufficiently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
Besides, I find I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
speak more of these several
<hi>Doctrines,</hi> without entring into
<hi>Controversies,</hi> and making use of
those <hi>Polemical Weapons,</hi> and
engaging into such a <hi>Spiritual
Warfare,</hi> which as a <hi>Laick</hi> I
mean never to trouble my self
with. However, I hope I may
so far express my self, as to wish
all those <hi>Points</hi> that concern
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:55762:52"/>
                  <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Forgiveness of Sins,</hi>
in any extraordinary way, (on
what Side soever) may be wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught, and on such Terms,
that upon what <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Doctrine</hi> soever present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Mankind, nothing may
be detracted from that <hi>Vertue</hi>
and <hi>Goodness</hi> which ought to be
the perpetual <hi>Exercise</hi> of our
<hi>Life;</hi> lest occasion be given to
make Men more ready and bold
to <hi>sin</hi> again: since while Men
attend chiefly to those <hi>outward
Helps</hi> or <hi>Remedies,</hi> they usually
comply not so entirely with
their proper <hi>Duties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these <hi>Five Articles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus declared, which, if
Men did embrace, would alone
assert a <hi>Catholique Church;</hi> and
it being likewise demonstrated
how Necessary it is for every
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55762:52"/>
Man to begin there, before he
descend to the whole <hi>Context</hi> or
<hi>Bulk</hi> of any one <hi>Religion,</hi> which
he may find controverted in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<hi>Ages</hi> and <hi>Countries;</hi> I shall
now deliver the Reasons for
which I principally embraced
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
open and manifest Way
extant to Mankind, whereby it
is possible to establish <hi>God's Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Providence,</hi> which yet is
his <hi>highest Attribute.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That I find nothing
can be added to them, which
will make a Man really more
<hi>vertuous</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> than the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<hi>Five Articles</hi> or <hi>Points,</hi>
when they are sufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated
in Mens Hearts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That however the
<hi>Doctrines</hi> added thereto were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55762:53"/>
comfortable and full of
Promise to those who believe
them; yet, since I observed in
general, that Men took occasion
thereby to grow more bold in
Sinning, I began to doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they did not derogate from
the Severity of <hi>Vertue:</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
I found that those Points
were more controverted, than
that the Age of any one Man
could untie and dissolve the
Intricacies in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That I found all
<hi>Mysteries, Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi>
tended chiefly to the
Establishment of these <hi>Five Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi>
as being at least the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
End for the Which those
<hi>Rites</hi> were ordained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, and lastly,</hi> That I
thought the <hi>doing</hi> some <hi>good
Deed, speaking</hi> some <hi>good Word,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:55762:53"/>
or <hi>thinking</hi> some <hi>good Thought,</hi>
were more necessary Exercises
of my Life, than that I should
omit them for any Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Having thus therefore setled
these <hi>Five Points,</hi> as <hi>Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
and together demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
that we ought to give
them the first place in our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
I shall come to that
<hi>Supplemental</hi> Part, called <hi>Faith,</hi>
which Word (as I find among
<hi>Authors</hi>) is used in two divers
Senses, and thus distinguished:
<hi>First,</hi> As it is understood to be a
firm assent given to Things
past, upon the Credit and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of others. And, <hi>second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
As it is taken for a <hi>Faculty</hi>
of the <hi>Soul,</hi> laying hold and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it self on <hi>God's Providence</hi>
and <hi>Goodness</hi> hereafter, if we do
the best we can.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:55762:54"/>
Where we must observe;
That as the <hi>first Faith</hi> hath its
next or most immediate Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>money
from Man, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
is true or false, as they
who first affirmed it were: So
the <hi>second Faith</hi> is by all <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi>
held necessary to be used
as the best means for the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of our <hi>Souls</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> when
true Piety and a Good Life do
concur; insomuch as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
this <hi>latter kind</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>
may be found in good Men, tho
no <hi>Tradition</hi> of former times e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come to their Knowledge:
Whereas the other <hi>Faith,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
chiefly on <hi>Revelations,
Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Prophecies,</hi> hath in
it many Difficulties, as I have
said before, and is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
among the stricter
<hi>Proselytes</hi> of it, but in a manner
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55762:54"/>
rejected by those <hi>Nations</hi> among
whom other <hi>Faiths</hi> have been
taught by their <hi>Lawgivers;</hi> for
all <hi>Faiths</hi> have been shaken, but
those only which stand upon
the <hi>Basis</hi> of <hi>Common Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Notwithstanding</hi> all which, as
I thought, it concerned me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
those several and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
<hi>Traditions,</hi> (which were
not impossible to have been true,
if <hi>God</hi> so pleased,) not to distrust
and doubt of all, <hi>Wherefore</hi> I
applyed my self chiefly to the
<hi>Christian Faith</hi> contained in the
<hi>Holy Bible,</hi> as having in it more
exact <hi>Precepts</hi> for the Teaching
us a <hi>good life</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi>
than any other Book whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that I could meet with: and
besides I found my self (through
<hi>Gods Providence</hi>) born in the
<hi>Christian Church,</hi> and instructed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55762:55"/>
even from my Infancy in the
<hi>Holy Doctrines</hi> drawn from
thence. But as together I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
many things taught in
the said <hi>Church,</hi> which were not
only vehemently opposed by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Christian Churches,</hi> but also
repudiated in their chief parts
among other <hi>Nations:</hi> So, I
found no such solid <hi>Foundation</hi>
to build this my <hi>Faith</hi> upon,
as the <hi>Authority</hi> in general of
the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> resolving
according to the saying of a
Learned <hi>Father, That those things
I never had known without the
Church, I never had believed
without it.</hi> Neither did the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
among them much
move me, since being a meer
<hi>Laick,</hi> I had neither Will nor
Leisure to engage my self in the
clearing of those doubts; the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55762:55"/>
scruples of those variously a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated
disputes by Men equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Learned, being of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricacy,
that I saw more and
more might be said about them,
than that I should presume to
determine any thing by the
Judgment of the best Authors
I could peruse on either side:
So that for my <hi>final resolution,</hi>
I thought the best <hi>grounds</hi> of
my <hi>Faith</hi> ought to be taken
from those points which were
piously assented to by all <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi>
and might aptly consist
with my aforementioned <hi>Five
Articles;</hi> But for the <hi>disputes</hi>
and <hi>controversies</hi> of Learned
Men, to lay them aside, until
they were agreed amongst
themselves; and in the mean
while to attend a <hi>good life,</hi> and
<hi>repentance,</hi> assuring my self, that
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55762:56"/>
in the quality of a <hi>Laick</hi> or <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Person,</hi> my time was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
imployed so, than in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable
<hi>subtleties</hi> of the <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
To conclude, I embraced
the <hi>five Catholick Articles</hi> for the
Reasons above mentioned; from
whence coming to the <hi>Doctrines</hi>
of <hi>Faith,</hi> I believed piously,
upon the <hi>reverend Authority</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> that which was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously
taught by them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any contradictions: All
which I have here set down,
with no intention to scandalize
any, but only to give a Reason
as well of those <hi>Points</hi> which
may be known, as of those
which are already believed in
the <hi>Christian Religion:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
to induce men by these <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi>
to the <hi>Practice</hi> of a <hi>good
life,</hi> and blessed concord among
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55762:56"/>
themselves; since having joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
received these <hi>five Catholick
Points,</hi> there will be less occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of hate and dissention about
the rest: So that the <hi>different
Opinions</hi> amongst them might
be argued with less <hi>violence</hi> and
<hi>passion,</hi> the <hi>Points</hi> wherein they
are agreed being greater <hi>bonds</hi>
of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Amity</hi> among them,
than that they should be dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on any lesser occasion. And
<hi>certainly,</hi> unless the <hi>Method</hi> I
have here proposed be effectual
to this purpose, I see no hope
that any good Reconciliation
can follow among the <hi>Principal
Sects</hi> of the <hi>Christian Religion;</hi>
since the one <hi>affirming</hi> the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi>
to be the <hi>sole Judge</hi> of
<hi>Controversies,</hi> and the other say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the <hi>Church</hi> alone should
determine them, they seem like
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55762:57"/>
persons in variance, who disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing
about their <hi>Arbitrators</hi>
or <hi>Judges,</hi> are hopeless that the
business in Question between
them should ever come to a <hi>just
Tryal,</hi> and find an indifferent or
equal Decision. Now upon all
that hath been said, give me
leave to raise these few <hi>Queries,</hi>
and so conclude.</p>

<hi>uncertain</hi> in their <hi>Explications,</hi>
so that unless a Man read all
<hi>Authors,</hi> speak with all <hi>Learned
Men,</hi> and know all <hi>Languages,</hi>
it be not impossible to come to
a clear <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>all Doubts?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6. Supposing all <hi>true</hi> in their
<hi>Originals,</hi> and in their <hi>Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Whether</hi> yet they be so
good for the instructing of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
that bring <hi>Pardon</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi>
upon such easie Terms, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55762:58"/>
the Business is done to our
Hands? And,</p>
               <p>7. <hi>Whether</hi> this <hi>Doctrine</hi> doth
not derogate from <hi>Vertue</hi> and
<hi>Goodness,</hi> whilst our best Actions
are represented as Imperfect
and Sinful, and that it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to keep the <hi>Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
so as <hi>God</hi> will accept our
<hi>Actions,</hi> doing the best we can?</p>
               <p>8. <hi>Whether</hi> speaking <hi>good
Words,</hi> thinking <hi>good Thoughts,</hi>
and doing <hi>good Actions,</hi> be not
the just Exercise of a Mans Life?
Or that without embracing of
the foresaid <hi>Five Principles</hi> or
<hi>Fundamentals,</hi> it be possible to
keep <hi>Peace</hi> among Men, that
<hi>God</hi> may be well served?</p>
               <p>9. <hi>Whether</hi> the foresaid <hi>Five
Principles</hi> do not best agree with
the <hi>Precepts</hi> given in the <hi>Ten
Commandments,</hi> and with the <hi>Two
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55762:58"/>
Precepts</hi> of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> viz. <hi>To
love God above all, and our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
as our selves?</hi> As well as
with the Words of <hi>St. Peter,
That in every Nation he which
feareth God, and worketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
is accepted of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>10. <hi>Whether</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of
<hi>Faith</hi> can by <hi>Humane Reason</hi> be
supposed or granted to be <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,</hi>
unless we are infallibly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that those who teach this
<hi>Doctrine</hi> do know the <hi>Secret
Counsels of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>11. <hi>Whether</hi> all things in the
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> (besides the <hi>Moral
Part,</hi> which agrees with our
<hi>Five Principles</hi>) such as <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on the <hi>History,</hi> may
not be so far examined, as to be
made appear by what <hi>Authority</hi>
they are or may be received?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:55762:59"/>
12. <hi>Whether</hi> in <hi>Humane Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
any one may or ought to be
convinced by <hi>one single Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
so far as to believe things
contrary to, or besides <hi>Reason?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>13. <hi>And lastly, Whether,</hi> if it
were granted they had <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
I am obliged to accept of
anothers <hi>Revelation</hi> for the
<hi>Ground</hi> of my <hi>Faith?</hi> Especially
if it doth any ways oppose these
<hi>Five Articles,</hi> that are grounded
upon the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Law of Nature unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</note> which is <hi>God's

Enacted by the

the <hi>beginning</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and
therefore not to be destroyed or
altered by every <hi>whiffling Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi>
of an <hi>Enthusiast.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Finally,</hi> Submitting this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55762:59"/>
                  <hi>Reader,</hi> I shall conclude

<hi>That all those who lived accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
