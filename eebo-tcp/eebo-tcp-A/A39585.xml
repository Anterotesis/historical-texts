         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
NARRATIVE
OF THE
Iriſh Popiſh Plot.</head>
            <p>SInce we have manifeſtly found by woful experience, That
the Princely favours, and tender proceedings of His late
Majeſty towards the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> proved altogether ineffectual to
contain them within the bounds of Loyalty and Duty, but
ſtill they ſuffer themſelves to be led blindfold into fatal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
by the pernitious Counſels of their Prieſts, the World
may eaſily believe (by their proceedings in the laſt Rebellion) that
their deſigns are always on foot, and tending to no leſs than the
utter ſubverſion of the Engliſh Government in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
the Power in the hands of their own Natives and Religion.
For confirmation hereof, we need not look back ſo far as the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of that <hi>Franciſcan</hi> Fryar, one of their Council, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared,
That the Seſſion of Parliament held at <hi>Dublin,</hi> being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued
in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1641, and the time drawing nigh for putting their
deſigns of ſurprizing <hi>Dublin-Caſtle,</hi> and all other places in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Engliſh, into execution, there was a grand conſult, or
meeting of the Romiſh-Clergy, and principal Lay-men of their
Faction, appointed to be at the Abbey of <hi>Multifarvan</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Weſtmeath,</hi> where amongſt other matters there debated, the
Queſtion was, what courſe ſhould be taken with the Engliſh, and
all others that were found in the whole Kingdom to be Proteſtants;
and by their ſubſequent Practiſes it appear'd, that no leſs than a
general Maſſacre was reſolved on: Though the poor Fryar had no
other Reward or Recompence for the Diſcovery, ſave only a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement:
In which reſtraint he continued, till the Romiſh party
getting the upper hand, found him in the Priſon, and there moſt
cruelly Murder'd him.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious (and unneceſſary, ſeeing they are ſo
notoriouſly known) to give an account of the ſeveral contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49363:3"/>
of the Popiſh Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ever ſince the Conqueſt of
that Kingdom, to ſhake off the Engliſh Government; and the
horrid and barbarous cruelties they have practiſed in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto:
Therefore I will confine my ſelf to ſuch particulars as have
happened ſince His Majeſties Reſtauration, taking notice only,
That their Ignorance produces ſo blind a ſuperſtition towards the
Popiſh Religion, that they will moſt willingly venture their lives
(all that their many Rebellions have left them, and thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
too much too, unleſs they make better uſe of them) to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing, which they are made believe tends to the Honour
of Holy Church: As on the other ſide, their malice to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
(who are poſſeſt of their Eſtates) is ſo great, that they
would be content to be in worſe bondage to a Foraigner, ſo they
might but gratifie their revenge ſo far, as to have the Engliſh
equal ſufferers with them. Though they apprehend no danger of
that, taking themſelves to be already ſuch ſlaves, that they fancy
their condition cannot be worſe by changing their Maſters (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
for a Prince of their own Faith) witneſs their late agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with <hi>Spain,</hi> and their preſent one with <hi>France,</hi> which theſe
Papers ſet forth.</p>
            <p>No man that has any inſight into the affairs of <hi>Ireland,</hi> can be
ignorant, that the Romiſh Clergy of that Kingdom have publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and privately the enjoyment and exerciſe of their Religion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the manner of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> more freely ſince
His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, than in ſeveral years before, by
the very great indulgence of the late Governors. They have
their Titular Primates, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Vicars General,
Provincial Conſiſtories, Deans, Abbots, Priors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who all
live freely, though ſomewhat covertly amongſt them, without
controul, exerciſing Juriſdiction over the people. They have alſo
their Prieſts, Jeſuits and Fryars, who are of late years exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
multiplied, and in great numbers returned out of <hi>Spain, Italy,
France,</hi> and other Foragin parts (where the Children of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that are devoted to that way, are uſually ſent to
receive their education) much to the damage and diſadvantage of
the Proteſtants in that Kingdome; and no leſs to the Papiſts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
if they would but have the patience to conſider what mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
they have endured by the means of Ignorant Popiſh Prieſts,
who value no Religion ſo much, as the want of their Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Glebes and Monaſteries. But that which cauſes the greateſt
admiration in me, is, that Noble-men, private Gentlemen, and
others that are Roman Catholicks, and enjoy great part of their
Eſtates, if not all, ſhould be thus infatuated and miſled by ſuch
a parcel of deſigning Hypocrites, to act contrary, not only to
their Allegiance, but their Honour and Intereſt too; forgetting
the Calamities, by their means and wicked induſtry, brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49363:3"/>
that Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the utter ruine and deſtruction not
only of many Thouſand Engliſh Families, but of many of their own
Nation and Relations, who were ignorant of their horrid deſigns;
yet did upon the ſame account periſh, and in ſome ſort ſuffer'd
more than the Conſpirators themſelves.</p>
            <p>Within few years after His Majeſties happy Reſtauration, one
<hi>John Mullowny</hi> a mean man by birth, but now Titular Biſhop of
<hi>Killalow,</hi> and ſeveral others of the Popiſh Clergy and Gentry of
that Kingdom, united in a Conſpiracy againſt His Majeſties Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
in <hi>Ireland:</hi> For the ſaid Biſhop <hi>Mullowny</hi> having, whilſt
he was in <hi>France,</hi> received in <hi>Paris</hi> the ſum of One hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Lieures to promote a Rebellion in <hi>Ireland,</hi> did engage the
enſuing perſons to carry on the ſaid deſign (to wit) Collonel
<hi>Miles Riley,</hi> Collonel <hi>Cullen,</hi> Collonel <hi>Byrne,</hi> Collonel <hi>Mortagh O
Bryan,</hi> and Collonel <hi>Dudley Coſtellow,</hi> the laſt of whom fail'd not
to perform his part thereof, as preſently I ſhall relate: But firſt,
for its progreſs, the Reader muſt note, That after the laſt Act of
Settlement in <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Popiſh Clergy being void of all hopes
of His Majeſties favours, or any Toleration eſtabliſh'd by Law,
imployed ſeveral Emiſſaries into all parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to give notice
to all perſons, whoſe deſperate fortunes (occaſion'd by their own
or their Anceſtors Rebellion) or any hardſhips which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
they endured had made diſcontented, of the ſaid deſigns,
and to prepare and engage them therein, and uſed endeavours to
make all the intereſt in Gariſons and ſtrong holds throughout the
Kingdom that poſſibly they could: And where they had no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
appointed ſome of their confederacy to be in readineſs to
ſurpriſe ſuch places and holds. Theſe Emiſſaries were going about
for a year and an half before this commotion began; and then the
ſaid Collonel <hi>Coſtellow</hi> being forward to perform his part thereof,
before the reſt were fully ready, and before he received his part of
the Money of <hi>Mullowny,</hi> raſhly engaged himſelf; For making a
party in <hi>Connaught,</hi> he fell upon, and was ſufficiently revenged
upon the Lord <hi>Dillons</hi> Tenants and Eſtates in that County, upon
ſome former grudge he had againſt him. And afterwards he made
his intereſt about <hi>Longford,</hi> and engaged in it a Gentleman of that
Countrey, whoſe name I ſhall omit, he being then in the Engliſh
Army; yet by the inſinuation of the Popiſh Clergy, was trickt
into the ſaid Rebellion, by which the people of <hi>Longford</hi> were then
Murdered, and the whole Town Fired; and in the Action the ſaid
Gentleman was ſhot dead, and his Head brought to <hi>Dublin</hi> and ſet
on the Gate; and <hi>Coſtellow</hi> himſelf ſuffered upon the ſame account,
but not at the ſame time. Collonel <hi>Mortagh O Brian</hi> was kill'd by
one <hi>Reerden,</hi> who was formerly a Lieutenant in his own Regiment.
Collonel <hi>Byrne</hi> was ſome years after in Reſtraint in <hi>Dublin,</hi> and
which way he eſcaped is beſt known to thoſe that were acceſſary
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49363:4"/>
to it: and what became of the reſt I cannot tell, but the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy
was very formidable, and had it gone on till full ripe, would
have had very dire effects. In the Relation of which I have been
thus brief, becauſe my ſelf was not engaged in it, and ſo cannot
of my own knowledg ſay poſitively how far the contrivance in
particulars was carryed on; but I can give a ſufficient account how
I came to know what I have here ſet down, when ever I ſhall be
required.</p>
            <p>And ſhall now addreſs my ſelf to ſpeak of thoſe things which
fell within my particular cognizance, and which I can affirm upon
knowledg. As follows,</p>
            <p>IN <hi>March</hi> 1673, or thereabout, ſeveral Officers out of <hi>France</hi>
Landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> under the pretence of raiſing Recruits for
Collonel <hi>Hamilton,</hi> then in the <hi>French</hi> Service, to wit, Captain
<hi>Daniel Macnamarra,</hi> Captain <hi>John Lacy,</hi> Captain <hi>Con Oneale,</hi> one
<hi>Macmahan,</hi> and Lieutenant <hi>Hurley,</hi> and ſeveral others; many of
the ſaid Officers being my former acquaintance (before they were
imployed in the <hi>French</hi> Service) upon their coming into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
I met ſeveral of them, and entring into communication with them
(having formerly heard a general Rumour of the <hi>French</hi> deſigning
upon <hi>Ireland,</hi> and conſidering that the ſaid perſons being imployed,
for ſome years before, in the <hi>French</hi> Service, might be capable to
give ſome particular account thereof) I enquired of <hi>Lacy,</hi> whether
there was any probability of the <hi>French</hi>'s invading <hi>Ireland,</hi> or any
ſuch matter intended? He anſwered, That if the <hi>Dutch</hi> were once
ſubdued, he did not queſtion but the <hi>French</hi> would eſtabliſh the
Roman Catholick Religion in all the Northern parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and
(as far as he could underſtand by Marſhal <hi>Turene</hi> who was then his
General) that we ſhould have the ſame Laws eſtabliſhed in <hi>Ireland</hi>
that are in <hi>France;</hi> and when the <hi>French</hi> had compleated what
they had in hand, that we ſhould ſuddenly after ſee a great altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> The ſaid <hi>Lacy</hi> then uttering <hi>more
words then I ſhall mention here.</hi> He likewiſe gave me an account
of the Number of <hi>Iriſh</hi> that they had then Training up in <hi>France,</hi>
and that our welfare in <hi>Ireland</hi> did much rely on the ſucceſs of
their Forces in <hi>France;</hi> and that he did admire that any perſons of
Quality, that did underſtand the deſign of that War, ſhould ſtand
ſo much in their own light as to ſlip ſo good an opportunity, and
ſo juſt a Cauſe, being altogether to deſtroy <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
their Laws; and that he did not queſtion, with the Aſſiſtance
of the <hi>French,</hi> but that it would be accompliſhed notwithſtanding
all oppoſitions; and that ſuch perſons of <hi>Iriſh</hi> extraction as did not
engage themſelves in the ſaid Wars, would not in the future be
eſteemed, eſpecially ſuch perſons of quality as had no charge of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49363:4"/>
               <hi>Families.</hi> That he did admire why they did not conſider their
own preſent Condition, and the occaſion of their laſt Ruine; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
That it was rather for want of <hi>Conduct</hi> than <hi>Courage;</hi> and
that he did not doubt (if they were not wanting to themſelves)
that their loſs in the former Wars, would be retrieved in the next,
if they did prove true to their <hi>ſuperiors</hi> (meaning thereby the Titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Popiſh Biſhops</hi> of the ſeveral Dioceſſes in <hi>Ireland</hi>) who were
able, not only to <hi>inſtruct</hi> them, but alſo to forward and enable
them in the ſaid Deſign; and that he was confident that the <hi>French</hi>
had that intereſt that would not receive ſuch a repulſe as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
did in <hi>King ſale;</hi> alleadging, that the fault was rather to be
imputed to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> than to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> That the Articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Philip Oſullevan</hi> on the behalf of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were not duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> and if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> had been in Arms to
unite themſelves with the ſaid <hi>Spaniard,</hi> according to the ſaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
they might have been ever ſince poſſeſſed of their Eſtates and
Liberty of Religion. I made anſwer, that the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
into ſo many Engagements and Rebellions, that the name
of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man was become <hi>ridiculous</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous.</hi> The name
of an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man (ſaid he) is only rediculous to ſuch as <hi>enjoy their
Eſtates;</hi> and it is rather for their poverty, than for any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that we are contemptible, and therefore it will concern us to
remedy that fault by regaining all our Eſtates.</p>
            <p>After this Diſcourſe was over, I told the ſaid <hi>Lacy,</hi> that I had
a deſire to <hi>Travel into France,</hi> and inquired of him, whether there
was any probability that I might procure a Commiſſion under Count
<hi>Hamilton?</hi> Who ſaid, there was; and that Captain <hi>Anthony Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
would be ſuddenly in the County of <hi>Limerick;</hi> and as ſoon as
he had notice thereof, he would give me an account whether the
ſaid <hi>Hamilton</hi> had any Blank Commiſſion left undiſpoſed; but ſoon
after, upon information to the Lord Deputies of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there
were ſpecial Orders to ſecure the Officers, and ſtop the men, which
barred their Voyage that time.</p>
            <p>A little time after I met Captain <hi>Neal,</hi>
               <note place="margin">This Captain <hi>O Neale,</hi> is Son to <hi>Ewen Row O Neale,</hi> who was Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in 41.</note> and underſtood by him,
that Count <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Regiment was divided, and in factions, one
party for <hi>Hamilton,</hi> and the other for <hi>Dungan,</hi> which gave me but
little encouragement to proceed; and acquainting the ſaid <hi>Neal,</hi>
that I did reſolve to Travel into <hi>France,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Neale</hi> ſaid, that
he did prevail with a great many young Gentlemen to venture their
Fortunes abroad; and that he did believe, if they did generally
know in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> how the Game was playing for them, that there
would be hardly any left in the whole County, but would all una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
go for <hi>France;</hi> but added, that he did conceive it
would be of dangerous conſequence to him to declare what his
knowledge was of the affairs abroad, and how likely they were to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49363:5"/>
have good ſucceſs in their undertakings, if they did prove obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſuch as were intruſted to give them timely notice; and that
it was for want of good and prudent management,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> Coſtellows</note> the laſt deſign,
ſo long in agitation, was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Theſe Officers being croſſed in their Voyage (and their men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed)
went back into <hi>France</hi> again, from whence, about a year
after, the ſaid Lieutenant <hi>Hurly</hi> returned into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and reſided
in <hi>New-Caſtle</hi> or thereabouts for half a year or upwards, where it
was credibly reported, that he did train up ſeveral Gentlemen, by
teaching them to Exerciſe <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Musket:</hi> And it was generally
affirm'd then amongſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that in ſeveral parts of <hi>Ireland</hi>
the like method was uſed, in order to being in readineſs, to receive
Commands from ſuch as were appointed for the carrying on the ſaid
Conſpiracy in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the year 1675, Captain <hi>John Lacy</hi> came out of <hi>France</hi>
into <hi>Ireland,</hi> giving an account of the affairs abroad to Biſhop
<hi>Mullowny</hi> and the reſt of the Popiſh Clergy in that Country, giving
them full aſſurance,<note place="margin">The Romiſh Religion in <hi>Ireland</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed.</note> that all was working on for the better, charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and commanding them to be very urgent with the people, and
to omit no opportunity, and that they ſhould ſuddenly ſee their
Religion better ſetled in <hi>Ireland</hi> than ever before, and that they
would be rid of that yoke of Hereſie which they had ſo long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
under; and that now the minute was nigh at hand, on which
their Fortune depended, or their utter Deſtruction. Theſe words
he did utter in the preſence of ſeveral of the Clergy, as I have
been told by the ſaid <hi>Mullowny</hi> and others; and the ſaid <hi>Lacy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the ſame in effect in my company.</p>
            <p>About the ſaid year, News came freſh into <hi>Ireland,</hi> That the
King of <hi>England</hi> was very ill; and the report ſometime after was
ſtrong, that His Majeſty was dead; ſome affirming, that if he was
not, that it was impoſſible for him ever to recover, which gave
great incouragement to their deſign<note place="margin">The King fell ill, which gave much encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſaid deſign.</note>: At which time there flocked
great multitudes out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> giving notice, That
they would be in Arms, and ſuch as had none, ſhould uſe their
endeavours to procure ſome, and that the time was come on which
they would execute their deſigns. But His Majeſty (by God's
Mercy) recovering from the ſaid Diſtemper, gave them much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
for that time, inſtead of their former hope<note place="margin">His Majeſty being well recovered from his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gave much diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to the party.</note>s; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
That thoſe deſperate perſons returned into <hi>England</hi> (as we
in <hi>Ireland</hi> ſuppoſed) and continued there ſome time before the
<hi>Parliament</hi> aſſembled, and then returned into <hi>Ireland</hi> with no leſs
hopes of good ſucceſs than formerly; declaring to the people there,
that there was great induſty uſed, in preparing a Bone to throw
between both Houſes of Parliament, which gave the Malecontents
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49363:5"/>
there,<note place="margin">The Officers gone out of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </note> hopes, that by means thereof they would bring their horrid
deſigns, long in agitation, to effect; That is to ſay, to aboliſh the

thereof, to erect Popery, and eſtabliſh Arbitrary Government:<note place="margin">Again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with new hopes.</note>
But coming ſhort of their wicked expectations, they returned into
<hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the year 1676, I ſaw Doctor <hi>Creagh,</hi> otherwiſe called the
Titular Biſhop of <hi>Cork,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Biſhop <hi>Creagh</hi> came out of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </note> who (as I was told by one Doctor <hi>Stretch</hi>)
was newly come from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome;</hi> afterwards, in <hi>Limerick,</hi>
happening to be in the company of the aforeſaid Biſhop <hi>Mullowny</hi>
(who was my former acquaintance, and knew that I was privy to
ſeveral paſſages and intrigues of this kind) he told me, that they
had received further intelligence concerning the ſaid affairs, by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
<hi>Creagh,</hi> and ſeveral others of the Popiſh Clergy, who were
lately arrived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that they had inſtructions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and authority from his Holineſs the Pope, for to quit and
diſcharge the Roman Catholicks of <hi>Ireland</hi> from their Allegiance to
the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſaying, That the King of <hi>England</hi> had no
Right to <hi>Ireland,</hi> but what he had from the Pope; and that the
King being an Heretick, the ſame right returned to the Pope again;
and ſaid, the <hi>French</hi> were not then in a condition to perform what
was formerly agreed upon; Biſhop <hi>Mullowny</hi> 
               <note place="margin">This is the ſame <hi>Mullow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the former Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</note>ſaying, That the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
in order to the carrying on of the ſaid deſign, were in the
hands of the Titular Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Tuam,</hi> and did not queſtion
but every point therein mentioned ſhould be faithfully performed;
adding, that there were thoſe in <hi>England</hi> appointed for to ſupply
His Majeſties Wants,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>One</hi> Lynch.</note> and keep off Parliaments until this were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>
            <p>It was a general rumour throughout <hi>Ireland,</hi> amongſt the Popiſh
Clergy and Gentry for ſeveral years before, eſpecially 1675 and 1676,
That his Royal Highneſs, in 1677 enſuing, at the furtheſt, ſhould
be King. As ſoon as I had this intelligence from the ſaid <hi>Mullowny</hi>
and others, I acquainted <hi>John Piggott</hi> Eſq;, a Juſtice of the Peace,<note place="margin">Acquainted <hi>John Piggott</hi> Eſq; with the ſaid particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note>
with that in particular in the aforeſaid years; who being examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before the Lord Lieutenant and Council, in <hi>November</hi> 1679, did
not only acknowledg the ſame, but gave it in his Examinations
under his Hand and Seal; and ſo far I refer my ſelf to the ſaid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations,
which are now in the cuſtody of Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> How this and a <hi>French</hi>
deſign, and the Plot diſcovered againſt His Majeſties Life here in
<hi>England</hi> doth agree, I will not take upon me to determine, but
refer the inferences to the Judicious Reader.</p>
            <p>On or about the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>November</hi> 1677; Collonel <hi>Pierce Lacy</hi>
invited me to go with him to <hi>Limerick,</hi> he being then to treat
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49363:6"/>
about the ſaid deſign with the Lord <hi>Brittas,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Macnamar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>
of <hi>Crattellagh,</hi> and ſeveral others who were engaged in carrying
on the ſame, as I have been told by the ſaid <hi>Lacy,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Mullow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and many more of the Popiſh party.</p>
            <p>About <hi>January</hi> 1677, The Lord <hi>Brittas,</hi> Captain <hi>Thomas Bourk,</hi>
and ſeveral others with them, came into the Barony of <hi>Conollue</hi> in
the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> where they had ſeveral private Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
one whereof was at the Houſe of one <hi>John Hicks</hi> Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
in <hi>Rathkeal</hi> in the ſaid County of <hi>Limirick,</hi> there being at
the ſaid meeting, in number Twenty, or more, who were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
to meet at Night<note place="margin">Twenty or more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber met at <hi>John Hickes</hi> in <hi>Rathkeale</hi> Innkeeper.</note>; but ſome Engliſh Gentlemen coming
ſuddenly there,<note place="margin">Gibius <hi>and</hi> Palmes.</note> barred them of treating of the particulars at that
time: Therefore they agreed to have another meeting at the ſame
place the week following, and another at <hi>New Caſtle</hi> in the ſaid
County, where they met accordingly, but the particulars they then
concluded upon, I know not.</p>
            <p>On or about the Fourteenth of <hi>February,</hi> in the ſame year, I
met Mr. <hi>Euſtace White</hi> upon the <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>Chrough Burgeſs</hi> in the
County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> who told me, that he had Two Letters to the
Lord <hi>Brittas,</hi> one from Sir <hi>John Fitz Gerald,</hi> the other from Mr.
<hi>Hurly,</hi> or Mr. <hi>Poore;</hi> I enquired of the ſaid <hi>White,</hi> what did Sir
<hi>John</hi>'s Letter import? The ſaid <hi>White</hi> anſwered, That they did
underſtand the Lord <hi>Brittas</hi> had received his Commiſſion, and that
Sir <hi>John Fitz Gerald</hi> did expect to be his Lieutenant Collonel,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>White</hi> owned the ſame.</note> and
that the ſaid <hi>White</hi> did expect a Captains Command under the ſaid
Lord <hi>Brittas.</hi> Sir <hi>John Fitz Gerald</hi> being examined before the
Lord Lieutenant and Council, in <hi>November</hi> 1679, did own to have
ſent ſuch a Letter by the ſaid <hi>White,</hi> at the ſame time, to the Lord
<hi>Brittas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> which are well to live,<note place="margin">Many who were not at the laſt Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion at the leaſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſuffered more than the Actors.</note> and reſtored to part of
their Eſtates, if not all, were very much diſcontented at thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
who though they knew not the particulars, had a general
notion of the Evil coming upon them, and did fear that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
might ſmart for the Nocency of others; ſeveral of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
who were not only innocent in themſelves, but harboured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
ſeveral Engliſh Families, having ſmarted for the Rebellion of
others, in a manner more than thoſe that have been Actors in the
ſaid Rebellion, as by woful experience I can juſtifie and maintain.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh likewiſe in thoſe laſt years,<note place="margin">The Engliſh had Forty-one in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</note> having Forty-one freſh
in their memories, were much diſmayed to ſee and hear of thoſe
great multitudes meeting both publickly and privately; and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſting
that there was ſome evil or miſchief intended them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
that ſtrict Watches be duly kept through the Country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49363:6"/>
In the years 1676 and 1677, ſeveral Emiſſaries went to and fro,
giving intelligence of foraign affairs, and how managed abroad;
likewiſe ſeveral Letters were come down to the Country with feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
names to them, one whereof I had in my hand, and peruſed it,
it was directed to Capt. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and ſubſcribed by Capt. <hi>Jones,</hi>
both feigned names, which ſaid Letters were writ at their grand
Cabals in <hi>Dublin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Gran Cabals in <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </note> or thereabouts, as I did underſtand by Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi>
and ſeveral others; and that which I did read, he ſaid was come
from one Dr. <hi>Cuſack</hi> near <hi>Dublin,</hi> whom I have never ſeen nor
known; the ſubſtance thereof I delivered to Sir <hi>John Davis</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
of State: Theſe were the methods that were uſed in the
ſaid years, for the better managing the ſaid deſign.</p>
            <p>On or about <hi>May</hi> 1678, an Agent being then appointed to go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>France,</hi> by name Dr. <hi>Hetherman,</hi> the Emiſſaries of the Jeſuits,
and the reſt of the Clergy in thoſe parts that were the principal
men, conſulted together, and pitched upon Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> to be a fit

there, to the ſaid Agent that was bound for <hi>France,</hi> as ſoon as the
ſaid <hi>Lacy</hi> returned from <hi>Dublin;</hi> Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> being ſhort of Money,
borrowed 60 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Simon Eaton</hi> Eſq;, under the pretence of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
Rent and Arrears to Sir <hi>William Talbot</hi> Agent to his Royal
Highneſs in that Kingdom: The ſaid <hi>Lacy,</hi> after the receipt of the

following,<note place="margin">Returned in <hi>Auguſt</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</note> then returned to his own Houſe, being there but

Father <hi>Fox</hi> and ſeveral others, they and Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> being together,
for a good while before I came there, I do not know what the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of the ſaid inſtructions given by the ſaid <hi>Lacy</hi> to the ſaid

except <hi>Hetherman</hi> (that being my firſt acquaintance with him)
who converſed altogether in <hi>French</hi> or in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
in general terms were treated of upon the former ſubject;
after Dinner was over, Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> and my ſelf walked abroad in
the Street for an hour at leaſt, and he told me how forward they
were in managing and carrying on the ſaid deſign, and that Dr.
<hi>Hetherman</hi> (who was then Agent bound for <hi>France</hi> as aforeſaid)
was as fit a perſon to manage the affairs in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> as any in

renew my acquaintance with the ſaid <hi>Hetherman.</hi> After we return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the Houſe of the ſaid <hi>Streitch,</hi> and ſeveral diſcourſes being
treated in general terms about the ſaid Deſign, the ſaid <hi>Hetherman</hi>
and I walked abroad in the Garden of the ſaid <hi>Streitch;</hi> the ſaid <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therman</hi>
was very earneſt to learn of me what force or ſtrength I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49363:7"/>
conceived the Proteſtants to be in that County;<note place="margin">A Roll in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, with the number of Papiſts and Proteſtants.</note> I made anſwer, that
I never enquired into the particulars. He told me I was to blame
for it; whereupon he produces me a Roll in the nature of a Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
but in Paper, where he ſhewed me each Pariſh in particular,
and the number of the Proteſtants and Papiſts in that County; the
Papiſts by the return of the ſaid <hi>Hetherman,</hi> had in number amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Fifteen for each Proteſtant in the ſaid County, and that he
had the like return from the County of <hi>Cork,</hi> County of <hi>Clare,</hi>
County of <hi>Kerry, &amp;c.</hi> not mentioning the numbers of the ſaid
Counties then to me. I asked him then, how came he to have
ſuch an exact return of the Proteſtants and the Papiſts? He ſaid it
was not difficult to him, preſcribing the enſuing methods uſed in
thoſe affairs; ſaying, that every Pariſh-Prieſt had always an exact
Catalogue of Proteſtants and Papiſts in their Pariſhes, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame twice a year to the Biſhops, and likewiſe ſaid, that he
had a Liſt of the Nobility that were ingaged in managing the ſaid
Deſign, but did not ſhew me the ſame; and did ſay, that he did
truſt in God that the Natives of <hi>Ireland</hi> would not be long Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to Heretical Government; and for his part, that he would uſe
all the induſtry and intereſt he had to effect the ſaid Deſign; and
that he did conjecture, that the County of <hi>Kerry</hi> might be the moſt
convenient Landing-place for an Army in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it being a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
County, and convenient, having but few there to oppoſe
them, being far from any aſſiſtance; that he did not doubt, if the
perſons ingag'd in carrying on the ſaid deſign did perform their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
that before the Engliſh Forces in <hi>Ireland</hi> had full notice
of the Army landed, there would be but few left to give oppoſition;
and pitching upon the Month of <hi>November</hi> following to be the time
appointed for their Landing,<note place="margin">A Deſign to ſurpriſe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick,</hi> and many other ſtrong holds in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be delivered up to the <hi>French.</hi>
               </note> ſaid, that ſome were deſirous to have

of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> there, and their ſtrength and
numbers in that Country) at the general Conſultation of the Popiſh
Clergy about <hi>Dublin,</hi> it was agreed to begin in the Province of
<hi>Munster,</hi> and to ſecure all the Forts and ſtrong-holds there, and
that there were perſons ingaged in the ſaid Deſign, that could, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much danger, deliver up ſeveral Forts and Cities in the ſaid
Kingdom; and in ſuch Cities and Forts where they had not intereſt
in the Officers within the ſaid Cities, that they had perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
throughout the Kingdom to ſurprize all ſuch ſtrong-holds
and Cities aforeſaid, ſaying, that if the ſaid Deſign had miſcarried,
conſidering what great aſſiſtance and friends they had both at home
and abroad, that the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ſhould never expect but to live in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
reflecting upon the miſcarriages in all former deſigns, blaming
the undertakers,<note place="margin">Much reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the management of all former Deſigns.</note> ſaying, that if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did unanimouſly unite
and riſe in Arms when Coll. <hi>Dudley Castellow</hi> firſt began the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
in <hi>Connought,</hi> that they would by that time have <hi>Ireland</hi>
freed from Hereſie; and now, that they had no other way then to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49363:7"/>
Riſe all in a night, and to proceed in a general Maſſacre throughout
the ſaid Kingdom, and to kill Man, Woman and Child, and not to
leave a Proteſtant living in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> The ſaid <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therman</hi>
in three days after the ſaid meeting, went away for <hi>France;</hi>
before the ſaid <hi>Hetherman</hi> parted, I acquainted Sir <hi>Thomas South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
with all the particulars, and deſired that he would ſecure <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therman</hi>
and all his Papers, and likewiſe told him who the Officers
were that were appointed to carry on the deſign; but he did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
therein, but often promiſed that he would ſend to acquaint
the Earl of <hi>Orory</hi> with the Proceedings, but did not (as far as ever I
could underſtand) and ſent to Collonel <hi>Lacy,</hi> and the reſt, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them of ſuch matters as I had imparted to him about the ſaid
Deſign, as hereafter ſhall appear more at large.</p>
            <p>On or about <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1678, the <hi>French</hi> were expected to Land
beyond <hi>Tarbutt,</hi> in the River of <hi>Shanan,</hi> in the County of <hi>Kerry,</hi> in
the ſaid Kingdom; the perſons concerned to perform their parts of
the Deſign in that Countrey, did often Conſult together in thoſe
days (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Lord <hi>Baron</hi> of <hi>Brittas,</hi> Collonel <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> and
ſeveral others having continual Intelligence, that the time was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nigh, the day being appointed on which the ſaid Deſign was to

1678,<note place="margin">They were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that the <hi>French</hi> would not anſwer their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation at the ſame time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</note> as aforeſaid, and to ſurprize <hi>Limerick</hi> the <hi>23d;</hi> ſome were
for ſurprizing thereof ſome days before the <hi>French</hi> had Landed;
others oppoſed it, thinking that if the <hi>French</hi> did not come at the
time appointed, that it were of dangerous conſequence for them to
hazard themſelves in the undertaking, and ſo concluded to make
no noiſe or inſurrection, till they had the aſſiſtance aſſured unto
them: But the ſaid Lord <hi>Brittas,</hi> Collonel <hi>Lacy Macnamarra,</hi> and
ſeveral others made it their buſineſs for ſeveral years before to be
free and familiar with the Officers of <hi>Limerick,</hi> by treating and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining
them, in hopes thereby that their Deſign might be the
eaſier carried on, ſitting up early and late with the ſaid Officers, in

three of the ſaid Officers of <hi>Limerick</hi> dyed. I could ſay more
of this, but I think this is ſufficient.</p>

that as far as I could then underſtand, it was a Cuſtom at that time,

            <p>The perſons concerned in the ſaid Conſpiracy (as the Lord <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi>
and others) gave out, that they were to have Commiſſions
ſometimes to Raiſe men for <hi>Holland,</hi> and other times for <hi>Tangier,</hi>
that by the Rumours thereof, the leſs notice might be taken of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49363:8"/>
publick meetings and Treaties, and to avoid all ſuſpicion whilſt
they were managing the aformentioned Contrivance. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
in thoſe parts all this while imagining what the matter ſhould
be, were in bodily fear, ſeeing ſo many great meetings as aforeſaid,
and likewiſe ſome of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who were abroad, and knew the
Laws of <hi>France,</hi> and the rigour of Arbitrary Government, being
now poſſeſſed of ſome of their Eſtates, if not all, were in much
fear that the Popiſh Clergy of <hi>Ireland,</hi> by their contrivance, would
bring deſtruction upon the Innocent as well as the Nocent, the
like having happened often before in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>March</hi> 1678, or thereabouts, Sir <hi>John Fitz Gerald</hi> viſiting
ſome Friends in the County of <hi>Limerick,</hi> amongſt the reſt went to
Coll. <hi>Pierce Lacy,</hi> who told Sir <hi>John,</hi> that he was highly obliged
to Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> ſaying, that the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did ſend
him word by Mr. <hi>John Hurly,</hi> that I ſhould tell and acquaint the
ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> that Coll. <hi>Lacy,</hi> one <hi>Eaſmond,</hi> and others, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the Conſpiracy then on foot in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Sir <hi>John Fitz Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi>
did ask Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> whether he did ſee me ſince he received
that Meſſage? Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> replying that he did very often, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did tax me with it, deſired the ſaid Sir <hi>Johu</hi> to ſay nothing of it
at preſent; whereupon the ſaid Sir <hi>John</hi> denied to ſtay to drink
with the ſaid <hi>Lacy</hi> (as Sir <hi>John</hi> told me) and Rode ſtraight to the

the Innkeeper; <hi>Couſin,</hi> when will you take as much care of me as
I have done for you within this two hours? Then I asked Sir <hi>John,</hi>

ſmothered, repeating the ſaid meſſage ſent from Sir <hi>Thomas South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
by Mr. <hi>Hurly,</hi> to Coll. <hi>Lacy,</hi> and that if I did tell Sir <hi>Thomas
Southwell</hi> ſuch a thing as Coll. <hi>Lacy</hi> ſaid (meaning the diſcovery of
the Plot in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell</hi>) that he was
no better than a Traytor to his Country in betraying me; and that
if I did not repeat the ſame to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> that
he was a Raſcal for abuſing me; and then asked when I ſaw Mr.
<hi>Hurly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Mackmechiny,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Burk,</hi> Capt. <hi>Purdon,</hi> or Coll. <hi>Lacy?</hi>
I told him lately. Then ſays he, did none of your Friends and good

Then ſays he, look to your ſelf, and take it from me, as a ſpecial
Caveat,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>John</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat to me for the future.</note> that for the future you avoid all their Companies; for I
do aſſure you, that they have an eye upon you, which for ought

out, that he was to have a Regiment of Horſe? or under whoſe

that it was by the Earl of <hi>Orory</hi>'s intereſt (who was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

no leſs by the Company that frequented his Houſe, that
there would be a ſudden alteration, and ſeveral other particulars to

than he did, had he not been diſſwaded from it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>John Fitz Gerald</hi> being examined before the Lord Lieutenant

ſtay until Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> got out of bed, which I refuſed to do. Then
the ſaid <hi>Piggot</hi> promiſed me that he would give me an account of

me, in regard that he had Married Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>'s Daughter, and his

            <p>The next day after I had received the ſaid Certificate, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, from Mr. <hi>Piggot;</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell</hi> ſent one of his Servants

the ſaid Certificate? He anſwered, That it may be a means to prevent
me from receiving any miſchief from the ſaid perſons. Whereupon

with my ſelf was requiſite for me to do, if I had not had his advice.
Then after I parted with the ſaid <hi>Lacy,</hi> I returned back again to the

            <p>In <hi>May</hi> 1679, or thereabouts, I went to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi>
and ſat with him a whole afternoon; who told me, that he
did ſend private intelligence of the particulars to the Earl of <hi>Orory,</hi>
which afterwards proved quite contrary, as hereafter doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>In <hi>July</hi> following, having intelligence that his Grace the Duke
of <hi>Ormond</hi> was to be in <hi>Thomas</hi> Town in <hi>Auguſt</hi> following; I told
the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell,</hi> that I thought it convenient for me
to wait upon his Grace, and give him an account of the Deſigns in
Agitation againſt the Government, and that I muſt make uſe of the
ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Southwell</hi>'s name therein. Then the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas</hi>
told me, That if I did mention any thing of him, that he would
have an Action of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> againſt me; I told him I would try
that, and ſo both diſcontentedly parted.</p>
            <p>In <hi>August</hi> following, being fully ſatisfied that his Grace the Duke
of <hi>Ormond</hi> was come to Captain <hi>Mathews,</hi> in the County of <hi>Tippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,</hi>
it being leſs than 30 miles diſtance from my houſe thither;
The <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>August</hi> aforeſaid, I went again to the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas
Southwell,</hi> and told him, that I was reſolved next morning to ſet forth
for <hi>Thomas-Town</hi> to wait upon the Duke, who I underſtood was to
be there. Then he was earneſt with me to paſs all by, and ſay no
more thereof; He finding that I would not comply, he pretended
that I owed 5 <hi>l.</hi> for a parcel of Land, containing forty Acres, which
he held by Leaſe from <hi>Brook-Bridges,</hi> Eſq; now here in <hi>London;</hi>
which ſaid Land lying convenient to my concerns, I bought a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
intereſt therein, and poſſeſſed my ſelf thereof, and told him
that I did not underſtand any Debt that was owing from me to him.
But if he could juſtly claim any, he ſhould be immediately paid,
and told him that 5 <hi>l.</hi> would not break ſquares betwixt him and me:
but he ſwore he would have an Action of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> againſt me; and
ſo parted. And whileſt I was upon my Examinations afterwards
in <hi>Dublin,</hi> to avoid all manner of ſuſpicions, and falſe pretenſions of
Debt or Debts to be due from me to any perſon or perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
I declared that I had renounced all manner of Protections
that may be granted to preſerve me from my Creditors, and left my
ſelf open to the Law. Thus far I refer my ſelf to his Grace the Lord
Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the Right Honourable <hi>Arthur,</hi> Lord Viſcount <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,

told me that moſt of the Gentlemen of that part of the County

I did conceive my ſelf in danger and returned back to the

I took Pen and Ink and writ ſome part of depoſitions, and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to ſend an expreſs to the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> that night,

you ſee what <hi>Walter Huet</hi> ſwears againſt me, as well as you
have been pleaſed to examine him the particulars of what he had
Sworn againſt me, I ſhall deſire that you will reexamine him to
ſhew reaſons why he did not declare this ſince <hi>March,</hi> 1677, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this time being <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1679, They knowing that I ſeldome
or never miſſed one Aſſizes or Seſſions in <hi>Limerick</hi> for ſeveral years

why he did not proſecute me ſooner, ſaid that he did conceive that
I was a Reſolute Gentleman, and that he was afraid that I ſhould
runn him through or Piſtol him; then I deſired that he may be
queſtioned why he did not being once at the Aſſizes at <hi>Limerick</hi> and
ſeeing me there at the Bench, he ſaid then that he thought I had
too many Friends there, and that he did ſuppoſe they would not

him now more than at any time paſt to come before them Two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates
which he knew to be the neareſt Friends that I had, then
ſaid he I give no more reaſons then I have, and ſo parted.</p>
            <p>That night I had liberty of the Magiſtrates to go home to my
own houſe without any Guards, next day I returned to them, and
deſired that they ſhould ſend their Warrant with me to <hi>Limerick,</hi>
and had a Guard to attend me thither of thirty horſe, the Aſſizes
being juſt comeing on three daies after, at which I expected my
Trial: after I got into <hi>Limerick</hi> and was received by the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal,
there all perſons in the Counties of <hi>Limerick</hi> and <hi>Clare,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
what my Crimes ſhould be, I had ſeveral of the beſt of
them come to me there, to know what the occaſion ſhould be.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the Sheriff, having ſent part of my Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> as I formerly mentioned
by expreſs, his Grace upon peruſal thereof ſent Special Orders
to the ſaid Sheriff, that he ſhould on ſight thereof come along

the ſaid Sheriff as ſoon as he came thither, came to me to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal ſea,
and ſhewed me the ſaid Order, which was very welcome
to me, becauſe it would ſet me at Liberty (never haveing been a

            <p>Then the ſaid Sheriff, and I got ready to go to the Duke, and
did ſet forth from <hi>Limerick</hi> about a elven of the Clock the ſaid
night, the night following his Grace being told that we were come

after he had taken part of my depoſitions, asked me whether I feared

any thing of the Treaſon ſworn againſt me in <hi>Limerick</hi> as aforeſaid,
and if I did ſuppoſe that there would be any dainger, that his Grace
would give me a Pardon, I anſwered that for my knowledge in the
ſaid Conſpiracy againſt the Government that I would accept of his
Majeſties gracious Pardon, though I did not doubt to prove that
I had diſcharged my ſelf thereof, by acquainting Magiſtrates from
time to time, of my knowledge thereof, and for any other Crime,

did either of their Tales agree together, the matter appear'd
ſo frivolous or rather ſet up by Practice, that the Jury without
any Heſitation pronounc'd me not Guilty.</p>
            <p>Then the Grand Jury returned <hi>Billa vera</hi> upon the Indictment
againſt the perſons who broke my houſe;<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Richard Reynolds</hi> would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Trial at the requeſt of others, but diſſmiſſed them.</note> then the Clerk of the
Crown called them by their names upon their Recognizance,
the number of fourteen or fifteen did appear, Judge <hi>Reynolds</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
the Indictment to be Vexatious having 31 mentioned
therein, but would not have the patience to hear the Trial, being
worked upon by others as I will Juſtifie, put me off, having at

leaſt twenty witneſſes then in Court to prove the matter of Fact,
and ordered the ſaid people to be diſmiſſed, and addmitted them
not to their Trial; then I prayed his Lordſhip in open Court to
do me Juſtice, and to let the Trial of the ſaid perſons that did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
proceed, but all to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Afterwards I went up to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and petitioned to the Lord
Lieutenant and Council, and did ſet forth in the ſaid petition the
greivances and Injuſtice done unto me by Sir <hi>Richard Reynolds</hi>
as I conceived, by putting off the Trial aforeſaid; after the ſaid
Petition was read, I was called to appear before the Lod Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent

the Lord Lieutenant and Council, that the people aforeſaid

            <p>The Lord Lieutenent and Council upon full conſideration of

The ſaid Commiſſion was executed the third, fourth and fifth daies
of <hi>February;</hi> 1679. By <hi>Garret Fitz Gerald,</hi> Eſq; high Sheriff of
the County of <hi>Limerick, Simon Eyton, George Ailmer</hi> and <hi>John
Odel,</hi> Eſquires, Upon the full examination and hearing of ten ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
witneſſes, who proved the particulars mentioned in the ſaid
Information as aforeſaid, and finding twenty more ready to averre
the ſame, Returned the ſaid Commiſſion to the Lord Lieutenant
and Council with the depoſitions of the ten that ſwore poſitive to
the names of thoſe that broke my houſe, and heard them ſay kill
the Rebel and knock him in the head before he goes any further;
and the ſaid Commiſſioners did Certifie to the Lord Lieuetenant
and Council that there had been a great many more ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
the ſame, as the ten did in their depoſitions aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Whereupon ſeveral of the riotous perſons aforeſaid were again
taken up, and brought to Tryal, and though the breaking my houſe
in the night, and menacing words before recited were fully ſworn
againſt them by divers Witneſſes, againſt whom they had no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour

to diſcover <hi>another</hi> moſt horrid Conſpiracy againſt our
Gracious Soveraign, for inveſting a <hi>Forreiner</hi> with that Kingdom;
and ſubverting his Majeſties Government there, I thought it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
upon me as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and in duty obliged as a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi>
to my King, and in <hi>Charity</hi> and kindneſs to all you my dear (though

in that Kingdome, that they may not be ſeduced by the ill

and deſperate <hi>Rebellions,</hi> may be obviated and prevented.</p>
            <p>I confeſs my <hi>Education</hi> and courſe of life (more influenc'd by

and had not this extraordinary occaſion, and the <hi>command</hi>

which well weighed and purſued might be of good uſe
to you and your poſterity.</p>
            <p>I know I make this addreſs to you upon very diſadvantagious
Terms, for tis not to be doubted but your crafty Prieſts (who make
no Conſcience of ſtandering any mans name (nay of Murdering
his perſon, where it may either tend to conceal their own Villain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies,
or advance their Diveliſh cauſe) have already fill'd you with
abundance of <hi>prejudice,</hi> and repreſented me to you as the worſt of

bear me witneſs that I have declared nothing but what is moſt
punctually true, ſo there are too many of you (the Prieſts and
Gentry eſpecially) that <hi>know</hi> it to be ſo, and that how loud and
and cauſeleſly ſoever, they may rail at me, yet at the ſame time
their own Souls give their Tongues the <hi>lie,</hi> and therefore my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
is that how much ſoever what I ſhall ſay to you may be againſt
your preſent bigotted humour, yet it is ſtill moſt conducive both
to your <hi>duty</hi> and your real <hi>Interest,</hi> which I heartily wiſh you may
not too late be ſenſible of, it being much better to <hi>prevent</hi> than
<hi>Repent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affliction,</hi> (ſayeth the wiſeſt of men) makes people <hi>wiſe,</hi> and
tis a Proverb that <hi>Experience is the Miſtris of Fools.</hi> How incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibly
<hi>ſtupid</hi> then muſt you be, whom ſuch <hi>tedious</hi> (I am ſorry
I cannot ſay <hi>undeſerved,</hi> nor <hi>unprovoked</hi>) Afflictions, and ſo many
repeated lamentable <hi>Experiments</hi> of the <hi>ill ſucceſs</hi> and fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of <hi>Intriguing</hi> with Forreiners, and <hi>Rebelling</hi> againſt your
Lawful Governours, has not yet been able to contain within
bounds of Loyalty and obedience; tell me ſeriouſly and in earneſt,
do you think that the blood of two hundred thouſand peaceable
Proteſtants and Loyal Subjects by you moſt Barbarouſly Butcher'd
in the Rebellion begun, 23 <hi>October,</hi> 1641, does not yet Cry loud
for vengeance upon you, the perſons, or at leaſt defendants of thoſe,
whoſe accurſed hands were embrued in that deteſtable Maſſacre?
And yet what did you gain by it, though you had the Popes Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
and his Bulls of Pardon, and his Nuncio to head you, and
promiſes from <hi>Spain</hi> to aſſiſt you, and though you ſtarted your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
at a Juncture when <hi>Scotland,</hi> and preſently after <hi>England</hi> (by
the arts of the ſame Jeſuitical and Popiſh Incendiaries who blew
you up into a flame) were engaged in a Common Combuſtion, and
conſequently in the eye of Reaſon unable to yield any aſſiſtance
towards cruſhing the helliſh deſignes, yet do you not remember
that Providence was pleaſed to defeat your Projects, to blaſt your
enterprizes, to confound your Forces, to give you up to ſo total a
conqueſt, till at laſt you became the ſcorn of all the world, and there
wanted but little to render you as vagrant, as contemptible, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
as <hi>Jews,</hi> and root out the memory of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Nation from
off the face of the Earth.</p>
            <p>And ſince by the Mercies of God and ſuperabundant Indulgence
of our Gracious King, great numbers of you are returned from a
deſperate Exile, and reinſtated in your forlorn Poſſeſſions, (at leaſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49363:15"/>
to a greater degree than moſt of you had reaſon to hope for) what
a moſt prodigious Ingratitude both to Heaven and your Earthly
Soveraign will it be for you again to to tempt the fates, and engage
your ſelves in new Rebellions? What can you expect from ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings
(equally fooliſh and wicked) but everlaſting ſlavery
and utter irretreivable Ruine?</p>
            <p>Wherefore ſince thoſe attempts however guilded over with
plauſible pretentions by your deſigning Clergy-men (who haveing
nothing themſelves to loſe, are like the deſperate fallen Angels, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
tempting you to miſchief, that they may have the more num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous
partners both in their Guilt and puniſhment) are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
moſt nefarious and unjuſt, and tend to nothing but deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
I ſhall endeavour to lay before you the ſandy foundations
wherein all the hopes are built, and demonſtrate that you have as little
Policy as right in ſuch black (and hitherto ſtill blaſted) endeavours.</p>
            <p>As for your Army which you expect out of <hi>France,</hi> I am apt to
think it's a <hi>deluſory medium</hi> drawn over your eyes by the Jeſuitical
party to deceive you; and no Prince will give you any aſſiſtance, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
you your ſelves firſt appear in action, for till then, they cannot
give any truſt to you (as it happened in the three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſions)
and after you are broken into action, you muſt depend upon their
Charity and diſcretion whither they will aid you or no, but be
aſſured their ſupplies will be but faint and ſmall, as you have found
before (from the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) by ſad experience: There is no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to be put in the power of any Forraigne Prince, but it will be
your duty as well as wiſdome to rely upon the goodneſs of your own
natural Prince, he having been ſo merciful and indulgent unto you</p>
            <p>Nor is it reaſonably to be imagined that any <hi>Chriſtian Prince,</hi> much
<hi>leſs the moſt Chriſtian King</hi> ſhould commit or countenance ſo horrid an
act, as to raiſe a Rebllion in the Territories of another Prince, who is
the <hi>greateſt</hi> and beſt (I had almoſt ſaid) the <hi>only</hi> friend he hath in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope;</hi>
but I am not ignorant, that it is a <hi>French</hi> Maxim, that a man
ought not to be a ſlave to his word, that Intereſt is Right, and all things
Lawful that make for their Princes Glory and Grandeur; ſuppoſe
therefore he ſhould permit ſome of his forces to go over into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
as he did unto <hi>Portugal</hi> contrary to the faith of the <hi>Pyrenaean treaty,</hi>
and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts to joyn with them, it will aſſuredly prove the
ruine and confuſion of them; if it be conſidered, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
have all the ſtrong holds in that Kingdom at their command, and how
eaſily an Army may be tranſmitted out of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> into
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and what an obſtinate defence the Engliſh there will make,
before they will depart with theſe eſtates they now enjoy, and which
they have acquired with ſo much expence of blood; the <hi>French</hi> have
reaſon to underſtand and remember the Engliſh gallantry; if they
have forgot, let them enquire at <hi>Poiters, Agincourt</hi> or <hi>Creſſey,</hi> and
they will tell them; But in caſe the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould <hi>own</hi> the
action, and vigorouſly appear for them; without doubt there are
ſome ſo highly concerned in point of intereſt (conſidering the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation
of that Kingdom) that he will draw the greateſt Naval power
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49363:15"/>
of <hi>Europe</hi> againſt him, and of what pernitious conſequence it may be to
his glory, its ſuitable to his great judgment to conſider; except he could
poſt his <hi>Naval</hi> as he did his <hi>land</hi> forces, that they could not (as they
ſaid) be <hi>attacqued;</hi> yet that imagination was confuted at the relief of
<hi>Mons,</hi> and in caſe the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould tranſmit an Army into <hi>Ireland,</hi>
the conqueſt of it would not be like a <hi>Goal</hi> at foot-ball, in an inſtant,
but a work of time, and the more forces they ſend thither, the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
for want of proviſion would the ſooner be undone, for a <hi>Famine</hi> hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
put a period to all invaſions or rebellions there; it cannot reaſonab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be conceived that the <hi>French</hi> ſhould releive them by <hi>Sea,</hi> when they
will have ſuch a great power againſt them; for if the <hi>French</hi> keep the
Sea, they will be fought, and then let them conſider the conſequence;
if they keep in <hi>Breſt,</hi> which is their only Port from whence they can
expect relief, they will be <hi>blocked</hi> up, or their Ships fired in the Port;
the Glory of that action of <hi>Blake,</hi> at the <hi>Canaries</hi> is worthy of their great
conſideration, who entred their Port and fired all their Ships in Harbor,
though there were <hi>thirteen block houſes,</hi> Caſtles, and workes where an
innumerable multitude of Cannon were planted, and moſt furiouſly
fired againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships; where there is a good <hi>wind</hi> and <hi>tide,</hi>
and noble reſolutions (as I hope they will find there is in the <hi>Engliſh</hi>)
they need not fear any artillery whatſoever: Let the <hi>Iriſh</hi> remember
their ſucceſs when they were encouraged by the <hi>Spaniard</hi> (and aſſiſted
by the <hi>Pope</hi>) to rebel, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> being then the moſt potent Prince
in <hi>Europe;</hi> And in caſe the moſt Chriſtian King ſhould put an Army in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Fleet to land, except he were Prince of <hi>the Air,</hi> and could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
the <hi>Sea,</hi> and <hi>Tempeſts,</hi> he is not ſure to land them; let him think
of the expedition of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th.</hi> againſt <hi>Argiers,</hi> and the ill and
untimely fate which did attend it, however I am ſure he cannot forget
<hi>Goree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor let the <hi>Iriſh</hi> who have Eſtates, and who differ from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in
point of <hi>Religion,</hi> imagine that the communion of profeſſion may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
them more than the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>Ambition,</hi> and <hi>Covetouſneſs</hi> of
the <hi>French;</hi> what they may expect from a Forraigner they may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture
by the anſwer which the Duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> gave in this
caſe in <hi>Eighty Eight,</hi> that his <hi>Sword knew no difference between a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
and a Heretick, but that he came to make way for his Maſter</hi> And
let them be aſſured that, that which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have left them of their
Eſtates, the <hi>French</hi> will take from them, for though themſelves be
<hi>Catholicks,</hi> yet their <hi>Eſtates</hi> will be <hi>Hereticks;</hi> It's poſſible that ſome
of the meaner ſort of <hi>Iriſh</hi> (if the <hi>French</hi> ſhould prevaile) may mend
their conditions, but thoſe who have Eſtates will by their adhering
to the <hi>French</hi> be aſſuredly <hi>undone;</hi> For the <hi>French</hi> will not think them
fitting to be entruſted with their Eſtates, or to be <hi>faithful</hi> to him,
who were rebellious to their own natural King and Soveraign Lord.</p>
            <p>For King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond is your <hi>natural Prince,</hi> deſcended from
your own <hi>Blood Royal,</hi> he being lineally deſcended from <hi>Firgatins,</hi>
Second Son of the then Reigning King of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>firſt of Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49363:16"/>
which was antiently peopled from thence; So you ought to pay His
Majeſty the Allegiance due from natural born Subjects, not from a
<hi>conquered people,</hi> which now you can no more eſteem your ſelves.</p>
            <p>There are about 10000 <hi>Iriſh</hi> born to Eſtates, and are partly diſpoſſeth
theſe for their loſſes, and others for reſtraint of, and in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
are <hi>diſcontented,</hi> but they do not conſider their own Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
cauſed their ruin; by their murmurings I perceive let the ſentence
be never ſo <hi>juſt,</hi> it will not hinder the condemned from riſing againſt
the <hi>Judge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though ſome <hi>Bravo</hi>'s, <hi>Hadlanders,</hi> and <hi>Needemites</hi> may joyn with
Forreign Forces, I am apt to think the wiſe and conſiderate people
(tho Papiſts) will not forfeit their Allegiance to their natural Prince;
for proof of which fidelity in this kind you need go no further than
the late Wars in the time of the Earl of <hi>Tyrene;</hi> wherein they were
aſſaulted with as powerful temptations to move them from their <hi>Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>
as poſſibly could be preſented unto them, for at that time not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the <hi>King of Spain</hi> did confederate himſelf with the Rebels and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his forces at <hi>Kinſale</hi> for their aſſiſtance, but the <hi>Biſhop of Rome</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
with his Breves and <hi>Bulls</hi> ſollicited the Nobility and Gentry of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> to revolt from their obedience to the Queen, declaring that
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did fight againſt the <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> and ought to be
oppoſed as much as the <hi>Turks,</hi> promiſing the ſame favour to ſuch as
ſhould ſet upon them, as he doth unto ſuch as fight againſt Infidels;
And yet for all theſe promiſes and threatnings of the <hi>Pope,</hi> which was
alſo ſeconded by a Declaration of the Divines of <hi>Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidolid,</hi>
not only many of the Lords and Gentlemen did conſtantly
adhere in their Allegiance to the Queen, but were alſo encouraged ſo
to do by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts within the <hi>Pale</hi> in the Connty of <hi>Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
tho they were of Popiſh profeſſion.</p>
            <p>I pray conſider that horrid <hi>Maſſacre</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
committed after they had lived together for <hi>forty years</hi> in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſecurity and happineſs, how by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> they were ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that there were ſcarce an <hi>Iriſh</hi> man through <hi>Ireland</hi> that durſt
hold up his hand againſt them; and the Kingdome became ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>populated,
that conſidering what vaſt numbers of people were <hi>deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by thoſe three great Judgments of Heaven the Sword, Famine
<hi>and Plague,</hi> it's thought that in the Concluſion of that war, there was
not left living the <hi>eighth part</hi> of all the <hi>Iriſh</hi> nation, the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
being waſted and conſumed; where for ten ſometimes <hi>twenty</hi> or
<hi>thirty miles,</hi> nay indeed almoſt all the Kingdome over (except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſons) one ſhould nor behold <hi>man, bird</hi> or <hi>beaſt</hi>
appear, the very wild Fowls of the air, and the wild beaſts of the
Fields, being either dead or having departed out of thoſe deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and thouſands of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> were dayly ſtarving for want of
Food, who did in their extremity, ordinarily feed on the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
Horſes, for which no ſatisfaction was at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
but with the loſs of their Lives, nay the Famine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49363:16"/>
at laſt grew to that height that they did not only feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Horſes, but upon dead <hi>Corps</hi> taken out of the <hi>Graves.</hi>
All which muſt be acknowledged a juſt Judgment of God
inflicted on them for their notorious <hi>Barbariſm</hi> committed
in their Maſſacring of the Engliſh.</p>
            <p>A ſad Tragedy, and may it never be re-acted; but
now His Majeſty, having out of his Princely goodneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored
many <hi>Iriſh Papiſts</hi> (which did little deſerve ſo ſignal
a favour) to their <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and to live where they pleaſe
without any reſtraint, and to injoy all things in plenty;
and the whole Kingdom beginning to flouriſh and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
its glory; now to <hi>rebel</hi> againſt ſo gracious and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a Prince, and to bring the ſame Calamities, and
worſe (if poſſible) upon the Nation, and by betraying it
into the hands of a Foreign power, are Acts ſo full of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
and amazement, that no man I ſhould think, (were I
not convinced from their own mouths to the contrary)
could be ſo ungratefully wicked.</p>
            <p>You cannot rationally think, that <hi>France</hi> will ever give
you any conſiderable aſſiſtance, but may engage you in a
Rebellion, and then leave you to ſhift for your ſelves: And
ſo by that means bring a ruin and extirpation upon your
ſelves and Poſterities; conſider the late, but never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
caſe of the <hi>Meſsineſſes,</hi> who caſt off their Obedience
to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> their Natural Prince, and fled to the
protection of the <hi>French;</hi> after they had by their Taxes
and Oppreſſions drained away all their Mony, the <hi>French</hi>
deſerted them; and they thereby became expoſed to the
diſpleaſure of an inraged Prince, and to all the Miſeries
and calamities imaginable: The <hi>Meſsineſſes</hi> of all People
on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> being before the moſt flouriſhing,
but ſince their Rebellion the pooreſt and moſt miſerable.
Let this example be an Anſwer to all the <hi>French</hi> Charms
the Prieſts ſhall lay before you, and take time to conſider,
if you ſhall be ſo imprudent and deſperately wicked as to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49363:17"/>
caſt off your Obedience to your Natural Prince, whether
the ſame Fate and Calamities may not attend you. Take it
for a <hi>Maxime</hi> of Eternal Truth, and which you muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
by your dear bought experience, that after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
is ſuppreſſed, the King is <hi>more King,</hi> and the Subject
<hi>more Subject;</hi> Many whoſe Anceſtors were deep in the late
Rebellion, by his Majeſties Royal favour are now reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in their Eſtates, if not in all, yet in ſuch a part as may
give them a comfortable ſubſiſtance (and I muſt tell you
it's better to have a <hi>piece of Bread,</hi> then no Bread at all.)
Have you not a free exerciſe of your <hi>Religion</hi> throughout
the whole Kingdom? Have you not your <hi>titular</hi> Arch-Biſhops,
Biſhops, Vicar-General, Provincial Conſiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
Deans, Abbots, Priors, &amp;c. Who without controul
exerciſe a voluntary juriſdiction over thoſe of the Romiſh
perſwaſion? Are the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> put in execution againſt
you? Have you not as great, if not greater freedom, and
<hi>indulgence</hi> than thoſe of the <hi>Evangelical Communion?</hi> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if all theſe Princely Favours and tender proceedings of
His Sacred Majeſty towards the Papiſts in that Kingdom
cannot contain them within the due bounds of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and
Obedience, they deſerve to be made ſtanding <hi>Monuments</hi>
of his Juſtice.</p>
            <p>But imagine the worſt, let it be granted that the <hi>French</hi>
are Landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and poſſeſſed of a Port or two
there, and that many of the Natives (for all 'tis like will
not forfeit their Allegiance) revolt and reſort unto the
<hi>French,</hi> yet I hope there is no ſuch danger, as is vulgarly
conceived in loſing that Kingdom, now that they have
timely notice to prevent. For a Plot diſcovered is more
than half prevented, and if after ſuch fair and frequent
warning we ſhould ſuffer ſuch an important place to
be loſt, we are ſure the moſt careleſs or infatuated People
in the World.</p>
            <p>For Ports gained muſt be maintained and ſupplyed by
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49363:17"/>
Sea; which how uncertain and difficult it is to effect, our
<hi>Fleets</hi> being better then theirs, is unanſwerable: To attend
the defence of them only would but multiply their trouble
and charges, and give the Engliſh there no other Harm
then ſome inconvenience; from the which, time will free
them; for no tenable Fortifications can ever hold out the
Siege of a powerful Aſſailant, that is Maſter of the Field,
and ſo it muſt be granted the <hi>Engliſh</hi> will or may be.</p>
            <p>An Invader whoſe Object is Conqueſt, muſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
himſelf in a Port, but draw into Field; great Armies
require a World of Horſes for the draught of Artillery,
Ammunitions, Victuals, Utenſils for the War, Tents,
Baggage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which cannot either be brought from <hi>France</hi>
nor furniſhed by the Rebels. The County of <hi>Kerry</hi> is the
Place deſigned for their Landing, a very remote Part as
any in <hi>Ireland,</hi> yet furniſht with a good Haven; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
will be very imprudent (whereſoever they ſhall Land) if
they drive not the Country before them, whereby they
will fail both of <hi>Horſes</hi> for draught, (without which they
cannot march) and of Victuals or any thing elſe, which
may be uſeful unto them.</p>
            <p>So did the <hi>French</hi> deal with <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth <hi>Anno</hi> 1536.
Who entred <hi>France</hi> by way of <hi>Province,</hi> with an Army of
50000 <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Foot,</hi> they Commanded all the Horſe
and Cattle in the County to be driven out of the Enemies
reach, the Corn, Straw, and what elſe might be <hi>food</hi> for
<hi>Horſes,</hi> and all other Moveables to be carryed into Places
of Safety.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ovens</hi> and <hi>Mills</hi> to be broken down, the <hi>Wines</hi> in
Casks to be Staved, &amp; for corrupting of Waters cauſe Corn
to be caſt into the Wells, leaving the Country like a vaſt
<hi>Deſert;</hi> whereby the Emperours Army within few days
(almoſt ſtarved and diſeaſed) was not 25000 ſtrong.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49363:18"/>
If <hi>Charles</hi> could not upon a <hi>Continent,</hi> provide himſelf of
Carriages ſufficient for the uſe of his Army, or <hi>Food</hi> for
his hungry <hi>Soldiers</hi> in the plentiful Country of <hi>Province,</hi>
how much leſs ſhall an <hi>Invader</hi> by Sea be able to bring
them with him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Province</hi> being thus uſed, and the Cities well guarded,
the Invader for want of Relief in the Country, muſt eat up
his own <hi>Stores:</hi> And within ſhort time (if they be many)
will be <hi>Conſumed,</hi> if few will be <hi>Forced out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the number of <hi>Horſes</hi> the ſtrength of Armies princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
conſiſts, the Tranſporting of 5000 <hi>Horſe</hi> requires
more <hi>Tonnage</hi> than 30000 <hi>Foot;</hi> and how they will be
able to Tranſport any number of <hi>Horſe</hi> (without which
they are of no <hi>Power</hi>) the <hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> being at Sea, I muſt
confeſs I am to learn.</p>
            <p>The way of <hi>Conqueſt</hi> is to <hi>provoke Battel,</hi> the advantage
of the Defendant is to avoid it, but upon appearance of an
aſſured Victory, which the Maſters of the Field may do
at Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The lingering of time dayly conſumes the Invaders,
both by <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> light <hi>Skirmiſhes</hi> (which upon every days
March, at Fords, Bridges, and Streights they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void)
and by other Caſualties.</p>
            <p>Their ſupply will be ſlow, and ſubject to peril, whilſt wants of
the Engliſh (they having their Country to Friend) will eaſily be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay the <hi>French</hi> can at their pleaſure ſupply them,
with Men, Victuals, and all things neceſſary for their carrying
on the War, by reaſon of their great number of Ships.</p>
            <p>I am apt to think this will prove a great miſtake in you,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49363:18"/>
they will find it impoſſible to give any ſuccors, when the
<hi>Engliſh Fleet</hi> is at Sea, as you may aſſure your ſelves it will
be, when there is the leaſt appearance of an Invaſion;
and I muſt tell you its not the multitude of Ships that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
Victory, a <hi>few good nimble</hi> Ships of War are a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Fleet, than any Fleet can be compoſed of greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
over preſſed with heavy Luggage, they are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in themſelves uſeleſs, but a cumber to thoſe that ſhould
Fight, and the loſing of them is the apparent loſs of the
Enterprize.</p>
            <p>There was never a more Magnificent Fleet ſwimming
upon the Ocean, then that which <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond brought
upon the <hi>Engliſh Coaſt,</hi> a Navy ſo well Manned and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitioned,
that the like till than was never ſeen, it was
the <hi>Glory of the Sea,</hi> yet it was defeated by her Majeſties
own <hi>Fleet,</hi> built in her own Realm, the Captains, Pilots,
Maſter Gunners, and Sailors, all her natural Subjects, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was borrowed from her Neighbours, whereby her
Triumph was more glorious; that famous Victory was
not gotten by chance or by favour of Winds, and Storms,
but next unto God, by the goodneſs of the Engliſh Ships,
the Valour and Dexterity of their Gunners, and Saylors;
and eſpecially by the conduct and direction of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders:
Why then ſhould the <hi>French Fleet</hi> be now more
terrible than <hi>that</hi> was in Eighty eight, nay the Engliſh are
to doubt them leſs, ſince by the Providence of His Majeſty
the <hi>Royal Navy,</hi> and the Merchants Ships are now more
in number, better fitted for the War, and greater of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
than they ever were.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If you begin a War (or rather a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> for ſo it is)

               <item>I. A Navy well Furniſhed, to cut off all their correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podence
with any King or State.</item>
               <item>II. An Army well paid to keep up Garriſons.</item>
               <item>III. Laws well executed to alter their miſchievous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</item>
               <item>IV. A Miniſtry well ſetled to Civilize and inſtruct them.</item>
               <item>V. And laſtly, Strict care taken to puniſh all Prieſts,
and Jeſuits, that are the Nurſes of Rebellion, diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of States, Mortal Enemies to all Proteſtant
Governments, and indeed the Common Incendiaries
of the Kingdom of <hi>Irelnad.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>But I ſhall not inlarge or preſume to direct particularly
on theſe neceſſary Heads, but humbly leave them to the
conſideration of Authority.</p>
            <p>Whilſt to you my <hi>Beloved,</hi> (as long as you ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<hi>Loyal) Country-men!</hi> I apply my ſelf, whatever ill
Thoughts that you may have of me, all I ſhall return in
anſwer is, <hi>Am I your Enemy becauſe I tell you the Truth?</hi> I have
repreſented to you the fatal Conſequences of your paſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
and ſhewn you the improbability of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
deſigns, which I certainly know, many ill men are
fomenting and carrying on amongſt you. But beſides all
theſe Moral and Politick diſcouragements, I would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have you take notice, that there is a moſt juſt God in
Heaven, who by his Providence and uncontrouble Power
will aſſuredly blaſt all your attempts; and Revenge the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49363:19"/>
Blood of Innocents, and puniſh Murder, and Rebellion,
and Treachery; and ſupport and preſerve his true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Worſhip againſt all the moſt crafty, moſt plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and moſt powerful devices whatſoever; therefore
as you love your Peace, your Safety, your Eſtates, your
Lives, and your Souls, Study to be quiet: Hearken not
to the vain charmings of your Prieſts, who deſign only to
make as much ſlaves of you in Temporals as they already
do in Spirituals; exert your Reaſons, and ſuffer not your
ſelves to be led hoodwinkt into deſtruction, by a vain
empty fooliſh ſtory of Tradition and ridiculous Cuſtoms
and Notions; open your Eyes and give your rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
but leave, impartially to inquire and examine things,
and you will certainly find, that you have hitherto been
befooled and Prieſt ridden, and that what you call Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion, in all things wherein it differs from
what is believed, own'd and enjoyn'd to be practiſed by
the Proteſtants, is nothing in the World but a cheat; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd
to ſupport and gratifie either the Ambition or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs
of your ſelf-deſigning Clergy.</p>
            <p>This much however, (having this publique opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to diſcharge my Conſcience, and expreſs my ſincere Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to you) I thought fit to ſay, proteſting that in all
that I have diſcovered and here written, I have had no
aim at Temporal advantage, private Revenge, or any other
ſiniſter deſign; but that I have done it only and purely for
the Glory of God, the Service of my King, the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Government, the Real good of you, my dear
Country-men! and the disburthening of my own Soul.
To which good ends I Heartily wiſh theſe poor Papers
(though never ſo inartificially dreſſed) may be effectual:
And with that ſatisfaction commit them, and my ſelf, to
the Worlds <hi>Cenſure,</hi> and Gods <hi>Protection.</hi>
