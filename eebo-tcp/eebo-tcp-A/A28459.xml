            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

would ſcarce gain belief, even from my modern

me, That no ingenuous perſon will think me ſo

Upon Sunday 24. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Mr. <hi>Crosby</hi> (an
eminent Divine of that City,) preach'd before
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> in the Cathedral Church; And
in his Prayer ſtyled <hi>His Majeſty Supreme head
over all perſons in his Dominions:</hi> At which
ſome of the <hi>Scots</hi> took exception, and Mr.
<hi>Crosby</hi> was afterwards admoniſh'd to forbear
ſuch expreſſions.</p>
            <p>Tueſday the 26. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> was a Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz
in <hi>Pitchcroft</hi> neer the City, of ſuch Loyal
Subjects of that and the adjacent Counties
as would come in to <hi>His Majeſties</hi> aid; Here
appeared <hi>Francis Lord Talbot</hi> (now Earl of
<hi>Shrewsbury)</hi> with about ſixty horſe; Mr. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin
Touchet,</hi> Sir <hi>John Packington,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter
Blount,</hi> Sir <hi>Ralph Clare,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ralph Sheldon</hi> of

forty horſe, Mr. <hi>Thomas Hornyold</hi> of <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more

Mr. <hi>Rob. Blount</hi> of <hi>Kenſwick,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rob Wigmore</hi>
of <hi>Lucton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Knotsford,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter
Blount</hi> and divers others. Notwithſtanding
which acceſs, the number of <hi>His Majeſties</hi>
Army both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> was conceiv'd
not to exceed 12000. men, (viz.) ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Scots</hi> and about 2000. <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thoſe
too not excellently Arm'd, nor plentifully
ſtored with Ammunition.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Cromwell</hi> (that grand Patron of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55910:10"/>
Sectaries) had amaſs'd together a numerous
Body of Rebels, commanded by himſelf in
cheif, and by the <hi>Lord Grey</hi> of <hi>Groby, Fleetwood</hi>
&amp; <hi>Lambert</hi> under him, conſiſting of above thirty
thouſand Men, (being generally the Scum and
Froth of the whole Kingdome;) One part of
which were Sectaries, who through a Fanatique
zeal, were become <hi>Devotes</hi> to this great <hi>Idol;</hi>
The other part ſeduc'd perſons, who either
by force or fear were unfortunately made
Actors or participants in this ſo horrible
and fatal a Tragedy.</p>
            <p>Thus then began the Pickeerings to the
grand Engagement. <hi>Major General Maſſey</hi>
with a commanded party, being ſent by <hi>His
Majeſtie</hi> to ſecure the Bridge and Paſs at
<hi>Upton</hi> upon <hi>Severn,</hi> 7. miles below <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
On Thurſday the 28. of <hi>Auguſt, Lambert</hi> with
a far greater number of Rebels attaq'd him,
and atter ſome diſpute gain'd the Paſs, the
river being then fordable. Here the <hi>Major
General</hi> behav'd himſelf very gallantly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Shot in the hand from ſome Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
the Enemy had placed in the Church,
and retreated in good order to <hi>Worceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During this Encounter, <hi>Cromwell</hi> himſelf,
(whoſe Head-quarter was the night before
at <hi>Perſhore,)</hi> advanc'd to <hi>Stoughton</hi> within 4.
miles of the City on the Southſide, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55910:10"/>
that Evening a Party of his horſe faced it.</p>
            <p>The next day (<hi>August</hi> the 29.) the Sultan
appear'd with a great body of horſe and foot
on <hi>Redhil</hi> within a mile of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> where he
made a <hi>Bonne- mine,</hi> but attempted nothing;
And that night his Head-quarters were at
Judge <hi>Berkleys</hi> houſe at <hi>Speachley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Saturday <hi>(Auguſt</hi> 30.) It was reſolv'd by
<hi>His Majeſty,</hi> a Council <hi>of</hi> War, to give the
Enemy a <hi>Camiſado,</hi> by beating up his Quarters
that night with 1500. ſelect horſe and foot,
commanded by <hi>Major General Middleton,</hi> and
Sir <hi>William Keyth;</hi> All of them wearing their
<hi>Shirts</hi> over their Armor for diſtinction;
which accordingly was attempted, and might
in all probability have been ſucceſsful, had
not the deſign been moſt traiterouſly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
to the Rebels by one <hi>Guyes,</hi> a Tailor
in the Town, who was hang'd afterwards as
the juſt reward of his treachery: In this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Major Knox</hi> was ſlain and ſome few taken
Priſoners.</p>
            <p>A conſiderable party of the Rebels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by <hi>Col. Lambert, Col. Ingoldsby,</hi> (not
yet a convert) and <hi>Col. Gibbons</hi> being got
over the <hi>Severn</hi> at <hi>Upton,</hi> march'd the next
day to <hi>Powick Town,</hi> where they made an <hi>Halt;</hi>
for <hi>Powick-bridge,</hi> lying upon the river <hi>Team</hi>
(between <hi>Powick Town</hi> &amp; <hi>Worceſter,)</hi> was guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55910:11"/>
by a Brigade of <hi>His Majeſties</hi> horſe and
foot, commanded by <hi>Major General Robert
Montgomery,</hi> and <hi>Col. George Keyth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fatal 3. of <hi>September</hi> being come,
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> this morning holds a Council of
War upon the top of the <hi>Colledge-church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeple,</hi>
the better to diſcover the Enemies
poſture; Here <hi>His Majeſty</hi> obſerv'd ſome
firing at <hi>Powick,</hi> and <hi>Cromwell</hi> making a bridge
of boats over <hi>Severn</hi> under <hi>Bunshill,</hi> a mile
below the City towards <hi>Team</hi> mouth; <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> preſently goes down, commands all
to their Arms, and marches in perſon to
<hi>Powick bridge</hi> to give orders, as well for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
that bridge, as for oppoſing the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the other of boats, and haſted back to his
Army in the City.</p>
            <p>Soon after <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was gone from
<hi>Powick bridge,</hi> the Enemy aſſaulted it furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which was well defended by <hi>Montgomery,</hi>
till himſelf was dangerouſly wounded, and his
Ammunition ſpent, ſo that he was forced to
make a diſorderly retreat into <hi>Worceſter;</hi>
And <hi>Col. Keyth</hi> was taken Priſoner at the
Bridge.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Cromwell</hi> had with much
celerity finiſht his bridge of boats and plancks
over the main river, without any conſiderable
oppoſition, whereby he might communicate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55910:11"/>
with thoſe of his party at <hi>Powick bridge,</hi> and
was the firſt Man that led the reſt over, and
then went back himſelf and rais'd a <hi>Battery</hi> of
great guns againſt the <hi>Fort-royal</hi> on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
the City.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> being return'd from <hi>Poick bridge,</hi>
march'd, with the <hi>Duke of Buckingham</hi> and
ſome of His Cavalry, through the City, and
out at <hi>Sudbury gate</hi> by the <hi>Fort-royal,</hi> where
the Rebels great ſhot came frequently neer
His Sacred Perſon.</p>
            <p>By this time <hi>Cromwell</hi> was got to an
advantageous Poſt at <hi>Perry wood</hi> within a
mile of the City, ſwelling with pride and
confident in the numbers of his men; but
<hi>Duke Hamilton</hi> (formerly Lord <hi>Lanerick,</hi>) with
his own Troop and ſome High-landers, Sir
<hi>Alexander Forbus</hi> with his Regiment of Foot,
and divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords and Gentlemen vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntiers,
by <hi>His Majeſties</hi> command and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
engaged him, and did great
execution upon his beſt men, forced the great
<hi>Sultan</hi> (as the <hi>Rhodians</hi> in like caſe did the
<hi>Turk</hi>) to retreat with his <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and were
once Maſters of his great Guns.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>His Majeſty</hi> gave an incomparable Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of valor to the reſt, by charging in
Perſon, which the <hi>High-landers</hi> eſpecially
imitated in a great meaſure, fighting with
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55910:12"/>
the but-ends of their muskets, when their
Ammunition was ſpent; but new Supplies
of Rebels being continually poured upon
them, and the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſe not coming up
in due time from the Town to <hi>His Majeſties</hi>
relief, <hi>His Army</hi> was forced to retreat in at
<hi>Sudbury gate</hi> in much diſorder.</p>
            <p>In this Action <hi>Duke Hamilton</hi> (who fought
valiantly) was mortally wounded, of which
he dyed within few days; Sir <hi>John Douglas</hi> alſo
received his deaths wound, and Sir <hi>Alexander
Forbus</hi> was Shot through both the calves of
his legs, lay in the wood all night, and was
brought a priſoner to <hi>Worceſter</hi> the next
day.</p>
            <p>The Rebels in this Encounter had great
advantage as well in their numbers, as by
fighting both with horſe and foot, againſt <hi>His
Majeſties</hi> foot only, the greateſt part of His
horſe being wedg'd up in the Town; and
when the foot were defeated, a part of <hi>His
Majeſties</hi> horſe afterwards fought againſt both
the Enemies horſe and foot, upon great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Sudbury gate</hi> a Cart loaden with Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
was overthrown, and lay croſs the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the gate, ſo that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> could not
ride into the Town, but was forc'd to diſmount
and come in on foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:55910:12"/>
In the <hi>Friers ſtreet, His Majeſty</hi> put off his
Armor, (which was heavy and troubleſome to
him,) and took a freſh horſe, and then percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
many of His Foot-ſouldiers begin to
throw down their Arms and decline fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> rod up and down among
them, ſometimes with his hat in his hand,
entreating them to ſtand to their Arm's and
fight like Men, other whiles encouraging
them; but ſeeing himſelf not able to prevail,
ſaid, <hi>I had rather you would ſhoot me, then keep
me alive to ſee the ſad conſequences of this
fatal day:</hi> Such was the magnaminity of this
Prophetique King.</p>
            <p>During this hot Engagement at <hi>Perry-wood</hi>
and <hi>Red-hil,</hi> the Rebels on the other ſide the
Water poſſeſs'd themſelves of <hi>S. Johns,</hi> and
thoſe of <hi>His Majeſties Army</hi> that were there,
without any great reſiſtance laid down their
Arms and ſubmitted to mercy.</p>
            <p>When ſome of the Enemy were entred,
and entring the Town both at the <hi>Key, Caſtle
hill</hi>) and <hi>Sudbury gate,</hi> without any Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
Th' <hi>Earl of Cleveland,</hi> Sir <hi>James Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
Col, William Carlis</hi> (then Major to the
Lord <hi>Talbot</hi>) Capt. <hi>Tho. Hornyold,</hi> Capt. <hi>Tho.
Giffard,</hi> and Capt. <hi>Richard Kemble,</hi> (Captain
Lieutenant to the Lord <hi>Talbot</hi>) rallied what
force they could (though inconſiderable to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55910:13"/>
the Rebels numbers,) and Charg'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
very gallantly at <hi>Sudbury gate</hi> and in the
Street or that name: Here Sir <hi>James</hi> and
Capt. <hi>Kemble</hi> were deſperately wounded, and
others ſlain; yet this Action did much ſecure
<hi>His Majeſties</hi> march out at S. <hi>Martins gate,</hi>
who had otherwiſe been in danger of being
taken in the Town.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time <hi>Colonel Drummond</hi>
with a Party of <hi>Scots</hi> maintain'd the <hi>Caſtle hill</hi>
with much reſolution, till ſuch time as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
were agreed on for Quarter; So that
the Rebels, having at laſt ſubdued all their
opponents, fell to Plundring the City unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully,
few or none of the Citizens eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
but ſuch as were Sectaries and of their
party.</p>
            <p>When <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſaw no hope of Rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
His thus diſcomfited foot, He march'd
out of <hi>Worceſter</hi> at S. <hi>Martins gate,</hi> about ſix
of the Clock in the evening with his main
Body of horſe, as then commanded by <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
David Leſley,</hi> but were now in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p>The Foot <hi>conſiſting</hi> moſt of <hi>Scots</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all either ſlain or taken, and ſuch of
them (who in the Battle eſcaped death,) liv'd
longer to dye for the moſt part more miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;
many of them being afterwards knock'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55910:13"/>
o'the head by Country people, ſome bought
and ſold like ſlaves for a ſmall price, others
went begging up and down, till Charity failing
them, their neceſſities brought upon them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes,
and diſeaſes death.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was come to <hi>Barbon's
bridge,</hi> about half a mile out of <hi>Worcester, He</hi>
made ſeveral Stands, faced about and deſired
the <hi>Duke of Buckingham, Lord Wilmet,</hi> and other
of His Commanders, that they might rally
and try the fortune of War once more.
But at the Bridge a ſerious Conſultation was
held, and then perceiving many of the Troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to throw off their Arms and ſhift for
themſelves, they were all of opinion, the day
was irrecoverably loſt, and that their only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
work was to ſave <hi>His Majeſty</hi> from
thoſe ravenous Wolves and Regicides;
Whereupon <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> by adviſe of His
Council reſolv'd to march for <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Immediately after this Reſult, the <hi>Duke</hi>
ask'd the <hi>Lord Talbot,</hi> If he could direct the
way Northwards, His Lordſhip anſwer'd, that
he had one <hi>Walker</hi> in his Troop (former Scout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
to <hi>Col, Sands</hi>) that knew the way
well; Who was accordingly call'd to be the
Guide, and perform'd that duty for ſome
miles; but being come to <hi>Kinver heath,</hi> not
far from <hi>Kederminſter,</hi> and day-light being
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55910:14"/>
gone, <hi>Walker</hi> was at a puzzle in the way.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>His Majeſty</hi> made a Stand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
with the <hi>Duke, Earl of Derby, Lord Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot,</hi>
&amp;c. whether He might march at leaſt
to take ſome hours reſt; The <hi>Earl of Derby</hi>
told <hi>His Majesty,</hi> that in His flight from
<hi>Wiggan</hi> to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> he had met with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
honeſt man, and a great convenience of
concealment at <hi>Boſcobelhouſe</hi> (before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,)
but withall acquainted the King, it was
a Recuſants houſe. And it was ſuggeſted, that
thoſe people (being accuſtomed to perſecution
and ſearches,) were moſt like to have the
readieſt means and ſafeſt contrivances to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
Him; <hi>His Majeſty</hi> therefore reſolv'd to
goe thither.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> being made acquainted
with <hi>His Majeſties</hi> reſolution, and finding
<hi>Walker</hi> dubious of the way, called for Mr.
<hi>Charles Giffard,</hi> (a faithful Subject, and of the
noble Family of <hi>Chillington</hi>) to conduct <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> towards <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> which office Mr. <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard</hi>
willingly undertook, having one <hi>Yates a</hi>
ſervant with him, very expert in the wayes
of that Countrey; and being come neer
<hi>Sturbridge,</hi> it was under conſideration whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſhould march through that
Town or no, and reſolved in the affirmative,
and that all about His Perſon ſhould ſpeak
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:55910:14"/>
French, to prevent any diſcovery of <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi>
preſence.</p>
            <p>Mean time <hi>Leſley,</hi> with the Scottiſh Horſe,
had, in the cloſe of the Evening, taken the
more direct way North-ward by <hi>Newport, His
Majeſty</hi> being left onely attended by the Duke
of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dail,</hi>
Lord <hi>Talbot,</hi> Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> Colonel <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas

<hi>Armorer,</hi> (ſince Knighted) Mr. <hi>Hugh
May, Mr. Charle Giffard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Peter Street,</hi>
and ſome others, in all about ſixty
Horſe.</p>
            <p>At a houſe about a mile beyond <hi>Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
His Majeſty</hi> drank and eat a cruſt of
bread, the houſe affording no better proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and as <hi>His Majesty</hi> rode on, he diſcourſed
with Col <hi>Roſcarrock</hi> touching <hi>Boſcobel-houſe,</hi>
and the ſecurity which the <hi>Earl of Darby</hi> and
he found at that place.</p>
            <p>Upon further conſideration by <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
and Council, and to the end the Company
might not know whither <hi>His Majeſty</hi> directly
intended, Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> was required to conduct
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> to ſome houſe neere <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> the
better to blind the deſign of going thither:
Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> propoſed <hi>Whiteladies</hi> (another Seat

            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> and his Retinue (being ſafely
conducted to <hi>Whiteladies</hi> by <hi>Mr. Giffard</hi>) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted,
now, as they hop'd out of danger of
any preſent ſurpriſe by purſuit; <hi>George
Pendrel</hi> (who was a ſervant in the houſe) open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Dores, and after <hi>His Majeſty</hi> and the
Lords were entered the Houſe, <hi>His Majeſtes</hi>
Horſe was brought into the Hall, and by this
time it was about break of day on <hi>Thurſday</hi>
morning: Here every one was in a ſad conſult
how to eſcape the fury of bloud-thirſty Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
but the greateſt ſolicitude was to
ſave the <hi>King,</hi> who was both hungry and tired
with this long and haſty March.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Roſcarrock</hi> preſently cauſed <hi>Barthol.
Martin</hi> (a boy in the Houſe) to be ſent to <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobel</hi>
for <hi>William Penderel,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charles
Giffard</hi> ſent alſo for <hi>Richard Penderel,</hi> who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
near hand at <hi>Hobbal Grange,</hi> they both
came forthwith to <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> and were
brought into the Parlour to the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Derby,</hi>
who immediately took them into the inner
Parlour, where the King was, and told <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
Penderel</hi> in particular, <hi>This is the King,</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:55910:15"/>
(pointing at <hi>His Majeſty) thou muſt have a care

and Mr. <hi>Giffard</hi> and alſo much conjure
<hi>Richard</hi> to have an eſpecial care of his Charge.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> were thus ſent
for, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had been adviſed to rub his
hands on the back of the Chimney, and with

and other Princely ornaments, put on a nog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
courſe ſhirt of <hi>Edward Martins,</hi> who lived
in the Houſe, and <hi>Richard Penderels</hi> green
Suit, and Leather Doublet, but had not time
to be ſo exactly diſguiſed as he was afterwards;
for both <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard Penderel</hi> did ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſe

came to the Houſe within half an hour after
the Company were gone.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Penderel</hi> conducted the King out at

receiv'd ſome refreſhment at a little obſcure
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55910:17"/>
houſe, and afterwards met with two honeſt:
Laborers in an adjoining wood, to whom they
commmunicated the exigent and diſtreſſe
which the fortune of war had reduc'd them to,
and finding them like to prove faithful, the
<hi>Duke</hi> thought fit to imitate his Royal Maſter,
quitted his horſe, delivered his <hi>George</hi> (which
was given him by the Queen of <hi>England)</hi> to
Mr. <hi>May</hi> (who preſerved it through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and after reſtor'd it to his <hi>Grace</hi> in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi>
and chang'd habit with one of the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and in this diſguiſe was convey'd by one
<hi>Nich. Mathews</hi> a Carpenter, to the houſe of
Mr. <hi>Hawley</hi> an hearty Cavalier at <hi>Bilſtrop</hi> in
<hi>Nottingamſhire,</hi> from thence to the Lady <hi>Villi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
houſe at <hi>Brooksby</hi> in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and, after
many hardſhips and encounters, his Grace got
ſecure to <hi>London,</hi> and from thence to <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame time the Lord <hi>Leviston,</hi> Col.
<hi>Blague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Darcy,</hi> and Mr. <hi>May,</hi> all quitted
their horſes, ſeverally ſhifted for themſelves,
and moſt of them, through various dangers and
ſufferings, contrived their eſcapes; In particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Mr. <hi>May</hi> lay 21. dayes in a hay-mow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to one <hi>Bold</hi> an honeſt husband man,
who liv'd neer <hi>Cheſſardine; Bold</hi> having all that
time Rebel-ſouldiers quartered in his houſe,
yet faild not to give a conſtant relief to his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:55910:18"/>
more welcom Gueſt, and when the Coaſt was
clear of Souldiers, Mr. <hi>May</hi> came to <hi>London</hi> on
foot in a diſguiſe.</p>
            <p>The Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> (ſeeing no hope of rally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,)
haſted towards his Fathers houſe at <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
neer <hi>Newport,</hi> where being arrived, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd
his horſe into a neighbours barn, but was
immediately purſued by the Rebels, who
found the horſe ſadled, and by that concluded
my Lord to be not far off, ſo that they ſearch'd
<hi>Longford</hi> houſe narrowly, and ſome of them
continu'd in it four or five dayes; during all
which time my Lord was in a cloſe place in one
of the outhouſes, almoſt ſtifl'd for want of air,
and had infallibly periſh'd for want of food,
had he not been once relieved in the dead of
night, and with much difficulty by a ſervant;
yet his Lordſhip thought it a great providence,
even by theſe hardſhips, to eſcape the fury of
ſuch enemies, who ſought the deſtruction
of the Nobility, as well as of their King.</p>
            <p>In this interim the valiant Earl of <hi>Cleveland,</hi>
(who being above 60. years of age, had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
21. dayes together upon a trotting horſe)
had alſo made his eſcape from <hi>Worceſter</hi> when
all the fighting work was over, and was got to
<hi>Woodcot</hi> in <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> whither he was purſued,
and taken at one Mris. <hi>Broughtons</hi> houſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Scotch Cavalry</hi> (having no place to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55910:18"/>
unto neerer then <hi>Scotland,</hi>) were ſoon
after totally diſperſed, and moſt of them
taken by the Rebels and Country people in
<hi>Cheſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and parts adjacent.</p>
            <p>Thus was this <hi>Royal Army</hi> totally ſubdued,
thus diſperſed; and if in this ſo important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
any of the Scottiſh Commanders were
treacherous at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> (as ſome ſuſpected,)
they have a great Account to make for the
many years miſeries that enſued thereby to
both Nations, under the tyrannical government
of <hi>Cromwell</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to the duty of my attendance
on His <hi>Sacred Majeſty</hi> in <hi>Spring Coppice;</hi> By that
time <hi>Richard Penderel</hi> had conveyed Him into
the obſcureſt part of it, it was about ſun-riſing
on thurſday morning, and the heavens wept
bitterly at theſe calamities; inſomuch as the
thickeſt tree in the wood was not able to keep
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> dry, nor was there any thing for
<hi>Him</hi> to ſit on; Wherefore <hi>Richard</hi> went to
<hi>Francis Yates</hi> houſe, (a truſty neighbour,
who married his wifes ſiſter,) where he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
a <hi>blanket,</hi> which he folded and laid on
the ground for his <hi>Majeſty</hi> to ſit on.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Richard</hi> ſpoke to the
goodwife <hi>Yates,</hi> to provide ſome victuals, and
bring it into the wood at a place he appointed
her, ſhe preſently made ready a meſs of milk
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:55910:19"/>
and ſome butter and eggs, and brought them
to <hi>His Majeſty</hi> in the wood; Who being a little
ſurpriz'd to ſee the woman (no good concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of a ſecret,) ſaid cheerfully to her; <hi>good
woman, Can you be faithfull to a diſtreſſed Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier?</hi>
She anſwered, <hi>Yes Sir, I will dye rather
then diſcover you;</hi> with which Anſwer <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
was well ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Wilmot</hi> in the interim took <hi>John
Penderel</hi> for his guide, but knew not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
whither to goe, purpoſing at firſt to
have march'd Northwards, but as they paſsed
by <hi>Brewood Forge,</hi> the forgemen made after
them, till being told by one <hi>Richard Dutton,</hi>
that it was Col. <hi>Crompton</hi> whom they purſued,
the <hi>Vulcans</hi> happily, upon that miſtake, quitted
the chaſe.</p>
            <p>Soon after they narrowly eſcaped a party of
Rebels as they paſſed by <hi>Coven-brook;</hi> ſo that
ſeeing danger on every ſide, and <hi>John</hi> meeting
with <hi>William Walker</hi> (a truſty neighbour,)
committed my Lord, to his care and council,
who for preſent conveyed them into a dry
marl-pit (where they ſtaid a while,) and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to one Mr. <hi>Huntbaches</hi> houſe at <hi>Brinsford,</hi>
&amp; put their horſes into <hi>John Evans</hi> barn, whilſt
<hi>John Penderel</hi> goes to <hi>Wolverhampton</hi> to ſee
what convenience he could find for my Lords
coming thither, but met with none, the Town
being full of Souldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:55910:19"/>
Yet <hi>John</hi> leaves no means uneſſayed, haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
to <hi>Northcot,</hi> (an adjacent village) and there,
whilſt he was talking with <hi>Goodwife Underhill</hi>
(a neighbour,) in the inſtant Mr. <hi>John Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
(a ſojourner at Mr. <hi>Thomas Whitgreaves</hi> of
<hi>Moſeley,</hi> and of <hi>Johns</hi> acquaintance) was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
paſſing by, to whom <hi>John</hi> (well aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of his integrity,) preſently addreſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
&amp; his buſineſs, relates to him the ſad news
of the defeat of <hi>His Majeſties</hi> Army at <hi>Worceſter,</hi>
and diſcovers in what ſtraits and confuſion he
had left <hi>His Majeſty</hi> and His followers at <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,</hi>
and in particular that he had brought
thence a perſon of Quality, (for <hi>John</hi> then
knew not who my Lord was) to <hi>Huntbaches</hi>
houſe, who, without preſent relief, would be in
great danger of being taken.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Huddleſton</hi> goes home forthwith, takes
<hi>John</hi> with him and acquaints Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi>
with the buſineſſe, who freely reſolved to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
all, rather then ſuch a perſon ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> repaires to <hi>Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baches</hi>
houſe, ſpeaks with my Lord, and gives
direction how he ſhould be privately convey'd
into His houſe at <hi>Moſeley</hi> about ten of the
clock at night; and, though it ſo fell out that the
directions were not punctually obſerv'd, yet
my Lord and his Man were at laſt brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55910:20"/>
the houſe, where Mr. <hi>Whitgreave,</hi> (after
ſome refreſhment given them) conveys them
into a ſecret place, which my Lord admiring
for its excellent contrivance, and ſolicitous
for <hi>His Majeſties</hi> ſafety, ſaid, <hi>I would give a
world my friend</hi> (meaning <hi>the King) were
here;</hi> and then deposited in Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi>
cuſtody a little bag of Jewels, which my
Lord received again at his departure.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as it was day Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> ſent
<hi>William Walker</hi> with my Lords horſes to his
neighbour Col. <hi>John Lane</hi> of <hi>Bentley</hi> near <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</hi>
South-eaſt from <hi>Moſeley</hi> about four miles,
(whom Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> knew to be a right ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Gentleman, and ready to contribute any
aſſiſtance to ſo charitable a work) and wiſhed
<hi>Walker</hi> to acquaint the Colonel, that they
were the Horſes of ſome eminent perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the King, whom he could better ſecure
than his horſes: The Col. willingly receives the
horſes, and ſends word to Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> to
meet him that night in a Cloſe not far from
<hi>Moſeley,</hi> in order to the tender of farther ſervice
to the owner of the horſes, whoſe name nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Colonel nor Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> then
knew.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> night, when it grew dark, <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> reſolv'd to go from thoſe parts into
<hi>Wales,</hi> and to take <hi>Richard Penderel</hi> with him
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55910:20"/>
for his guide; but, before they began their
journey, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> went into <hi>Richards</hi> houſe
at <hi>Hobbal Grange,</hi> where the old Goodwife
<hi>Penderel</hi> had not onely the honour to ſee <hi>His
Majeſty,</hi> but to ſee <hi>Him</hi> attended by her ſon
<hi>Richard:</hi> Here <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had time and
means better to complete His diſguiſe; His
name was agreed to be <hi>Wil. Jones,</hi> and His
arms a wood Bill: In this poſture about nine a
Clock at night (after ſome refreſhment taken
in the houſe) <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> with His truſty ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
<hi>Richard,</hi> began their journey on foot, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
to go that night to <hi>Madeley</hi> in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
about five miles from <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> and
within a mile of the River <hi>Severn,</hi> over which
their way lay for <hi>VVales;</hi> in this Village li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
one Mr. <hi>VVoolf,</hi> an honeſt Gentleman of
<hi>Richards</hi> aquaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had not been long gon, but the
Lord <hi>VVilmot</hi> ſent <hi>John Penderel</hi> from Mr.
<hi>Whitegreaves</hi> to <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> to know in what
ſecurity the King was, <hi>John</hi> returned and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<hi>my Lord</hi> that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was marched
from thence; Hereupon my Lord began to
conſider which way himſelf ſhould remove
with ſafety.</p>
            <p>Col. <hi>Lane,</hi> having ſecured my Lords horſes,
and being come to <hi>Moſeley</hi> according to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
on Friday night, was brought up to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55910:21"/>
my Lord by Mr. <hi>Whitgreave,</hi> and (after mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
ſalutation) acquainted him, that his ſiſter
Mrs. <hi>Jane Lane</hi> had by accident procured a
Paſs from ſome Commander of the Rebels,
for her ſelf and a man to goe to <hi>Briſtol</hi> to ſee
her ſiſter, then near her time of lying in; and
freely offer'd, if His Lordſhip thought fit, he
might make uſe of it, which my Lord ſeem'd
inclinable to accept; and on Saturday night
was conducted by Col. <hi>Lanes</hi> man (himſelf
not being well) to the Col. houſe at <hi>Bentley,</hi>
His Lordſhip then and not before diſcovering
his Name to Mr. <hi>Whitgreave,</hi> and giving him
many thanks for ſo great a kindneſſe in ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
a danger.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>His Majeſty</hi> came to <hi>Madeley,</hi> He met
with an ilfavoured encounter at <hi>Evelin Mill</hi>
being about 2. miles from thence; The Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
(it ſeems) was an honeſt-man, but <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
and <hi>Richard</hi> knew it not, and had then in
his houſe ſome conſiderable perſons of <hi>His
Majeſties</hi> Army, who took ſhelter there in their
flight from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and had not been long in
the Mill, ſo that the Miller was upon his
watch, and <hi>Richard,</hi> unhappily permitting a
gate to clap, through which they paſſed, gave
occaſion to the Miller to come out of the Mill
and boldly ask <hi>who is there? Richard,</hi> think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Miller had purſued them, quitted the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55910:21"/>
uſuall way in ſome haſt, and led <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
over a little brook, which they were forced to
wade through, and which contributed much
towards the ſurbating and galling <hi>His Majeſties</hi>
Feet. Here <hi>His Majeſty</hi> (as he afterwards plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
obſerved) was in ſome danger of loſing
his Guide, but that the ruſling of <hi>Richards</hi>
calves-skin breeches was the beſt direction <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> had to follow him in that dark night.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> arrived at <hi>Madeley</hi> about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night,
<hi>Richard</hi> goes to Mr, <hi>Woolfs</hi> houſe, where
they were all in bed, knocks them up and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
Mr. <hi>Woolfs</hi> Daughter, (who came to the
dore) that the King was there, who preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
him into the houſe, where <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
refreſhed himſelf for ſome time; but, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that the Rebels kept ſeveral Guards
upon <hi>Seavern,</hi> and it being fear'd that ſome of
their party (of which many frequently paſſed
through the Town,) might quarter at the
houſe (as had often hapned,) it was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
unſafe for <hi>His Majeſty</hi> to lodge in the houſe
(which afforded no ſecret place for conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,)
but rather to retire into a barn near ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning,
as leſſe liable to the danger of a
ſurpriſe, whither <hi>His Majeſty</hi> went according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and continued there all the day following,
His ſervant <hi>Richard</hi> attending him.</p>
            <p>During <hi>His Majeſties</hi> ſtay in the Barn, Mr.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55910:22"/>
               <hi>Woolf</hi> had often conference with him about
His intended journey, and in order thereto
took care by a truſty ſervant (ſent abroad for
that purpoſe,) to inform himfelf more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
of thoſe guards upon <hi>Seavern,</hi>
and had certain word brought him, that not
only the bridges were ſecured, but all the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage-boats
ſeized on; Inſomuch as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it very hazardous for <hi>His Majeſty</hi> to
proſecute His deſign for <hi>Wales,</hi> but rather to
go to <hi>Boſcobel-houſe,</hi> being the moſt retired
place for concealment in all the Country, and
to ſtay there till an oppotunity of a further ſafe
conveyance could be found out; which advice
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> inclined to approve: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
reſolv'd for <hi>Boſcobel</hi> the night following;
in the mean time His hands not appearing
ſufficiently diſcoloured, ſuitable to His other
diſguiſe, Mris. <hi>Woolf</hi> provided Walnut-tree
leaves, as the readieſt expedient for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The day being over, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> adventured
to come again into the houſe, where having for
ſome time refreſhed himſelf, and being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with conveniecies for His Journey,
(which was conceived to be ſafer on root than
by horſe) He with his faithfull guide <hi>Richard</hi>
about eleven of the clock at night, ſet forth
towards <hi>Boſcobel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:55910:22"/>
About three of the clock on Saturday mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
being come near the houſe, <hi>Richard</hi> left
<hi>His Majeſtie</hi> in the wood, whilſt he went in
to ſee it no Souldiers were there or other dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger;
Where he found Col. <hi>William Carlis,</hi>
(who had ſeen, not the laſt man born, but the
laſt man kild, at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and) who, having
with much difficulty, made his eſcape from
thence; was got into his own neighbor-hood,
and, for ſome time concealing himſelf in <hi>Beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebel
wood,</hi> was come that morning to the houſe
to get ſome relief of <hi>William Penderel,</hi> his old
acquaintance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> having acquainred the Col. that the
King was in the wood, the <hi>Col.</hi> with <hi>William</hi>
and <hi>Richard</hi> goe preſently thither to give
their attendance, where they found <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
ſitting on the root of a tree, who was glad
to ſee the <hi>Col.</hi> and came with them into the
houſe, and did there eat bread and cheeſe hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily,
and (as an Extraordinary) <hi>William Pende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
wife</hi> made <hi>His Majeſty</hi> a Poſſet, of thin
milk and ſmal beer, and got ready ſome warm
water to waſh His feet, not onely extreme dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but much galled with travail.</p>
            <p>The Col. Pull'd off <hi>His Majeſties</hi> ſhoos,
which were full of gravel, and ſtockens which
were very wet, and there being no other ſhoos
in the houſe that would fit <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55910:23"/>
good wife put ſome hot embers in thoſe to dry
them, whilſt <hi>His Majeſties</hi> feet were waſhing
and his ſtockens ſhifted.</p>
            <p>Being thus a little refreſhed, the Col. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> to go back into the wood,
(ſuppoſing it ſafer then the houſe,) where the
Colonel made choice of a thick leafed Oak,
into which <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> help'd both
the King and the Col. and brought them ſuch
proviſion as they could get, with a cuſhion for
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> to ſit on; In this Oak they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
moſt part of that day, and the Col.
humbly deſired <hi>His Majeſty</hi> (who had taken
little or no reſt the two preceding nights,) to
ſeat himſelf as eaſily as he could in the tree,
and reſt his head on the Colonels lap, who was
watchfull that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> might not fall; and
in this poſture <hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſlumbred away ſome
part of the day, and bore all theſe hardſhips and
afflictions with incomparable Patience.</p>
            <p>In the Evening they returned to the houſe,
where <hi>William Penderel</hi> acquainted <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
with the ſecret place, wherein the <hi>Earl of Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>
had been ſecured, which <hi>His Majeſty</hi> liked ſo
well, that He reſolved, whilſt He ſtaid there,
to truſt onely to that, and go no more
into the <hi>Royal Oake,</hi> as from hence it muſt be
cal'd, where he could not ſo much as ſit at
eaſe.</p>

               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> now, eſteeming himſelf in ſome
better ſecurity, permitted <hi>William Penderel</hi> to
ſhave Him, and cut the hair of his head, as ſhort
at top as the Sciſſers would do it, but leaving
ſome about the ears, according to the Country
mode; Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> attending, told <hi>His Majeſty,
Will was but a mean Barber;</hi> To which <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> anſwered, <hi>He had never been ſhav'd by

the Hair which he cut off, but <hi>Will.</hi> was only

               </gap>d the King had

ſtrictly, and laid before him as wel the penalty
for concealing the King, which was death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy; as the reward for diſcovering
him, which ſhould be one thouſand pounds
certain pay, but neither fear of puniſhment
nor hope of reward, was able to tempt <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phry</hi>
into any diſloyalty; He pleaded ignorance

to <hi>His Majeſty</hi> and the <hi>loial Colonel</hi> at <hi>Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobel,</hi>

ſome chickens for <hi>His Majeſties</hi> ſupper,

what meat he would pleaſe to have provided

ſome mutton, if it might be had; But
it was thought dangerous for <hi>William</hi> to goe
to any market to buy it, ſince his Neighbors
all knew he did not uſe to buy ſuch for his own
dyet, and ſo it might beget a ſuſpition of his
having ſtrangers at his houſe; But the Col.
found another expedient to ſatisfy <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi>
deſires; Early on <hi>Sunday</hi> morning he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs
to Mr. <hi>William Stauntons</hi> ſheep-coat,
who rented ſome of <hi>Boſcobel</hi> grounds, here he
choſe one of the beſt ſheep, ſticks him with

brings him home on his back.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:55910:26"/>
On <hi>Sunday</hi> morning (<hi>Sept.</hi> the ſeventh) <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> got up early (his dormitory being
none of the beſt, nor his bed the eaſieſt,) and
near the ſecret place where the lay, had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
of a Gallery to walk in, where he
was obſerv'd to ſpend ſome time in his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and where He had the advantage of a
window, which ſurveid the Road from <hi>Tong</hi> to
<hi>Brewood;</hi> Soon after <hi>His Majeſty</hi> coming down
into the Parlor, his noſe fell a bleeding, which
put his poor faithful ſervants into a great
fright, but <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was pleaſed ſoon to
remove it, by telling them, It often did
ſo.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Mutton was cold, <hi>William</hi>
cut it up and brought a leg of it into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> cal'd for a knife and a tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,
and cut ſome of it into Collops and
prick'd them with the knif's point, then cal'd
for a frying-pan and butter, and fry'd the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops
himſelf, of which he ate heartily, Col.
<hi>Carlis</hi> the while being but Under-Cook, (and
that honor enough too,) made the fire and
turn'd the Collops in the Pan.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Colonel</hi> afterwards attended <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> in <hi>France, His Majeſty</hi> calling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
this paſſage, among others, was
pleaſed merrily to propoſe it, as a problemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Queſtion, whether Himſelf or the Col.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55910:27"/>
were the Maſter-Cook at <hi>Boſcobel;</hi> and the
ſupremacy was of right adjudg'd to <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this while the other brothers of the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derels</hi>
were in their ſeveral ſtations, either ſcout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
abroad to learn Intelligence, or upon ſome
other ſervice; but it ſo pleas'd God, that,
though the Soldiers had ſome Intelligence
that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had been at <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> and
none that he was gone thence, yet this Houſe
(which prov'd a happy ſanctuary for <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
in this ſad Exigent,) has not at all been
ſearch'd during <hi>His Majeſties</hi> aboad there,
though that had ſeveral times, this perhaps
the rather eſcaping, becauſe the Neighbors
could truly inform none but poor Servants to
be here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> finding himſelf in a hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
ſecurity, ſpent ſome part of this Lords-day
in a pretty Arbor in <hi>Boſcobel</hi> garden, which
grew upon a Mount, and wherein there was a
Stone Table and Seats about it. In this place
He paſs'd away ſome time in reading, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the place for its retiredneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> underſtanding by <hi>John Pende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi>
that the <hi>Lord Wilmot</hi> was at Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greaves,</hi>
(for <hi>John</hi> knew not of his remove to
<hi>Bentley,</hi>) was deſirous to let my Lord know
wh<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re he was, and in what ſecurity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55910:27"/>
To this end <hi>John Penderel</hi> was ſent on <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>
morning to <hi>Moſeley;</hi> But <hi>John,</hi> finding
my Lord remov'd thence, was much troubled,
and then acquainted Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Huddleſton,</hi> that <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was re<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urn'd to
<hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and the diſaccommodation He had
there; whereupon they both reſolve to goe
with <hi>John</hi> to <hi>Bentley,</hi> where having gain'd him
an acceſs to my Lord, His Lordſhip deſign'd
to attend the King that night at <hi>Moſeley,</hi> and
deſired Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> to meet his Lordſhip
at a place appointed about 12. of the clock,
And Mr. <hi>Huddleſton</hi> to nominate a place
where he would attend <hi>His Majesty</hi> about one
of the clock, the ſame night.</p>
            <p>Upon this Intelligence my Lord made
ſtay of Mrs. <hi>Jane Lanes</hi> Journey to <hi>Briſtoll,</hi>
till <hi>His Majeſties</hi> pleaſure were known.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John</hi> return'd to <hi>Boſcobel</hi> in the Afternoon
with intimation of this deſign'd meeting with
my Lord at <hi>Moſeley</hi> that night, and the place
which was appointed by Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> where
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> ſhould be expected. But <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,</hi>
having not recovered his late foot-jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to <hi>Madeley,</hi> was not able without a horſe,
to perform this to <hi>Moſeley,</hi> which was about
five miles diſtant from <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> and near the
mid from thence to <hi>Bentley.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was therefore concluded that <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:55910:28"/>
ſhould ride upon <hi>Humphry Penderels</hi> Mill-horſe
(for <hi>Humphry</hi> was the Miller of <hi>whiteladies</hi>
Mill,) The horſe was taken up from Graſs,
and accoutr'd not with rich trappings or furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
befitting ſo great a King, but with a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
old Saddle and a worſe bridle.</p>
            <p>When <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was ready to take horſe,
Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> humbly took leave of Him, being
ſo well known in the Country, that his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
upon <hi>His Majeſty</hi> would in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
have prov'd rather a disſervice then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
however his hearty praiers were not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for <hi>His Majeſties</hi> preſervation.</p>
            <p>Thus then <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was mounted, and
thus he rode towards <hi>Moſeley,</hi> attended by all
the honeſt brothers, <hi>William, John, Richard,
Humphry,</hi> and <hi>George Penderel,</hi> and <hi>Francis
Yates,</hi> each of theſe took a Bill or pike-ſtaff
on his back, and ſome of them had piſtols in
their pockets, two march'd before, one on
each ſide <hi>His Majeſties</hi> horſe, and two came
behind a loof off; their deſign being this, that
in caſe they ſhould have been queſtion'd or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countr'd
but by five or ſix troopers or ſuch like
ſma l party, they would have ſhew'd their valor
in defending, as well as they had done their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
in otherwiſe ſerving <hi>His Majeſty:</hi> And
though it was near Midnight, yet they conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> through by-ways, for better Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:55910:28"/>
After ſome experience had of the horſe,
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> complain'd, <hi>It was the Heavieſt
Dull Jade he ever rode on,</hi> to which (<hi>Humphry</hi>
the Owner of him) Anſwer'd (beyond the
uſual notion of a Miller,) <hi>My Leige! Can you
blame the horſe to goe heavily, when he has the
weight of three Kingdoms on his back?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>His Majeſty came to Penford Mill,</hi>
within two Miles of Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> houſe,
His Guides deſired Him to alight and goe on
foot the reſt of the way, for more ſecurity, the
Foot way being the more privat and the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and at laſt they arriv'd at the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Mr. <hi>Huddleston,</hi> (which was a little
grove of trees in a Cloſe of Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi>
cal'd the <hi>Pit-leaſow,)</hi> in order to <hi>His Majeſties</hi>
being privately convey'd into Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi>
houſe; <hi>William, Humphry,</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the horſe, the other three attended
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> to the Houſe; but <hi>His Majeſty,</hi>
being gon a little way, had forgot (it ſeems)
to bid Farewel to <hi>William</hi> and the reſt, who
were going back, ſo He cal'd to them and ſaid,
<hi>My troubles make me forget my ſelf, I thank you
all,</hi> and gave them His hand to kiſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lord Wilmot,</hi> in purſuance of his own
appointment; came to the meeting place at
his hour, where Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> receiv'd him
and conveyd him to his old chamber, but hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55910:29"/>
nothing of the King at his prefixed
time, gave occaſion to ſuſpect ſome miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
might have befaln him, though the
night was very dark and rainy, which might
poſſibly be the occaſion of ſo long ſtay; Mr.
<hi>Whitgreave</hi> therefore leaves my Lord in his
chamber, and goes to <hi>Pit-leaſow,</hi> where Mr.
<hi>Huddleſton</hi> attended <hi>His Majeſties</hi> coming, and
about two hours after the time appointed <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> came, whom Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Huddleſton,</hi> convey'd, with much ſatisfaction
into the houſe to my Lord, who expected him
with great ſolicitude, and preſently kneeld
down and embraced <hi>His Majesties</hi> knees, who
kiſs'd my Lord on the cheek, and ask'd him
earneſtly, <hi>what is become of Buckingham, Cleve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and others?</hi> To which my Lord could
give little ſatisfaction, but hop'd they were
ſafe.</p>
            <p>My Lord (addreſſing himſelf to Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greave</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi>) ſaid, <hi>though I
have conceal'd my friends name all this while,
now I muſt tell you, this is my Maſter, your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
and the Maſter of us all;</hi> not knowing that
they underſtood it was the King; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> was pleaſed to give his hand
to Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huddleſton</hi> to kiſs,
and told them he had receiv'd ſuch an Account
from my Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> of their fidelity, that
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55910:29"/>
he ſhould never forget it; and preſently ask'd
Mr. <hi>Whitgreave, where is your ſecret place?</hi> which
being ſhewed <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> He was pleas'd
therewith, and returning into my Lords cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
ſate down on the bed-ſide, where his
Noſe fell a bleeding; and then puld out of
his pocket a handkercher, ſuitable to the reſt of
his apparel, both courſe and dirty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſties</hi> Attire, as was before obſerv'd
in part, was then a leather-doublet, a pair of
green breeches and a Jump-coat (as the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
call's it) of the ſame green, a pair of his
own ſtockens with the tops cut off, becauſe
embroider'd, and a pair of ſtirrop ſtockens,
which were lent him at <hi>Madeley,</hi> a pair of old

            <p>Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> obſerving the courſneſs of

ſome body had innocently but indiſcreetly put
white paper, which, with going on foot from the
place where <hi>His Majeſty</hi> alighted to the houſe,
was roll'd between his ſtockens and his skin,
and ſerv'd to encreaſe rather then aſſwage the
ſoarneſs of his feet.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> had by this time brought
up ſome bisket and a bottle of ſack, <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
ate of the one, and drank a good glaſs of
the other; and, being thus refreſh'd, was
pleas'd to ſay cheerfully, <hi>I am now ready for
another March; And if it ſhall pleaſe God once
more to place me in the head of but eight or ten
thouſand good Men, of one mind, and reſolv'd to
fight, I ſhall not doubt to drive theſe Rogues out of
my Kingdoms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now break of the day on Munday
morning the eighth of <hi>September,</hi> and <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
was deſirous to take ſome reſt: In order
whereto a Palet was carried into one of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
places, where <hi>His Majeſty</hi> lay down, but
reſted not ſo well as His Hoſt deſired, for the
place was cloſe and inconvenient, and they
durſt not adventure to put Him into any bed
in an open Chamber.</p>
            <p>After ſome reſt taken in the hole, <hi>His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi>
got up, and was pleaſed to take notice of,
and ſalute Mr. <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> Mother, and (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
His place of retreat ſtill ready) ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55910:30"/>
whiles in a Cloſet over the Porch,
where He might ſee thoſe that paſs'd the road
by the houſe.</p>
            <p>Before the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> betook himſelf to
his Dormitory, he conferr'd with Mr. <hi>VVhit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greave,</hi>
and adviſed, that himſelf or Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſton</hi>
would be alwayes vigilant about the
houſe, and give notice if any Souldiers came,
and (ſayes this noble Lord) <hi>If it ſhould ſo fall
out that the Rebels have intelligence of your
harbouring any of the Kings Party, and ſhould
therefore put you to any torture for confeſsion, be
ſure you diſcover me firſt, which may haply in ſuch
caſe ſatisfie them, and preſerve the King.</hi> This
was the expreſſion and care of a loyal Subject,
worthy eternal memory.</p>
            <p>On Munday <hi>His Majeſty</hi> and my Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd
to diſpatch <hi>John Penderel</hi> to Col. <hi>Lane</hi>
at <hi>Bentley,</hi> with direction for the Colonel to
ſend my Lords horſes for him that night about
midnight, and to expect him at the uſual
place: My Lord accordingly goes to <hi>Bentley</hi>
again that night, to make way for <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties</hi>
reception there, in order to a reſolution
taken up by <hi>His Majeſty</hi> to go Weſtward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the protection of Mrs. <hi>Jane Lanes</hi> Paſs;
it being moſt probable, that the Rebels wholly
purſu'd <hi>His Majeſty</hi> Northwards, and would
not at all ſuſpect Him gone into the Weſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:55910:31"/>
This Munday afternoon Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> had
notice that ſome Souldiers were in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood
intending to apprehend him, upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
that he had been at <hi>Worceſter</hi> Fight:
The <hi>King</hi> was then lain down upon Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtons</hi>
bed, but Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> preſently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
his <hi>Royal Gueſt</hi> in the ſecret place, and
my Lord alſo, leaves open all the Chamber
dores, and goes boldly down to the Souldiers,
aſſuring them (as his Neighbours alſo teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
that he had not been from home in a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
then laſt paſt; with which aſſeveration
the Souldiers were ſatisfied, and came not up
ſtairs at all.</p>
            <p>In this interval the Rebels had taken a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> who came in <hi>His Majeſties</hi>
Troop to <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> and, either by menaces
or ſome other way, had extorted this confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from him concerning the <hi>King,</hi> (Whom
theſe Bloud-hounds ſought with all poſſible
diligence) that he came in company with <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> to <hi>Whiteladies,</hi> where the Rebels con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
He might ſtill be; whereupon they
poſted thither without ever drawing bit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
kill'd their horſes, and brought the faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
Priſoner with them.</p>
            <p>Being come to <hi>Whiteladies</hi> on Tueſday,
they call for Mr. <hi>George Giffard,</hi> who lived in
an appartiment of the Houſe, preſent a Piſtol
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55910:31"/>
to his breaſt, and bad him confeſſe where the
<hi>King</hi> was, or he ſhould preſently dye; Mr.
<hi>Giffard</hi> was too loyal, and too much a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to be frighted into any infidelity, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
denies the knowing any more, but that
divers Cavaliers came thither on Wedneſday
night, are up their proviſion and departed, and
that he was as ignorant who they were as
whence they came, or whither they went, and
beg'd, if he muſt dye, that they would firſt
give him leave to ſay a few prayers: One of
theſe Villains anſwered, <hi>If you can tell us no
news of the King, you ſhall ſay no prayers:</hi> But
his diſcreet anſwer did ſomewhat aſſwage the
fury of their Leader, yet they ſearched every
corner of the houſe, broak down much of the
Wainſcoat, and at laſt beat their Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
ſeverely for making them loſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>
            <p>During this Tueſday, in my Lord <hi>Wilmots</hi>
abſence, <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was for the moſt part at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>VVhitgreave</hi>
being much abroad in the neighborhood, and
Mrs. <hi>VVhitgreave</hi> below ſtairs, both inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after news, and the motions of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery,
in order to the preſervation of their <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Gueſt;</hi> the old Gentlewoman was this day
told by a Countrey man, who came to her
houſe, that he heard the <hi>King,</hi> upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55910:32"/>
had beaten His Enemies at <hi>VVarrington
bridge,</hi> and that there were three Kings come
in to his aſſiſtance; which ſtory ſhe related to
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> for divertiſement, Who ſmiling,
anſwered, <hi>Surely they are the three Kings of</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein
<hi>come down from heaven, for I can imagine
none elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> out of the Cloſet window, eſpy'd
two Souldiers, who paſs'd by the gate in the
Road, and told Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi> he knew one
of them to be a <hi>Highlander</hi> and of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment;
who little thought his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>
was ſo near.</p>
            <p>And <hi>His Majeſty</hi> for entertainment of the
time was pleas'd to diſcourſe with Mr. <hi>Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
the particulers of the Battle of <hi>Worceſter</hi>
(the ſame in ſubſtance with what is before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.)
And by ſome words which <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty</hi>
let fall, it might eaſily be collected that
His Councils had been too often ſooner diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
to the Rebels, than executed by His
loyal Subjects.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Huddleſton</hi> had under his charge young
Sir <hi>John Preſton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Palyn</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Francis Reynolds,</hi> and on this Tueſday in the
morning (the better to conceal <hi>His Majeſties</hi>
being in the houſe, and excuſe his own more
than uſual long ſtay above ſtairs) pretended
himſelf to be indiſpoſed and afraid of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55910:32"/>
and therefore ſet his ſchollers at ſeveral
Garret windows, that ſurvey'd the roades, to
watch and give notice when they ſaw any
Troopers coming; This ſervice the youths
perform'd very diligently all day, and at night,
when they were at Supper, <hi>Sir John</hi> cal'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Companions, and ſaid (more truly then
he imagin'd,) <hi>Come Lads, Let us eat luſtly, for
we have been upon the life-guard to day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> night between twelve and one
of the clock, <hi>The Lord Wilmot</hi> ſent Col. <hi>Lane</hi>
to attend <hi>His Majeſty</hi> to <hi>Bentley,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greave</hi>
meets the <hi>Colonel</hi> at the place appointed,
and brings him to the Corner of his Orchard,
Where the <hi>Colonel</hi> thought fit to ſtay, whil'ſt
Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> goes in and acquaints <hi>the King</hi>
that he was come: Whereupon <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
preſently took his leave of Mris. <hi>Whitgreave,</hi>
ſaluted her and gave her many thanks for his
entertainment, but was pleas'd to be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
with Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton,</hi>
not onely by giving them thanks, but by
telling them, he was very ſenſible of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
they might incur by entertaining Him,
if it ſhould chance to be diſcover'd; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> advis'd them to be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of themſelves, and gave them direction to
repair to a Merchant in <hi>London,</hi> who ſhould
have order to furniſh them with moneys and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55910:33"/>
means of conveiance beyond ſea, if they
thought fit. However <hi>His Majeſty</hi> concluded,
that if it ſhould pleaſe God ever to reſtore him
to the Government of His Dominions, He
ſhould not be unmindful of their civilities and
fidelity to Him. Thus grateful was this <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
King,</hi> for even that which was every
good ſubjects duty, and thus ſollicitous (in
the midſt of His own dangers) for their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.</p>
            <p>After <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had vouchſaf'd theſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
expreſſions to Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Huddleſton,</hi> they told <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> All the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they could now doe Him, was to pray
heartily to Almighty God for His ſafety and
preſervation, and then kneeling down, <hi>His
Majeſty</hi> gave them His hand to kiſs, and ſo
went down ſtairs with them into the Orchard,
where Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> both humbly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deliver'd his <hi>great Charge</hi> into Col. <hi>Lanes</hi>
hands, telling the <hi>Colonel</hi> who the perſon was
he there preſented to him.</p>
            <p>The night was both dark and cold, and <hi>His
Majeſties</hi> cloathing thin, therefore Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſton</hi>
humbly offer'd <hi>His Majeſty</hi> a Cloak,
which He was pleaſed to accept and wore to
<hi>Bentley,</hi> from whence Mr. <hi>Huddleſton</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
received it.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and Mr. <hi>Huddle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:55910:33"/>
heard <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was not onely got ſafe to
<hi>Bentley,</hi> but march'd ſecurely from thence,
they began to reflect upon <hi>His</hi> advice, and, leſt
any diſcovery ſhould be made of what had
been acted at <hi>Moſeley,</hi> they both abſented
themſelvs from home; The one went to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
the other to a friends houſe in <hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
where they liv'd privately til ſuch time as
they heard <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was ſafely arriv'd in
<hi>France,</hi> and that no part of the aforeſaid tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
at <hi>Moſeley</hi> had been diſcover'd to the
Rebels, and then return'd home.</p>
            <p>This Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> is deſcended of the
ancient family of the <hi>Whitgreaves</hi> of <hi>Burton</hi> in
the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> and was firſt a <hi>Cornet,</hi>
afterwards <hi>Lieutenant</hi> to <hi>Capt Tho. Giffard,</hi> in
the firſt War for His late Majeſty.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Huddleſton</hi> is a younger brother of
the renowned Family of the houſe of <hi>Hutton-John</hi>
in the County of <hi>Cumberland,</hi> and was a
Gentleman volunteir in His late Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
firſt under Sir <hi>John Preſton</hi> the Elder, till
Sir <hi>John</hi> was render'd unſerviceable by the
deſperate wounds he received, and after under
Colonel <hi>Ralph Pudſey</hi> at <hi>Newark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty,</hi> being ſafely conveyd to <hi>Bentley</hi>
by <hi>Col. Lane,</hi> ſtaid there but a ſhort time, took
the opportunity of Mris. <hi>Janes</hi> Paſs, and
rode before her to <hi>Briſtow,</hi> the <hi>Lord Wilmot</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55910:34"/>
for the moſt part at a diſtance. In all
which Journey Mris. <hi>Lane</hi> perform'd the part
of a moſt faithful and prudent Servant to <hi>His
Majeſty,</hi> ſhewing her obſervance, when any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
would allow it, and at other times
acting her part in the diſguiſe with much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>But <hi>His Majeſties</hi> particular <hi>Giſts</hi> to <hi>Briſtow</hi>
and to the houſes of ſeveral loyal ſubjects,
both in <hi>Somerſetſhire, Wiltſhire, Hampſhire</hi> and
ſo to <hi>Brighempſton</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> where He, about
the end of <hi>October</hi> 1651. took ſhipping, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſecurely at <hi>Deip</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the ſeveral
accidents, hardſhips and encounters, in all that
Journey, can now be exactly related by none
but <hi>His Majeſty</hi> himſelf; ſince the much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
death of that faithful Subject and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Souldier the <hi>Lord Wilmot,</hi> who was cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
Earl of <hi>Rochester,</hi> as a part of that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<hi>His Majeſty</hi> thought due to ſo great a
fidelity.</p>
            <p>The very next day after <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was
gone from <hi>Boſcobel,</hi> being Monday the 8. of
<hi>September,</hi> two parties of Rebels came thither,
the one being part of the County Troop, who
ſearch'd the houſe with ſome civility; The
other, <hi>Capt. Broadwayes</hi> men, theſe ſearch'd
ſeverely, eat up their little Store of proviſion,
plunder'd the houſe of what was portable, and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55910:34"/>
one of them preſented a piſtol to <hi>William Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derel,</hi>
and much frighted <hi>My dame Joan;</hi> yet
both Parties return'd, as empty as they came,
of that intelligence they ſo greedily ſought
after.</p>
            <p>This danger being over, honeſt <hi>William</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think of making ſatisfaction for the fat
Mutton, and accordingly tender'd Mr. <hi>Staunton</hi>
its worth in money; but <hi>Staunton,</hi> underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sheep was kil'd for the relief of ſome
honeſt Cavaliers, who had been ſhelter'd at
<hi>Boſcobel</hi> refus'd to take the money, but wiſh'd,
much good it might doe them.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Penderels</hi> were of honeſt Parentage,

William, John, Richard, Humphry, Thomas</hi>

<hi>Thomas</hi> was ſlain at <hi>Stow fight, William,</hi> as you

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>His Majeſty</hi> had not been long gone from
<hi>Boſcobel,</hi> but Col. <hi>Carlis</hi> ſent <hi>William Penderel</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Humphry Ironmonger,</hi> his old friend, at
<hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> who not only procur'd him a

him with money for his journey, by

The <hi>Oake</hi> is now properly call'd <hi>The Royal

many miles round, have flock'd to ſee the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
BOSCOBEL, which (as you have heard)
had once the honour to be the Palace of <hi>His
Sacred Majeſty</hi> but chiefly to behold the <hi>Royal
Oake,</hi> which has been depriv'd of all its young
Boughs by the viſiters of it, who keep them
in memory of <hi>His Majeſties</hi> happy preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Boſcobel-houſe</hi> has yet been a third

the Lord <hi>Bruerton,</hi> who was engaged with him,
took ſanctuary there for ſome time, and was

            <p>When <hi>His Majeſty</hi> was thus happily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd

to Miracle; let us ſum up the number
of thoſe, who were privy to this firſt part of <hi>His
Majeſties</hi> diſguiſe and concealment; Mr. <hi>Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fard,</hi>
the five <hi>Penderels,</hi> their Mother and three
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:55910:37"/>
of their Wives, Col. <hi>Carlos, Francis Yates</hi> and
his Wife, ſome of the Inhabitants of <hi>Whitela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
Mr. <hi>Woolf,</hi> his Wife, Daughter and Maid,
Mr. <hi>Whitgreave</hi> and his Mother, Mr. <hi>Huddleſton,</hi>
Col. <hi>Lane</hi> and his Siſter; and then conſider
whether it were not indeed a <hi>Miracle,</hi> that ſo
many men, and (which is far more) ſo many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould faithfully conceal ſo important and
unuſual a Secret; and this notwithſtanding the
temptations and promiſes of reward on the one
hand, the danger and menaces of puniſhment
on the other.</p>
            <p>To which I ſhall adde but this one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
that it was concealed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
for the moſt part, of that Religion, which
has long ſuffer'd under an imputation (laid on
them by ſome miſtaken Zelots) of diſloyalty
to their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>And now, on my bended knees, let me joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
congratulate <hi>His</hi> reſtored <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and
humbly offer Him this ſhort and hearty wiſh,
O KING,<note place="margin">Dan. 3. 10.</note> LIVE FOR EVER. And
not content with my own inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Prayers, with all my Soul I beg the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
aſſiſtance of others, earneſtly inviting all
the Nation, even all the three Nations, to ſing</p>
            <closer>Te Deum Laudamus.</closer>
