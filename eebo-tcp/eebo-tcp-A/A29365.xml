         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hou haſt (I doubt not) heard with what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
and pains this ſmall work is brought
forth, and delivered into the world; let
the difficulty of Printing quicken thine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in reading. As the fall of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
is much expected, ſo the riſing of the Churches is much
deſired. Thy prayers, and our paines, may help forward
both. Wherefore that I might not be wanting to this great
ſervice, I am willing that theſe notes ſhould walk abroad,
which I thought ſhould never ſee more light than what
crept in at my ſtudie windowes. This Sermon may prove
all the Legacie which your dying friend ſhall be able to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath
unto you; For I am now returning to that Church
and people of God, which Jeſus Chriſt hath committed to
me, and others. And if in this voyage the Lord ſhall put
the windes, and seas in Commiſsion for my death, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
is,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That God would forgive our adverſaries (if it
be his will) that have put us to theſe extremities.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it may be ever ſaid of this Iland, as
once it was ſaid of</hi> Iſrael, Happy art thou O Iſrael:
who is like unto thee, O people ſaved by the Lord,
the ſhield of thine help, and the ſword of thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency?
<hi>Deut.</hi> 33. 29.</p>

as</hi> Joſeph <hi>ſaid to his brethren that ſold him into a

me, but God meant it unto good, Now therefore
feare not, &amp;c. <hi>Yet we know that publick Adminiſtration
of Juſtice is not contrary to perſonall forgiveneſſe. Wee
muſt confeſſe, that the leaving of our owne deare Country
was, and is moſt afflictive to us; A trouble to leave our
good friends, Convenient houſes, Pretious liberties, and ſo

               </note> If they will not ſuffer you
where they have to doe, let not your minde bee
troubled to ceaſe from your work, or diſert your
office, but teach and perſevere, if it be not lawfull
in one place, it may bee in another. But thou
wilt ſay, What if it be lawfull in no place, and that
wee be every where caſt out in the whole world?
Chriſt anſwers, Be not ſolicitous, before it come
to paſſe that no place be left for the word, I will be
preſent by my comming, there ſhall alwayes be
a place where you may teach till I ſhall come,
onely doe you hold on, and you ſhall be ſaved; you
ſhall not have gone over all the Cities of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> till
the Sonne of man ſhall come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93998:3"/>
So that according to <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Truth, though
the perſecutions of the Churches bee never ſo great, yet
there ſhall alwayes be ſome place free, and open at a Citie
of Refuge for Gods people to flye unto, and hide themſelves
in, till Chriſt ſhall come by publick deliverance for the
Churches.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond. You have ſeene what great things the
Lord hath done for you. Beleeveſt thou becauſe of theſe,
thou ſhalt ſee greater, onely let us follow the ſtarre of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,
and divine guidance which hath led us along all this
while, and not goe in to conſult with the Scribes; and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
of the times, with thoſe that ſay they are Jeues, and
are not; ſo ſhall our ſtarre the Scripture lead us more
clearely to the place, and houſe where Chriſt is. Neither
be thou aſhamed to receive, and owne the truth, and way
of Chriſt, though it be deſpiſed. The wiſe men did worſhip
Chriſt in a manger.</p>
            <p>And for the third, I ſhall not prophecie if I ſay, The
ſword is now drawne, whoſe anger ſhall not be pacified till
<hi>Babylon</hi> be downe, and <hi>Sion</hi> rais'd. Yet if thou ſhalt
meet with another ſuffering Bout, In Patience poſſeſſe thy
ſoule, In Faith thy God, In Love thy neighbour. And know
that it is Gods uſuall way to bring his beſt ſervants to his
choyce bleſsings by tedious Bouts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 18. In the
interim obſerve diligently what God is now doing, and help
forward the work of God what you can. <hi>Quod Deus facit
pro nobis facit in nobis.</hi> And as you would read, and
ſtudy ſome choyce booke to get learning, ſo read, attend, and
ſtudy every page, line, and letter of this great volume of the
Lords works which is now extant, be in commons with the
Lords people. <hi>The works of the Lord are ſought
<pb facs="tcp:93998:4"/>
out of all thoſe that have pleaſure in them,</hi> ſaith
the Pſalmiſt.</p>
            <p>Finally, good Reader, pray for us, that wee may ſtand
compleat in all the will of God; and though the malice of
ſome men hath beene ſo great, that wee may not live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one Land, yet the mercy of God is ſo rich, that wee
may live together in one heaven.</p>
            <p>Now, the God of peace that brought againe from the
dead our Lord Jeſus, and great Shepheard of the Sheepe,
thorough the blood of the everlaſting covenant, make you
perfect in every good work to doe his will, working in you
that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Chriſt,
to whom be glory for ever, and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

preſent times, and the preceding
words; for the Holy Ghoſt having
made a deſcription of the ſtate and
condition of the Church of Chriſt,
in the firſt, ſecond, third, fourth, and
fifth verſes, comes in the ſixth verſe to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another viſion which Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and
that is of an Angell flying in the midſt of heaven
with the <hi>everlaſting Goſpell;</hi> which is ſaid to be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Goſpel</hi> is preach'd in the midſt of heaven, that

            <p>Shee is deſcribed two wayes.</p>
            <p>1. From her <hi>Greatneſſe,</hi> called the great Citie.
Indeed ſhee hath beene great in large poſſeſsions,
and great revenues, ſo ſhee is fallen already in a
great meaſure, yet ſhee is too great. Great in her
opinion with Kings and Princes, and thus ſhee is
fallen already in a great meaſure, yet ſtill too great.
Great in her authority, and power over the Saints,
and Churches of Chriſt, and from this greatneſſe
ſhee is much fallen already, and yet too great.</p>
            <p>2. From her <hi>ſinnes</hi> that ſhee is guilty of, under
that word <hi>Babylon.</hi> For if wee conſult with this
book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> we ſhal find that the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that party is called <hi>Egypt, Sodome,</hi> and
<hi>Babylon,</hi> as if the wickedneſſes of them all were
concentred in her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Egypt</hi> was exceeding harſh, and cruell to the
Church, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> of God: ſo are they.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sodome</hi> was exceeding baſe, and filthy in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

ſhee is ſaid to <hi>fall,</hi> and not once, but againe
<hi>fallen, fallen.</hi> As it is Gods way to reward thoſe

becauſe ſhe is to fall, the Princes of the earth

            <p>By this late <hi>Babylon</hi> therefore, we underſtand the

<hi>Rome</hi> in her latitude, with all her Merchants, and
thoſe that ſymbolize with her, is here to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.
And that <hi>Rome,</hi> and no other is here meant,
I prove by theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Babylon</hi> is here in my text called, <hi>the great Citie,</hi>
and in S. <hi>Johns</hi> time, what was the great Citie but
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe: for ſuppoſe a man were in <hi>France,</hi> and
ſhould heare another ſay, that ſuch &amp; ſuch a work
were to be done in the great Citie, who would not
know that he meant <hi>Paris?</hi> or ſuppoſe a man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
ſhould heare another ſay, that ſome great work
were to be done in the great Citie, who would not
know, that hee meant <hi>London?</hi> In S. <hi>Johns</hi> time the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93998:7"/>
Roman Empire prevailing, the great Citie was
<hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe; and therefore the Holy Ghoſt ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that <hi>Babylon</hi> was the great Citie, ſaith expreſly,
that by <hi>Babylon</hi> is meant <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. This Citie, and Whore of <hi>Babylon,</hi> is ſaid to
ſit upon a beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 7. Now if we looke into
the book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> whereby much of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is to be interpreted, wee ſhall finde mention
made of foure beaſts to ſucceed one another, which
is there interpreted to be foure Kingdomes or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies.
The firſt of the Chaldees. The ſecond
of the Medes and Perſians. The third of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.
And the fourth of the Romans. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Johns</hi> time, the three firſt beaſts were dead,
and gone; the fourth and laſt, onely remained, the
Roman Empire. And what Citie or people hath
ſo ridden the Roman Empire, as <hi>Rome</hi> hath done?</p>
            <p>3. S. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that this beaſt that carried
the woman, this Citie was to have <hi>ſeven heads, and
ten hornes,</hi> Revel. 17. 7. which the Holy Ghoſt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preteth
in the ſame Chapter, ſaying. <hi>Theſe ſeven
heads are ſeven mountaines,</hi> ver. 9. or <hi>ſeven Kings,</hi> that
is, ſeverall ſorts of government, ver. 10. And the
ten hornes are ten Kings or Kingdomes, ver. 12.
which this Empire did break into. Now though
ſome think, whileſt they looke thorow falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives,
that they ſee ſome other Citie ſitting
upon ſeven hills, yet let any man ſhew us theſe
three met together in any other Citie. Who
knowes any other Citie whoſe building hath beene
laid on ſeven hills, ſo famous that the Citie it ſelfe
is called <hi>Septires,</hi> and whoſe government hath been
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93998:8"/>
of ſeven ſorts, and whoſe Empire hath beene bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
aſunder in to ten Kingdomes, or there-abouts?
This wee know is agreeable to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe, and
therefore <hi>Rome</hi> and no other people is here meant
by <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The Scripture is moſt expreſſe, telling us,
<hi>totidem verbis,</hi> that that Citie which in S. <hi>Johns</hi>
time raigned over the Kings of the earth, was <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
Revel. 17. 18. <hi>And the woman which thou ſaweſt, is
that great Citie which raigneth over the Kings of the
earth.</hi> But in <hi>S. Iohns</hi> time no other Citie then <hi>Rome</hi>
raigned over the Kings of the earth, and therefore
that, and that alone is truly <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, our late
<hi>Babylon.</hi> Whereupon <hi>Cornelius à lapide,</hi> conſidering

Church.</hi> But was <hi>Babylon</hi> a true Church? was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
a true Church? was <hi>Egypt</hi> a true Church?
<hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Sodome, Egypt,</hi> and truly <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oh what
abundance of hurt, and miſchiefe hath this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
poſition done, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is a
true Church! I my ſelfe have knowne ſome that

againſt her, who againe ſtagger'd in their faith, I
wiſh (I might not ſay they were revolted) when
they ſaw this opinion countenanced, and publiſhed
by great authority. And what ſay the Papiſts?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93998:8"/>
Your owne men, ſay they, hold that the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church, and that ſalvation is to be
had in her, as for the Church of <hi>England</hi> it is a Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall,
hereticall Church, wherein no ſalvation
is to be had. The ſafeſt way therefore is to joyne
with us, where, according to all men, both ours
and yours you may be ſure of your ſalvation. And
indeed the argument were very ſtrong, and home,
if the premiſes were true. But when it ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
by Scripture, that <hi>Sion</hi> is called <hi>Babylon,</hi> and
<hi>Babylon</hi> called <hi>Sion,</hi> then, and not till then will I
beleeve that <hi>Rome</hi> is a true Church. I know what
ſome urge, namely, that Antichriſt, that man of
ſinne, is to ſit in the houſe of God, and therefore
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the houſe, and Church
of God. But if we conſult with the originall, wee
ſhall finde that the words are not <gap reason="foreign">

It will bee ſaid this hath beene done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready.
True, it hath beene done, and much good

and heares what a world of evill is diſcovered in
each Committee; what filthineſſe, and lewdneſſe
of filthineſſe in this and that Prieſt, in this, and that

or rather ſob. Good Lord, what a lamentable
condition was this poore Land in? O that the

11. Thou Sonne of man, ſhew the houſe to the houſe of Iſrael,

True marble needs no painting. And Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

In the primitive times when the heathen would
put the Chriſtians to a cruell death, they tyed a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
man to a dead man, that ſo by the filthy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and ſtench of the dead carkaſſe, they might
poyſon the living man to death; this they counted
the worſt of death; the death of deaths. So when
the dead ordinances of mans Inventions, ſhall bee
tyed to the living ordinances of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
What is this, but as much as in us lyes to
poyſon the living with the dead? But I pray tell
me, what unkindneſſe hath the good ordinance of
Chriſt done to us, that wee ſhould put it to ſo ſad a
death. And as Chriſt ſaid to the Jewes, <hi>I have done
many good works amongſt you, for which of all theſe doe
you take up ſtones againſt me?</hi> ſo may the ordinances of
Chriſt ſay, O ye people of <hi>England,</hi> I have done
many good works among you; I have converted
many of you by preaching to you; I have healed
many of you, that were ſore bruiſed; I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
many of you that were ſore troubled, for
which of all theſe doe you uſe me thus unkindly;
for which of all theſe doe you thus tye, and linke
me to that, which never entred into the heart of
God to match mee with. What <hi>Luther</hi> ſaves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
preaching, that may, I ſay, concerning all
the ordinances of God. We that are Miniſters (ſaith
hee) think to take our people with our expreſſions,
and if we light upon an expreſſion that pleaſeth us
well, wee think that it ſhould convert every one
that heares it from us; but then the Auditor comes
<hi>&amp; hominem olet,</hi> hee ſmels man in the expreſſion,
turnes his back upon it, and the whole vaniſheth,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93998:11"/>
and comes to nothing. The explication is plaine,
and eaſie.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, I beſeech you, in Chriſts ſtead, that
are the heads of our Tribes, that nothing be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded
upon the Churches of Chriſt; but what
may clearely, and plainely have <hi>Jus divinum</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and engraven upon it. Your wiſedomes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but obſerve the ſeverall diſtractions that are
both in Church, and Common-wealth. If you
Analize the diſtractions of the Common-wealth,
you may finde thereby what is the head of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
in the Church alſo. And in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
this is that which troubles, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
are ſo illegall; O ſayes one, though it
coſt me never ſo much, yet if it were according to
law, I would yeeld unto it. This is that which cuts
ſo deepe, ſayes another, there is no law for theſe,
and theſe courſes: ſo in the Church, I cannot yeeld
to this, and that cuſtome, this and that Innovation,
for there is no law for it.</p>

Wherefore, I beſeech you take heed, that there be
no duſt left in the houſe of God in any corner. Give

is the mother of their devotion; therefore
they uſe their friends, that the people may be put

<hi>Babylon</hi> fall, and fall immediatly.</p>
            <p>Theſe be your duties.</p>
            <p>But it is exceeding hard, and very difficult to
doe theſe:<note place="margin">Object.</note> a perfect and full reformation is very
good, and neceſſary, but exceeding hard, and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.</p>
            <p>True. But did not <hi>Abrahams</hi> Sacrifice hang in
the bryers and buſhes?<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Ye read, that when <hi>Iſaac</hi>
ſhould have beene ſacrificed, God provided a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
but that Sacrifice did firſt hang in the bryars.
Ye are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and if you would
offer a ſacrifice of Gods owne a ſacrifice that
ſhould bee pleaſing to him, make account that it
muſt hang in the bryars, buſhes, and many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p>The heathen could ſay, <hi>Vertue groves upon the
rocks,</hi> and if the extirpation of <hi>Babylon,</hi> with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of true Religion, were not a hard work,
it were not fit for a Parliament to doe. They are
met to unty ſuch knots as none elſe can unty. The
heathen King ſaid to a poore man, Though this
gift be too great for you to receive, yet it is not too
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93998:13"/>
great for mee to give. Either it is of God that you
are aſſembled, or elſe it is not; if it bee not, why
ſit you here, if it be, can any thing be too hard for
God; Wherefore, let your faith laugh in the face
of difficulties. For as unbeliefe will make a thing
difficult though never ſo eaſie, ſo faith will make a
thing eaſie though never ſo difficult.</p>
            <p>But this worke is not onely exceeding hard and
difficult,<note place="margin">Object.</note> but very dangerous. In great reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
there muſt be ſome alterations, and alteration
cannot be without danger and trouble.</p>
            <p>1. There is much difference between ſmart and
danger.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> If a man have rotten, and aking teeth in
his head, though the pulling them out be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
troubleſome, and full of ache, and ſmart even
to bleeding of the gums, and vexation of all the
body, yet there is no danger, much ſmart, but no
danger. So in regard of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
though the pulling out of ſome rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
members may cauſe a bleeding, make trouble,
and ſome diſturbance, yet there is no danger, ſome
ache, but no danger.</p>
            <p>2. Many things ſeeme to bee dangerous at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that are not ſo at hand. When <hi>Moſes</hi> rod
was at a diſtance from him, it was turned to a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
and hee fled from it; but when hee tooke
it by the taile at Gods command, it was his rod
in his hand againe. Priſons, baniſhments, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
at a diſtance are ſerpents to us; when we come
to them, are exceeding comfortable, and our rods
in our hands.</p>
            <p>3. Suppoſe there were danger in a reformation,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93998:13"/>
and extirpation of all that's <hi>Babylons,</hi> yet there's
more danger in want of reformation. Vomiting
Phyſick is very troubleſome, but diſeaſe more. He
that ventures againſt <hi>Babylon,</hi> at the worſt can but
loſe his life, which may bee taken away by the
fall of ſome tyle, on the turning of ſome humour
in our body; but hee that partakes with <hi>Babylon</hi> in
her ſinne, ſhall partake with her in her plagues and
puniſhments to all eternity. What a trouble did
<hi>Achan</hi> cauſe, yet hee was but one man, his act one,
and the Babyloniſh garment but one. O what
trouble then will it be to ſuffer many <hi>Achans,</hi> and
that continually? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayes, that when the
Jewes would not acknowledge Chriſt, leſt the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
ſhould come, and take their place, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
loſſe, they loſt moſt. They would not loſe
their earth, and they loſt their heaven, they would
not loſe their place, and they loſt their God.</p>
            <p>4. But ſuppoſe that there were the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in the beſt reformation, is there not enough in
heaven to pay for all. Nay, my beloved, even on
this ſide heaven, there is no loſſe by Chriſt in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
for Chriſt; <hi>non habendo habemus,</hi> In not having,
wee have. I remember what is written of <hi>fortis
Ziſca,</hi> and (as my Author ſayes) written upon his
tomb in his Epitaph, thus, Eleven times in joyning
battell, I went Victor out of the field, I ſeemed
worthily to have defended the cauſe of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
and hungry, againſt the delicate, fat, and
gluttonous Prieſts, and for that cauſe to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
help at the hand of God. Mark the empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
it lyes there, <hi>And for that cauſe.</hi> But ye have an
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93998:14"/>
example of <hi>Jehoſhaph at,</hi> which is exceeding full, and
much encouraging, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>And the Lord was
with Jehoſhaphat, becauſe hee walked in the firſt wayes of
his father David.</hi> He brought up reformation to the
firſt inſtitution, and hee was full therein, for it is
faid, he walked <hi>in the firſt wayes,</hi> not in the laſt, of his
father <hi>David,</hi> and ſought not to <hi>Baalim, Nor after
the doings of Iſrael,</hi> ver. 4. And ſee what followed.
<hi>Therefore the Lord eſtabliſhed the Kingdome in his hand,
and all Judab brought to Jehoſhaphat preſents, and he had
riches, and honour in abundance, ver.</hi> 5. The Prophet
<hi>Haggai</hi> is moſt expreſſe, and bids them compute,
whether that from the very day that they ſet their
hands to the building of the Temple. God did not
build them up in outward mercies. Certainly, my
beloved, the onely way to gaine, is to loſe for
God. It is a greater mercy to have, that I may
loſe for God, then that I may keepe for my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that a man be in place of authority,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
and finde that his heart is exceeding dull, and dead,
and backward to this work of reformation, what
ſhould hee doe that may give wings to his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that may move and quicken up his ſpirit in this
particular?</p>
            <p>In this caſe,<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> let him put himſelfe upon the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of his authority in the execution of Juſtice. For
it is with the Magiſtracie herein, as with the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie,
the way to preach, is to preach; the way to
prayer, is prayer. <hi>Iter ad gratiam eſt gratia,</hi> The
way to grace is grace. God is pleaſed ſometimes
to come in with freſh ſtrength, and to give new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93998:14"/>
in the heat of preaching. So in the acts of
Magiſtracie, God comes in alſo in the diſpenſation
thereof.</p>
            <p>2. In that caſe, preſent your ſoules with that
great truſt that is comitted to you, &amp; put upon you.
If a Miniſter when he is banding away his pretious
houres betweene this, and that play-book; or when
he is moſt prodigall of his peoples time (for it is
theirs not his) if then I ſay when hee is moſt idle,
and indiſpoſed to thoſe great ſervices, he could but
realize a Congregation, and preſent before him the
many ſoules that depend upon him, and as it were
heare them calling out unto him; O Sir, ſtudy,
ſtudy for our ſoules, ſtudy for our eternity; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
this would awaken, move, and put life into
him. So if thoſe that are in authority, and place of
Magiſtracie, would but preſent themſelves with
thoſe many thouſands that have entruſted them
with their liberties, eſtates, lives, I had almoſt ſaid
conſciences, and eternities, ſurely it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
quickning, and helpfull.</p>
            <p>3. Conſider your preſent oportunity. Oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
once loſt, is never recovered. My words ſhall
know no flattery, never did <hi>England</hi> ſee a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more fitted for the ſervice and work of God,
then this now is. A quiver ſo full of choſen and
poliſhed ſhafts for the Lords work. I have often
thought that God would deale by our preſent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
aſſembly, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> did deale with
the Jaw-bone, wherewith hee had ſlaine heaps of
the Philiſtines, which when hee had done, hee
threw it away; but afterwards thirſting, and being
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93998:15"/>
like to dye for want of water, God ſent him back
to his Jaw-bone againe, and tells him that he would
cleave that, and open a fountaine of water to him
from thence. So hath God uſed this great Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
ordinance for the ſlaying of many Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines,
but, in theſe latter times, this Jaw-bone of
ours hath beene throwne away, and deſpiſed in
the eyes of the world; and it may bee now God
will open a fountaine of water from hence, that
wee may all be revived, and live thereby. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
then let all thoſe that are of this honourable
aſſembly, think; It may be God hath raiſed mee
up to this time, all the while I was at the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
God was laying in of abilities in mine education
for this occaſion; and ſhall I loſe this oportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>Oportunitas indicat virum,</hi> oportunity ſhewes
the man, and makes the man, and ſometimes hath
the caſting voyce for mans eternity.</p>
            <p>4. Conſider this alſo, that if reformation be not
now wrought, our ſinne and guilt will be greater
then ever it was. This Parliament time is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
time for good or evill; take a good
work, and though it were never ſo private, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall,
yet if it paſſe in this houſe, it does com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
nationall: ſo take an evill, and though it
were never ſo private before, yet if it paſſe here, it
will take an higher degree, and commence nationall
wickedneſſe; this is a fearefull evill, and very
dreadfull, that a perſonall ſinne ſhould become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall.
I know you are unwilling that any ſinne
ſhould ſteale it's degree; as therefore you doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
that no perſonall ſinne ſhould become natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93998:15"/>
I beſeech you in Chriſts ſtead, let the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
be full and perfect, and let every man ſay,
<hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, I alſo will have a hand in it, and
ſhoulder at it. <hi>Downe with it, downe with it, even to the
ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if you be a Miniſter, you know your duty;
onely (as <hi>Luther</hi> phraſes it) let your knowledge
be incarnate into godly practice; good works are
faith incarnate, knowledge incarnate. Now you
read <hi>Joſhua</hi> 3. 13, 15, 17. That when the children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> went thorow <hi>Iordan,</hi> thoſe Prieſts that bare
the Ark of the Lord, were firſt to enter upon the
waters, &amp; to ſtay in the midſt of them, till all <hi>Iſrael</hi>
paſt over. The water doth note affliction, the feet of
thoſe that bare the Ark, are to be firſt in danger, and
there to ſtand till all be over. In the place before
mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. 10, 11, 12. Gods threatning is
very terrible. As if he ſhould ſay, As for thoſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites
that goe aſtray when <hi>Iſrael</hi> goes aſtray, and
doe admit the uncircumciſed in heart to myne holy
things, though they be ſuffered in mine houſe, yet
they ſhal but do the out-works thereof, as for thoſe
inward things of mine houſe, and ſelfe, they ſhall
not be admitted to them, nor truſted with them.
Though they may preach ſome outward truthes,
which they may read of in books, yet for thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſecret heart things of the Covenant, I will
never truſt them with them, they ſhall not draw
neere to me. O therefore beloved, that wee could
denie our own knowledge, wiſedomes, parts, gifts,
liberties, and all that's ours in this great ſervice.</p>
            <p>But if a mans condition,<note place="margin">Queſt.</note> and ſtate bee private,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93998:16"/>
what muſt hee doe to help forward the fall of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take heed that thou do nothing to hinder Gods
publike deſigne by your private practices,<note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the evill of all your doings, leſt your private
wickedneſſe do <hi>ponere obicem</hi> to Gods proceedings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achans</hi> wickedneſſe was committed in the dark,
and with much privacie, yet what influence had it
into publike miſery?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> murmured againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
envied at him, for which ſhee was ſtricken with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie,
whereby the whole congregation was ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and their march hindered. It is ſaid 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.
33. that the high places were not pulled downe, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the people were not prepared for the Lord;</hi> not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the <hi>Prince</hi> was not prepared, or the <hi>great ones</hi>
not prepared, but becauſe the <hi>people</hi> were not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
It is in regard of truth, as in regard of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
in this particular, though the Baker may have
kneaded his dough, that is, his falſe opinion, and
made it ready, yet as the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaks, and
as <hi>Zanchy</hi> interprets the place, he ſets not in, till the
Oven be heat, that is, the heart of the people war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and prepared for it. So for a truth alſo, or a
publike mercy, and deliverance, though God have
provided it for a people, yet it is not handed to
them, and ſet in, till their hearts be warmed &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for it. You may obſerve therfore, that when
<hi>David</hi> had made his penitentiall Pſalm for his own
ſinne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. after much ſupplication for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of his owne evill, and for grace, and comfort
he comes at laſt in the 18. <hi>ver.</hi> to this petition; <hi>Doe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93998:16"/>
good in thy good pleaſure unto Sion, &amp;c.</hi> How comes
that in here? Yes, when a man hath once repeated
of his owne ſinne, and cleared that reckoning, then
he is fitteſt to ask mercy for the Church, and till
then unfit. Therefore though in regard of your
owne ſoules, your owne eternitie, you will not part
with your owne ſinnes, yet if you have any pitty,
any compaſſion, any bowells towards y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>wne
Country, or Churches of God, put away the evill
of all your doings.</p>
            <p>2. Though your condition be never ſo private,
you may diſcover the wayes of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the works,
and complotments of the Baby loniſh party: and
the diſcovery of evill is halfe it's ruine, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>They ſhall proceed no further,
for their folly ſhall be made manifeſt to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. You may <hi>beleeve</hi> downe the walls of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
Faith removes mountaines, though it bee but a
graine; By it the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> fell, in the blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of thoſe poore Rammes hornes. And the walls
of <hi>Iericho</hi> were built up to heaven, ſurely then the
Walls of <hi>Babylon</hi> cannot bee higher. Wherefore
ſeeke out thoſe promiſes, and threatnings, ſet your
heart towards them, beare your ſelves upon them,
urge, and preſſe God by vertue of them, and ſay,
though it be very unlikely that <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhould fall,
yet God hath thus, and thus promiſed, thus and
thus threatned, and he is faithfull, here I will ſtay,
and here I'le wait.</p>
            <p>4. You may ſpread the blaſphemies of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byloniſh
faction in the eyes of heaven. Thus did
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93998:17"/>
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when <hi>Rabſhakeh</hi> blaſphemed, and wee
know how it prevailed. Great, and grievous have
the blaſphemies beene wherewith the men of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
have blaſphemed the Saints of God, and the
footſteps of his Annoynted, which God takes as
done againſt himſelfe, and ſo repayes them, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
35. 12. compared with the 13 verſe. In the 12
ver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> ſaid, <hi>I have heard all thy blaſphemies which
thou haſt ſpoken againſt the mountaines of Iſrael, ſaying,
they are layd deſolata, they are given us to conſume:</hi> But
in the 13 verſe theſe words are charged upon them,
as if they were ſpoken againſt God himſelfe, <hi>Thus
with your mouth you have boaſted againſt mee, and have
multiplyed your words againſt me.</hi> Therefore at the 14
verſe followes the puniſhment. The ſpreading of
their helliſh blaſphemies, is exceeding prevalent
with God, and very potent.</p>
            <p>5. You may uſe all the Intereſt you have in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and whatſoever credit you have there, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
it, which wee beſeech you doe now in this
particular. Your prayers puts them under Gods
curſe.</p>
            <p>6. Though your condition, and ſtation be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſo private, you may according to your place,
curſe the practices and complotments of all the
enemies. Doth not <hi>Iacob</hi> ſeeme to pronounce a
curſe upon the practices of <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> though
his owne children, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 7. <hi>Curſed be their wrath
for it was cruell, &amp;c. for in their anger they flew a man,
and in their ſelfe, will they digg'd downe a wall.</hi> What
is the endeavour of the Babylonians, but to digge
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93998:17"/>
downe the walls of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and of our protection.
O my ſoule come not thou into their ſecret. God
hath commanded that <hi>Meroſh</hi> ſhould bee curſed,
and curſed bitterly; becauſe they went not forth
to help the Lord againſt the mighty. How bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then are they to be curſed, that goe forth to help
the mighty againſt the Lord.</p>
            <p>It was a Statute, &amp; a Law in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
the ancient land-marks, he ſhould be curſed.
<hi>Curſed,</hi> ſayes the text, <hi>ſhall hee be that removes the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Land-marks, and let all the people ſay Amen.</hi> What
is the ancient Land-mark of <hi>England,</hi> but our Laws
and Religion, and therefore if any man ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
this our Land-mark, curſed ſhall he be, of the
Lord curſed, and let all the people ſay Amen.</p>
            <p>7. What ever perſonall injury hath beene done
unto you by any of the enemies of the Churches,
you may, you muſt paſſe them by, ſo farre as it is
a private concernment, and you ſhall not loſe
hereby, your forgiveneſſe haſtens their ruine. For
this cauſe, as you may read, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 2, 3, 4. God
himſelfe tooke vengeance on <hi>Miriam,</hi> becauſe <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
was a meeke man: ſee how the mention of his
meekneſſe is brought in by way of parentheſis at
the third verſe, as the cauſe of Gods proceedings
againſt her, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. Wherefore my beloved, have
any beene wronged, and injured by your, and Gods
enemies, carrie it meekly, carrie it humbly, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge,
no revenge, but all forgiveneſſe. And have
they begun to fall before you, let there be much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,
but no inſulting, prayſes, but no inſulting,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93998:18"/>
prayer ſtill, but no inſulting. Let your moderation
bee knowne to all, for God is at hand. Theſe are
your duties. Which things if they bee in you, and
abound, in due time <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall, and you ſhall
ſee it; for the ſecond doctrine tells us it.</p>
            <p>Though Antichriſtian and Romiſh Babylon be never
ſo great,<note place="margin">Doct. 2.</note> yet it ſhall fall, and fall aſſuredly.</p>
            <p>This is but equall,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> thoſe that have fallen from
God, ſhall fall by God; thoſe that have made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to fall, ſhall fall themſelves. Now the man
of ſinne is the ſtarre that is fallen from heaven, who
in the 2 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 2. 3. (as ſome obſerve) is called in the
abſtract, <hi>Apoſtacie</hi> not an Apoſtate, a <hi>falling away,</hi>
not one that is fallen away, ſo notorious is hee for
ſinfull falling; and as God rewards grace with his
owne grace, ſo hee rewards ſinne with it's owne
likeneſſe.</p>
            <p>2. How elſe ſhall <hi>Sion</hi> riſe, if <hi>Babylon</hi> doe not
fall? It is ſaid, when the Lord exalteth the low
tree, he bringeth downe the high tree, then ſhall all
the trees of the Forreſt rejoyce. God is making
way to ſuch a Jubilee, therefore <hi>Babylon</hi> muſt fall,
and that aſſuredly.</p>
            <p>3. Thoſe that are too bigge for themſelves, and
cannot mannage their owne greatneſſe, muſt needs
fall. Pride goes before a fall; It is the naturall <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
of <hi>Babylon</hi> to bee proud, and great, great and
proud. <hi>Babell</hi> was at firſt built to affront providence,
that the world might be no more drowned. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſayes that King in <hi>Daniel,</hi> Is not this great
<hi>Babylon</hi> that I have built for mine honour. And
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93998:18"/>
               <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. ſaith our late <hi>Babylon, Iſu a Queene, &amp;c.</hi>
They have beene great, and in their owne eyes
great, ſurely therefore their owne waight ſhall
ſink them.</p>
            <p>4. Muſt not thoſe needs fall that are ſet in dark
and ſlippery places, whom the Angell of the Lord
drives? Now, if ever, the places of Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
are very ſlippery, themſelves in the dark, and
the Angell of God driving them. Therefore they
ſhall fall, and fall aſſuredly.</p>
            <p>And if ſo.<note place="margin">Vſe.</note> Then learne wee how to take notice
of, and behold theſe great works of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as they fall out in our
generation. It is in regard of the evill that comes
to evill men, as in regard of the good that comes to
the good. Now when the Saints doe receive any
mercy, their hearts ſtick not in it, nor their eyes on
it, but they ſee it lying under it's relation, in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the word, and promiſe, ſaying; It is indeed a
great mercy that I have a houſe, and place to dwell
in, but God hath not onely given me ſweet habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but he hath given it mee in the way of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
<hi>to performe the mercy promiſed.</hi> Hee hath given
mee wife, children, and friends, <hi>to performe the mercy
promiſed,</hi> Nay, he hath given mee Chriſt himſelfe
<hi>to performe the mercy promiſed,</hi> Luk. 1. Thus they ſee
all things, lying under a promiſe in that relation.
So alſo when ye ſee any judgement befall the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Gods Church, you are not to looke upon
them, as meere works of God, but to looke upon
them in their relations, in relation to the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93998:19"/>
as lying under the threatning, and the fruits
of it; and the reaſon hereof is this eſpecially, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
otherwiſe you doe not ſee the whole work
of God, when you doe ſee it before you. As it is
ſaid of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 29. 4. <hi>Yet the Lord hath not given
you eyes to ſee, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As now ſuppoſe that a foole, a mad man, or a
beaſt ſhould come into the congregation, though
they ſhould ſee the water of Baptiſme, yet they
would not ſee the Sacrament, or halfe the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
becauſe they could not ſee it under it's rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Wherefore my beloved, when ever you
ſhall behold the hand of God upon the world, in
the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and his great works, that way, be
ſure that ye behold them under the relation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Lords threatning, and ſay; True, here
is a Babyloniſh Prieſt, crying out, Alas, Alas my
living, I have wife and children to maintaine, and
all is gone, my preferment is gone, my hope is
gone, my place, and office gone. But all this is <hi>to
performe the judgement threatned;</hi> God threatned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that he would <hi>put it into the hearts of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the earth to eat her fleſh, and drink her blood,</hi> Revel.
17. 16. Now it is in a great meaſure fulfilled, for
her great revenues, and rich livings are in part her
fleſh, and blood. God ſaid before, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. <hi>That
her Merchants ſhould ſtand a far off weeping, &amp; wailing,
and ſaying, Alas, alas, that great Citie.</hi> Thus is the
word of the Lord fulfilled, and God is faithfull.</p>
            <p>As the fall of Babylon is very certaine,<note place="margin">Doct. 3.</note> ſo it is the duty
of the Saints to ſpeake of it as if it were done already.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:93998:19"/>
Wee are bound to honour the faithfulneſſe of
God,<note place="margin">Reaſ. 1.</note> more than the faithfulneſſe of any other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
other things are faithfull to us, (as <hi>Salvian</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
becauſe he is faithfull. We expect cooling,
and cleanſing from the water, and that is faithfull:
Why? For God is faithfull, he bids it be faithfull
to us. Wee expect warmth, and light from the
fire, and that is faithfull: Why? for God is
faithfull, hee bids it bee faithfull to us. In all
theſe faithfull creatures there is but a drop of
Gods faithfulneſſe, and when they promiſe, we
beleeve them, and ſhall wee not beleeve him when
hee promiſes, and when hee threatens? When a
faithfull friend promiſes, wee ſay it ſhall be, but
wee are to honour Gods faithfulneſſe more, and
therefore to ſpeak of the thing promiſed, or threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
as if it were done already.</p>
            <p>When wee doe but begin a good worke, God <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
ſpeaks of it as done already, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. It is ſaid, <hi>by
faith Abraham offered up Iſaac;</hi> yet hee did not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
offer him up, but intended it, and ſet him ſelfe
to doe it at Gods command; <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 20. it is ſaid,
that <hi>Moſes tooke his wife, and ſonne, and returned to the
land of Egipt;</hi> Yet hee was but in the beginning of
his returne. When we have begun any good work
for God, he ſpeaks of it, as done altogether; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he having begun that great and good work for
the Churches, the fall of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it is our duty alſo
to ſpeak of it, as if it were done already.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore correct our manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.<note place="margin">Vſe 1.</note>
If any ſtorme or trouble ariſe upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93998:20"/>
wee are ready to break forth into diſpondent
concluſions, ſaying, God is now gone, mercy
gone, the ordinances gone, wee were in good hope
to have ſeene good dayes, the ruine of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
enemies; but they doe ſo prevaile, as that
wee have no hope at all in this particular. But
though the extremity of the Church bee never ſo
great, and the enemies never ſo flouriſhing, wee
ought to ſay, They are fallen, they are fallen.</p>
            <p>But how can wee ſpeake thus when an utter
improbability,<note place="margin">Object.</note> and unlikelihood dwells upon the
buſineſſe?</p>
            <p>Yes.<note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For when God deſtroyes his enemies, hee
either takes them away by a weake hand, as <hi>Jer.</hi>
50. 45. <hi>The leaſt of the flocke ſhall draw them out;</hi> Or
they ſhall periſh by their owne hands, as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 9.
16. <hi>The wicked is ſnared in the work of his own hands;</hi> Or
they ſhall be deſtroyed without hands, As <hi>Job</hi> 34.
20. <hi>The mighty ſhall bee taken away without hands.</hi>
And is this true may the ſoule ſay, that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church ſhall periſh by a weake hand,
or by their owne hand, or without hands; then
will I never ſinke, and deſpaire in my heart, or give
ill language to Gods faithfulneſſe, though the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of Gods Churches be never ſo low, though
the condition of the enemies be never ſo high.</p>
            <p>If wee are to ſpeake of this worke,<note place="margin">Vſe 2.</note> as if it
were done already, when it is not done indeed;
then how contrary are thoſe to Gods word, who
ſay it is not done when it is done indeed. That
will not acknowledge Gods worke, that ſay on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93998:20"/>
the contrary, It is not fallen, It is not fallen,
when it is fallen in truth. And ſuch there ſhall be,
who when the viall is powred upon the ſeat of
the beaſt, <hi>ſhall gnaw their tongues, and blaſpheme
the God of heaven, not repenting of their deeds,</hi> Revel.
16. 10, 11. But I hope better things of you, and
ſuch as accompany ſalvation. Onely now if there
bee any here, that have given any aſſiſtance to
<hi>Babylon,</hi> by pen, tongue, or hand, let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
O every one, repent you of your ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
repent, repent you left you partake with <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
in all her plagues, and torments to all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
And remember that ſpeech of <hi>Godtes Calchus,</hi>
I am afraid to denie the truth, leſt I bee for
ever denyed by the truth. <hi>Chriſtus eſt via &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas,
non conſuetudo,</hi> Chriſt is the way, and truth,
not cuſtome, not innovation. And if there bee
ever a drunkard, ſwearer, adulterer, Sabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breaker,
or prophane perſon here, let him la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to get into Chriſt, leſt when hee ſhall ſee
theſe great works come to paſſe (and come to
paſſe ye ſhall ſee them ſhortly) with greater
works of God then I have mentioned, ye may bee
able to rejoyce in them; whereas otherwiſe you
will ſay, I, theſe be glorious works indeed, and
comfortable for thoſe that are in Chriſt, but I am a
poore wretched drunkard, &amp; not in Chriſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
above all things get into-Chriſt; ſo ſhall you
rejoyce with the felicity of Gods choſen.</p>
            <p>And if any have had any ill thoughts, or words,
of, or againſt Gods people, now change your
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93998:21"/>
words, and your thoughts of them: For, for their
ſakes it is, that thoſe great works are to bee done,
<hi>Iſ.</hi> 43. 14. <hi>Thus</hi> ſaith the Lord your Redeemer, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
one of Iſrael, for your ſake I have ſent to Babylon,
and have brought downe all the Nobles, and the
Chaldeans, whoſe crie is in
the ſhippes.
