         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WARNING OF LOVE FROM THE Bowels of Life, TO THE Several Generations of Profeſſors of this AGE, that they may Awaken and Turn towards the Life, to be truly cleanſed &amp; ſaved by its powerful Living Virtue, before the ſtorm of Wrath break forth and theover-flowing Scourge overtake them, which will ſweep away the ſtrongeſt and moſt wel-built refuge of Lies, and ſink thoſe ſouls (even into the pit of miſery) which are there found, when the ſtorm comes.</head>
            <p>Held forth in four <hi>Propoſitions, Aſſertions,</hi> or <hi>Conſiderations</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Man</hi> in his <hi>Loſt Eſtate,</hi> and his <hi>Recovery</hi> out of it.</p>
            <p>Propoſ. 1. <hi>That Man is fallen from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THere is an Everlaſting, Infinite, pure Fountain and Well-ſpring of Life, from whence all Creatures came; from whence their <hi>Life, Being, Motion, Vertue</hi> and <hi>Rest</hi> flows, in which they all have a place and ſtanding according to their nature, eſtate, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature and courſe of operation in his eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, who made all, diſpoſeth of all, ruleth in and over all eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: Whoſe everlaſting kingdom and dominion (which was before all, and will be after all) cannot be excluded by any power or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion which ariſeth after it; but onely ſo far as it ſelf hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it hath given way to that power of darkneſs, which is contrary to it: which how it ſprang up, what it hath to do, and how it is to vaniſh, is not for man's comprehenſion to fathom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64214:2"/>
In this Spring of life, man had an eſpecial place and ſtanding. The Lord had created and placed him Supreme, under himſelf, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the works of his hands, gave him his Kingdom here on earth under him, gave him his Image to rule in, even a ſufficient mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that eternal wiſdom in which he formed him, to which he was to be ſubject himſelf, and by which he was to reign over and order all with delight, joy, and comfort in himſelf, to the praiſe and glory of him who formed all, and had given him the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over all. Here was the ſweet eſtate, the ſweet peace, the ſweet liberty, the ſweet unity of all, all being kept and preſerved in that <hi>Life, Vertue, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Power</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> wherein they were made, the creatures naturally becoming ſubject to, ſerving and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying man (man uſing them and ruling over them not in the Tyranny, not in the Luſt, not in the Vanity, not in the Exceſs; but in the Righteouſneſs, in the Love, in the Meekneſs, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, in the Divine Wiſdom, in the pure power and virtue of the Life) man likewiſe naturally vailing to his Maker, walking in his Light, living in his Life, ſhining in his Beauty, conquering and triumphing (over all that might aſſault) in his ſtrength, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing perfect and ſtreight before him in purity and cleanneſs of heart, in that ſweet, pretious, preſerving fear, which naturally ſprings up in the heart of the creature (not degenerated) towards his Creator and Preſerver. Now, what could man want, having the Spring of Life ſo near him? What could he deſire in the Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the Life, which the Father of Life could have with-held from him? Had he asked the Spirit, could the Father have denied him? and had he ſtood ſtill a while in the Life, out of the Luſt, could he have forborn asking the Spirit? Had he not ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been tempted to the Tree of Knowledg, ſurely he had eaten of the Tree of Life, and had lived for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But man being in honour, lodged not one night, (HE FEL THE FIRST NIGHT,</hi> read me who can) <hi>but became like the beaſts that periſh.</hi> He loſt the Divine Image, and then had at beſt but the Natural: but that, depending upon the Divine, the beauty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was loſt too. He loſt the Eternal Wiſdom, he loſt the Spring, he loſt the Godhead, he loſt that which was to reign over the Creatures, and then he became but as the Creatures, nay worſe then the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. What he henceforth knows of God (as he ſtands in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation) he knows naturally, like bruit beaſts (even by the natural exerciſe of his mind, with the faculties thereof, even as the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64214:2"/>
beaſts learn and know by their nature, after their kind) and in what he thus knows, he corrupts himſelf worſe than the beaſts. Let the Lord try him never ſo mu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h, never ſo often, drop down of <hi>the dew of heaven</hi> upon him, ſend him <hi>line upon line, precept upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, now a little and then a little,</hi> yet he ſtill remains bruitiſh, both in his underſtanding, receiving, and in his making uſe of it all. Still he forgets the truth, and loſes himſelf in the image, gets a notion, an imagination, a comprehenſion of ſomewhat into his natural part (which changes him not inwardly, but ſtill he is the ſame in his root, ground and nature) but the Life, the Eternal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue he is ſtill eſtranged from, and ſo is bruitiſh in all his knowledg and apprehenſions of God and his Truths, bruitiſh in his worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of him, bruitiſh in his belief and hopes, and his immortal ſoul periſhes under all. Outward Iſrael was a true and full reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of him, who had many Teachings, a pure Law of Worſhip, and ſacrificing, many Prophets to reduce and reſtore them to the right path of holineſs and obedience, but ſtil they were erring in their hearts from the Lord and his pure Law of Life, not knowing their Owner or their Maſters Crib, ſo wel as the Ox or Aſs did theirs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
            <p>Propoſ. 2. <hi>That Man, by all the imaginations that can enter into his heart, and by all the means he can uſe or courſes he can run, cannot return back to God again, or ſo much as deſire it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Fall of Man from God is ſuch, that it hath benummed all his ſences, yea ſo bereft him of them, that he cannot feel his own eſtate. He is dead, ſpiritually dead, and can no more feel his death, his ſpiritual death, then a man naturally dead can his natural death. He is bewitched into a fools Paradice, where he hath a new Life, a new Vertue, a new Wiſdom, a new Kingdom, a new Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (which is indeed but Death) with which he is ſo tranſported, that he forgetteth the old; and in this new ſpirit and eſtate, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as deſire after it. Men ſpeak of the Reliques of the Image, which the firſt man had: Ah poor deceived hearts. What Reliques of Life are there in a Dead Man? What Reliques of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in a man wholly degenerated and corrupted? Nay, nay; The Spiritual Image, the Divine Image, the Eternal Life, the pure Power and Vertue is wholly loſt, and there is nothing left, but what is captivated and deſtroied through the degenerating power. There is nothing at all of the Eternal Kingdom, of the Spiritual Image, of the Divine Life to be found in fallen Man, but a little ſeed; and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:64214:3"/>
that Seed not ſo much as ſown in his earth, as he ſtands in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; for the ſowing of it is the beginning of the work anew. And now, who can read this Riddle? <hi>The Kingdom is within every man, &amp; yet not ſo much as ſown in any man, till the ſpringing up of the eternal ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue according to the Eternal pleaſure; nay the earth is not ſo much as prepared to receive the Seed, until the Lord ſend his Plough into the heart.</hi> So that it is impoſsible for fallen Man to attain to ſo much as one true breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or deſire after God again; this muſt ariſe from the Grace, from the Mercy, from a New begetting (by the free gift) towards Life, towards the Divine Image again, which was ſlain in Man (and the impreſſion of it on him wholly loſt) ever ſince the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world in his heart, which God hath ſet there, ever ſince he choſe it. And indeed fallen Man degenerated Man (would the Spirit of the Lord let him alone, and not diſquiet him) likes his own eſtate well enough. The world being written in his heart, his thoughts and deſires are centred there, &amp; of themſelvs reach no further. Might he but have the enjoyment of the creatures without, and the enjoiment of ſuch a kind of earthly knowledg &amp; Wiſdom within, as he now aſpires after, he would ſit down in <hi>Egypt</hi> &amp; <hi>Babylon,</hi> reſting fully ſatisfied with <hi>Egyptian</hi> knowledg &amp; wiſdom, &amp; with the Babyloniſh treaſures (might he have enough of them) and never think of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the pure holy Land of Life any more.</p>
            <p>But when the Eternal ſtirs in him, when the pure Light opens at any time, then he has ſome little Glimmerings of his eſtate, then he has ſome ſenſe of his fallen condition, and ſome deſire to remedy it; What doth he then? Then he beſtirs himſelf to get ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to cover him, then he gathers ſtones and makes mortar to build up a Wall and raiſe a Tower, that he may not lye open to the deluge of Wrath; for, by this ſtirring of the life, he hath ſome little taſte and ſight, that he is not one with the life, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from it. The ſoul being awakened by the opening of its own ſpring in it, begins to feel the want of its ſpring: It wants the true Vertue, the true Peace, the true Joy, the true Comfort and Refreſhment, the true Reſt, the true Liberty, the true Life, the true Light; and for want of this, its eſtate is miſerable: And in the ſtirring of the Spring, it feels this miſery; and in this feeling it groans, it mourns, it pants, it cryes out, and the creatural earthly ſpirit can have no reſt becauſe of it. What therefore doth the creature do to ſtill this cry? Why, it joyneth, as it were, with the ſoul, it uſeth all the means it can to attain that, which the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64214:3"/>
ſoul ſees the want of: It inquireth after God, hearkneth out after thoſe that know him, ſtudieth the Law, obſerveth the Statutes and Ordinances, performeth the Duties, Believeth, Prayeth, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, Waiteth: nay, what is it, which the creature will nor ſet upon in this diſtreſs (eſpecially if the Convictions of the Eternal Light purſue and follow him cloſe) to ſtill the cry of the ſoul, and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the price of the Eternal Inheritance, which is ſet before the Soul, which the Soul can never be at reſt or ſatisfied, without ſome aſſurance of, and progreſs towards? But all this will not do. Man in all his own obedience, as well as in his diſobedience is ſhut out. <hi>There is a flaming ſword which turns every way, to keep the way of the Tree of Life;</hi> inſomuch as man can by no means come at the way to the true life, nor enter into the ſtrait and narrow Path that leads thereto, but as he is cut to the heart, his life let out, and as he dyes, and comes into unity with that which ſlayes him, and keeps the way from him. So that man, in his running to God is thruſt by, as well as in his running from him: in his willing and deſiring after him he is rejected, as well as in his willing againſt him. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> Mark, There is a Birth of Bloods, a Birth of the will of the Fleſh, a Birth of the will of Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13. all theſe will, all theſe run (ſome of them very hard) but they are all thruſt by, and diſ-regarded by the Lord both in their willing, and in ther running. There are <hi>many</hi> found <hi>running the race, but one obtains the prize,</hi> which one is he that is <hi>born of God,</hi> to whom when God gives the prize, he will ſay to all the other Births (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their Willing and Running, their Beleeving, Hoping, Praying, &amp;c.) <hi>Depart from me I know you not,</hi> ye are the fruit of a ſtrange Womb, not of my Spouſe, and ſo muſt not inherit my Kingdome. And as all theſe will be cut ſhort of the Inheritance at laſt; ſo all that they do at preſent, is loathſome to the Lords ſoul. <hi>The ſacrifice of the wicked is abomination; how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked minde,</hi> Prov. 21. 27. His Sacrifice, his Worſhipping of God, his Praying, his reading of Scriptures, his meditating there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of God, and his Works, his Beleeving, Hoping, Waiting, fearing of Threatnings and applying of Promiſes, &amp;c. all is abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The wicked man, he whoſe heart is not circumciſed by the Lords Eternal Spirit, whatſoever he can, or doth Sacrifice to God, the Lord loaths, and it cannot profit his ſoul.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>Yea, when he does them in hypocriſie, ſo they are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:64214:4"/>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, more then ſo. When he doth them with an evill heart, they are much more abominable, <hi>how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked minde?</hi> but let him bring it with a good minde with that which he calls the good heart (for the circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed heart, the heart of the true New Birth is only the good heart, not that heart which every falſe Birth is apt to call good) let him bring it with that heart, which he takes to be the upright heart, with an honeſt intention, ſo far as he knows, take his Sacrifices at the very beſt, at the very pureſt he can attain to, yet then they are Abomination.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon hereof is plain and manifeſt. <hi>The Fountain is unclean,</hi> the Root in him is corrupt; And <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Make the Tree good, and his fruit will be good:</hi> But while the Tree is bad, the Fruit cannot be good. Now can the holy God be pleaſed with that Sacrifice which comes from the unclean Spring? Can God own or approve that knowledge of himſelf, that Faith, that Love, that Obedience, that Integrity, or Uprightneſs, that Induſtry or Diligence, thoſe Prayers or Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which man pumps up out of the old Ciſtern? Nay all theſe muſt into the Pit, with the common Filthineſs and Pollutions of the earth: And when the Lord rakes this aſide from the ſeveral ſorts of Profeſſors, what will be left in them? Oh how many have builded up a wall, dawbing it with untempered Mortar, which will not ſtand in the day of Trial, nor ſhelter them from the Eternal Flames? Oh what yelling and roaring will there ſhortly be in ſuch, as by no means would be warned, but would be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of themſelves in their falſe knowledg and practiſes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their Fabricks of Religion to the trial of the day! and the day will try them indeed, even to the bitter perplexity and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of their hearts, when they come to ſee that there is now no way of eſcape, but they muſt lye down in the bed of Eternal Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Miſery, and Torment, and in utter Separation from that, wherein they thought they had a large and unqueſtionable ſhare.</p>
            <p>Propoſ. 3. <hi>That all Profeſsions of God and of Chriſt upon the earth, all knowledg and beliefs whatſoever, with all practiſes of Duties and Ordinances of Worſhip, ſave only ſuch as proceed from, and are held in the pure life, are but as ſo many Fig-leaves, or deceitful Plaiſters, which may skin over the wound, but canot truly heal it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The wound of man is deep by the Fall: He hath really loſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64214:4"/>
God, is ſhut out of his Commonwealth, yea (in that eſtate) is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether without hope (for the hope ſprings from Gods Viſitation of him with his Light, and from the living Promiſe.)</p>
            <p>That which recovers man is the Eternal Vertue, the Endleſs Power, the Life Immortal, the Chriſt of God.</p>
            <p>Now what ever knowledge man gathers (whether from the Book of the Creatures, or from the Scriptures, or any other wayes) or what ever man profeſſes, or what ever man practiſes out of this, it is but a cover of his own, but a formed thing, but his own Image of Truth, of Knowledge, of Faith, of Love, of Obedience, of Worſhip; it is not <hi>the Living Truth the Living Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the Living Faith, the Living Love, the Living Obedience, the Living Worſhip:</hi> And ſo it is but mortal, but fleſhly; &amp; when it coms before the Eternal flames, it wil not abide them, but vaniſh. <hi>All fleſh is graſs:</hi> all the Knowledg, the Faith, the Love, the Worſhip, the Obedience, the Righteouſneſs, &amp;c. which man (who is ignorant of the leadings and power of the Life) can come at, is but Graſs: yea the flower of it, the ſeeming beauty and goodlineſs of it, the very choiceſt of it in any ſort of Profeſſors, is but <hi>as the flower of the field;</hi> it may make a fair ſhew there, but when the Lord cutteth it down with his fickle, and when his Sun riſeth upon it with its burning heat, it wil ſoon wither, and his fire wil ſoon devour it, ſo that its very place ſhal be found no more? What wil become of all the fruit that fleſh hath born, when God maketh bare, and cutteth down the root? what wil become of all Mortal Knowledg of the Scriptures, Mortal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Faith and Obedience which hath its root, growth and ſpreading in the mortal part when the Lord heweth at it with his immortal Axe? Do not deceive your ſelves; There is nothing wil ſtand but what is immortal, and that which is gathered into it, and ſo one with it: no Knowledg, no Faith, no Love, no Obedience, no Worſhip, no Hopes, but what ſpring from the Seed, are gathered into the Seed, and live in the Seed. This will abide, when all that ſprings from man and hath its place and reſidence in the mortal part (and not in the true Treaſury) wil come to an end, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint all who have fixed their hopes of the inheritance there:</p>
            <p>Propoſ. 4. <hi>That the living Seed of Eternal Life, which God hath hid in Man underneath his earth, hath in it the Living Vertue, which alone can heal Man and reſtore him to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which heals of the Death is the Tree of Life, whoſe Rind or Bark, whoſe Leavs, whoſe Bloſſoms, whoſe Fruit, whoſe Boughs and
<pb facs="tcp:64214:5"/>
branches, whoſe Bulk or Body, with the whole Sap thereof, is all healing, &amp; there is nothing elſe can heal. Let man catch all the knowledge that ever ſprang from the Life; If he could beleeve (I mean in the mans part) all that ever the Life ſpake, if it were ſo that he could perform all that ever the Life called for, yet this would not heal him at all: Whereas the leaſt vertue from the life, ſpringing up into, and livingly retained in the Lifes veſſel, truly refreſhes and heals. The Seed in all its ſpringings up, and ſhootings forth in the heart, lets out of its healing vertue. Let <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> proof, a Conviction, a Judgement, a Condemnation, which wounds that part which hath erred from the life, yet even in that there is a ſecret, hidden healing of ſomewhat elſe. <hi>The ſmitings of the righteous principle are as Balm, and its reproofs as an excellent Oyl. Thy Rod and thy Staffe comfort me. Light is ſown for the righteous, and Joy for the upright in heart;</hi> in all the tearings, ſmitings and rendings of the earthly part (with which the Seed alſo ſuffers) and the faith, in which theſe are received is the preſent ſubſtance of the healing, from the eternal vertue hoped for.</p>
            <p>Now, who will be wiſe? let him become a fool in the fleſh: Who will be ſtrong? Let him become weak in the mans part. Who will be ſaved by the Eternal Power? Let him ceaſe from the man in himſelf. Who ever would be able, in the Life, to do all things, let him ſink into that himſelf which is not, that it may bring to nought all things in him that are, that ſo it alone may be; and he, by it being brought to nothing, will eaſily become all in it. This is the true way of Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Redemption; firſt to be loſt, to be overcome, to be drowned, to be made nothing by that <hi>which is not,</hi> that that may come to <hi>BE</hi> in him, and he be quickned raiſed up and perfected in that, and ſo become poſſeſſour of the Fulneſs. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong;</hi> but he that daily loſeth his ſtrength, and his ability to know, or ſo much as to will or deſire (even till at length he become nothing at all) in him is the Corrupt at laſt deſtroyed, and the mortal ſwallowed up of the Life. He that feels the pure Seed ſpringing up; and by the growth of that is daily Begotten, Quickned, Raiſed, Juſtified, Sanctified, Circumciſed, Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, fed in one part, and ſtarved in another: When the work of Begetting, Quickning, Raiſing, Regenerating, Juſtifying, Sanctifying, Circumciſing, Baptiſing is finiſhed in him, and he is throughly begotten into the Life, quickned by the Life, raiſed in the Life, Regenerated, Juſtified, Sanctified, Circumciſed and Baptiſed through the Life; he ſhall have the Kingdome, wear the Crown, enter into the joy of his Lord, weild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scepter of Righteouſneſs with his Lord, in his Kingdome for ever. Now this work is to be done in the heart on this ſide the grave; for after death comes Judgement for the things done in the body; and the Tree is to be diſpoſed of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as it is found at its fall, either to the fire, or to grow and flouriſh in the Land of Life. Therefore be not ſloathful, but watch unto the movings of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Seed, that its work may be perfected, that it may arrive at its Stature, and come to its full growth and may finiſh its Service and Teſtimony, that ſo it may enter into its Habitation, and receive you with it into its Everlaſting Manſion, where every Servant, and conſtant Sufferer with the Seed, ſhall be welcomed of its Father, and remain partaker of their Joy and Fulneſs for Ever.</p>
