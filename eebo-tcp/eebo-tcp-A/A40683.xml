            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This <hi>Grace of Assurance</hi> is not attainable with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> ease and idlenesse. Christianity is a laborious Profession. Observe Gods servants cleane through the Scripture, resembled to men of painefull vocations: To <hi>Racers,</hi> who must stretch every sinew to get first to the Goale: to <hi>Wrestlers,</hi> a troublesome emploiment; so that I am unresolved whether to recount it amongst Toiles, or Exercises, (at the best it is but a toilesome Exercise.) To <hi>Souldiers,</hi> who are in constant <hi>Service</hi> and <hi>dayly Duty,</hi> alwaies on the <hi>Guard</hi> against their Enemies. Besides, we Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are compared to <hi>Shepherds,</hi> a painefull and dangerous profession amongst the Jewes; to

               </gap>hers: so that besides the difficulties of our Christian calling, we are incumbred with others, which attend our Ministeriall function. Let none therefore conceit, that Salvation with the Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces accompaning it (whereof this <hi>Assurance</hi> we treat of is a Principall) is to be compassed with facility, without constant care and endeavour to obtaine it. How easily was the man in the Gospell let downe to our Saviour in the house, whilst foure men for him uncovering the roofe thereof, let him downe with cords lying quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his couch? Some may suppose that with as little hardship they may bee lifted up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that whilest they lazily lye snorting on their beds of security, (never mortifying their lusts, never striving for grace, never strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against their corruptions) they shall bee drawne up to happinesse, or it let down to them, merely by the cords of Gods mercy, and Christs merits. Such men without amendment will one day finde themselves dangerously deceived, and that it is a laborious taske, to gaine either the surenesse, or assurance of salvation, wherein, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apostles prescription, <hi>wee must give diligence.</hi>
            </p>

How comfortable were it, if Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters were ascertained of true grace and pietie in the breasts and bosomes of the people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge. But the best way to passe a rationall verdict, on the sincerity of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity in another, is first to finde an experimentall Evidence thereof in ones own heart. A Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher complained, that it was an exceeding hard thing to finde a wise man; true, said an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, <hi>for he must bee a wise man that seekes him, and knowes when he hath found him;</hi> and hence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth the difficulty, because two wise men in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect must meet together, the <hi>Seeker,</hi> and the <hi>Finder.</hi> It is a hard thing in like manner to bee assured of unfained faith, and undissembled De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in another mans heart. Because first, that party must have a feeling of the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace in his owne soule (otherwise blinde men are incompetent Judges of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours) before he can make his presumptions of holinesse in another, from those sacred sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes and fruits of piety, which he findes in his owne Conscience. Let it therefore be eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans maine worke, first to make a scrutiny in his owne soule, to make his own <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Election</hi> sure.</p>
            <p>How contrary is this to the common practice <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/> of most in the world? It is a tale of the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Jew, but it is too much truth of too

            <p>For the second, this assurance of ones <hi>Calling</hi> and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/>

I say separable, to manifest my dissenting from such worthy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, who make this Assurance to bee the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Being, Essence, Life, Soule, and Formality of Faith itself.

First, that every one who hath true faith, and are eternally to bee saved, have alwaies some measure of this Assurance: Secondly, that such, who are devoid of this Assurance, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise deprived of all sincere faith for the present. But God forbid any Preacher should deliver Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines so destructive to Christian comfort on the one side, and advantagious to spirituall Pride on the other.

faint, but feeble infant-faiths to the pit of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire, exacting and extorting from them more than God requires, that every Faith should have assurance with it, or else be uneffectuall to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. No, the formality of Faith, consists in mans renouncing and disclaiming all sufficiencie in himselfe, casting, rolling, and relying his soule totally and entirely on the mercies of God, and merits of Christ, though not assured sometimes of the certainty of his salvation.

            <p>As for those reverend Divines who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/> and maintained the contrary, that Assurance is the very soule of faith, and faith dead and uselesse without it; far be it from me, because dissenting from thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31518:14"/>
can onely bee decided betwixt God, and a mans owne Conscience: no third Person can be privie to the secret transactions betwixt them. The last of these two Opinions (so farre as one may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture) hath most of charity, and not the least of truth in it. I am perswaded that many a pious soule dying in the fit of a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>mptation, hath instantly expected to sinke from his death-bed into hell-fire, when the same by Gods goodnesse hath beene countermanded a contrary way, and sent to blisse and happinesse; Yea, it is more then probable, that many sad and affli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ted spirits, have beene pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed of glory in heaven, before they durst ever owne that themselves had any true <hi>Grace</hi> on earth.</p>
            <p>The next question which comes to be resolved,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIII"/> is, whether this assurance once possessed, may not afterwards be forfeited. Here the controversie is not, whether once the childe of God, may relapse into the state of damnation, totally and finally lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all saving <hi>Grace</hi> in his heart, (which desperate Position cuts asunder the sinewes of all Gospel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort) but it is onely enquired into, whether the apprehension or <hi>Assurance of his calling</hi> may not in some cases be lost. Wherein our answer is affirmative, and this usually comes to passe on these two sad Occasions.</p>
            <p>First, when the Party commits some Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence-wasting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXIV"/> sinne, such as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tearmes, <hi>Peccatum devoratorium salutis;</hi> and continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31518:14"/>
have a good minde to destroy this <hi>Assurance;</hi> But it is seldome seene, that their strength is so great, (though they frequently fret and dayly nibble at the cordes of our Assurance) as to share or grind them asunder, a thing usually done by the committing of high and heinous offences. There is a whirlewinde in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> called a <hi>Herricane,</hi> which comes but seldome, and yet too often. For then Rasor-like it shaves downe all levell and flat before it, Trees, and Townes, and Towres, in a word, it is as wild and savage as the Natives of the Countrey. No lesse the impetuous violence and cruelty of a Conscience<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wasting-sinne: such as <hi>Lots</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ll, when they come, they make a depopulation of all <hi>Graces</hi> formerly planted in the soule; maiming the hand of Faith, breaking the Anchor of Hope, quenching the heate of Charity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> darkning the light of knowledge, and totally taking away for a time, the comfortable apprehension of Gods love to them, and their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to God. This made <hi>David</hi> petition to God, <hi>Restore to me the joy of thy salvation,</hi> Wherein three things are implied. First, that once he did possesse that joy, <hi>Restore it.</hi> Secondly, that now hee had lost it, <hi>Restore it;</hi> Lastly, that the losse thereof was not so desperate, but with hope by true sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to recover this joy. <hi>Restore to me the joy of thy Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second way to lose this Assurance, is by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXV"/> suffering some great affliction, above the standard and proportion of ordinary crosses; seemingly

Thus holy <hi>Job,</hi> when God discharged whole volleys of Chaine-shot of afflictions against him, <hi>one drew on another,</hi> we find him sometimes venting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, rankly savouring of despaire, and no wonder if hee began to stagger who had drunke so deepely of the bitter cuppes. And now conceiving our selves in some measure to haue satisfied the most important practicall queries wherewith this doctrine of Assurance is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, we come to make some profitable applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

that for the present they are possessed of this assurance. And is it so indeed? And doest thou not deceive thy selfe, beholding thy condition through a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It were no manners nor charity in mee to give thy beliefe the lie; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what you say of your selves, I give credite thereunto. Onely let me stay a little and congratulate your happy estate. <hi>Good successe have you with your honour.</hi> God hath not dealt thus with every one, neither have all his servants so large a proportion of his favour. And now I will take the boldnesse to commend some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell unto you. In the first place be thankefull to God f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Secondly, take heed of insulting over such as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXX"/> want this assurance: upbraid not them with their sad condition. Say not unto them, I am certaine of my <hi>Calling and Election, Ergo,</hi> I am a Saint, a chosen vessell, eternally to bee sav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>u lackest this certainty, therefore art a reprobate, a cast away, a fire-brand of Hell, eternally to bee damned. Is this the expression of thy gratitude to God, proudly to trample on his servants, and thy brethren? It is hard to say, whether that thy inference hath more of profanenesse, or false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in it. If a Favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>credit with the Emperour as my selfe, are so many Traitours.</hi>] Would not this be accounted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a vaine-glorious expression, but injurious, both to his soveraigne and fellow-subjects? How many thousands of them, would be willing, yea desirous to adventure their lives, in a lawfull cause for their Emperours honour, who not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing never had the favour, to bee personably known unto him, much lesse to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thirdly, walke humbly before God, and know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXI"/> that this Assurance hath a narrow throate, and may be choaked with a small sinne, if God leave thee to thy selfe. There be two kindes of poyson, the one hot, the other cold. Hot poyson makes speedy dispatch, it sends men post to their graves; Cold poyson is not so active and operative, it kills but at distance, and if in any reasonable time it meets with a seasonable Antidote, the malignity thereof may be prevented, yea perchance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Antidote, if falling upon a strong and stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy constitution, may be mastered by natures own Cordiall; not finally to destroy, but onely to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie and benumme.

            <p>Nor let any confidently presume on the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIII"/> of predestination, (which like the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians</hi> cannot be repealed) thereon to sinne with indempnity, because once and ever Gods servant, and no feare finally to fall from him.

            <p>We come now to these that sing, <hi>We shall be.</hi> It <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXIV"/> is (say they) not onely vaine but wicked to seeke to bett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wee should wrong God and our owne consciences to affirme that for the present this Assurance is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon us; but are not in despaire in due time from God's mercy to receive it. Some counsels I have to recommend unto them.</p>
            <p>First doe not envie and repine at their happines,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXV"/> to whom this favour is already confirmed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath lov'd and honour'd them so much, doe thou love and honour them the more, and doe desire and endeavour to bee added to their society.</p>
            <p>Secondly know to thy comfort that were it not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXXVI"/> more for God's glory, and thy good, this Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had long since been bestowed upon thee. And for severall reasons it is hitherto detained.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Perchance because as yet th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>u hast not fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently sued to God for it. Thy affections are gold weights, not zealously engaged in the desire thereof. Thou seemest indifferent and unconcern'd, whether thou receivest this As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance or no. Now God sets such an estimate and valuation on this Assurance, as a grand gift, and favour of the first magnitude, that he will have it sought, and searched, and sued,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31518:19"/>
and prayed; and pressed for, with holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, and restlesse importunity before hee will grant it. <hi>Hannah</hi> called her sonne, <note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 1, 20.</note>

            <p n="2">2. Perchance God as, yet with-holds this assurance from thee, with intent to render it more acceptable when it is bestowed.
