            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and it hath. ii. greate prerogatyues before any other mynistration, that is to say, by reason of the place and of the tyme: of the place, for it was instituted by god in paradise: of the tyme, for it was fyrste ordeyned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other mynystrations. And trouth it is, that prestes by custome haue had alway the ministration &amp; the solempnysyng therof, and none but they, as to the ceremonies, &amp; so it is right co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient that they haue stil: but yet it is expedient, that it be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by what authorite they haue it: and that it may with a cause be ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken fro them by the hyghe powers, as it may in dede. Also confyrmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is by the lawe of man, and was ordeined by the bishoppes of Rome and the clergie, throughe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of thappostles in the prymitiue churche, whiche by touchynge of
<pb facs="tcp:20348:9"/>
theyr handes, gaue the holy gooste in a vysyble sygne, but that gyfte went not to theyr successoures: how be it theyr successours haue ordey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that they shall lyke wyse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme them that be baptised, by tow chynge of theyr handes, and if they that do it be in grace, it maye doo good, and elles it wil do lytel good. Also auriculer confessyon is by the lawe of man, and it may sometime do good, and be occasyon to bringe in contrition. Neuer the lesse many of the clergye affyrme, and all the peple in maner beleue, that it is by the lawe of god. Also satisfactyon, if it be taken as a parte of penance, gyuen by iniunction of the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour, in suche maner as hath benne vsed in tyme past after confessions, is by the lawe of man: And if it be taken as good deedes of prayour,
<pb facs="tcp:20348:10"/>
fastynge, and almes deede, done of deuotion, then it is commanded to euery man by the lawe of god. but yet whiche way so euer it be taken, it neuer putteth away synne, but it maye throughe grace, and through the free gyfte of god, whether it be frely done, or by waye of iniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and penaunce, encrease his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and rewarde in heuen. Also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions and hallowynges, as they be commonlye vsed, be by the lawe of man: and if the minister be in state of grace, his benedyctyons and halowynges may do good: but if he be out of grace, then as of them selfe, they do rather hurt then good. And neuerthelesse many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thynke, that the euyll lyfe of the mynyster, hurteth not suche hallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wynges or benedyctions, noo more than it dothe hurte theyr consecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:20348:10"/>
and absolutions, or suche other mynystrations as they haue by the lawe of god. And surelye that is a ryghte great errour. Also bysshops haue power to examyne encumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, that be presented to benefyces, but that is in this realme onely by custome, and by the fauour and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feraunce of the king and his lawes, and not by the lawe of god. for it can not be proued by the lawe of god, that one prist hath that power ouer an other priste, ne none shoulde be made pristes, but such as were able to take a cure. Also all holydays, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte the seuenth daye, and also the precyse fastynge dayes, matyns, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uensonge, the ceremomies at masse, and other like, be by the law of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and so is the power of iurisdiction, that the clergye hathe vsed in tyme paste, as to kepe courtes and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilles,
<pb facs="tcp:20348:11"/>
to do corrections, and suche other: And yet many thynke, that suche thynges haue ben by the lawe of god. Trouthe it is, that many of the prayours that be sayde at masse, matyns, euensonge, and diriges be taken out of scripture, and be scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in dede: but to this intente that they shall be sayd in one place of the seruice, rather then in an other, or in this tyme of the yere, more than in this, or to this intente one time, and to this an other: they are but cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monyes, for they be ordeyned to be saide in that ordre by the onely lawe of man. And therfore it were righte expediente, that it were openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and knowen, what thynges be vsed by the law of god, and what by custome and by the lawe of man. And vndoubtedly there is no lawe of god, that commaundeth settynge

vp of ymages, but whether the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynge vp of them be prohybited by the lawe of god, that is to say by the xx.

daye haue it in moche more graty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent maner, than they had before. And vnder this maner beganne the auctoritie of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like general councilles in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che of god: and then to speke some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the power of the catholyke generall councils, that I haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of before, I thynke veryly, that the power of them standeth mooste principally to declare the trewe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholyke fayth, accordynge to the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and groundes of scripture: and to declare also, what is to be iuged to be agaynste scripture, and what not: and to expounde the doubtes therof: and also to determine, what bokes are to be obeide and taken as bookes of scripture, and what not. For all chrysten people muste agree in one faythe and in one god. Howe be it the correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them that wold

<pb facs="tcp:20348:18"/>

And also it is to be noted, that to declare the faithe, or to do any of the thynges, that I haue sayd before, do pertayn to the generall councille: is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste scripture, ne agaynste the power of kinges and princes. For they neuer had those powers, but to correcte offenders, and to appoynte thorder of correction, in what degre of offence so euer it be, without their assent, is against the power of kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and princis; Ro. xiii. where it <note place="margin">

the lawe of god: but correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they myght none do, ne his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes might nothing do therin: but only pray to almightye god for his amendement. Also yf the generall councille decreed, that the youngest sonne shuld enherite in this realm: or that all entayles made of landes, shulde be voide: Or that the clergie shuld haue a iurisdiction, and make proces of exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication againste euery man, that breke any of their decrees, all were in vayne: for it were agaynste the prerogatyue of kingis and princis in euery realme: and also against scripture, whereby kynges haue their power, as is said before. Wherfore the general coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill hath therin no auctoritie.

               <hi>IF A MAN</hi> wylle saye, and aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly stand in it, that the byshop of Rome is heed of the vniuersalle Churche of Christe: it is not onely vntrewe, but it is also heresye, and is directely agaynste scripture, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes. v. Where it is sayde: Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersę terrę rex imperat seruienti, that is, The kynge commaundeth the hole countrey as his subiect. Whervpon it foloweth, that the emperour, whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che is kynge in Italye, maye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde the byshoppe of Rome as his subiecte. And if the byshoppe of Rome shulde be heed of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall churche: then he shulde be heed ouer the Emperour. For he vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly is one of the church: and than
<pb facs="tcp:20348:21"/>
he might commaunde hym as a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to hym, and that is directly against the said texte ecclesiastes. v. and if the bysshoppe of Rome came in to the realme of any other kyng, he shulde for the tyme be subiecte to that kynge, and ought to be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente to his lawes and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes. And also it is sayd, Sa. vi. Here ye kynges and vnderstande: lerne ye that be iudges of all partes of the worde. And if kinges be Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of al partes of the worlde, what part of the world is left to the iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bishoppe of Rome? And if the bysshoppe of Rome were su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme heed of the vniuersall chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, then he might iudge vniuersal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in al realmes: and that were dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctely ageynst the sayde textes. It is heresie therfore, to saye that the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Rome is heed of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall
<pb facs="tcp:20348:22"/>
churche. Also to say, that the byshoppe of Rome and the clergie maye make lawes to bynde kinges and princis and their subiectes, is also against scripture, psal. 11. where it is saide, O kynges vnderstande ye, be ye lerned that iuge the world. For yf the bysshoppe of Rome and the clergie shoulde haue power to make lawes, to bynde kynges and their people: then myght not kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges iudge the world: for they might not iudge vppon tho lawes, ne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme tho lawes. For he that maye make a lawe, hath power to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete and to reforme the lawe, and none but he: and so shulde kynges be bounden by tho lawes: &amp; myght not of their owne power iudge the worlde, as the sayde texte, Psal. 11. say the they do. Also seyncte Paule, Ro. xui. sayth of euery prynce thus:
<pb facs="tcp:20348:22"/>
He is the reuenger in to wrathe to hym that dothe euylle. And sayncte Paule in the sayd wordes excepteth no maner of euylle. And if princes haue power to reuenge euery euyll. It is heresye to say, that the byshop of Rome may iudge or reuenge any maner of euyll, by his owne power. And neuertheles not withstandyng the sayde textes, and dyuers other, whiche proue sufficientely, that the high power of the worlde is in kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and princis, wherof I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited parte in the firste chapyter of this treatise: yet the bysshoppes of Rome haue in tyme past, as heedes of the vniuersall churche, taken v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, to summon and appoynt generall councils, as they haue cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, and to commande kinges and princis to obey that sommons, and to assiste theym therein. but yet
<pb facs="tcp:20348:23"/>
when kynges &amp; princes haue done soo: they, ne any other by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntemente, ne yet any lay manne shulde haue in the sayde councilles any voyces, but bysshoppes, prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes, and religious, and other of the clergie onely. For they haue preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that they make the vniuersall churche, and that such a churche as may not erre. And surely to say, that byshops and pristes, make the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall churche, is a great erroure: for the vniuersall church is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of all faithefull people, and not onely of the bysshops and priestes. And of that churche saint Paule speke, Ephes. v. whanne he sayde, that for his churche Christe gaue hym selfe: and no man wylle say, that Christ gaue hym selfe only for the clergie.

And nowe lette euery manne in his owne conscience iuge, whether it be an indifferent waye of Justice, that the byshoppe of Rome and the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie shulde be in these mattiers iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to redresse the sayde abusions, heresyes, and vntrewe doctrynes, brought in by them selfe, &amp; by their predecessoures, and whyther they wolde be dilygente to abbate their accustomed vsurped honor, power, riches, libertie, and suche other, as in this worlde be thinges ryght de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable and plesant, specially if the councill be kepte, where they haue worldly power: I doubte not, but that there be som of the clergie, that wolde put therto right greatte dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: but to fynde many of them, I thinke it wold be very hard. And yet the byshop of Rome hath nowe of late summoned a councyll to be
<pb facs="tcp:20348:25"/>
holden after the old fashion: And it he shuld shew him self out wardly to do it for a reformation, &amp; in wardly intende to maynteyne forthe the old abusyons, it shoulde be in hym to great a faute &amp; enormitie to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred. And therfore it is to think, that he knowith many of the clergy, that wyll helpe forthe his good purpose therin. Howe be it thoughe his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent be neuer soo good in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet if ignorance do not excuse, I thinke verily, that he, and all that haue moued hym to su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon it, haue fallen therby into a ryght great he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, for the causes before rehersed. And it wyll be very harde to proue, that ignoraunce of the lawe of god shulde excuse any manne, specially them that are moste bounde to haue knowledge of it. wherfore I wyll say thus farre, concerninge the said

               <hi>THERE</hi> was no auctoritie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by Christe to oone apostle aboue an other, though peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture some reasons myghte be made to proue, that Peter oughte to haue some certayne preemynence before the other apostelles: but I entende not at this tyme, to speake of that preemynence. For what soo euer it were, it can not be proued by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, ne by any other sufficient au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorite, wherby any man shulde be
<pb facs="tcp:20348:26"/>
bounden to beleue it, who was his successoure, ne whoo is nowe his successour: so that none may claime any preemynence by hym ouer any other. Ne it is not redde in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that whan the power of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall councils in the begynnynge of the churche stode in the appostelles and seniours, as I haue said before, that any of the apostels commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an other to come to any council. Wherfore it is very lyke, whan any doute rose, that nedid to haue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill, that the apostels, and seniours, and other of the churche, whose pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence was necessary, of their chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie came to it, without any comman<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dement: but haply by a charitable and a louynge monition and desyre of one to an nother: ne there is not any mention made in scripture, that there was any excommunication or
<pb facs="tcp:20348:27"/>
interdiction made againste theym that came not: for all the mencion that is made, Act. xv. for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge of the council at Hierusalem, whan the question rose, whether cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuncisy on shulde be necessary in the newe lawe, is, that the Apostelles, and seniours gathered them selfe to gether, to here the matter. And in the latter ende of the same chapiter it appereth, that the apostles and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niours, by assente of the hole chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che, wrote a letter to the brethern of the gentylles conuerted at Antioch, Sirie, and Cilyce, in whiche coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys the said question fyrst sprang. And amonge other thynges, they wrote thus vnto them: For as moch as we haue harde, that some of vs haue come to you, and troubled you with wordes tournynge your myn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, to whom we gaue no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

so to do: It hath pleased vs, gathered to gether in one, to chose then, and to sende to you with oure mooste dere beloued Barnabe and Paule, which shal shewe you, what we thynke. &amp;c. And it appereth not, that any commaundement was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for that gatherynge to gether: but that charitie was the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement therin to euery man, &amp; none other but that. Also <hi>Act. xxi.</hi> when the iewes murmured against saynte Paule, by cause that as they sayde, he taughte the Iewes in the begynnynge of the churche, that they shuld not circumcise their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: The bretherne at Hierusalem said vnto hym, that vopin that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it behoued to gather the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and so it was. But it appereth not, that any commandement was gyuen for the gatherynge. And I
<pb facs="tcp:20348:28"/>
haue not harde of any other scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that warranteth any suche co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement. And yet syth the fey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned power of Rome beganne, it is pretended, that suche thynges as at to be doone in the Churche of God, muste be done by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the by shoppe of Rome: and that he muste commaunde all men, as well kynges and pryncis, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, none excepte, spiritual ne tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and that they muste obey his commaundement, and that vppon no lesse peyne then of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or interdiction. And that it is he also, that is sette to iudge al men, and that vpon his welth vnder god, the helthe of all the people dothe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pende, as it is sayd <hi>Distinc. xl.

And I thinke therfore, that if it shuld happen hereafter, any infy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels to be conuerted to the feithe of Christe, that they shuld be meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously astonied, whan they heryng of Christis mekenes, shulde see su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che pride in his mynysters, whyche neuertheles pretend the highest per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fection in Christis Churche.

Sunt quidam: the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe of Rome sayth amonge dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other thynges, that suche thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges as the Euangelistes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetes speke not of, he maye make newe lawes: and he neyther excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth lyfe, londes, nor goodes, and that pretence is so vntrewe, that I thynke verelye, there is not one of the clergy at this day, that wyl pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende,
<pb facs="tcp:20348:33"/>
that the clergye maye make lawes of suche thynges: thoughe peraduenture somme wolde thinke, that they maye make lawes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che thynges, as they calle spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alle. But the truthe is, that they maye not make anye lawes of the one ne of the other. And yf they did, they shoulde doo directely againste dyuers textes of scrypture, whiche gyue power in that behalfe to kyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and princis, whereof parte be recited before. And ouer that, yf all the lawes made by bysshoppes of Rome, and other bishoppes and the clergie in tyme paste, were through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serched, there wolde appere, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syde the lawes before remembred, ryght many decrees and canons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste scripture, and againste the power of kynges and princis: and that also gyue more occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to pride
<pb facs="tcp:20348:34"/>
than to mekenesse, and that be like wyse righte harde and greuous, as welle to many of the clergye, as to the hole multitude of the people.</p>
            <p>And yet it is to be doubted, that yf these matters, and other lyke, shuld be commytted to the bysshoppe of Rome, and to the clergie, to be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in suche councils as haue bene vsed in tyme paste, and wherin bys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and pristes haue only had the voices, that right small refourma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shuld folowe thervpon. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kinges and princis now in this daungerous tyme are bounden in conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to loke the more diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vppon suche matters.</p>
            <p>¶ And this treatyse intendeth not, that all ministrations and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whiche haue ben vsed in tyme paste by custome and by the lawe of man, shulde be auoyded and clerely
<pb facs="tcp:20348:34"/>
set asyde, ne yet that defaute shulde be found in the bishop of Rome and in the clergie, and to reste there and go no ferther, but rather that suche abusyons &amp; superstitions, as haue risen by occasion of some of the said ministrations and ceremonies, &amp; of the bishops of Rome &amp; the clergye, shuld be reformed, &amp; brought to the true trade of Christes doctrine. And that it shuld also be openly shewed and declared to the worlde, by what auctorytie the mynystrations and ceremonies nowe vsed amonge the people, and also the power of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Rome and of the clergy fyrst began. For if true and playne declaration were made in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, it wolde vndoutedly appere, that the bysshops of Rome and the clergy, haue vnder the colour of the law of god, claymed many mo thin
<pb facs="tcp:20348:35"/>
ges, thenne it gyueth vnto theym: and whiche hathe venne in theym a right greatte offence, and hath ben also one of the greattest occasyons, wherby the charitie, peace, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes amonge the people haue ben broken, and the puritie of Christes doctrine, in maner broughte into a hole ceremoniall fashion of lyuing, after the deuyce and doctrine of the clergie. And if suche thynges were reformed, it is very like, that trouth whiche is God hym selfe, and his trewe doctrines wolde shortly after appiere in the worlde, and boldelye shewe theyr faces throughe all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten realmes.</p>
