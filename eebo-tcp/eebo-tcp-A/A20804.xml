            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE LEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NED AND RELIGIOVS Lord, WILLIAM Lord PAGET, grace, peace; and all happines both temporall <hi>and eternall.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit (most noble Sir) the doctrine of the restitution of this whole vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse, and the renouation of the principall creatures therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, may be thought to bee cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, intricate, doubtfull, and to minister oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of scorne, or errour to the ignorant and those that are carnally minded; and albeit the doctrine of the glorious resurrection of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints in the same matter and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, be doubted of, by the curious; denied by infidells; and impugned by diuers Heretikes and Atheists, yet both these doctrines and assertions, whereof the latter is an Article and maine foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Faith, are plainely proued by plentifull and pregnant testimonies of Scripture, euinced by euidence of Arguments, and subscribed vnto by consent of the best Diuines both ancient and moderne. That there shall be, at the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:10434:3"/>
of our Lord Iesus (which shall not bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Rome be ruinated, and the dispersed Iewes generally conuerted to Christianitie) a glorious restorement and reformation of the world: Of these visible heauens, with their lights, eyes, starres: and of the earth, and (in all probability) of all such, plants, trees, beasts, birds, hearbs, which were created by God in the sixe dayes, and which shall be found remaining at the day of the Lord, it is sufficiently proued in this present Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Yet that I may giue your Lordship some tast and touch, these places and arguments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly following, are forcible, and duly to bee considered. First, there shall be a <hi>newe</hi> (outward) heauen, and a <hi>newe earth,</hi> (new I say for qualitie <note place="margin">Isay 65. 17. 2. Pet. 3. 13.</note> but not for substance) <hi>wherin dwelleth righteousnes,</hi> (that is) righteous men, yet by entercourse, and not by any continuall residence. Secondly Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, wee know, that euery creature groaneth after this glorious libertie, <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note> therefore the Apostle taketh this restitution as a thing granted. Thirdly, the creatures shall bee <hi>changed,</hi> namely into a better forme, <hi>ergo</hi> they shall not bee eternally abolished. Fourthly, the inward supernaturall and constant desire of the creatures, to be fully and finally freed from vanity and the bondage of manifold abuses, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (in their maner and proportion) to be restored into the glorious libertie of Gods children, doth euince as much. Fifthly, <hi>sinne,</hi> the corrupting cause of the creatures, shall at the last iudgement wholy cease, therefore the corruption and abuse
<pb facs="tcp:10434:3"/>
of the creature; shall then likewise cease. Sixthly, God who is the God of order, and not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of confusion, will at length, rectifie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme whatsoeuer hath bin and is, disordered and deformed. Seuenthly, Christ our mighty Sauiour, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> and the Lord from heauen heauenly must &amp; shal cure euery wound, that the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and that sinne and Sathan haue inflicted. Eightly, the Apostle proueth the certaintie of eternall life, by the secret desire of the creature after this time; wherein it shall bee gloriously renewed. Ninthly, Gods elect must, and shal wholy recouer the dominion ouer other creatures, which by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, they haue (in great part) lost, and then <hi>the mecke</hi> shall (in their maner) <hi>inherit the Earth,</hi> and none but they, but now for <note place="margin">Matth. 5. ver. 5.</note> the most part, Tyrants, and Gods enemies vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pingly possesse it. Lastly, (to omit the generall consent of later and most worthy Writers) Saint <hi>Theodoret, Ambrose, Oecumenius</hi> &amp;c. hold and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this particular restitution. Neither must it be thought that the Creatures renewed shall engender, or multiplie; for as there is, and shall be no engendring, nor multiplication of the <note place="margin">A Parable.</note> Saints in heauen (notwithstanding the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of male and female shall remaine;) so shall there be no multiplication, much lesse in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, of plants, beasts, birds, in the renewed earth. Touching the vse and end of the creatures, they shall serue to set forth Gods <hi>power, wisedome, mercy, goodnes,</hi> and shall serue for the Saints <hi>delight</hi> &amp; <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,</hi> and not otherwise. And as for al other
<pb facs="tcp:10434:4"/>
cauils and obiections of any moment. I suppose I haue sufficiently answered them in the booke.</p>
            <p>Now that the bodies of Gods children (though for the present vile, mortall, deformed, miserable &amp;c, shall at the last day arise againe in power, glorie, incorruption, and that in the same substance with all their parts and dimensions, in few words I thus demonstrate. First, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old and new Testament do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly declare it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, sundry types and figures of the old law, and the rising of diuers Saints, both in the old and also the new Testament, (at least) to a temporall life, are good inducements hereunto. Thirdly, the Saints bodies, being the Temples of the holy Ghost, and being redeemed by Christ, as well as their soules, must of necessitie bee glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, as well as their soules. Fourthly, the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is grounded vpon Gods almightines, and <note place="margin">Matth. 22. 20.</note> vpon his infallible promises. Fifthly, Christ our head, to whom we must be made conformable, arose againe in the same bodie and substance that <note place="margin">Phil. 3. 20.</note> hee died in; therefore our bodies shall in like sort, arise againe. Lastly (not to exceed the skantling of an Epistle) the bodies of the Saints must come to iudgement, as well as their soules; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must needes rise againe. Concerning the sundry and sweete comforts that the holy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the Resurrection affordeth vs. I haue distinctly laid them forth in the Treatise. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the matter being so vsefull, so desirously heard in the greatest auditorie, and worthy of an
<pb facs="tcp:10434:4"/>
honourable and iudicious Patron, I haue vpon iust causes, and due deliberation presumed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title it to your Honour, and to commend it to your patronage: For first, to whom should the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it, of better right appertaine then to a <hi>noble Caedar</hi> in Gods Church: A <hi>Mecenas</hi> of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, a <hi>Sheild</hi> of Iustice, a sincere <hi>Israelite,</hi> and to one that in <hi>Stafford-shire</hi> shineth, as the <hi>Sunne</hi> amongst the lesser <hi>Starres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, your Lordship is knowne to be very learned, and studious &amp; a diligent hearer of your painefull and godly preaching Minister Master <hi>Macham:</hi> Lastly, it hath pleased the right Reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend father in God, and my singular good Lord, the Bishop of Couentry and Lichfieild, in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue compassion towards mee, to procure for mee, and seate mee in the vicaredge of <hi>Coll-wich,</hi> a fewe miles distant from your Honours dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling house, and therefore I would be glad to haue so noble a protector neere mee. And thus, most humbly requesting your Lordships fauour, and gratious acceptation of these my meditations, I betake your blessed Lordship, together with your most vertuous, and zealously religious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, vnto the continuall tuition, and heauenly gouernment of the Almightie.</p>

               <q>23 And not onely they, but our selues also, which haue the first fruits of the Spirit (euen wee our selues) groane within our selues, waiting for the adoption (to wit) the redemption of our bodies.</q>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Epistle of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romanes, wherein is enclosed the <hi>Quintessence</hi> and perfection of sauing <hi>Doctrine,</hi> may not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be compared to the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> of God, the place of all pleasure and happinesse: the 8. Chapter, which like <hi>a conduit pipe</hi> conueyeth vnto the Church, the waters of life, may be likened to the <hi>tree of life, (i. the Sacrament and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it,) in the middest of the Garden,</hi> and this my text in regard of the spirituall nourishment and <hi>Soules</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10434:6"/>
that it ministreth (as it <hi>were)</hi> a goodly branch of this blessed tree, whose fruit serueth for food, and whose <hi>(very)</hi> leaues, for shade and medicine.</p>
            <p>And this Parcell of Scripture, is so ample and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that like the riuer of <hi>Eden, that watered the Garden,</hi> it doth diuide it selfe into foure heads, or parts.</p>
            <p>For first the Apostle in the beginning of the Chapter, vnto the first verse, absolueth his large and long dispute of our <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Iustification</hi> by Christ and Faith in him onely.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the first verse vnto the eighteenth, he by powerfull and perswasiue arguments exhorteth the Romanes to holinesse and newnes of life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, from the 18. vnto the 31. verse, hee by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie, sound and substantiall reasons, doth arme, comfort, and confirme them against the manifold miseries, and troubles of this <hi>life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, from the 31. verse vnto the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he concludeth his doctrine, partly by a braue chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge of all aduersary <hi>power,</hi> and partly by way of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and exclamation.</p>
            <p>Touching the coherence and dependance of my <hi>Text,</hi> with the verses immediately going before, we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand that the <hi>Apostle</hi> in the eighteenth verse of this Chapter, affirmeth that the <hi>excellency of eternall</hi> glory, doth (whether wee respect quantity, quality, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance) farre exceed and surmount the <hi>afflictions of this present life.</hi> In the three verses next ensuing, hee proueth the certeinty of the same <hi>Glorie,</hi> by the secret instinct and earnest desire of the (reasonable and brutish) <hi>Creature;</hi> yea of the whole <hi>Vniuerse:</hi> which like a spye out of a watch tower, or like to a Captiue, that doth <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, (i) put it head out of a grate, and carefully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the comming of the deliuerer, doth desire and waite for the <hi>manifestation</hi> of <hi>Gods children,</hi> when it shal be freed from the bondage of corruption and abuse, and be restored into it former purity and perfection, (and in

it proportion and degree) be made partaker of their glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: and in the two and twentieth verse, hee repeateth, and further explaneth the Creatures desire and waiting for it restitution; and in the three and twentieth verse, he enforceth the certainty of <hi>immortality,</hi> by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward groning, and serious expectation of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for their <hi>redemption and saluation:</hi> and the scope and drift of the Apostle in this place is, by the ioynt and mutuall groning and expectation both of the creature, and also of Gods children, to demonstrate the assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the <hi>glory</hi> to be reuealed.</p>
            <p>Touching the order and Method of the <hi>Apostle in my Text,</hi> we haue a double description, first of the <hi>Creature,</hi> secondly of Gods children. <hi>In the Creature</hi> to be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, three things are to be noted, first, the generality of it, <hi>Euery Creature,</hi> secondly, the earnest and carefull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and waiting of it, <hi>groaneth and trauelleth in paine together,</hi> lastly, the extent, or continuance of this groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and trauelling, <hi>vntill now.</hi> In Gods <hi>Elect,</hi> who are in the three and twentieth verse described, three points are like wise to be obserued. First their spirituall and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing graces, wherby they know themselues to be Gods children, and wherby they are distinguished from <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> from <hi>hypocrites, heretickes,</hi> and all prophane and vntegenerate persons: in these words, <hi>which haue the first fruits of the spirit.</hi> Secondly their deepe desire, and hopefull expectation, arising from the aboue named graces in these termes, <hi>groaning within our selues and waiting for, &amp;c.</hi> Lastly, the obiect and end of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and hope, epitomized in this worde <hi>Adoption,</hi> which the Apostle by interpretation, calleth <hi>the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body,</hi> to wit, the finall and full deliuerance of it, from mortality, death, and all the miseries of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary life, and thus much our blessed Sauiour intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth when and were he saith, <hi>when yee see these things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to come to passe, then looke vp and lift vp your heads, for</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Luke 21 28. Ephes. 1.</note> 
               <hi>your redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Now it remaineth that I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10434:7"/>
lay downe, and prooue, and apply the speciall doctrines lessons and obseruations, that this Scripture naturally yeeldeth and presenteth to our considerations. But that I may worke vpon a sure foundation, and build vpon a sure ground, and proceede orderly, I am first, (so farre forth as I conceiue it either manifestly reuealed in Gods word, or (at least) in some particulars very probably to be gathered out of it) to remoue all rubs out of the way, and to determine what this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, euery <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is; whether that it is generally, or specially to bee vnderstood; and what, or which this <hi>creature is,</hi> (or <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> are): and in the handling heereof, I will deale and proceede, first negatiuely, shewing what creatures shall <note place="margin">Incipiendum a facilioribus.</note> not bee restored, and deliuered, and then <hi>Positiuely and affirmatiuely:</hi> by resoluing what creatures shal vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly be deliuered and restored, and what also in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the iudgement of probability onely, shall bee repaired and renewed.</p>
            <p>Therefore from the number of the creatures that doe groane <hi>and trauell in paine together,</hi> after, and for their deliuerance and restorement, are to bee abstracted and deducted these <hi>Creatures,</hi> whose speciall kinds follow.</p>
            <p>First, the blessed and sinlesse Angels: for they are not capable of, much lesse, subiect to such bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and abuse, but doe alwaies <hi>behold the face of God the Father which is in Heauen.</hi> Indeed, they so long <note place="margin">Matth. 18. 10.</note> as they attend vpon, &amp; minister vnto the Saints in earth, haue not that perfection of glory and ioy, which they shall haue, when they shall be discharged of this Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, and shall be in rest and contemplation, but yet they are not made subiect to vanity, nor in any bondage of corruption: and what if they, as <hi>they reioyce of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of a sinner,</hi> so they (in a sort) mourne for, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <note place="margin">Luk. 15. 10.</note> vnder so great peruersenesse and frowardnesse of Gods children, whereof they are beholders; may bee said to <hi>groane and trauaile in paine:</hi> yet this <hi>groaning and trauelling,</hi> is not in regard of their <hi>essence and nature,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Beza. 2.</note>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10434:7"/>
which admitteth no blemish or abuse, but onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their <hi>office and Ministerie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Diuels;</hi> and all euill <hi>spirits,</hi> whom God hath reserued in euerlasting <hi>Chaines vnder darkenesse,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iud. Epist. v. 6.</note> vnto the iudgement of the great day, and that haue no possibilitie of anie better condition, are in no wise to be rancked in this number: they daily expect a time of torment, but not of triumph; and they doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dole <note place="margin">Matth. 8. 29.</note> with Gods children but continually seeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> or so manie as God hath in his eternall counsell reiected, cannot liere be imploied: for none of the reprobate persons groane or <hi>sympathise</hi> with Gods children; and to none of these belongeth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, but to all of them, is damnation; decreed, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, prepared.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, from this number, are distinguished and deducted the verie <hi>Elect</hi> of mankinde: for first, this word <hi>Creature,</hi> in the Scriptures doth not signifie man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde vnlesse some other word, or words be added to it. Secondly, the <hi>Elect</hi> onely haue the denomination of the <hi>Sonnes</hi> of God, and so hath not the creature; Thirdly, in my <hi>Text,</hi> the <hi>Elect</hi> of God are discerned and seuered from the <hi>Creature,</hi> by the discretiue coniunction <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>but,</hi> and by the graces of saluation which the Apostle calleth <hi>the first fruites of the Spirit,</hi> and Lastly, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation <note place="margin">vers. 23.</note> of the <hi>Resurrection and redemption of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</hi> Now these graces and this hoped for <hi>resurrection</hi> are proper to the <hi>Elect</hi> onely, and doth not at all appertaine to the <hi>Creature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>hornes and thistles,</hi> briars &amp; brambles, weedes and nettles, &amp;c: are none of the Creatures that are by S. <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Paulmeant, or,</hi> intended: for, instantly vpon mans trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression and fall, the earth being cursed for his sinne, brought foorth all these euill things.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, all creatures that haue their being from an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiuocall, mixt and <hi>confused</hi> generation, and not from
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10434:8"/>
the proper male and <hi>female,</hi> and therefore are, in kinde and name diuers and different, as <hi>Mules, Wolfe-dogs, Wolfe-birches,</hi> and all monstrous <hi>creatures</hi> come not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the number of the <hi>Creatures,</hi> to which deliuerance and renouation is promised.</p>
            <p>Seuenthly, all <hi>Creatures</hi> that haue their beginning from, and are bred of corruption and putrefaction, as frogs, flies, wormes, mouldes, mise, crickets, bats, barna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, haue no part in this restitution.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and all seas, for there shall bee <hi>no more sea,</hi> and consequently no <hi>sea-fish:</hi> take away the subiect, take away the <hi>adiunct:</hi> and take away the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 1. Sublato vel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gato subiecto proprio, tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntur vel ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur adiuncta.</note> 
               <hi>element,</hi> and then take away the <hi>creature</hi> that liueth in it.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, all those (or such) plants, beasts, foules, that either are alreadie dead and dissolued, or, that after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and at Christ his second comming shall bee found deed and without life, are to bee deducted out of this number.</p>
            <p>Lastly, amongst other things, all <hi>houses, buildings, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, townes, villages, monuments, inuentions and deuises</hi> of man shall be vtterly dissolued, <hi>for the earth and the works</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 10. Metaph. C. 3. magis dicimus illum scire rem, quiscit eam af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiuè quam qui negatiuè.</note> 
               <hi>therein</hi> (whereof these are parts) <hi>shall be vtterly burnt with fire.</hi> Now because <hi>affirmatiue</hi> knowledge, whereby a thing is knowne <hi>positiuely,</hi> is farre better, then <hi>negatiue</hi> knowledge, whereby a thing is knowne <hi>priuatiuely, and confusedly,</hi> let vs, with warrant of Scripture, and waight of reason (according to our skantling,) see and set downe what is the <hi>Creature</hi> that <hi>groaneth</hi> and <hi>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth in paine together vnto this day,</hi> and shall at length be restored.</p>
            <p>First, whether we render these words, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>whole Creature,</hi> and so take it <hi>collectiuely,</hi> for a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, or a continued quantitie, in which sense the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is not seldome vsed, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>&amp;c. and Marke</hi> 2. 13. or according to the current of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all consent of most <hi>interpreters,</hi> auncient and moderne,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10434:8"/>
take it for <hi>euery particular,</hi> or, the general of euery parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: then it must needes be graunted, that the whole <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerse</hi> shall continue: the foure <hi>elements</hi> shall be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, renewed, made more subtile and be (in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood) eternally preserued in this happie estate.</p>
            <p>It is most manifest and apparent out of Scripture, that <note place="margin">Isaiae. 66. 22. 2. Pet. 3. 10. Apoc. 21. 1.</note> there <hi>shall be a new heauen: i.</hi> a new or renewed, starrie, ayrie, visible and externall <hi>heauen,</hi> (for this heauen onely and not the third heauen is subiected to the bondage of corruption) <hi>and a new earth,</hi> and certaine it is, that these haue from the beginning to our time continued <hi>groaning and trauailing in paine for their deliuerance.</hi> Or let vs take <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, either <hi>collectiuely,</hi> for the whole frame of the world, <hi>or, distributiuely</hi> for euery kinde, manie kindes, or (at least) some kindes of <hi>creatures,</hi> then the <hi>Sunne, Moone</hi> and <hi>Starres, those eyes, lights,</hi> and <hi>lampe</hi> of <hi>heauen,</hi> are to be restored to a better state <hi>and condition,</hi> and that vpon these grounds following. First, we vnder <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, comprehending the maine parts and principall creatures, then the <hi>Sunne, Moone, starres</hi> with their <hi>Orbes,</hi> must necessarily be heerein included and vnderstood. For they haue neuer since their first cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ceased to be, and haue from mans fall, continued in groaning, and painefull trauaile, and so shall continue vnto the consummation of the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> (&amp; by the same reason, the starres) shall at the last day receiue a manifold addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of brightnesse and glorie; for the <hi>Sunne shall be sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen times more glorious</hi> (then it is now) and <hi>the Moone</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Isaiae. 30. 26.</note> 
               <hi>shall be as glorious as the Sunne;</hi> which place of Scripture, as it hath his <hi>allegoricall</hi> interpretation, in regard of the <hi>(begun)</hi> reformation of the Christian Church, so it shall be literally fulfilled, when the Church and other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures shall be perfited: as might bee instanced and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced by manie <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the like nature and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the perpetuitie of Christ his <hi>(spirituall)</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10434:9"/>
is shadowed and set foorth by the continuance of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone: his throne shall be as the Sunne,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psal. 89. vers. 36. 37. Psal. 72. vers. 5. verse 7. verse. 17.</note> and (it) shall be established for euermore as the <hi>Moone,</hi> Gods children shall feare him so long as the <hi>Sunne and Moone endureth: and Christ his name</hi> shall endure so long <hi>as the Sunne Ergo,</hi> these creatures shall be restored, and so continue without decay, or corruption. But if the Sunne, Moone and starres shall be glorified, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, then it may be demaunded to what vse they shall <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> serue? I answere, that they shall cease from all motion, (for they shall haue a perfect <hi>rest or iubily,)</hi> and they shall not serue for signes <hi>seasons</hi> and for <hi>daies</hi> and <hi>yeeres,</hi> nor <note place="margin">Gen. 1. vers. 14.</note> to distinguish <hi>times, (for there shall be no more time,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>night nor darkenesse, Summer nor Winter,</hi> nor shall they bee anie more vsed as instruments to impart and communicate light to the world: for God by his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. ver. 23.</note> presence <hi>shall enlighten the new heauen and the new earth,</hi> and the Saints very bodies shall be as light as the Sunne, not needing anie <hi>Sunne, Moone</hi> or starre-light. There shall be no neede of, or, such vse of anie creature, when we shall enioy the creator himselfe. But they shall remaine as most glorious and lightsome <hi>bodies,</hi> and as so manie <hi>monuments</hi> of Gods eternall power, wisedome and goodnesse, the beholding and contemplation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, shall not onely affect and wonderfully delight the Saints, but also occasionably stirre and prouoke them to extoll and magnifie the creator.</p>
            <p>Touching the continuance and reparation of such <hi>plants, beasts, foules,</hi> as shall haue a life and being, at the glorious appearing of our Lord, it seemeth verie proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (if not demonstrable,) by these testimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and arguments ensuing. <note place="margin">Vbi multa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currunt verisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia, facile est credendum: Aristot. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 31.</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, this particle (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is commonly and vsually (in the new Testament specially) taken for a discontinued quantitie, and for specials and particulars, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample sake Christ healed <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. that is, <hi>euerie sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and euery disease amongst the people: euery sinne and</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:10434:9"/>
               <hi>blasphemie shall be forgiuen vnto men: Godwill haue all,</hi> that is, (some of euerie kinde, calling, condition) <note place="margin">1. Tim. 2. 4.</note> 
               <hi>men to be</hi> saued <hi>and to come to the knowledge of the truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and God is not willing that anie should perish, but all should come to repentance,</hi> and why may it not bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in this my <hi>text?</hi> especially seeing amongst the <note place="margin">2.

            <p>Secondly, Gods children that do, &amp; haue in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life recouered by regeneration, the <hi>title</hi> &amp; interest in, &amp; to all the <hi>creatures:</hi> the light wherof they wholy lost by <hi>Adams</hi> fal, and the dominion in great part (they must semblably at the last day recouer and obtaine <hi>the full Lordship and dominion ouer them:</hi> then <hi>they shall accord</hi>

               <hi>together</hi> (as they did at their first creation) and bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto man: if <hi>Adam</hi> being Lord (vnder God) of the earthly <hi>Paradise,</hi> had (for the time) the rule and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of them, how much more shall <hi>men</hi> the <hi>heire</hi> of the heauenly <hi>Paradise</hi> and of the new heauen, and the new <hi>earth, wherein dwelleth righteousnesse</hi> (that is, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Bucan.</note> and iust men) haue the eternall dominion ouer them? at such times, and in such manner, as God shall appoint: especially, seeing that we in Christ, not onely recouer that we lost in <hi>Adam</hi> (I meane so much as shall make for our eternall happinesse) but are <hi>gainers, and improue our estate many waies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly the <hi>Saints</hi> shall (at the day of the Lord) <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> the earth, wherein most of them, for the present, <note place="margin">Matth. 5. 5.</note> haue no free hold, nor actuall possession, yea, <hi>they shall raigne on the earth,</hi> to wit by enter course and in manner <note place="margin">Apoc. 5. 10.</note> that God shall see good, yet their ordinarie place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidence <note place="margin">Apoc. 14. 4.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, shall these outward and visible heauens, and their <hi>transparent lights &amp; ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mes, the Sun, Moone, starres, &amp;c.</hi> be renewed and shall the renewed earth be wholy dispossessed and depriued of their necessarie and conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ornaments and furniture? Is there not reason (or at least) great probabilitie as well for this, as for that? But <hi>plants, birds, beasts, &amp;c.</hi> shall serue no longer for <note place="margin">Obiection.</note> mans necessitie, or to helpe his infirmitie, for there shall be no vse of them, for labour, lodging, building, meate, drinke, apparell, phisicke, <hi>Ergo</hi> these ends and vses cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the creatures must, and shall likewise cease. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: <note place="margin">Answer.</note> The argument followeth not: for though their naturall, ends, and vses which serued for mans infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie shall cease: yet their spirituall and principall ends, to witt, the setting forth of Gods glorie: the matter of mans delight, and the exercise of his meditation and thankfulnesse, may and shall continue and abide. These ends are the perfection of the creatures in which they shall rest. The soundnesse of this my answere may more plainely appeare by these particulars following: <hi>The brasen Serpent</hi> that <hi>Moses,</hi> by Gods commandement set vp in the wildernesse (if we respect the supernaturall <note place="margin">Num. 21. 9.</note> next and speciall end of it) was to be a signe of cure vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> that as manie of them <hi>as</hi> were <hi>stung</hi> by <hi>fiery Serpents,</hi> might looke vpon the <hi>brasen serpent and liue</hi> and withall <hi>to be a figure of Christ,</hi> by <hi>whom alone we</hi>

               <hi>are cured and healed</hi> of the <hi>deadly sting</hi> and <hi>poison of sinne and condemnation,</hi> and though it was no signe of cure nor figure of Christ, anie longer (for ought we reade) then the Iewes were in the wildernesse, yet it remained as a <hi>Monument</hi> of Gods mercifull goodnesse, vntill <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiah</hi> his time, who, when it was peruerted to I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, did in (an heroicke zeale) breake it into <note place="margin">2.

Christ our head at, and after his resurrection retained, and now being (in <hi>heauen)</hi> glorified, hath, and retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, all the parts and dimentions of a true <hi>humane body,</hi>

                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> it must be like to the first, and therefore good and perfit.

                  <head>The fourth member.</head>
                  <p>Touching the properties and qualities of a glorified <note place="margin">Obserue. Phil. 3. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>bodie:</hi> I, first answer (generally) that the <hi>bodies of the Saints, shall be fashioned like vnto his glorious bodie,</hi> the <hi>glorie</hi> whereof, when our Lord extraordinarily appeared in it to Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> did exceede the glorie of the Sunne, otherwise <hi>Paul</hi> could not haue discerned it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Act. 22. 6.</note> it; Particularly, I answer thus: and content my selfe to expresse the principall qualities of a glorified <hi>bodie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, their bodies shall be immortall, because their reward is eternall, and because Christ shall then whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroy <hi>sinne and death</hi> the cause of mortality.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, they shall be <hi>incorruptible,</hi> for they haue lost none of their substance, and need no repaire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, they are impassible and vncapable of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, greefe or paine, yet capable and partakers of all ioy <note place="margin">Apoc. 13. 13.</note> and holinesse.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, they shall be goodly, seemelie, beautifull: If beauty so much commend the bodie in <hi>earth,</hi> and if it be commended so much in the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> then it shall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10434:33"/>
bee much more beautifull in <hi>Heauen,</hi> when it shall <note place="margin">Eph. 5. 17.</note> haue all perfections in perfection, and haue no spot or wrinckle.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, their bodies shall be (at least in all likelihood) <hi>shining bodies,</hi> for they shall be glorious, whereof <hi>shining</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15. 40.</note> 
                     <hi>is a part (or kinde)</hi> the righteous shall shine, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>the brightnesse of the firmament,</hi> and as the <hi>starres;</hi> but as <hi>the Sunne</hi> in the Kingdome of their <hi>Father:</hi> this <note place="margin">Dan. 12. 3. Matth. 13. 43.</note> glory shall arise from the <hi>vision,</hi> chiefly of God and the aspect and continuall presence of the <hi>Lord Iesus:</hi> Glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, tastes and resemblances heereof, we haue in <hi>Moses face,</hi> which when he had beene conuersant with God 40. daies in the mount, did shine so <hi>brightly,</hi> that the <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 29. 2. Cor. 3. 13.</note> Children of Israel could not stedfastly looke on him. Secondly, in diuers and glorious <hi>apparitions</hi> of <hi>Angells:</hi> when the <hi>Angell of the Lord appeared to the Shepheards,</hi> it is said that the glory of the Lord <hi>shone round about them: The Angell</hi> of the Lord that at Christ his <hi>resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi>

                     <hi>rolled away the stone,</hi> had his <hi>countenance like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and his raiment white as snow.</hi> Lastly, in our <hi>blessed</hi>

                     <hi>Sauiour whose face in the transsiguration did shine as the Sunne: his raiment did shine as the Light,</hi> and was <hi>so white</hi>

                     <hi>as no fuller on earth could white them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, they shall not be naturall <hi>bodies,</hi> but <hi>spirituall</hi> that is spirituall in quality, but not in substance; for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise they should cease to bee bodies. The <hi>bodies</hi> shall be spirituall in a three-fold sense, First in that they shall be wholly sreed from all <hi>earthly and drossie corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> all the senses shall be more <hi>pure and subtill:</hi> And the <note place="margin">Martyr. 2. Reg. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>affections</hi> shal (so much as the truth of nature wil permit) be refined: Secondly, because they shall be no more vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held and maintained by <hi>earthly meanes</hi> and helpes, but be preserued by <hi>Spirituall meanes:</hi> that is, by the power of his (holy) <hi>Spirit;</hi> what vse (herein) <hi>shall there be of the Creature,</hi> when the Lord of <hi>glorie</hi> is in <hi>place?</hi> and in <note place="margin">Matth. 22.</note> these two respects <hi>(especially)</hi> they are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> that is, <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to the Angels:</hi> Thirdly, because, they shall neuer

                     <hi>rebell</hi> against, but be alwaies subiect and <hi>obedient to the regenerate soule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seuenthly, their <hi>bodies being clarified</hi> and refined, shall be <hi>light, agile, nimble, able</hi> (like the <hi>bodie</hi> of our Lord) <hi>to walke vpon the waters,</hi> and by their proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">1.

                  <p>Lastly (to insist no longer in these particulars) they shall be (by way of excellencie) <hi>vessels of honour, meet for the Lords vse,</hi> and filled with <hi>all ioy and blessednesse.</hi>

                  <p>First, of the heathens, yea and of their chiefest <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Arist. lib. 2. de gen. et. corrupt.</note> who not knowing the <hi>waies</hi> and word of God, vtterly denie that the <hi>bodie</hi> being once dead, can arise againe the same, <hi>in number, substance and kinde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> in Christ his time, and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thence, of the <hi>Sardinian heretikes,</hi> the <hi>Archonites</hi> and <hi>Maniches,</hi> and diuers <hi>Heretickes</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> of our times, who peremptorily held, and hold that the <hi>bodie</hi> riseth not againe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, of those, who in their absurdity, hold and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that the bodie at the generall <hi>resurrection</hi> shall be essentially turned into <hi>a Spirit,</hi> and so looseth his bodily substance: but this palpable <hi>error</hi> may be thus refelled.</p>
                  <p>First, if the <hi>bodies</hi> at the <hi>resurrection</hi> become <hi>Spirits</hi> then they cease to bee <hi>sensible, visible, touchable:</hi> but Christs <hi>bodie</hi> when it rose againe, lost none of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.</note> and therefore how can ours?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if the <hi>bodies</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> be turned into <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> then they cease to be <hi>bodies,</hi> and how can they rise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:10434:34"/>
Thirdly, the bodie being turned into a <hi>Soule, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> the same or a diuers, then the <hi>Saints</hi> should consist <note place="margin">Deletio proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatum est natura negatio. <unclear>Keckerm</unclear>. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 33.</note> of a double <hi>Spirit, the one naturall, the other</hi> accidentall, and it should follow that the bodie (being) should bee no more a bodie: For, take away the proprieties of the bodie, and take away the bodie.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, God should not be the author of order, but of confusion, but this is flatly against the Scripture.</p>
