            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough theſe Treatiſes follovvinge, were begunne and ended at the requeſt and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of ſome fewe which were deſirous of them, for whoſe cauſe they are alſo nowe come vnder the printe: though peraduenture not done (as they ſay in printe) yet becauſe it is not vnlikely, but by theſe meanes they will come into the handes of many, who will enquire vpon what groundes I haue aduentured this thing, whiche to ſome will ſeeme ſtraunge and newe, yea vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inexpedient, that they are made common to all which are wonte to ſit in the Doctors chayre: to other alſo (which wil neyther greatly miſlike the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them into our tounge, nor yet the folowing of the better ſorte in that arte, they will carrie notwithſtanding the ſame taſte, becauſe they will ſeeme newer then the neweſt:) I thought it neceſſarie to write theſe fewe following, if not to ſatisfie them, yet at the leaſt to incline them to a more moderate iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gement concerning my labours, then otherwiſe, the former coniectures will ſuffer them to come vnto. There is in deede a thirde ſorte, which will looke for a defence of theſe artes in generall, being by them accuſed as vayne &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. But becauſe their reaſonings are ſuch as are to be anſwered by kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them in the darke and from the noyſe of ſounde oppoſitions, which will more hurte them and trouble the worlde, then any defence of good aunſwere, profite others. I will follow the example of many wiſe, nay the precept of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, to confute them with ſilence. To come therefore vnto the firſte ſorte, there can be nothing more fitte to ſatisfie them, then to ſhewe that that whiche they doo but floriſhe againſt vs, will deadlie wounde their cauſe. Howe can they call that newe, the which hath teſtimonies of the wiſeſtes and auncienteſt of both ſortes. For to omitte the examples of theſe dayes, whiche haue alreadie brought all artes into Frenche, Dutch, and almoſt into Engliſhe, and that by the hande of the moſt cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ningeſt workemen: What will they anſwere vnto the knowledge and learning of the Egiptians, wherein Moſes excelled, before the Greeke or Romane tounges became generall? Were not their writinges, thinke they, in their owne tounge? yea after that, were not Salomons treatiſes &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes (whether written or vnwritten) both of naturall things, and of al that is done vnder the Sunne, and therefore of theſe thinges) were they not done in the moſt ancient and worthie tounge of the Hebrues? Nay euen their chief maiſters nowe, Plato and Aristotle, Tullie, and Quintilian, wrote they not in their owne tounges, and that euen when theſe artes were more ripe in the tongues of others? So that Tullie is fayne (as he him ſelf ſomewhere confeſſeth) to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe from the Grecians, and of others, it is manifeſt they did it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Hebrues.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the ende why theſe artes haue bin kept in theſe tounges, doeth not only propte, but alſo holde vp this our practiſe, ſeeing it was done becauſe theſe tounges being moſt generall by reaſon of the ſpread that the Grecian and Romane Empire had made of them, they were the fitteſt to bee made the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of the worlde for theſe commodities. A ſtorehouſe I ſaye, not to keepe
<pb facs="tcp:27709:3"/>
them for the Romanes and Grecians alone, or for the expert in theſe tounges their free denizons: but at the leaſt that by their traffike, it might with their gay ne of the praiſe and glorie, become common to euerie particular nation, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one who had neede might buie of the ſame. Wherefore ſeeing the end was with their gayne the commoditie of all, let them not ſtill keepe in this corner to make it rare &amp; exceſsiuely deere, leaſt the people curſe them: eſpeciallie nowe that the famine of prouiſion to diſcerne of ſo many ſtrifes and ſubtelties, to vnderſtande and iudge of ſo many Treatiſes as are written both to hurte and benefite the worlde, both in regarde of matters ciuill and diuine, humane and ſpirituall, doeth daylie crie and call for it. Let them take heede alſo of open iniuſtice, for ſeeing the common vſe and practiſe of all men in generall, both in reaſoning to the purpoſe, and in ſpeaking with ſome grace and elegancie, hath ſowen the ſeede of theſe artes, why ſhould not all reape where all haue ſowen? at leaſt, why ſhould not ſome of euerie ſorte gleane, though by their cunning they had purchaſed theſe artes, as corne fields proper to them ſelues? Vnleſſe the more excellent and neceſſarie their commodities bee (as couetous men) they will be the more vnmercifull and nigardlie. Neither let them obiect againſt vs: A ſword in a fooles hand: for beſides that weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are not reſtrained &amp; tyed only to maſters of fence, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſinging to muſitions only: the ſimple play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of theſe treatiſes, which drawe men to no curiouſe or doubtful diſcourſes, but onely put them in minde of that which they may eaſilie ſeeke and knowe in moſt familiar examples with great fruit and delight, ſhall ſufficientlie aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere for them ſelues in this behalfe: praying all men to vſe them with ſome ſtudie as their callings may ſuffer, to ſtrengthen their iudgement, to diſcerne of the ſayinges and writinges of other men, to keepe better that whiche they learne, and not beyond their gifte and callinge, to aduenture to a further vſe then they can reache vnto. And thus much for the firſte ſorte.</p>
            <p>Concerning the ſeconde I will not deale with euery alteration and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, for ſome are ſuch as I thinke the verie alteration conſidered with the common rules nowe receyued of the ſounder ſorte, to iudge by, will giue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient defence: the other more doubtfull and ſtraunge, I will as brieflie and plainlie as I can mainteyne. Wherein if I go beyonde the capacitie or reach of the vnlearned, they are to be deſired either to ſtaye till they haue ſomewhat la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in theſe artes, or elſe not to trouble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues at all with this diſcourſe, but leaue it to thoſe for whoſe ſatisfaction chieflie it is written. And here our labour ſhalbe for the Logike: for the other I ſuppoſe neede not this defence, as hauing fewe and light alterations. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the definition of Logike I will not ſtriue whether well reaſoning, which is reaſoning accordinge to the arte, be conteyned in the generall of the definition, An arte or no, it is ſufficient for me that in my definition there is a true generall, an arte, and a true full difference, by which it differeth from all other artes: namely that it is of reaſoning. Nowe whether the proper ende be declared by the addition of well or no, I leaue it to thoſe who will diſpute of all the cauſes and not of the definition of Logike. For there is no reaſon why the ende of any thing ſhould come into the definition any more then the efficient cauſe, when as the difference is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore full and ſufficient. In inuention that is moſt generall, which concerneth the diſtribution of an argumente, that I make it not Artificiall and inartificiall, but firste and ariſing of the firſte, and after deuide the latter into more artificiall,
<pb facs="tcp:27709:3"/>
and leſſe artificiall. At which none neede greatly to maruell, ſeeing that reaſon whiche by arte appeareth the greater force of an other reaſon to the weaker force it hath in it ſelfe, and ſo reaſoneth more forcibly as doeth a teſtimonie, whoſe force the ſayde dependeth vpon other argumentes, it muſt be both ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall, and ariſe in part of another: but becauſe it hath neither his force in it ſelfe, nor ariſe perfectlie as a definition or diuiſion, but in parte onely from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther argumentes. It may for both cauſes be well iudged to be an Argumente, ariſing imoerfectly of the firſte, and ſo be called a leſſe artificiall ariſing of the firſte. The generall being touched, the difference in the cauſes aske the next place, where the referring of the ende vnto the efficient cauſe, wilbe odiouſe: but if it be weighed that by this meanes, the trueth is preferred &amp; the doctrine of the ende which is not commonly diſcerned from the effect and adioynte, is more cleared, the gayne wil eaſilie recompence the alteration of the place. For ſeeing it is a cauſe onely as it bringeth ſome force to the verie beinge of the thing, and all the force it bringeth is to moue the efficient or making cauſe to worke, it followeth that in that reſpect onely it is a cauſe. If it be ſayd, the end doeth not moue euerie efficient as the ende of naturall and artificiall thinges, as of the eye to ſee, the plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>met in a clok to force the next cauſes of the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie motion: the aunſwere is, they are deceyued, for as it regardeth theſe artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall things, it is an effect of the doing of it, and an adiointe in regarde of the force wherewith it is done: and to theſe things it giueth or bringeth nothing, but receyueth and taketh all from them: but it is a cauſe onely as it was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the author of nature, or the artificer to moue him to make this thing apte to this effecte, or to haue theſe properties: ſo that my ſentence remayneth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarilie true. Neither doo I ſee what other reſpect of a cauſe it can haue, for that which ſome ſpeake of the perfection it bringeth to the thing, is altogither vntrue, for all the perfection of the thing commeth from the efficient, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the matter and forme as the cauſes of the thing and the adiointes, as the ornamentes of it: In which reſpect this perfection is cauſed, and doeth not cauſe. The next to this is that the diuiſion of conceyuing and begetting cauſe is left out, and iuſtlie. For when as there ought to be no diuiſion, but that which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth of ſome difference of the partes betweene them ſelues, and of agreement with the whole, there being here no difference in the partes, becauſe the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cauſe is referred to procreation, as to his nexte effecte, and the conſeruing or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing cauſe, as to his nexte effect to preſeruation: in which reſpects they remaine onely ſimple as all others efficientes or making cauſes: it is to be inferred that they can make no diſtribution of the efficient cauſe.</p>
            <p>The like is to be ſaide, of working by it ſelfe and by chaunce, whiche make no difference of working or cauſing: for although in ſuch the principall inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no ſuch ende or purpoſe, yet the chiefe worker GOD in his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath, beſides this putteth no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in that force which bringeth forth effect, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> only betweene the purpoſe of the chiefe worker of the action, god:<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 11.</note> who worketh all things according to the counſell of his owne will, and the principall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument who did it to another purpoſe. Next to theſe followe the difference in the diſagreeing argumentes, where this is one and the chiefe, that the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Contraries are lefte out: Firſt into affirming and denying, whiche are no ſortes of contraries, but of the manner of vttering contraries, whiche as it falleth not into Logike to handle, ſo it is nothing to this purpoſe, becauſe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb facs="tcp:27709:4"/>
ariſeth not from any diſtinction of the contrarietie it ſelfe, whiche it ſhould doo, if they were diuerſe ſortes of contraries, but from the difference of expreſsing one and the ſame kinde. And this it yet more cleare in the eiuers ſortes of theſe: for relatiues are no contraries, becauſe the contrarietie lyeth in the deniall of the relation, not in the relation: neyther can it in that reſpecte be a newe ſorte of contrarietie, for when all the repugnancie lyeth in theſe two regardes, the one that being ſette as agreeing in the conſideration of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to one, it muſte be diſagreeing &amp; oppoſite in the ſame co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration one to another, as if it agree with Iacob to be Iſaaks father, it muſt diſagree with Iſaak to be ſo, this it hath from the generall nature of oppoſites, the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecte being that one is ſet againſt one, that it hath from the generall rule of contrarietie, and further it repugneth not. If ſaye one it hath this proper that relatiues are here contrarie, the aunſwere is that bringeth no newe kinde of contrarietie, and if this be a iuſt cauſe of a diuiſion of contraries, you may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide contraries agayne: ſome of cauſes, ſome of effectes, ſome of ſubiectes, and ſome of adiointes: ſeeing it maye be ſayde, theſe are cauſes whiche are contrarie, as it ſayde, theſe are relatiues which are contrarie.</p>
            <p>The like almoſt may be ſayde of the priuatiues, which are contraries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one is naturallie in the ſubiect as the habite, and the other diueth out or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priueth it of the habite: for what newe ſorte of contrarietie is here? Surely no other but that one is ſette againſt one, for the beeing naturally or not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie in the ſubiecte, belongeth not the Logiſion to conſider, but the ſeuerall Maiſter in his arte, as to the Phiſition that health is naturally in the bodye and howe, that ſickenes driueth that awaye, and howe: otherwiſe, why may we not make hurtfull contraries, whereof one is hurtfull to the ſubiecte, or profitable contraries, whereof one is profitable to the ſubiecte, as peace and warre to a common wealthe, Vice and vertue to the minder?</p>
            <p>Nowe lette vs conſider of thoſe others which they call contradictories, when one affirmeth, and the other denieth, as a man, not a man: iuſt, not iuſt. Concerninge theſe, when all the contrarietie (which they ſaye) is proper to them, lyeth eyther in the contradiction, it is, it is not: which is proper to iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not to inuention, to ſette foorth, or that one thing is opponed to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges which it is not: which is no contrarietie, but the oppoſition of diſperates, ſeeing one is not opponed to one kinde, but one to many kindes, and that equallie, as a man opponed to not a man, is equallie opponed to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, to fowles, fiſhes, beaſtes, vnſenſible creatures, &amp;c. in the ſame not a man: wherefore it followeth, that eyther they muſt allowe my dooing, or elſe in the firſte bring in confuſion whyleſt they ſpeake of that parte in one parte of the arte, which is proper to the other, and in the ſeconde confuſion and follie both: whyleſt they make that a contrarie whiche is none, and without all gayne repeate that whiche they haue ſufficientlie handled before. Neyther lette any ſaye they are contrarie, becauſe their is no midle betweene man and not a man, for ſo there is not betweene man and other things, &amp; yet they are not contrarie but diſperates only.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the firſte argumentes.</p>
            <p>The leauing out of Notation and Coniugation remayneth onely to bee ſpoken of in Inuention, the reaſon whereof is manifeſt, becauſe it is graunted of all that they haue no newe force, beſides the firſte, no newe reaſon or argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               </gap>ingates, referre them one vnto an other, and what is their beſides the cauſe and the effecte? What force or reaſon more? For that iust and iustlie are formed one of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, apperteyneth to Grammer, that they allude fitlie to the figure of Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, called Poliptoton, which chaungeth finely the ende or caſe of wordes.</p>
            <p>The like is to be ſayde of Notation, which is the interpretation of a name, which apperteyneth not to Logike but to Dictionaries: as in this, An argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo called, becauſe it argueth, a faithefull man, becauſe he hath faith: what force of reaſon is there in the firſt example? of the cauſe and the effect. What in the other? of the effect and the cauſe. But is there nothing elſe? yes. A fitte and elegant vttering of diuers things by wordes, not much, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing in ſounde, as argument, arguing, fayth, faythfull: but this is neither reaſon, nor newe force of reaſon; but onely an elegancie of the Trope called Paranomaſia, or chaunge of the name. Wherefore let vs keepe them no longer, nowe the honour claymeth them, but according to the lawe turne them home agayne. Thus much for inuention: As for the chaunge in a teſtimonie, I am contente to leaue it vnto the iudgement of the reader, when hee ſhall examine it according to the rules of Logike: as alſo thoſe ſmall differences which are in the ſeconde parte of Logike, for in that ſometimes the firſte ſorte of a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſme is founde in all his partes, there is nowe no longer any reaſon to traſe him vppe onely in an Enthimeme. And thus much for the ſatisfying of both theſe ſortes. Nowe, if they be not fullie contented, my deſire is of the former to beare with that, for the commoditie of others, whiche them ſelues like not. The other ſorte alſo I praye, to ſatisfie them ſelues in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and bettering that which can not yet ſufficientlie pleaſe them. And ſo I committe thee to the direction of God his Spirite, whom I praye ſo to increaſe thy knowledge by all good and lawfull meanes, as thou mayeſt diſcerne things that differ, and walke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, vntill the day of the Lorde.</p>

                  <p>The ſpring of reaſons is the firſte parte of Logike, whiche giueth rules of the ſortes of reaſons, which becauſe it doth helpe much to the finding out of reaſons, is commonly called Inuention.</p>
                  <p>A reaſon is that, which is apte to reaſon withall, whiche is commonly called an Argument: of which ſorte are all things, when they are referred in conſideration of reaſon one vnto another. For there is ſuch an agreement of the diuers ſortes of reaſons, as the nature of one hangeth vpon another, ſo that he that perfect lie kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth one, may alſo knowe the other, as in this example: God is the Sauior of all men: where GOD being referred to ſaluation, is a reaſon to ſet foorth ſaluation by the cauſe, and ſaluation being referred to God, ſetteth him forth by a thing cauſed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the effecte: In which alſo we ſee, he that knoweth GOD to be the cauſe of ſaluation, knoweth alſo ſaluation to be the thing cauſed of God.</p>

Where the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the excellencie of Loue, by a reaſon of deſcription which ariſeth of other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as of that which Loue doth cauſe, long ſuffering: Of the contraries to Loue, as enuie, frowarde dealing, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Simple, is a reaſon which hath force in it ſelfe, without regarde of any manner of compariſon: as, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heauen: Where we ſee, the dooing of the will of God is ſet forth firſt by a reaſon whiche is vncompared, namely by thoſe which ſhould doo it, Men in earth: then by a compariſon of the like, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in heauen doo it.</p>

                  <head>The ſeconde Chapter. Of a cauſe.</head>
                  <p>A CAVSE is that which giueth ſome neceſſarie force for the verie being of the thing cauſed.</p>
                  <p>A cauſe is of two ſortes, <list>
                        <item>The one which is without the thing cauſed as the making or efficient cauſe.</item>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The making cauſe is a cauſe which by ſetting the matter &amp; the forme togither, maketh the thing cauſed. As, The Lorde God alſo made man of the duste of the ground, and breathed in his face the breathe of life, and the man was a liuing ſoule Here wee ſee that God which is of him ſelfe without Man, is the making cauſe of man, and did make him, by breathing the breath of life which was the forme, into that of the duſte, which was the matter. Nowe, where more then one doo the proper worke of the making cauſe, all working togither, are the making cauſe. The partes whereof are the chiefe workers called the principall, and the helpes, called the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes, and the ende which moueth the making cauſe to ſette the matter and forme togither, is no other cauſe then this, ſeeing it bringeth no other force for the being of the thing, then to moue the making cauſe to worke, As, Of his owne will begatte he vs with the worde of trueth, that we ſhould be the firste fruites of his creatures. Where the ende, that we ſhould be the firſte fruites of his creatures moued Gods owne will, Gods owne will being the principall worker, to begette vs with the worde of trueth being the inſtrumentall, And thus much for the efficient or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The cauſes that are within the thing, are thoſe cauſes which are alwayes inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie remayning togither for the being of the thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:27709:6"/>They are twoo, <list>
                        <item>The matter.</item>
                        <item>The forme.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The matter is a cauſe of the which the thing cauſed is made: So the Lorde made woman of the ribbe of man. Noah the Arke of pine trees.</p>
                  <p>The forme is a cauſe, by the which a thing is that which it is: and ſo differeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all other things, as in the example of man before mencioned. But the naturall forme of thinges, though they may be conceyued by reaſon, yet they can not well be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſpeache. The artificiall forme of thinges is much more eaſie to bee conceyued in reaſon, and vttered in wordes: and therefore of ſuch ſpeaches there be many, as in all writers, ſo in the Scriptures eſpeciallie. So God ſet downe the artificiall forme of the Arke and of the Arke of couenaunt, the Table, the Candelſticke, the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, the mercie Seate, the Altar of burnte offeringes, the Court of the Tabernacle, and all the furniture and appurtenances therevnto: by which artificial forme they be that they be, and differ from all other things.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the cauſe: Now followeth the thing cauſed.</p>
                  <p>The thing cauſed, is that which is by the whole force of all the cauſes, As, So GOD loued the worlde, as he gaue his onlie begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him ſhould not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhe but haue eternall life. Where our happines is the thing cauſed: the loue of God, and faith the efficient cauſe. Chriſt the materiall cauſe, and eternall life the formal cauſe. So alſo euerie worke or mouing of anie thing, is the effecte or thinge cauſed by the worker or mouer. Hitherto of more agreeable reaſons. Of both which, relatiues are a moſt excellent example, they are thoſe which are ſo of and by one another, that they are the mutuall cauſes and effectes one of another. As, The Father and the Sonne, to giue and receyue, to teache and to learne.</p>
                  <p>Nowe of the leſſe agreeable argumentes. Leſſe agreeable reaſons are ſuch in whoſe agreement leſſe is giuen and receyued to and from one another: as appeareth in the example of more agreeable reaſons.</p>
                  <p>The ſubiect is of two ſortes, <list>
                        <item>Which receyueth the adioynt.</item>
                        <item>That wherein the adioint is is occupied.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in this example, Whereſoeuer the carkaſſe is, thither will the eagles reſorte. Where we ſee in the firſte parte, the worde Where, noting out a place (whiche is the ſubiecte of the thing that is in it) is the ſubiecte which receyueth: the carkas is the ſubiect wherein the Eagles which are the adiointes, occupie them ſelues by reſorting. So Husbandrie is the ſubiect of an Husbandman: Ruling the Church is the ſubiect of the Biſhop, becauſe in theſe things they are occupied.</p>
                  <p>The ſubiect which recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth alſo is double, <list>
                        <item>That which receyueth into it ſelfe.</item>
                        <item>That which receyueth to it ſelfe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>So Iob was the ſubiect in which was ſoundnes, vprightnes, and the feare of God, and the minde is the ſubiect in which are all euill qualities. So Iob and other menne were and are the ſubiectes which receyue to themſelues ritches, houſes, landes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>An adiointe is that which is adioyned vnto anie thing, as in all the former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the things referred vnto their ſubiectes, were the adiointes: ſo what ſoeuer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto anie thing not being cauſe or effecte of the ſame, it is the adiointe.</p>
                  <p>Agayne, adiointes are eyther <list>
                        <item>Common, or</item>
                        <item>Proper.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Eyther of them ſeparable or inſeparable, which for the moſt part ariſe of the cauſes or being of the things, and are therefore called eſſentiall or of the being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:27709:7"/>Common are thoſe which are adioyned vnto diuers ſubiectes, as the power of ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, drinking, ſleeping, &amp;c. are common adiointes to men and beaſtes, and can not be ſeparated. So ritches, pouertie, ſicknes, and health, are common adiointes to good and euill men, and may be ſeparated from them.</p>
                  <p>A proper adiointe is that which is alwayes ioyned to one and the ſame ſubiect. So righteouſnes, faith, ioye in the holy Ghoſt, are the proper adiointes to the children of God: ſo to be ſeene and felte are the proper adiointes of a bodie, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable. And it was proper to Adam and Ehauah, to enioye paradiſe, and yet ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: Alſo Paule to be rapte vp into the thirde heauen, and yet ſeparable.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of an agreeable argument, whereby only thoſe things that differ in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues may yet be ſaide to be one. So Chriſte ſayeth: I and my Father are ont, meaninge in nature or cauſe. So Iohn ſaith: There are three which beare witneſſe in heauen, the Father, the Worde, and the Spirite, and theſe three are one, meaning in their witneſſe whiche is their effecte. So Paule ſaith: He that planteth and he that watereth, are one, that is in office and function, which is the adiuncte.</p>

The kingdome of heauen is like vnto man that ſewed good ſeede in his fielde. Mat. 6. 5. When thou prayest be net as the hipocrites are. Alſo Mat. 24. 37 But euen as in the dayes of Neah, ſo ſhall the comming of the Sonne of man be. Likewiſe Gal. 4. 1 Then I ſaye, the heire as long as he is a childe, differeth nothing from a ſeruaunt, though he be Lorde ouer all.</p>
                  <p>The partes of a ſimilitude are ſometimes ſeuered or diſtinguiſhed by three conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or ſteppes of compariſon, commonly called termes: and ſometimes by fower.

And it was vnlike the beastes of the fielde, that were before. Alſo 1. Tim. 6. 3. If any man teache otherwiſe. Alſo 5. 25. and 1. 3. Thus much of the firſt reaſons.

                  <p>Of the more artificiall argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes ariſing of the firſte, there are two ſortes, <list>

                  <p>The whole is that which conteyneth or hath in it the partes.</p>
                  <p>The partes is that which is conteyned of the whole</p>
                  <p>A Diuiſion is made of argumentes which are agreeable to the whole, but diſagreeable amongeſt them ſelues, ſo that it is ſo much the more perfect, by how much the partes do more agree to the whole, and more diſagree amongeſt themſelues.</p>
                  <p>Diuiſion is made of reaſons which are <list>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Diuiſion made of the cauſe, is when the partes be cauſe of the whole, and then they are properly called members: for a member is that parte which giueth being to the whole, and the whole being of ſuch me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, is called integrall. For a man in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is often diuided into his members, the ſoule and the body: and the body into his members, as head, handes, feete, &amp;c. So the whole Lawe diuided into his two mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Firſt, which teacheth our duetie towards God in the firſt table, and that whiche teacheth vs our dutie towards our neighbour, in the ſecond table. The whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is deuided into his members, the parte in heauen, and the parte in earth.</p>
                  <p>Diſtribution of the thing cauſed, is whoſe partes are cauſed of the whole, or are the effect of the whole, as when the whole kinde or generall is diuided into his ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſortes or ſperialls.</p>

                  <p>A ſeuerall ſorte or ſpeciall, is a parte comprehended vnder the whole kinde or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forme, from whence he taketh that being which is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all the other partes or ſpecialls, as in the 10. to the Rom. The Apoſtle diuideth the ordinarie offices of the Church into Prophetes, that is Miniſters occupied in the worde, and other Miniſters occupied in other buſines in the Church. The firſte ſorte he diuideth againe into the Teacher who is occupied in doctrine, and the Paſtor who is occupied in exhortation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſeconde ſorte againe into Elders, which rule the Church, and Diſtributors, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che diſtribute to the poore, in which and ſuch like exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples, the firſte is called the moſt generall, the other the vndergenerall or ſubalternall, which in reſpect of the former, is the ſpeciall, and in reſpect of that foloweth is the generall. The laſte, is the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſorte, or moſt ſpeciall, becauſe it can not be diuided into moe ſpecialls, and this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion of the cauſes into the effectes, is moſte excellent: yet that is not to be neglected when the partes are only ſet forth by their effectes, as Salomon maketh a diuiſion of fower ſmall things in the earth by the effectes, the Emmets prepare their meate in the Sommer, the Miſe which make their dwelling in the Rockes, and the Greſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>A perfecte Definition or ſetting foorth of a thing, is that, whiche is made of the whole kinde or generall, and the proper difference of that ſeuerall ſorte which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, where the firſte parte is called the generall, the other the proper or ſpeciall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.

So the Church is a number of men in Chriſt Ieſus, where A number of men is the generall, and in Chriſt Ieſus, is the proper difference.</p>

                  <p>And here the iudgement muſt be according to the propertie of the axiome: as, that which is neceſſarily true, muſt be abſolutely graunted or affirmed: and that whiche is neceſſarily falſe, muſt be abſolutely denied: and that whiche is doubtfull, muſte bee doubtfullie affirmed, or denied: or elſe for certaintie diſtinguiſh how farre you denie, and howe farre you graunte.</p>
                  <p>Nowe, when axiomes are exactlie iudged, they muſt not only be according to this rule of trueth, but alſo according to the rules of rightfull placing or rightfulnes, and wiſe placing, or rule of wiſedome.</p>
                  <p>The rule of rightful placing is, when reaſons are placed in an axiome, according to their proper conſiderations, ſpoken of before in Inuention: As, the proper forme with the proper thinge formed, the proper ſubiecte, with the proper adiuncte: the proper generall with the proper ſpeciall. As, All the going aſide from the rule of goodnes, is ſinne, which both is neceſſarilie true, &amp; the proper general is affirmed of the proper ſpeciall. But it is contrariwiſe in this axiome: The lawe of God is perfect.

                  <p>Wiſe placing, is when reaſons whihch may be equally affirmed or denied one of the other, are ſo placed, as that which is beſt knowen be in the firſt place, as in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of reaſons, the cauſe muſt be before the effect, the ſubiect before the adioint, &amp;c. As, All going from the rule of godlines, is ſinne, is wiſely placed, becauſe the proper generall is ſet before the proper ſpeciall, which is, as it may be turned, All ſinne is goinge from the rule of righteouſnes, it is truly and rightly placed, but not according to this exact rule, for the proper ſpeciall, not ſo manifeſte as the proper generall, is notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſet before, which yet 1. 10. 5. is placed according to this rule.

Herevnto may be referred the full compariſons and the ſimilitudes, as, Looke what number of ſtarres there be in the heauens, ſo many in nomber ſhall thy ſeede be: ſaide God to Abraham. Whoſe contradictions, are the deniall of euerie parte.</p>

So that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we iudge this axiome to be true. we muſt iudge the partes to be truelie and neceſſarilie knitte togither. Which may be, though the partes be both falſe: as in this example: The Iewes neyther were Abrahams chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, neither did the workes of Abraham This axiome is doubtfull, when the partes and the following are doubtfull: As Paule in the ſhippe: If you obeye my counſell, you ſhall not periſhe.

               <p>The fine maner of wordes is a garniſhing of ſpeache, whereby one worde is drawen from his firſte proper ſignification to another, as in this ſentence: Sinne lyeth at the doores: where Sinne is put for the puniſhment of ſinne adioyned vnto it: lyeth at the doores ſignifieth at hande, as that which lyeth at the doores, is readie to be brought in.</p>
               <p>This chaunging of wordes was firſte founde out by neceſsitie, for the wante of wordes, afterwarde confirmed by delight, becauſe ſuch wordes are pleaſaunt &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the eare. Therefore this chaunge of ſignification muſt be ſhamefaſte, and as it were maydenly, that it may ſeeme rather to be ledde by the hande to another ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, then to be driuen by force vnto the ſame: yet ſometimes this fine manner of ſpeache ſwerueth from this perfection, and then it is</p>

               <p>Be not to iuste, nor too wicked: which ſpeache although it ſeeme verie harde, yet it doeth not without ſome fineneſſe of ſpeache vtter thus much, That one ſeeke not a righteouſneſſe beyonde the lawe of God, and that when none can liue without all ſinne, yet that they take heede, that ſinne beare not dominion ouer them: As, My teares are my meate daye and night. Thoſe that hate mee are moe in number then the heares of my heade: Both which do vtter by an exceſſe of ſpeache, a great ſorrowe, and a great number of enimies.</p>
               <p>The abuſe of ſpeache is when the chaunge of ſpeache is harde, ſtraunge, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted, as in the firſt example.</p>
               <p>The exceſſe of ſpeache is, when the chaunge of ſignification is very high &amp; loftie, as in the ſeconde example. And Pſal. 6. 7.</p>

So Iohn ſaith, He ſawe the ſpirit deſcending in the likenes of a doue, that is the ſigne of the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, the adioynt is put for the thing to whiche it is adioyned, As, Chriſte is called our hope, 1. Tit. that is, on whom our hope did depende.

               <p>THE mocking Trope is, when one contrarie is ſignified by another, as God ſaid, Man is like to one of vs. So Chriſt ſaith: Sleepe on, and yet by and by, Ariſe, let vs go. So Paule ſaith, You are wiſe, and I am a foole.</p>
               <p>This Trope is perceyued eyther by the contrarietie of the matter or the manner of vtterance, or both: So Elias ſaide to the prophetes of Baal: Crie aloude. &amp;c. So the Iewes ſaide vnto Chriſte: Hayle King of the Iewes.</p>
               <p>Hitherto appertayneth the paſsing by a thing, which yet with a certayne elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie noteth it. So Philemon 19. That I ſay not thou owest thy ſelfe vnto me.</p>

               <p>On the other ſide, one ſorte or ſpeciall is put for the whole ſorte or generall in the examples following. In the Lords prayer Breade one helpe of life is put for all helpes: This day, one time for all times. So Solomon ſayth, The thing of the day in his day, that is, the thing of the time in his time.</p>
               <p>So ſometimes leſſe is ſpoken, and yet more is vnderſtood, which is called diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Meioſis, As, I am. ſaith, to him that knoweth how to do well and doeth not, it is ſinne, that is a great ſinne. So our Sauior Chriſt ſaieth, If they had not knowen, they had had no ſinne, that is, no ſuch great ſinne as they haue nowe. Likewiſe the deniall by compariſon. So Solomon ſayth, Receyue my wordes and not ſiluer, that is, my wordes rather then ſiluer. So Paule ſaieth, I was ſente to preache, and not to baptiſe, that is, not ſo much to baptiſe as to preache.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A crying out or Exclamation is the firſte, which is ſet forth by a worde of calling out: Sometimes of wonder, As Rom. 8. O the depth of the iudgements of God! Pſal. 8. O Lorde, howe excellent is thy Name!</p>
               <p>Sometimes of pitie, alſo theſe wordes, Beholde, alas, oh, be ſignes of this figure, As, O Ieruſalem, Ieruſalem, which ſtoneſt the Prophetes. Sometimes of deſperation, As, My ſinne is greater then can be forgiuen. Behold thou driueſt me out &amp;c. Sometimes of wiſhing, As, O Lord of hoſtes, howe amiable are thy tabernacles. Sometimes of diſdayning, As, Roman. 7. in the ende: O miſerable wretch that I am, who ſhall deliuer me from this bodie of ſinne!

Alſo when this Figure is vſed in the ende of a ſentence, it is called a ſhooting out of the voyce or Epiphonema, as when the ſinnes of Ieſabel were ſpoken againſt, this is added at the ende, Seemed it a little to her to doo thus and thus. So after the high ſetting foorth of the name of God, Dauid ſhutteth vp his praiſewith this: Bleſſed be his glorious name, and let all the earth be filled with his glorie.

               <p>Thus much of crying out.</p>
               <p>Nowe followeth the Figure of calling backe, or reuocation.</p>
               <p>Reuocation is when any thing is called backe, and it is as it were a coolinge and quenching of the heate of the exclamation that wente before.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Epanorthroſis is correction, when ſome thing is called backe that went before: as, Paul conecteth his doubtfulnes of Agrippa, his beliefe, when he ſaith, Beleeust thou King Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa, I knowe thou beleeuest. Paul 1. Cor. 15. I laboured more aboundantlie than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God in me.</p>
               <p>A keeping of ſilence or Apoſiopeſis is when the courſe of the ſentence begonne is ſo ſtayed, as thereby ſome parte of the ſentence not being vttered, may be vnderſtood. So our Sauiour Chriſt ſayeth, My ſoule is heauie What ſhall I ſay, Iohn 12. 27.</p>

               <p>Communication is a deliberation with others. Gal. 3 1. 2.

What ſhall we ſaye then? ſhall we continue ſtill in ſinne, that grace may abounde? In which wordes is ſette downe the obiection, the aunſweringe in theſe wordes: God forbidde.

            </p>
            <p>1. Tim. 5. 8. If one care not for his owne, eſpeciallie thoſe of his houſe: which ſheweth an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall rule of mutual duetie betweene theſe two. Alſo the wiſedome of the holy Ghoſt, in ſetting downe mutuall dueties vnto them. Pro. 31. Ephe. 6. 2. Honour thy Father and thy Mother, which is the first commaundement with promiſe. 3 That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest liue longe on earth. 4 And ye Fathers, prouoke not your children to wrath, but bring them vp in instruction and information of the Lorde. 5 Seruauntes, be obediente vnto them that are your Maiſters according to the fleſhe, with feare and humblinge, in ſinglenes of your hartes, as vnto Chriſt. 6 Not with ſeruice to the eye, as men pleaſers, but as the ſeruauntes of Christ, doing the will of God from the harte. Coloſ. 4. 20. 21. 22. 23. 24.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which gouerne the familie, are thoſe Superiours who haue authoritie in the ſame. Their generall and common duetie is, to order their houſe according to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer rule.

Contrarie to this is the common and whole caſting off of this care, vnleſſe in worldly matters. The firſte parte of this rule is proued by theſe places: I will haue the yonger women to marrie, and gouerne their houſholde. 1. Tim. 5. 14.

Gene 24. 2.

that Iob ſent and fanctiſyed them, and riſing earelie, he offered a ſacrifice according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them all. For Iob ſayde, Peraduenture my ſonnes haue ſinned, or curſed God in their harte. So Iob did euerie of thoſe dayes.

            <p>The dueties in reforming, are thoſe dueties whereby they muſt laboure to reforme euery thing amiſſe which is eſpied, for Gods glorie and their good, and leaſt it creepe further. Contrarie to this is, that many corruptions are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted of, that they are winked at.</p>
            <p>Iob. 1. 5. Pſal. 101. 3. 4. 5. I Will not ſet before mine eyes a wicked thinge, I hate the workes of thoſe that decline, it ſhall not cleaue vnto mee.

            <p>Wiſedome is that the cauſes may be throughlie ſifted, and ſoundlie repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the worde of God. According vnto this wiſedome alſo, vntill a fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter occaſion, this duetie may be let paſſe, and with keeping the authoritie of the chiefe of the familie be winked at for a time. Eccleſ. 7. 21.

            <p>Patience fitte for it is, with keeping the authoritie of the chieefe of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, to heare what can be alledged, and by equitie alſo to allowe or diſallowe the ſame. Contrarie to which is, haſtines without diſcretion and making the matter playne, that the conſcience may be touched for the faulte.

            <p>Rebuke is a ſharpe admonition to take heede of the euill reproued aright, as is gathered out of that before.</p>
            <p>Correction is when with a ſharpe rebuke of inſtruction, puniſhment is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted or layde vpon the offendor, according to their diſcretion: conſideration being had of the faulte and all circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances of the ſame. Yet if this at any time for ſome cauſes be omitted, a greater is to be threatened and performed, when they ſhall nexte deſerue the ſame. Pro. 19. 19 Be thou great in the ſeruencie of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, in forgiuing the faulte, ſaying, that if thou ſhalt deliuer him, thou wilt further puniſhe him afterwarde.

Iam. 5. 15. And the prayer of faith ſhall ſaue the ſicke: and the Lord ſhall rayſe him vp: and if he haue committed ſinnes, they ſhall be forgiuen him. Mat. 18. 16. But if he ſhall not heare thee, take yet with thee one or two, that of the mouth of twoo or three witneſſes, the whole matter may be confirmed. Deut. 21. 18.

            <p>And hitherto of the firſte ſorte of dueties concerning Chriſtian holynes in the familie.</p>
            <p>The other concerning the things of this life, is conuenientlie to prouide the neceſſarie things of this life, as that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient clothing, foode, reſte: and (if on certayne cauſes neede be) recreation. 1.

            <p>And then much more the maiſter muſt care for the ſeruauntes, that they may haue euen that refreſhing &amp; eaſe which is meete. And thus much for the generall dueties, and of their ſpeciall dueties towardes thoſe which ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuallie or ordinarilie vnder their gouernement in the familie.</p>
            <p>Nowe followeth the other which is the intertaynement of ſtrangers: whoſe propertie is, the loue of intertayning of Gheſtes, 1. Tim. 3. 2. Therefore a Biſhop must be vnreproueable, the husbande of one wife, watchinge, ſober, modest, giuen to hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, &amp;c. Heb. 13. 2. Be not vnmindefull of intertayning Cheſtes: for hereby certayne vnawares haue intertayned Aungells. 1. Pet. Be hailcicus one towardes another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging.</p>
            <p>The firſt duetie required of this worke is, a liberall &amp; chearefull miniſtring of protection and all things which ſerue for the neceſsitie and comfort of this life, as is meete for the abilitie of them which receiue, and the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dicion of thoſe who are receyued. Gen. 18. 2. For when lifting vp his eyes he had looked, beholde three men ſtoode before him, whom whilest he ſawe he runneth to meete them from the doore of the Tente and bowed him ſelfe to the earth. And he ſaide: My Lordes: If newe I haue founde fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour in thyne eyes, paſſe not I praye thee from thy ſeruaunt. 4 Let there nowe be taken a litle water, and waſhe your feete, and ſitte downe vnder this tree. 5 In the meane time I will take and bringe a morſell of breade, and refreſhe your harte, afterwarde yee ſhall goe forwarde, ſeeing that for this cauſe you paſſe by your ſeruaunte: which ſayde: Doo ſo as thou haste ſpoken. 6 Therefore Abraham going haſtilie into the Tente vnto Sara, ſayde: Make readie at once three meaſures of corne: Take fine meale, kneade it, and make kakes baked vnder the aſhes. 7 But Abraham running to the hearde, tooke a ſucking calfe, tender &amp; good, and gaue it to a ſeruaunte, whiche made haste to prepare it. 8 Therefore takinge butter and milke, and the calſe which he had prepared, he ſet them before them, who did eate he ſtanding by them vnder the ſame tree. Gene. 19. 1. And thoſe two Aungels com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto Sodome in the eueninge, Lott ſate at the gate of Sodome: whom when Lot ſawe, he riſinge wente to meete them, and bewed him ſelfe with his face to the grounde. 2 And hee ſayde: Beholde nowe my Lordes, turne I praye you into the houſe of your ſeruaunte,<note place="margin">For protection ſee a notable example of Lot, Gen. 19. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

Whiche ſaide: Not ſo, we pray thee, for we can lodge all night in the ſtreetes. 3 But when he was inſtant vpon them exceeding lie, they turning vnto him, entred into his houſe: which made them a banket, and did bake vnleauened breade, and they did eate. 1.

            <p>Contrarie to this is nigardlines, ſuch as was in Nabal in receyuing of gue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes. Alſo ſuffering God to be diſhonoured, his word or Sabboth neglected, or anie ſuch abuſe to be committed by their gueſtes, &amp; not labour by good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to amende them or remoue them from the familie.</p>
            <p>And hitherto of the chiefe of the familie, and their dueties as are generall to all.</p>
            <p>Nowe for the moſte parte, the chiefe of the familie are maried folke, and ſo in common the gouernours of the houſe. They are called maried folkes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the bande of Mariage. Mariage is that ioyninge of one man and one woman togither by the couenaunt of God, that they may be one fleſhe, vntill they ende their life. Gene. 2. 24. Therefore ſhall man leaue his father and his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleane to his wiſe, and they ſhalbe one fleſhe. Leuit. 18. 18. Take not one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man vnto another to vexe her, by vncouering the ſhame of her that is married vppon this in her life. Pro. 2. 17. Which forſaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the couenaunt of her God. Mala. 2. 14. But you ſaye, Wherefore? Becauſe the Lorde hath witneſſed betweene thee and the wiſe of thy youth, againſt whom thou doest vnfaithfullie: yet ſhee is thy companion and wife couenaunted vnto thee. 1. Cor. 7. 30. The wife is bounde by the lawe as longe as her huſbande liueth, but if her husbande be dead, ſhee is free to marie vnto whom ſhe will, onelie in the Lorde. Rom 7. 1. Knowe ye not brethren (for I ſpeake to them that knowe the lawe) that the lawe doeth beare rule ouer a man as long as he liueth? 2 For the woman being ſubiecte vnto the man being aliue, is bounde by the Lawe: but if her husbande be dead, ſhe is deliuered from the lawe of the man. 3 Therefore whilest the man liueth, ſhe ſhalbe called an adultereſſe, if ſhe become another mans: but if her husband be dead, ſhe is free from the lawe, that ſhee is not an adultereſſe, though ſhe become another mans.</p>
            <p>To be one fleſhe, by a parte put for the whole, is that moſt neare and holy ſocietie with the power and vſe of the bodies one of another in puritie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the man in an eſpeciall manner is become the heade of the wife, and the wiſe another helpe vnto the huſbande likewiſe. Gene. 2. 18. And the Lorde ſayde: It is not good that man ſhould be alone, I will make him an helpe meete for him. Pro. 2. 17. Which forſaketh the guyde of her youth, and forgetteth the couenant of her God. Mat. 19. 6. Therefore they are no more two but one fleſhe: that therefore which GOD hath ioyned togither, let no man ſeparate. Ephe. 5. 31. Therefore ſhall man leaue father and mother, and ſhalbe ioyned to his wife, and they which were two ſhall become one fleſhe.</p>
            <p>Therefore in the whole gouernement of the familie, <list>
                  <item>The huſbande is the chiefe or foregouernour.</item>
                  <item>The Wife is a fellow helper.</item>

            </p>
            <p>To be a foregouernour is in the whole adminiſtration of houſholde go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement to be ouer all perſons and matters in the houſe, and euen the wife. 1. Tim. 3. 5.

            <p>The proper obedience is that which ſpringeth from a chearefull, naturall, continuall and childelike loue and reuerence.</p>
            <p>Contrarie to this is, diſobedience, vnnaturall behauiours or affections. &amp;c. 2. Tim. 3. 2. For men ſhalbe louers of them ſelues, couetous, boasters, proude, euill ſpeakers, diſobedient to parentes, vnthankefull, prophane. Coloſ. 3. 20. Children, hearken vnto your parentes in all things, for this is acceptable vnto the Lorde. Ephe. 6. 1. Children giue eare vnto your parentes in the Lorde, for that is iust.</p>
            <p>This obedience muſt ſhewe it ſelfe eſpeciallie in being gouerned by them in the matter of calling, and mariage, accordinge to the rules preſcribed in the worde of God, and all ſuch matters of waight &amp; momente. Chieflie vntill by the fathers authoritie and conſente, more full power be giuen to their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe of their yeeres and diſcretion. Numb. 30. 4.

Cor. 7. 36. But if any man thinke he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſome vncomely thing against his vngin, if ſhe paſſe the flower of her age, and that ſo it ought to be

Let them be ioyned in mariage. 37 But he which abideth firme in harte, neyther is driuen by neceſsitie, but hath his owne will in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and hath decreed this in his harte, that he may keepe his virgine, he doeth well. 38 Therefore he that giueth her in mariage doeth well, but he that giueth her not in mariage, doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better. Gen. 24. 51. Beholde Ribkah is before thee, take her and goe thy waye, that ſhee may be a wiſe vnto the ſonne of thy Lorde, as the Lord hath ſpoken.</p>
            <p>Laban the ſonne hauing the gouernement of his father being olde, was the chiefe in this buſines. Gen. 24. 55.

            <p>Contrarie to this is contempte of your parentes, greeuing of them, negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting to helpe and ſuccour them. &amp;c. 1. Tim. 5. 4. But if anie widdowe haue chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren or Nephewes, let them learne firste to ſhewe godlines towardes their owne houſe, and to recompence their kindred, for that is an honest thing and acceptable before God. Mat. 15. 4. For God hath commaunded, ſaying: Honour thy father and thy mother: and hee that curſeth his father or mother, let him dye the death. 5 But ye ſaye, who ſoeuer ſhall ſaye to father and mother, by the gifte that is offered by mee, thou mayest haue profite. 6 Though he honour not his father or his mother, ſhalbe free, thus haue you made the commaundement of God of no authoritie by your traditions Gene. 47. 12.

            <p>The entrance doeth conteyne ſuch a deſcription of God, as is meete for vs, whenſoeuer we adreſſe our ſelues to prayer, to haue feeling of in our hartes. It is diſpoſed in an Axiome or ſentence copulatiue or coupling. The firſt reaſon is from the adioint of relation Our Father, which is adorned with that manner of excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which vttereth a familiar affection, as My Father, my ſonne! Gen. 22. 7. So that we muſt in the aſſured feeling of faith according to the ſpirit of adoption and ſanctification crie vnto God as our merciful father, through Ieſus Chriſt, Rom. 8. 13. 14. 15. Gal. 4. 6. more readie then any father to graunt that wee aske according to his will, and therefore muſt be wayted on in requeſt &amp; ſute, till we obteyne. Lu. 11. 5. to the 14. ver. The ſeconde reaſon is, from the ſubiect Which art in heauen, that is, full of all maieſtie and power, Heauen the throne, or ſeate, or place of Gods Maieſtie, and power, where this is moſt cleare and manifeſt, Pſal. 113. 4. 5.

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is diſpoſed in an axiome ſimple of the ſubiect, &amp; the adioint, God his giuing occupied in prouiding bread, ſaying thus: Giue vs that which is not in our power &amp; wherof we are vnworthie, Deut. 8. 18. euen breade, that is by a Sinecdoche, all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of this life both for neceſsitie and chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, Eſa. 3. 1. Pſal. 104. where the conſequent is declared by two arguments. Firſt the ſubiect ours, that is ſuch as we in Chriſt be heires of, to vſe, being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by word and prayer, 1. Tim. 4. 1. Cor. 3. 22 The ſecond by the adioint, ſuch as is both apte &amp; able by his bleſsing to nouriſhe vs, ſeeing wee may haue money and put it in a bottomleſſe purſſe, and eate &amp; not be ſatisfied, &amp; drinke and yet not be refreſhed, Hag. 2. For the worde ſignified breade to our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, daylie, ſuch as may giue daylie nouriſhment. The antecedent is declared by the adioint of the time this daye, that is one kinde of time being putt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie for that time wherein we are, according to God his promiſe to aske it, as Salomon ſaith, The thing of the day in the day: that is, euery thinge in his time, as S. Luke expoundeth according to the day, that is, as the time requireth. For in ioye the time requireth one bleſsing, in affliction another, that we might hang on God euery moment, 1. Tim. 6. 6. &amp;c. Mat. 6. 31. &amp;c. To the other two this is generall, that there is a Sinechdoche where one kinde is put for all of that ſorte, and the meanes of them, as faith and all other good graces, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes begetting, nouriſhing, relieuing them, as preaching, exhortation, Sacramentes, corrections, &amp;c. as they tende vnto this.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is diſpoſed in an axiome ſimple of the ſubiect and adioint, Father remit vs our debtes. Where is an allegorie of a Metaphor, the ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borowed of debtes, which is drawen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the obligation of workes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we were bounde to continue to doo all the lawe, vnleſſe we would bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed, Col. 2. 14. Gal. 3. 10. Nowe by remiſsion of ſinnes is meant, iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, peace of conſcience, ioye in the holy Ghoſt, deliuerance from the wrath to come, and all ſuch of that kinde, Rom. 5. And this petition is when wee are troubled, terrified in conſcience, and through dulnes haue not feelinge of theſe. This is confirmed by a reaſon drawen from compariſon of the leſſe, and is concluded in a Sillogiſme connexiue or knittinge, in the firſte kinde both partes being conteyned in one, the aſſumption in the propoſition. Seeing euen we forgiue our debters, which haue not a droppe of thy infinite mercie in vs, Doo thou much more forgiue vs: for ſo S. Luke ſheweth it ſhould be interpreted in expreſſe wordes, and I ſee not why it ſhould not ſo be tranſlated, for the greeke phraſe doth well beare it. So this is for our comfort, if wee feele this readines in vs, otherwiſe we can haue no aſſurance. Luke 11.</p>
            <p>
