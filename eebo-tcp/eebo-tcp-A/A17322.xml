            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

so poore, and simple meditations: that vnder the shadow of their fauourable acceptaunce they might finde some rest, and reliefe, and when I thought of your Hh. I set downe my rest, boldly presuming, yea fully assuring my self, that this small testimonie of dutie (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be) should be no lesse acceptable the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my selfe haue bene alwayes welcome vnto you, &amp; to your whole houshold. And indeede my good Lord, they doe belong vnto your Hh. in many respectes.</p>
            <p>First, in regard of those manifold fauours and honorable, kindnesses, which I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes (although vndeserued) founde at your Lordships hands. Secondly, when I was as a dry roote remoued, and vnlikely to finde a place to grow in, your Lordship did receiue me, and (vnder God) a was speciall meanes to preserue me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such stormes and tempestes as did then threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to annoy me. Further, by your Lordshippes good meanes a way was made, &amp; a place was prouided, that I might exercise my tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the gaine of the Church. At my departure, your Lordship also furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed me with bookes out of your Librarie, &amp; with other helpes, more then euer I looked for, or deserued: and in all these, your onely
<pb facs="tcp:18991:2"/>
care and desire was of my good, &amp; the good of Gods Church. Reason therfore requireth, that your Lordship should once in 2. yeares space take a tast, at the least, of some of that frute, which (through the blessing of God) the soile of your Lordships fauor &amp; kindnes, hath yeelded. But principally in regard of the matter it selfe, this treatise (If it be worthie of such a name) belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geth to both your Hh. and to your whole houshold, whose chief delight with your Hh. was alwayes (during my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in your Lordships house) in the holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises of religion &amp; pietie. And I doubt not but that your Hh. godly zeale, and Christian care that way is still as great as euer, if not much greater then euer it was.</p>
            <p>As for the matter subiect of this treatise (I meane the assurance of Gods fauor, and such things as belong vnto the same) I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it is so heauenly, and comfortable in it self, that nothing can be vnto your Hh. more deare and precious, then to be conuersant in the same: for I know you are already perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded therof, and sufficiently confirmed therin: yet as the Disciples said (when the Lord Iesus shewed what a happy thing it is to eate bread in the kingdome of heauen) <hi>Lord giue vs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore
<pb facs="tcp:18991:3"/>
of that bread</hi> (the very hearing therof did so please them.) Euen so your Hh. hauing heard, and felt in your soules, how blessed a thing it is to be assured of Gods fauor to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, you will say, let vs still heare of that matter. For all things sauing this, do in time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sume &amp; become tedious: but this is of that nature, that the more is spent of it, the more it increaseth, like the widowes oyle, and the longer it is fed vpon, the sweeter it is vnto the soules of the faithful, like the water which Christ turned into wine, that who so euer drinketh thereof, may say as his mother said, (when all seemed to be gone) <hi>Lord thou hast kept the better vntill now,</hi> and the best is yet to come. If it shall please your Hh. to vouchsafe the perusing herof, and to measure the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation therof vnto the glory of God, but by the liking and feeling of your own hearts, I haue what I desire, and my paines are more then sufficiently recompenced. Thus humbly crauing pardon for my boldnes, I commend both your Hh and it, to the gracious blessing of the most high.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Or your sakes in generall (beloued in the Lord Iesus) I haue aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to lay my selfe open in these my poore endeuours, to the view and censure of all the world. For your comfort, I first spake them, and for your profit I haue now penned them, that if any thing were at the first mistaken, and not well vnderstood, or since that, hath bene forgotten, and as yet is vnpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, you might now learne it better, remember it lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp; practise it euer, to your endles co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. But that which hath chiefly preuailed with me for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing hereof, is the earnest desire of many, and special entreatie of some poore Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, afflicted in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which came vnto me since, with their imperfect notes of their owne gathering, which I tooke as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pledges of some comfort already receaued, and argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of a holy desire to be further profited ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Whose Christian desire, and godly hunger I take in this case as a sufficient calling hereunto, neither do I yet see how I could well haue made them a deniall, without some preiudice to their soules, some aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the enemie, and some checke vnto my owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science. For the matter it selfe: I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse, it is of that Maiestie, and excellencie, that it requireth both large and deepe discourses, wherein many both learned &amp; godly haue not bene wanting. My care hath bene to be found and plaine, for the benefite especially of the

simpler sort. And as the woman in the Gospel thought her selfe happy if she might but touch the hem of Christes garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, so when I began to meditate vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the assurance of Gods loue, it seemed to be so excellent a point and so full of comfort, that I thought my selfe a happy man if I might but touch the points, &amp; borders thereof, seeing I could not attaine to the full ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dling therof. If any ignorant may be instructed in the truth, if any hereby may in time be conuerted to the loue of the truth, if any that is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerted, may by this meanes be confirmed in the truth, giue God the glory, and I hold my trauaile sufficiently reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pensed, neither shall it repent me to haue passed through good report, and bad report, through honor and dishonor, &amp; the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of all, so that any profite may redound to your soules, and all the glory may returne vnto God.

was. 2. How greatly he profited by it. But more particularly, he recordeth. 1. The bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed estate of such as did wisely consider of his distressed estate, verses. 1.2.3. 2.

               </gap>, for his enemies looked euery day for his death and destruction.</p>
            <p>And of those his enemies he nameth thrée sortes. The. 1. sort were flatterers, of whom he complaineth and saith that they would come to sée him, but <hi>they would speake lyes, horde vp wickednesse in their hart, as in a vessell, and when they could get fit oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie they would emptie it vpon him. vers.</hi> 6. The 2. sorte were malitious whisperers, which did nothing but priuily contriue his ouerthrow, of whom he complaineth in the 7. &amp; 8. verses thus. <hi>All that hate me whisper together against me, euen against me do they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imagine my hurt. A mischief is light vpon him, and he that is downe shall no more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise:</hi> The 3. sort were a more trecherous brood, who while they pretended kindnesse inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his subuersion, like <hi>Iudas,</hi> who couered his treason with a kisse. Of these traitero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

companions he complaineth in the 9. verse after this manner. <hi>Yea my familiar frend whom I trusted, which did eate of my bread, hath lifted vp the heele against me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore being thus beset with open enemies on one side, with flattering claw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backes on the other side, with whisperers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, &amp; traitors before his daunger must needes be great, and his case (in mans sight) very desperate.<note place="margin">4.</note> 4. He sheweth what meanes he vsed to preuent them all, and that was prayer to God, as appeareth in the 10. verse. <hi>Therefore O lord, raise me vp, so shall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But least Sathan might perswade him to doubt of Gods fauour towardes him in his affliction, as he would haue done with <hi>Iob</hi> in his temptation, and so make him either cold in prayer, or distrufull in prayer, that so he might also haue lost the fruite of his prayer, therefore in the 5. place,<note place="margin">5.</note> he proueth by two arguments y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all this notwithstanding, God doth still fauour him. The 1. is drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his enemies person in the 11. verse. The 2. is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the consideration of his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the 12. verse.<note place="margin">6.</note> Last of all, because God had geuen him such tokens of his loue, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18991:6"/>
he concludeth his Psalme with thankes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geuing vnto God in this sort, <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israell, world without end. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Psalme was left vnto the Church of God, &amp; doth teach vs. 1. To take héede how we do rashly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne those that be in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and affliction, and are beset with diuers sorts of enemies, but wisely to consider, and charitably to iudge of their cause, if we looke for the Lordes helpe when we are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selues, and not to measure Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour by outward prosperitie, nor his anger by outward aduersitie, as blind worldlings commonly vse to do. 2. That the vse of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to worke in vs repentaunce for our sinnes, &amp; to make vs flye to Gods mercy for succour, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did. 3. That Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> while they liue, shall liue in dau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of open enemies, of malitious whisperers, and false brethren, though they be as godly as <hi>Dauid</hi> was. 4. That if we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go to God by prayer, we shall preuent all our enemies, if they were as many as <hi>Dauids</hi> were. 5. That in our prayers we must be assured of Gods loue in Christ to vs ward, least otherwise we loose the fruite of our prayer. 6. That when God hath heard vs we must with hartie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

prayse vnto him for it as <hi>Dauid</hi> did. So much of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Psal. in generall, now to the text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By this I know. &amp;c.</hi> In this text we sée two things. 1. How <hi>Dauid</hi> assureth himselfe of Gods loue towardes him. 2. How thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full he is to God for assuring him of his loue. The .1. he doth by two arguments.

The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is taken from his owne estate, which was no whit hurt, or impaired, but bettered by them. In his thankesgiuing we may note two things. 1. To whom he giueth thankes, namely, to the Lord God of Israell. 2. In what manner he geueth thankes: with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of his speach, in toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his harty &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sent to that which he spake, &amp; as one afrayed that it was not wel inough, when it was at the best, he saith. <hi>So be it, euen so be it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

thus, shall not those sicke and diseased men of <hi>Bethesda</hi> rise vp in iudgement against vs? no doubt they shall.</p>
               <p>We thinke that whatsoeuer we want, yet we are sure that God doth loue vs, &amp; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make any reckoning of his loue tokens, but we may be deceiued. <hi>Dauid</hi> was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so sure, for sometime he thought that the Lord had forgotten him, sometime he thought that God had geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him ouer to him selfe, hereupon he cried out at one time,<note place="margin">

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was glad to take a loue token when it was offred him, for when he was not sure of Gods loue towardes him, he thought that God was angry with him, and that was of all things most terrible vnto him and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. So must we, if we wilbe sure that God is not angry with vs, we must be sure that he fauoureth vs.</p>
               <p>If Gods people must be sure of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour towards them in Christ, as <hi>Dauid</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, then we must not stand in doubt of it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18991:11"/>
as Papists do teach, we haue no reason so to do. For doth he call vs his sonnes, and we call him our father, that we should doubt of his loue? Doth he call vs his friends, his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, his spouse, his loue, his doue, and by all the names of loue, that we should doubt of his loue? Hath he kissed vs with so many kisses of his mouth? hath he sent vs so many pledges of his loue? hath he renewed his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant so often? hath he sealed it with the Sacraments, and bound it with an oth? and al this that we might doubt whether he doth loue vs or no? Thus you sée one point of poperie ready to soune at the hearing of this doctrine. If there be any Papist here that hath a mind to it, let him take it vp, &amp; make much of it, for Gods people (you sée) care not for it, they had rather know for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie that God doth fauour them, then to stand in doubt thereof.</p>
               <p>To loue God, and to be loued of God, is all that God requireth of vs, and all that we desire of God. For if we loue him, then we feare him, we worship him, we trust in him, we heare him, we obey him, &amp;c. If he loue vs, then he prouideth for vs all good things, and preserueth vs from all that may hurt vs, &amp;c.

Our loue to him hath marks, and so hath his to vs. God doth not loue vs and kéepe it from vs, but he maketh it knowen that he loueth vs, as <hi>Ionathan</hi> made his loue knowen to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and as the father of the prodigal child made his loue manifest to his sonne when his affection was towards him.</p>

For as a sure friend is not knowen but in time of néede: so Gods goodnesse and loue is neuer so well perceiued, as it is in helping of vs whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we cannot helpe our selues.

            <p>There hath bene a great controuersie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene the Papists and vs (euer since the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination of desolation stoode in the holy place) about this point. They (intending to iustifie them selues with the Lawyer in the Gospell) say, This haue we done, and that can we do, affirming that it is in the power of man (which is but dust and ashes) of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and by him selfe, to repent when he will, to beléeue when he will, to obey God when he will, and to vphold them selues in their integritie. And to make their matter good, they say, we haue the grace of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs, to obtaine the grace of God by our own power. Where you sée they speake flat contraries, if they had grace to sée it: for if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grace of God be giuen vs, then we haue it not of our selues: if we haue it of our selues, then is it not giuen vs of God. Againe if we be vpholden by the grace and fauor of God, then we vphold not our selues: if we haue this power of our selues, then not of God. Thus they speake contrary to them selues, and are deuided in their owne spéeches, like the kingdome of Sathan, which is deuided in it self that it cannot stand. And to speake the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18991:51"/>
truth, they speake confusedly they know not what, because Babell, that is confusion, is fallen vpon them, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those men which would presume by their owne endeuours without God to climbe vp into heauen.</p>
            <p>Now on the other side, we hold, that we can get nothing but by the helpe of God: and we admit no first grace, but if the grace of God be in vs, it is giuen vs of Gods spirit, not gotten of our owne power, and this we proue by the word of God. <hi>God worketh both the wil and the deede,</hi>

Aske <hi>S.

and that will tell vs, that if we stand by our selues, we shall fall, although we were as strong as <hi>Peter.</hi> Aske <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and he will tell vs that the heart is deceiptfull, &amp; wicked aboue all things: yea and though it be borne and bred, and brought vp with vs, and we haue daily familiarity therwith, yet we can not know it. Therefore, if none can know it, much lesse can any reforme it. He that knoweth it can reforme it, and doth reforme it, where it is reformed: but that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord which searcheth the heart, for so it followeth in the next verse,<note place="margin">

If they be good at any time, that is not of man, but of God. <hi>Moses</hi> him selfe being in prayer, must haue his hands holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp by <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> if <hi>Moses</hi> were not able of him selfe to hold vp his hands in prayer, much lesse was he able to hold vp his heart in prayer. What doth this teach vs, but this, that if we were as zealous as <hi>Moses,</hi> yet God must hold vs vp, or else we faint.</p>
            <p>There are but two things required of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one. The first is, to become holy. The
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18991:52"/>
second is, to continue holy, to conuert and turne into the wayes of God, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the waies of the Lord: now both these are of God, and not of our selues. Of the first the Prophet <hi>Ioell</hi> speaketh whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith,<note place="margin">

How farre &amp; how long had <hi>S. Paule</hi> walked in the way of persecuting the Christians, if the Lord had not stayed him by the way?

For if the Lord in mercy should not vphold vs, we might be théeues, or murtherers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any wickednesse as well as others.

The blind world is in another vaine, and their vaine is vaine indéede: for they thinke that honesty and pietie do go by wealth and authoritie, and not by the grace of God. And therefore when they grow to be wealthy in the world, or when they haue gotten authoritie into their hands, they begin to lift vp the head, &amp; to turne vp the snout in the wind, then they dispence with themselues to disgrace al that come before them, if they like them not: and to disdaine al their poore neighbours, be they neuer so godly, but themselues cannot chuse

but be honest, and godly, because they are rich, and in authoritie.</p>
            <p>But what if they chaunce to be taken in a trip, as the wiliest foxe is sometime taken in a snare? what if they be conuinced of falling, or slipping, or some notorious crime? what then? do they then flie to God? nothing lesse, but to their wealth, or friends, or authoritie, or some worldly deuise, &amp; thus they say in their hearts, Thou my money, or thou my countenance, or thou my wealth, or thou my friend in the Court, shalt vphold me: and so, many times through corruption, for friendship, and fauour, for a gift, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or a bribe, a bad man, and a bad cause are vpholden, which should be cast in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dust. But <hi>Achab</hi> shalbe slaine though he will not be known to be <hi>Achab,</hi> and <hi>Ieroboams</hi> wise shall be knowne though she disguiseth her selfe: for onely they shall stand vpright who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord vpholdeth, and none else, <hi>for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.</hi>

but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is neuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> richer for his gift.

For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first: it is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Lord to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth offer it, &amp; to none but the Lord. Papistes say, blessed be God, &amp; our Layd, blessed be God, &amp; such a sainct, &amp; such a sainct, for this &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: so doth not Gods child here, <hi>Ergo</hi> they are not Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in so doing.

God, either in his workes or in his worship.

            </p>
            <p>The doctrine that is to be gathered from this verse, ariseth two wayes, first from the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:18991:69"/>
matter subiect: secondly, from the forme of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> words. The matter subiect of the verse is <hi>Dauids</hi> thankesgiuing to the Lord, for that he had so many wayes sealed vp, and made sure his loue vnto his soule. From which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample we may gather this general doctrine, that after benefits receiued of God, it is our dutie, and our delight to returne thankes vnto the Lord, if Gods loue be swéete vnto vs. And this dutie can none performe aright but the elect children of God, which are led by Gods spirit, endued with Gods grace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Gods benefites, and inflamed with his loue. All of vs do begge and craue like lepers, but scarce one of ten do returne praises and thankesgiuing for our healing, as though Gods gifts were not worth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks. We are not so kinde to the Lord for all his benefites, as we are to a mortall man for one curtesie. Onely the faithfull being once throughly enlightened, and effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, are afraid to omit or neglect this dutie, and when they do faile therein, they are not a litle grieued thereat: and that they do, for Gods spirit is in them. Therefore as they pray by the spirit, so by the same spirite they praise God: alwayes knitting vp their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18991:70"/>
with thankesgiuing, for they must not be separated. <hi>Daniell</hi> prayed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10.</note> &amp; praised God thrée times a day on his knées: no doubt he did it oftener as occasion was offred, but this he bound him selfe vnto what businesse soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he had, because of his dulnesse: to teach vs what we must do. But how many deuour the graces of God one after another like a hogge vnder the trée, neuer looking vp to the trée from whence they come: as though all that God sendeth were nothing. Some are afraid to be acknowen who did them good, or gaue them goods,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iohn.</hi> 9.21.</note> like the blind mans father, who for feare of the Iewes durst not tel who gaue his sonne his sight. Some are ashamed like <hi>Sarah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.13.</note> who laughed at the Angels mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, when she should rather haue giuen thankes: &amp; this is because the wicked mocke the godly for praising of God, as the sonne of the bond woman mocked the sonne of the frée woman, and it is now become a reproch to speake any one word amongst many to the praise of God: whereof it commeth that the most part both at bed and boord do so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly forget to prayse the Lord, but like beasts they sit and lye down, and like beasts they rise vp againe. But litle may we do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18991:70"/>
if we cannot by prayer aske leaue of God to take his blessings, when we haue no right to any thing but in Christ, and litle may we do, if we cannot giue him thanks, &amp; acknowledge him to be the giuer. Thus like théeues we steale the Lords benefites and do nothing for them, as if we should boldly goe into our neighbours house, &amp; take our diner, and his plate, and go away, and neuer say, with your leaue, nor I thanke you: the Lord open our eyes, and touch our hearts. Some that would séeme to be a litle more manerly, will vtter, nay I may more truely say, smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out a few cold words of course, like gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sips &amp; protestants at large, when they meete one another, Here is a goodly weather God be praised, Oh you haue a swéete child neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, God blesse him, God be tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked of your vpsitting, or your comming abrode againe, and so foorth: but if any thing be added more then these common gratulations, whereby God may reape more glorie, that is a note of a Puritane, and he is too holy for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Some would giue God thankes ofte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then they do, but they cannot remember him without a picture, or a crucifixe, or some Popish relicke, like the Ioclatrous Iewes,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18991:71"/>
which could not remember God til they saw a calfe. As though the Lords dayly benefits were not sufficient remembrances &amp; liuely pictures of the Lords goodnesse, or as though when any doth bestow a benefite vpon vs by his sonne, we should not thanke his father because we neuer saw him, and we want his picture.</p>
            <p>Some will for fashion sake giue God a good word or two, and say perhaps, God is a good God, God be blessed, I thanke God for my deliuerance, &amp;c. but then they must run a long discourse of them selues, but if I had not done this and that, if I had not played y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man, &amp; had a good forecast, &amp;c. it had not gone so well with me as it did. Thus many deale with God, like him that when he hath tolde out his money to his creditor which he ought him, and taken vp his bond, snatcheth vp his money againe, and for an hundred pound gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him a penie and a boxe on the eare. But to leaue all these to the Lord, this is most certaine, if we be afrayd, or ashamed, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, or indifferent to praise the Lord: or if we be vnreuerent, or idolatrous, or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious in praising God, how can we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our selues to be the children of God?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:18991:71"/>But note further in this holy seruant of God, how he was qualified, and prepared, before he would, or before he could offer any sacrifice of praise acceptable to God. First he examineth his heart, and findeth his affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s holy, and vpright before the Lord, his heart frée from reuenge, his spirit humbled vnder the hand of God, his soule assured of Gods fauour, and his faith setled in his promises: this being done, he procéedeth and saith <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord God of Israell, &amp;c.</hi> assuring him selfe, that when his person is accepted with God, his praises &amp; thankesgiuing shall not be reiected. This is to teach vs, that they which come vnsanctified, and vnprepared by a liuely faith and true repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, and haue nothing to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend them vnto God but their pride, their hatred, their infidelitie, their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, and such like, they cannot prayse the Lord, and if they do, it is returned vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their heads as sinne: &amp; so they are sent away not onely emptie, but in worse case then they came, like the vnworthy guest that came to the Kings feast without his wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this doctrine runneth currant thorough the whole body of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, and no man doth aske from whence it
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18991:72"/>
commeth or whither it goeth, but euery one of the Lords Seers and seruants giueth te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie vnto it. The Psalmist is of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mind, for he saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Psal.</hi> 34.15 16</note> 
               <hi>The eyes of the Lord are vpon the righteous, and his eares are open to their crie, but the face of the Lord is against them that do euill, to cut off the remembrance of them from off the earth,</hi> to shew how little the Lord regardeth their prayers, or any thing that they can offer vnto his maiestie. <hi>Salomon</hi> is likewise of the same mind, for he saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 15.8.</note> 
               <hi>The sacrifice of the wicked is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Lord, but the prayer of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is acceptable vnto him.</hi> He sheweth a good reason why. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>the way of the wicked is abomination to the Lord, but he loueth them that followe righteousnesse.</hi> In another place he saith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Prou.</hi> 17.7</note> 
               <hi>High talke beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Thus we sée it manifest both by testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and examples that the sacrifices of the wicked &amp; vngodly are vile before the Lord, how holy soeuer they séeme to be amongest men, and they can not prayse him, but as the deuils did confesse him.

            <p>This doctrine, if it were throughly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and closely layd to the conscience of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery estate &amp; calling, it would I hope make vs all more warie, and carefull in offering our selues with our presents of prayses and prayers vnto the Lord while we liue.

            <p>Agayne, there are some called Parishe Clarkes, which without any manner of cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thereunto from God, doe intrude them selues into the Ministers office, onely for a litle filthie lucre sake, and most confusedly and disorderly tumble ouer the holy things of God, as the Lordes prayer, with diuers things, which I blush to name, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence forsooth of helping the Minister to say seruice: a thing which I neuer saw, but in this place. How acceptable the prayers, and seruice of such men are, or rather how dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable it is vnto God, I would they had grace to consider.</p>
            <p>What will hypocrites, and conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of the word preached, say to this? because they cannot chuse, they come to common prayer, which indéede is too much negelcted, but as for other excercises, of preaching, and Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising (of all, the most néedefull, &amp; most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

consider and sée in what manner and forme he praysed God.</p>
            <p>First let vs consider why he saith, not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, <hi>Blessed be the Lord,</hi> but <hi>blessed be the Lord God of Israel.</hi> In these wordes be two points to be obserued. First, the cause why God loued him. Secondly, the largenesse, and the greatnesse of Gods loue. But first, of the cause why God loued him, and why he did so assure him of his loue &amp; fauor. And that was not, I warrant you, any worthinesse that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord found in <hi>Dauid,</hi> nor for his frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds sake, nor for his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey sake, nor for his vertues sake, but onely for his couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sake, which the Lord made with his Church, wherof <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was a member, &amp; therefore must néedes haue his part amongest y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rest, because God had so promised. <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israell.</hi> As if he should say, I giue the Lord prayse, &amp; thankes, which hath chose<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Israel, to be his people, which were not his peeple, and hath bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d him self, by promise to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God of Israel, &amp; to watch ouer his people, &amp; to assure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his fauor, which deserued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>thing but his wrath &amp; displeasure, for by this meanes I am now assured of his loue, and fauor to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, which I should neuer haue had if
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:18991:78"/>
the Lord had not chosen me to be one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he meant to bestow his loue, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his gracious promise, which he made to my fathers <hi>Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Isaac,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob</hi> (which was afterwardes called Israell:) and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his promise which he made, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, but also to all their séede, that is to all the faithful, so hath he delt with his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunts, blessed &amp; praysed be his name for it.</p>
            <p>Now we sée the fountaine from whence springeth all the good that we haue, blessed is Israell, because the Lord is their God, and blessed is England, because the Lord is our God. By this we may sée what an excellent thing it is to be of the Church of God, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Lord <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the Lord almightie, is our God, and we are his people, and if he be on our side, who can be against vs? or if any be against vs, who ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preuaile against vs? then are we in safetie from our enemies, then are we vpholden in our integritie, and prouided for according to our wants. So that the Lord doth not saue vs, nor helpe vs because we deserue it, but because he hath so promised in Christ Iesus, neither doth he chuse vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saw some goodnesse in vs, but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is his goodnes, &amp; grace bestowed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs,

            <p>The second thing that I obserue in these wordes is the large exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods loue. For, therfore doth the Prophet call him the Lord God of Israell, to shew y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> God is not a God of one onely, but of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faithfull to the end of the world. He was not onely <hi>Dauids</hi> God, but he is our God also, or els perhaps, some
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18991:81"/>
might say, Oh <hi>Dauid</hi> was an excellent man, and a man after Gods owne hart, and God did assist him wonderfully. But God is the same God to vs, that he was to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and will assist vs as mightely as he did <hi>Dauid,</hi> if we call vpon him as <hi>Dauid</hi> did. Yea to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of vs he is the same, for God is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter of persons, not the Iewes more then the Gentils, the wall of separation being pulled downe,<note place="margin">

            <p>Now are we to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider of the next words,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18991:81"/>
why he saith, <hi>world without end.</hi> He doth not praise God so long as the benefit of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance lasteth, and no longer, but so long as his mercy endureth, and that is for euer: for it hath pleased the Lord to chuse vnto him selfe a Church and a kingdome, out of Angels and men, which neuer shall haue end, and those shall praise him continually, as well for his iudgements as for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.

which the vnderstanding is ignorant of, and therfore the hart cannot affect, our sacrifices are but a mockerie against God, because the Parliament house is deuided, &amp; there is but a mutinie betwéene the hart, the toung, and the rest, but if all agrée vpon the point, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the toung sheweth the consent of the hart, and boldly without feare of any whatsoeuer sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>But why doth he double his speech &amp; say <hi>So be it, euen So be it?</hi> it should séeme that the speaker of the Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t house, is but a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple man, &amp; wanted matter, he meant well it may be, but for want of matter he is faine to harpe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one string much. Surely beloued, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet spake as he was moued by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy Ghost, &amp; this is Gods wisedome, therfore let vs not finde fault withall, this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plaine, &amp; simple dealing of a faithful soule indéede. It is vsuall in the Scripture to haue one thing oftentimes vrged in teaching, &amp; no oftener then is néedefull: because, first it is long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can learne Gods will, secondly it is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger before we can reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber Gods wil, but principally, because it is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gest of all before we can make a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science to obey Gods wil: therfore let no man in hearing one thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18991:86"/>
be wearie, because euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may learne the same thing better: do not say, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher wants matter, but say rather that we want grace, or vnderstanding, or memorie, or zeale, or loue, or something. Againe, let no man in teaching stand so much vpon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as to compte it a disgrace vnto him if he doth often repeate one thing being ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, for we sée it is Gods wisedome to teach so, &amp; if any man wilbe wiser the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods spirite, he will proue him selfe a foole. In prayer also the same spirit hath taught Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to speake one thing ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times, partly because there is in euery one great dulnes &amp; want of féeling, &amp; partly to note how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest they are &amp; desirous to obtaine y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, which they pray for. So doth <hi>Dauid</hi> here in this place say <hi>So be it, euen so be it,</hi> as though his hart had bene scarce awake at the first. A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that would faine haue a thing, which he née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth indeede, will say (being asked if he will haue it) oh yea, yea, yea, &amp; if it be a thing that he cannot away withall he will say, oh no, no, no, often together, as if he could not deny it too often, as the first could not desire it too much. This may the Church do, if their harts be touched with their owne wants &amp; weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses.

For many times in our prayers our mindes are crossed with one thing or other, so that God hath not the hart, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it againe, <hi>Hart</hi> what sayest thou? then <hi>So be it, euen so be it.</hi> Some thinke a cold word, vnreuerently blustred out, to be good inough for God, and are ashamed to amend any thing if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, and afrayde to stand to a thing if it be well.
