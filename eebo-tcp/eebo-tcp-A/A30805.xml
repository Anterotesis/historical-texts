            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe improvement of Arts and Sciences is the great deſign oſ all induſtrious Men. I have therefore in imitation of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:40830:6"/>
ſuch bin at pains, and coſt too in making ſome uſeful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments within my own Sphere of Phyſick, of which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent I ſhall only diſcourſe of one, <hi>viz.</hi> The making of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Mineral Waters equal to, if not exceeding, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, as to their Medicinal qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities. For I have ſo ſtrictly examin'd with what Minerals, Marcaſites and Nitrous Glebes the healing Fountains are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, to make 'em ſuch; that by preparing, purifying and exalting their Medicinal Virtues, I ſhall be able not only to imitate Nature, but herein excel; by defecating and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling thoſe groſs Terreſtrial
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:40830:6"/>
parts, and often unwholſome, that are commixt with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals: from which to extricate the benign and uſeful parts, great diligence and curioſity is requiſite.</p>
               <p>This boaſt I hope may be very well allow'd within the bounds of Modeſty, ſince I have brought my undertakings to Perfection.</p>
               <p>And ſince things Natural (eſpecially as to the <hi>Materia Medica)</hi> are greatly improv'd, in regard to their uſefulneſs, by Learning and Induſtry, why may not this Mineral Preparation, among the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable ſtore of others, be allow'd to challenge the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit it deſerves. It has pleas'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40830:7"/>
God, for our imployment, to make thoſe things that Miniſter Food and Phyſick, capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement by us, and our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Induſtry in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration neceſſary e're we can receive due Benefit and Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from 'em: whenas in thoſe only which ſerve for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and Pleaſure, as rich Fruits and Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He has ſhown his infinite skill and excellence; which when we tamper with we only damage. So that no Artiſt is ſo vain and impious to vye with Nature, but only pleas'd when he can diligently and curiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form that Labour and Culture aſſign'd him by his Maker.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40830:7"/>
But I muſt not digreſs; how high therefore this way of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick is in vogue, or like to be, ſhall not be ſo much my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to recount, as to make the uſefulneſs and conveniency of it appear. For if perſons can with little expence and trouble be prevail'd upon to make a harmleſs trial of thoſe things that are productive of great good, ſuch inſinuations are no ways culpable.</p>
               <p>'Tis obvious how many periſh for want of timely care, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſlenderer indiſpoſitions (which might ſoon be remov'd) to run to ſome high Diſtemper, and that too often ſuffer'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to have miſchiev'd the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40830:8"/>
e're they will look out for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: being deterr'd from the uſe of means, either becauſe the methods are harſh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing, or becauſe they are Expenſive and too Chargeable; none of which our Medicinal Waters can be taxed with.</p>
               <p>The Theoretick part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick being of late ſo richly adorn'd with accurate Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Diſſections and a refin'd Philoſophy; I conceive it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe requiſite that the Practice ſhould bear ſome proportion to it, otherwiſe the Ornament of Languages, and all other Embelliſhments, are but gilded nothings to the great Art of preſerving and reſtoring a ſound
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40830:8"/>
and healthy Conſtitution. For to live long and in health, as 'tis the beſt thing belonging to this World, ſo 'tis moſt deſir'd, tho' the methods conducing thereto are much neglected, 'tis not only furniſh'd with delights in it ſelf, but it gives a guſt to all others; for without it all their Excellencies are impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible. But this is a Bleſſing moſt reliſh'd and beſt valu'd by thoſe who ſometimes are without it.</p>
               <p>'Tis a great misfortune of Humane Nature not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern wherein her happineſs and delights conſiſt, which often are nearer her than ſhe's aware of; and the farther ſhe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in purſuit of 'em, ſhe's at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40830:9"/>
the greater loſs. For the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to be taken for a happy life are not ſo difficult, nor to be ſo far fetcht, as are by moſt imagin'd. But it being my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs chiefly to direct to that part which conduces to preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and reſtoring a healthy Body, I ſhall only concern my ſelf in what tends thereto.</p>
               <p>How nice and delicate a thing it is to keep the Body in a juſt and due mixture of Principles, and to recover thoſe decaying, is not ſoon apprehended. For the ſubtile vital Breath, or the volatile inviſible Spirit of man's Body, deſervedly nam'd Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, nouriſheth, feedeth and preſerveth himſelf by the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40830:9"/>
Oleity of Man's Suphur, which is predominant in the Blood; beſides theſe there is a Salt lying in the Juices, Fleſh and Bones; this miniſters its nobleſt part for nouriſhment to the Blood, and preſerveth man's Body from putrefaction, and is that <hi>Vinculum</hi> whereby the other two are kept and dwell together. For in the Salt there lyeth a Spirit which protects and preſerves the Balſoms in their worth and purity, it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth all the reſt, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible, unleſs it dye quite: for the Air which ſupports the Spirits with its Vital Breath, does carry in it a nitrous Spirit, which tempers the whole nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40830:10"/>
and prevents the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly diſorders of the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſta. Thus is preſerv'd and kept a due temperament of Principles <hi>ad juſtitiam,</hi> which is the great skill of a Phyſician.</p>
               <p>But leſt I make too large a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, deſigning at preſent to diſcourſe only of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſes of Medicinal Waters, and of my imitation of the Ultramarine Spaws; I ſhall ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now ſay ſomewhat of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in general and its uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

But if we examine its Nature, we
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40830:11"/>
ſhall find it conſiſt of thoſe qualities which denote its Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity, as clearneſs, thinneſs, lightneſs, ſoftneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cool, moiſten, attenuate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh, allay Thirſt, and are a pabulum or recruit to fretted Spirits, and a proper Liquor to convey and diſtribute other Aliments.

beſt and moſt wholſome which is void of taſte or odour, and is clear, pure, moſt light, ſoon heated, ſoon cold, and in which Fleſh is ſooneſt Boil'd. The living Spring I judge moſt valuable for Drinking, and that neareſt the head of it the beſt. For thoſe living Principles which actuate all Bodies, and keep 'em not only from putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, but qualifie 'em for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits and ſuſtenance to other Bodies, are in proportion in Waters, which denotes 'em of ſuch and ſuch a ſtrength and purity, and may be us'd in quantities accordingly. And 'tis no ſmall advantage that they are capable of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40830:12"/>
in ſuch large quantities, without fuming or diſturbing the Brain, to irrigate and ſoften the whole Body, and bedew the fiery Spirits with their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Vapours: And when thoſe Airy brisk Particles do extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves from theſe ſoft lodgments, they are again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with more to prevent their leaping out, or firing one againſt another: and ſuch a pretty buſtle or ferment in Nature raiſes that general efflo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſcence and vigour, which plumps, exhilerates, and makes gay a well-temper'd healthy Body. The diſpencing either of Food or Phyſick, in a clear, thin, ſoft and gentle Vehicle,

muſt make a better digeſtion, and a more equal diſtribution of it; then in a fiery Chariot, which precipitates Nature, and hurries the crude parts thro' thoſe ſtrait and ſlender paſſages beyond their Natural Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and lodges 'em where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature can expel 'em, nor Art reach 'em. Whenas the milder Liquors make ſuch eaſie gradations, that Nature can ſecern by her peculiar cleanſing ducts thoſe Feces and Crudities, which timely and orderly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd, prevent innumerable Obſtructions and Diſeaſes to the Body.</p>

               <p>But to ſhew how excellent a Vehicle Water is for the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of generous and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Medicines, is no difficult task, if its Nature be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as is before mention'd: for by ſearching out the minuteſt paſſages of the Body, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes a general diſpenſation of the deſign'd matter to all parts of it. And I am of the opinion that fine Chymical Medicines ſhould be deliver'd to Bodies in ſoft gentle Vehicles, but by no means in their own Terreſtrial Bodies; for they are ſo fitted
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40830:13"/>
there in their poſition, that our Bodies are not able to extricate the benign uſeful parts from the intricate meatus's of a tough Mineral, and raiſe its living principles from their domicils ſo ſtiffly munited and ſecur'd. Yet when by great Art and Labour theſe are got out and defecated, they are beneficially deliver'd in another Body, where they can't ſo ſoon ſhape a retirement: and if in thin light cooling Liquors, Nature can with eaſe gradually fetch out their help and refreſhment; whenas thoſe too hot fiercely aſſault Nature, and admit not of quantity enough for their equal diſtribution.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Mineral Waters.</head>
               <p>IN the Mineral Kingdom thro' which the Veins of Water glide, are amas't mighty Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, from whence may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted greater relief for the neceſſities of Mankind than is by moſt imagin'd.</p>
               <p>But to come near my purpoſe, excellent Medicines by the due managementof Fire, have bin obtain'd from ſeveral Minerals and Semi-minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to come yet nearer (by playing the Hydrotomiſt) the great account of Mineral Waters may be diſplay'd, which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40830:14"/>
beſides their own Nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Medicinal qualities from Subterranean Mines.</p>
               <p>It may be conſider'd that few Mineral Waters are ſimple, I mean impregnated only with one Mineral, but compounded as the Minerals and Marcaſites lye confus'd in the Bowels of the Earth; and thoſe who have bin curious to ſearch into the Nature of Medicinal Springs, have always diſcover'd a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Minerals; tho' perhaps ſome of 'em have not bin ſo lucky as to aſſign their virtues to the proper Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the Mineral Kingdom I place Salt, Nitre, Vitriol, Allom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for in the Salts of many Bodies
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40830:15"/>
Iye their chief Virtues, either for Purging by Stool or Urine, or for cleanſing, cooling, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſtimulating, opening of Obſtructions, attenuating of groſs humours, or aſtriction, corroboration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the Nature of the Body. The Learned <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith, (p. 55.) <hi>Semina ſalium cuncta in aquis ſita ſunt, attamen nondum ſaporem induerunt niſi corporum principia conſentanea uteroſ<expan>
                        <am>

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> terrae debitos repererunt, &amp;c. (viz.)</hi> That all the Seeds of Salts are plac'd in Water, yet are not endued with taſte, unleſs they find a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Principles of Bodies, and ſuitable Matrices of the Earth; then, and not till then,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40830:15"/>
they manifeſt their Saltneſs, and become determined in a Saline Body; in one place into Allom, in another Salmarine, in a third in Nitre, &amp;c. To which he adds, <hi>Quocirca notandum, Sal quoddam exiſtere Hermaphroditicum metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorum quod defectu nominis eſuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſive acetoſum re &amp; nomine vocari capit, generale equidem &amp; ad omnia metalla accommodabile,</hi> (viz.) That there is a certain Hermaphroditical Salt of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, which for want of another name is call'd an Eſurine or Acid Salt, which is a general ſort of Salt, and accommodated to all Metals. So that this Eſurine Salt, while ſuch, is no more than Salt, and not a Vitriol: but if
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40830:16"/>
it become a Vitriol, it muſt eſpouſe a Mineral or Metalline Body. He farther ſaith, <hi>Vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum praeſtantiſſimum naturaliter ereſcit fodinis, quibus natura iſtud Sal Eſurinum peperit, venam eris feracem, corrodens, &amp; fontis la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentis liquore diſſolutum;</hi> (viz.) That the beſt Vitriol is moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally brought forth in thoſe Mines where Nature hath begot that Eſurine Salt, corroding a ſtrong Vein of Copper, becomes diſſolv'd in the gliding Current of a Spring. But ſhould I here inlarge in an account of Nitre, Vitriol, Allom, Bitumen, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhould exceed my preſent intention, and prevent a future deſign. Yet I think it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40830:16"/>
neceſſary to my preſent buſineſs to ſay thus much of Nitre and Vitriol. The Eſurine Salt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd in the Air, if it meet with a fat unctuous Glebe, and be preſerved from Rain and Sun, that it ſpend not its ſtrength in the production of Vegetables, breeds great ſtore of Nitre: for 'tis obſerv'd that in theſe fat Earths there is at firſt no Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous taſte; neither can any Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre be extracted from 'em; but after their continuance a while in the cool Air, its magnetick power from a Nitrous Principle, opens the unctuous Body of the Fat Glebe, a fit receptacle for the Eſurine Spirit, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with coagulated and envellop't,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40830:17"/>
and after this manner is the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of Nitre.</p>
               <p>'Tis commonly obſerved, that in Cold Weather the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is more keen, and the Thirſt little, which proceeds from the great ſtore of Nitre that is in the Air.</p>
               <p>Vitriol I take to be an Eſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Acid Salt corroding the Sulphureous parts of Metals or Marcaſites by an Acid ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Spirit (whereof there is great quantity in ſome Mines) corroding the Veins of Iron, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from whence are the varieties of Vitriol. Sometimes from a Vitriol Loam or Clay diluted with Water, and ſet in a cold Cellar, may
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40830:17"/>
be gather'd an alluminous effloreſcence, which ſhews there may be a mixture of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom with Vitriol: But the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences or varieties of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnations, ariſe either from the difference of the quantity of the Acid Spirit corroding the Veins of Copper or Iron, or from the greater or leſſer continuance of the courſe of the Water thro' thoſe Metallick Veins.</p>
               <p>It need not ſeem ſtrange to any that there is ſuch Acidity in Water and Air: from whence elſe doth Iron and Copper being put into Water, or ſtanding long in the Air in a cold Cellar, contract ſuch a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40830:18"/>
Ruſt as they do? Is it not from the Acid Spirit of Air and Water uniting with the Eſurine Salt in thoſe Metals exciting its corroſive power to deſtroy the Texture of the Metal? And this Ruſt being Boil'd in Rain-water, will yield a Vitriol.</p>
               <p>There are many ways of of making Artificial Vitriols: but I ſhall paſs beyond my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention if I now diſcourſe of 'em.</p>
               <p>'Tis obvious what Beds of Minerals lye in the Bowels of the Earth, on which the Currents of Waters waſh in their circulating Veins, from which they are impregnated
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40830:18"/>
with their Medicinal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>But before I diſmiſs this Chapter, I think fit to add this, that there is a univerſal common Salt of Nature, the firſt Ens of Salts which is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificated according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives various forms.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> the Original Founder of all Beings, hath implanted in the Superficies of the Earth that great variety of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Seeds, which propagate themſelves in their Species: So that every Vegetable at its proper ſeaſon, by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavenly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſetting at work its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40830:19"/>
by ſtirring up its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power, begins to ſhape it ſelf a Body according to the Laws of Creation; Every Plant in its kind; till they have made up that wonderful variety which ſo richly adorns the Earth.</p>
               <p>In like manner are diſpers'd the Mineral and Metalline Seeds in the Bowels of the Earth, determin'd for ſpecification, and to become prolifick by the embryonate Sulphur ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purity or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of the Terreſtrial Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix: And thus the Metallick Order is compleated by the perfected Metals, while the imperfect and middle Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40830:19"/>
arrive but ſlowly to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talization.</p>
               <p>Now when Water impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with a Spirit, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour from the accenſed Body of Sulphur, paſſeth through a ſalſuginous Glebe, already endow'd with the common Salt of Nature, it produceth Salt, when through Nitrous Veins, Nitre; when through Alluminous, Allom; when through a Copperas, White Vitriol; when through a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Mine, Blew Vitriol; and when through an Ironiſh Glebe it ſhares of ſome particles of Iron, and produceth Green Vitriol, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But theſe are more or leſs, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40830:20"/>
of the Waters Acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the Fertility of the Veins through which they paſs. So that Waters ting'd with this Acid Spirit, become a proper Menſtruum for the opening of the Ramenta, and Extraction of the excellent qualities of Minerals and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites. But to demonſtrate the Artificial performance of this, is the buſineſs of the next Chapter.</p>

               <p>A Phyſician muſt learn to Anatomize all things in Nature, as well as Humane Body, to know what they contain within and without, to ſeparate the Poyſon from the Medicinal quality: he muſt know how to diſſolve, ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, exalt and prepare fully Metals, Minerals, Vegetables and Animals: for Receipts found in other Mens Writings, cannot ſufficiently inſtruct a Man to the Practice or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:40830:21"/>
The Field of Nature is very large, 'tis round and endleſs, affords room enough for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry induſtrious Man, ſo wiſely has the great Creator contriv'd us all imployment, that none need envy or aſſault anothers labours, but may go out and provide for himſelf; and did he know the Treaſures that lye undiſcover'd, 'twould make him of a buſie mind.</p>
               <p>Minerals as they yield the nobleſt and choiceſt Medicines, ſo they are of greater difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and require greater skill in their preparation than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vegetables or Animals. I have therefore (out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of uſeful rarities) apply'd
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40830:21"/>
my ſelf of late to hard labour in the Mines; from whence I hope to produce great benefit to others, and a little to my ſelf, which ſhall ſuffice.</p>
               <p>And having now exactly compleated by the neceſſary Laws of Alchymy my Mineral healing Waters, I judge it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Empirical, covetuous, or any ways baſe to permit 'em (on ſuch eaſie terms as I do, for general good) to break up like a publick Fountain, to which every one may reſort: Yet I do not impoſe 'em on any, let 'em fare according to the ſucceſs they obtain.</p>
               <p>I have made 'em exactly reſembling the Ultramarine
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40830:22"/>
Spaws; by ſelecting thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and Marcaſites which give 'em their excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal qualities; and I think the Artificial Preparation of 'em in ſelecting the uſeful parts, and rejecting thoſe more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome with the dregs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be of great advantage to the rendring theſe Waters more effectual and certain in their Operation, than the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
               <p>For inſtance in Antimony, how churliſh and unſafe is it, if given without any Artificial Preparation: but if diſſected, ſeparated, defecated, and by the rules of Alchymy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, what uſeful, ſafe,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40830:22"/>
and noble Medicines does it yield?</p>
               <p>There is as great reaſon to except againſt White Bread, becauſe 'tis the Flowers of the Wheat ſeparated from the groſſer matter of the Corn, and by the Baker's skill made Chymical Bread; as there is againſt Medicinal Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, becauſe diſcharg'd of their feces and uſeleſs or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parts.</p>
               <p>If then the Natural Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Waters receive their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from Minerals and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſites unprepar'd, only by waſhing on 'em as they paſs through the Caverns and Veins of the Earth, and are eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40830:23"/>
of ſo great uſe: of how much more certainty then in their operation and uſefulneſs muſt the Artificial Waters be, which have their Minerals purg'd and cleans'd from all their foul and noxious parts, and thoſe that are Medicinal exalted and made ripe for the ſervice of Nature.</p>
               <p>There is much in the World yet to be diſcover'd, which time and induſtry may bring to light.</p>
               <p>The Circulation of the Blood, how long lay that hid from Wiſe Men and great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, though thoſe Streams were always flowing about 'em; which when diſcover'd,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40830:23"/>
it ſeem'd ſtrange they could be ſo long ignorant.</p>
               <p>The late great improvement of making Salt Water Freſh, brought to that perfection that it ſerves all the intentions of Natural ſweet Fountains, has greatly encouraged me in the proſecution of this deſign, which is brought too to that perfection, that it bears all the teſts of thoſe Natural Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Waters it imitates, as the <hi>German</hi> Spaw, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and its operations are of greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and more manageable.</p>
               <p>For our Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſelected from all other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unwholſome, or not ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Medicinal intention,

               <p>And the advantages of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 'em daily made freſh are not inconſiderable, nor the conveniencies of contracting the entire Medicinal Doſe to what quantity of Water or other Vehicle you pleaſe, by the help of our Tincture; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many more, which 'tis not neceſſary to enumerate.</p>

               <p>I Think it not requiſite to give an entire account of all the Virtues of thoſe Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, Marcaſites and Nitrous Glebes, with which duly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd, our Waters are impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated: For 'twould make too early a diſcovery of my Art, ſince it required ſo much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and coſt to compleat it.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, becauſe I would give a rational account of all my undertakings; I'le ſay thus
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40830:25"/>
much further with the Learned <hi>Kircher, Baſis unica &amp; abſoluta origo omnium Aciditatum Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralium eſt a Spiritu Sulphuris Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> 'Tis apparent that there is a Spirit of Sulphur in Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Glebes, from the Acid taſte in Minerals.</p>
               <p>Our Waters having a Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oline Ironiſh Taſte and Odour, which appears from their ſharp and piercing pungency ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what harſh, ſhews they are Acuated with a Sulphureous Acidity from the Embryonate Sulphur of the Minerals and Marcaſites.</p>
               <p>But more plainly, I have carefully prepar'd my Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum, that by the gentle
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40830:25"/>
heat of a digeſter, I ſo open the Bodies of my Minerals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that I can with no leſs pleaſure than labour extricate their Volatile Salubrious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, from their groſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome Mixtures; and as eaſily preſerve and convey 'em to the deſign'd Vehicle.</p>
               <p>I give this account, becauſe I can in Glaſs Veſſels Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically Luted, ſublime all the Medicinal Particles from their Water, which ſhews their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and aptneſs for the ſervice of Nature.</p>
               <p>Whenas if you deal with the Natural Mineral Waters which ſoon evaporate their ſtrength and good qualities,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40830:26"/>
eſpecially if kept a while from their living Springs, you may precipitate a Vitrioline Ironiſh Ruſt, like Powder, but apt to ſement and petrifie, which taken altogether into the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is there precipitated, and by large quantities of potu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent matter diſtributed into the remote parts of the Body, and becomes fit Minera or Seedlings both for Stone and Gout.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>materies morbifica</hi> of both is one and the ſame, the difference only is in the ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: though I know Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick and Scorbutick pains are often ignorantly call'd Arthritick Symptomes: And
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40830:26"/>
ſuch who are afflicted with ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, and take theſe Mineral Waters not cleans'd from that ſediment, which I can ſeparate from 'em, in all probability miniſter much more Fewel than relief to their Diſtempers: And though they may by large draughts waſh away ſome Sand and Gravel, and now and then expel ſome Stones; yet the queſtion is, whether they don't lodge as much or more of this matter in the Body, as they thus drive through; which if, what Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement is it thus to be employ'd?</p>
               <p>I'me ſure I know by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience what hard labour
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40830:27"/>
preambles to the Birth of a Stone.</p>
               <p>But to return, our Artificial Waters are ſo finely prepar'd, that they afford no ſediment: yet they anſwer all the teſts and intentions of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Spaw, they tinge of a pale Clarret Colour, and a deep Purple with a little ſcrapings of Gall, and diſcolour the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they cleanſe, cool, dry, ſtimulate, open obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, diſſolve and attenuate groſs humours; and are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſive of Viſcous, Tartarous, and other Humours in the Stomack, Meſenteries, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondries, Reins, Womb, Bladder, and evacuate them
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40830:27"/>
ſometimes by Stool, largely by Urine, and other diſchargers of Nature.</p>
               <p>They create a great Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, when the Stomack's cleans'd, by recovering and ſtrengthening her tone: the like they do by the Womb, which muſt be of great uſe to ſuch who are ſubject to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages, weakneſs in thoſe parts, and are unapt to breed.</p>
               <p>But becauſe I think not fit here to particularize, I'le once for all ſay, They are of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent uſe for Ladies in all their diſtinguiſhing circumſtances from Men: But not to be us'd by thoſe with Child, unleſs by the Advice of their Phyſician:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40830:28"/>
And if further direction be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for any, 'tis fit they ſhould have recourſe to their own Phyſician.</p>
               <p>And here in a Parentheſis, let me ſay, 'tis requiſite to the health and happineſs of every perſon to have recourſe to a Spiritual and a Phyſical Guide, and that in times of Health, to preſerve, and provide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe Evils, which the height of a Diſtemper, and the hour of Death, make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable for any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſtration. <hi>Principiis obſta,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe Waters are powerful in all Cachectical and obſtinate Diſeaſes: like an Alkali they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40830:28"/>
imbibe the Acidity and Sowre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Blood, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently dulcifie the ſame: for by a Naturul Propenſity uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (magnetically) with the Eſurine Salt, they are ejected together with the obſtructive humours, by a ſtrong irritati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Nature (from theſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) to expel 'em.</p>
               <p>And from their Diuretick Nature, after they have atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated, cut, reſolv'd, and ſo alter'd the Mucous and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarous Humours of the Body, and prepar'd 'em for Excreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they then carry them off by Urine, which is the moſt ſafe and effectual conveyance (for all ſharp and ſaline Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40830:29"/>
eſpecially) of all other ſorts of Evacuation whatever.</p>
               <p>This Water thus enrich'd by my Tincture or Eſſence, ſearches ſuch latent paſſages and abſtruſe retirements of the Bowels and other parts, as other Medicines cannot reach, and after a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery made, doth not only diſpoſſeſs what is preternatural of its uſurped power, but alſo by corroborating and re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing Nature, ſo firmly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titles her to her former right of inheritance, that ſcarce any thing but an act of Hoſtility or Old Age can cut off the Intail.</p>

                  <p>Directions to be obſerv'd before, in, and after the taking our Waters.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO them who intend the uſe of theſe Waters for the removing of any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Diſtemper, I adviſe that they prepare their Bodies with ſome gentle Vomit or Purge, which ſhall be thought moſt proper by their Phyſician.</p>
               <p>To thoſe who carefully keep their Bodies from any glut of humours, and deſign only to take 'em for pleaſure, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſlighter indiſpoſitions;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40830:32"/>
to dilute and temper the Blood and preſerve it from decay or putrefaction in any meaſure, or to create a good Stomach, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I adviſe but a ſlighter preparation, (and that only before the firſt taking of 'em) by a few Stomach-Pills to clear the firſt paſſages, or by ſome gentle purging Tablets, which will finely prepare the Body, eating a few early in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before you drink the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
               <p>But I leave every one to have recourſe to their own Phyſician for ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p>What I have furniſhed my ſelf with requiſite to be given before and with the Waters,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40830:32"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall keep at home for ſuch who reſort to me: For I would willing avoid all offence, not coveting any mans em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
               <p>And thus I hope I ſhall eaſily demonſtrate my care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Obloquie, and ſatisfie any one I deſign not to Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polize.</p>
               <p>If prejudice prevent not, theſe Waters may be preſcrib'd by Phyſicians in Method to their Patients as well as the Natural Medicinal Springs; and by their Skill may be made in every reſpect a capable and uſeful Vehicle for the diſtributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch generous and noble Medicines as our Art directs.</p>

The Waters are of excellent uſe, and ſerve many intentions taken alone from one Quart to two, or three at moſt.</p>
               <p>And the rules to be obſerv'd in the taking of 'em are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to other Mineral Waters, and ſo generally known, that almoſt every one can prevent me in thoſe few and eaſie Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections that are requiſite.</p>
               <p>They are to be taken in the Morning Faſting (unleſs a few Tablets, or ſome ſuch ſlight Phyſical thing preamble) not when the Body is heated with exerciſe.</p>
               <p>They are not to be drank too quick, nor too ſlow: but convenient diſtances are to be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40830:34"/>
allotted, as once in half an hour a Pint, or leſs, as your Stomach can bear 'em, and rid 'em, till you have taken the quantity you deſign; After you have taken two or three Draughts 'tis beſt to uſe ſome gentle exerciſe <hi>ad ruborem</hi> only, not <hi>ad ſudorem,</hi> till you be pretty warm, but not ſweat.</p>
               <p>Whilſt you walk or ride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you may eat Orange-chips, Citron-peals, Carraway Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, Elicampane Roots Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if you are advis'd that it be convenient to paſs any of theſe Waters by Stool, the Purging Tablets taken with 'em will finely aſſiſt, and ſerve
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40830:35"/>
very well in the room of the Confectionary, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on Medicinal accounts.</p>
               <p>'Tis not fit to Dine till the Waters are paſſed, and half an hour before Dinner a Glaſs of Rheniſh, White-Wine or Clar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret I think not amiſs.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not here preſcribe the quality of your Diet; Every one knows that Mutton, Veal, Lamb, Chickins, Rabbits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are good Fare.</p>
               <p>My care is to caution you as to quantity, and that the rather, becauſe theſe Waters rightly us'd, give a great Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p>'Tis better both to Dine and Sup moderately, whilſt in this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40830:35"/>
Method, than to overcharge at once.</p>
               <p>Temperance prevents and helps to cure many Diſeaſes. He that deſires to eat much, muſt eat little; for by eating little at a time, he lives long and ſo makes it up.</p>
               <p>All intemperance in Drink ſhould at all times be avoided, But exceſs in this Method may be of danger: Nevertheleſs I commend a little good Wine, or Beer and Ale with diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſpecially an hour or two before you go to Bed.</p>
               <p>And here I think it kind to inſert this Note, That the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutive Cup, or Evenings draught ſo much in uſe, is generally
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40830:36"/>
taken too late: for to fill the Body with Liquor and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Bed, cauſes many Diſeaſes. 'Tis fit it ſhould as to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part be paſſed firſt, which would prevent Gravel, Stone, Gouts, Dropſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who take Drops, Powders, and ſeveral Phyſical Preparations in theſe Waters, or in Method with 'em, are to obſerve ſtricter rules than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, according to the nature of their Diſtempers and of the things they take, which as 'twould not be convenient, ſo neither can they be here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, recourſe muſt be had to ſuch as ſhall diſpenſe their preparations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:40830:36"/>
The uſe of theſe Waters is to be continu'd as need ſhall require, or while they pleaſe you.</p>
               <p>They may be taken by ſome with great advantage mixt in their Wines, if they drink White, Rheniſh, or Clarrets: For they finely dilute the Wine, cool and temper the Body: and very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the paſſing of the Wines by Urine, which will be of good uſe to them eſpecially who frequent the Taverns, and ſit there a while.</p>
               <p>Theſe Waters will be made freſh every day upon the beſt and choiceſt Springs that can be got.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:40830:37"/>
I ſhall make it great part of my buſineſs to ſee all thoſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary rules ſtrictly obſerv'd that are requiſite to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act preparation.</p>
               <p>And if in this ſhort Tract I have not given ſome ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry account of 'em, as to their Virtues and Uſe, I ſhall be ready at ſeaſonable times to give further direction to any that are pleas'd to require it.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of our Spaw-Tincture and its excellent Uſes.</head>
               <p>THe advantages of our Tincture are not few or mean, if the power be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd that's put into every ones hands.</p>
               <p>For here you have the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal qualities of the whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Natural Spaws, by much Care and Art ſeparated and cleans'd from their groſs Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial parts.</p>
               <p>Hereby any one never ſo remote, may have the entire benefit of the Natural Medici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:40830:38"/>
Any one upon Travel or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement may with this Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture furniſh himſelf with theſe Waters, and make 'em juſt as he takes 'em, and to what quantities he pleaſes. He may contract or dilate his Vehicle and yet have an entire Doſe of the Virtues, by the order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his drops.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that drink of my Waters may augment the Doſe of the Medicinal part by this Tincture to what degree they judge fit, or are advis'd to for their particular circumſtances: Or the Tincture may be dropt into Wine as you drink it to make it paſs the better by Urine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:40830:38"/>
To thoſe who frequent <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> or other Mineral Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, this Tincture may be of excellent uſe to enrich their Virtues, and to make them more certain in their Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: For by uniting with their Mineral Principles it will ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate 'em to a brisker diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge; and by this help, the great quantities uſually taken may be contracted, which will be of great uſe to weak Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and otherways infirm Bodies.</p>
               <p>And the dangers from the ill paſſing of thoſe Waters may be prevented, and better by this Tincture, agreeable to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40830:39"/>
their own Nature, than by any oppoſite Phyſick.</p>
               <p>Perſons unable to frequent the Wells through a low For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune are here accommodated at their own Houſes: Thoſe unable through ſickneſs, and whoſe circumſtances require, yet cannot take the quantities, or it may be not Water, may uſe this Tincture in appropriate Vehicles.</p>
               <p>'Twould be too tedious to enumerate half the benefits of this Tincture; and from theſe already mention'd every one may ſupply many more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, Eſpecially they whoſe neceſſities require, will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:40830:39"/>
About Twenty Drops of our Tincture makes a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Water to that ſtrength our Waters are of: Now any one may add fewer or more as he deſires, and make what quantities he pleaſes.</p>
               <p>For the improving our Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or <hi>Tunbridge, &amp;c.</hi> half the Doſe of drops to a Quart may be us'd, becauſe they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready impregnated with Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</p>
               <p>Unleſs you deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract your quantity of Water, then you muſt increaſe propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, 10, 15 or 20 Drops may be added to each Quart of Mineral Waters, and ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40830:40"/>
daily, till you arrive to what pitch you purpoſe, and then abate by degrees.</p>
               <p>'Tis not eaſie to commit any error, for as he that drinks three Bottles makes 'em more potent in operation than he that drinks but two, ſo 'tis with the Tincture.</p>
               <p>ANd now I'm come to fix the prices, with which I would rather give content, than conſult my own benefit. I have therefore deliberated well on 'em, deſiring they may be without exception in every particular, and ſo obtain a good eſteem, and be of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40830:40"/>
uſe to anſwer their deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>I hope therefore at ſix pence a Quart our Water will not be accounted dear; nor our Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture at Five Shillings the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which computed by Doſes is much about the rate of the Waters; for one Bottle of Tincture will make Ten or Eleven Quarts of Water to that ſtrength ours are of.</p>
               <p>And if any ones occaſion requires the increaſe of the Doſe, he muſt be content to be at the extraordinary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, which being but little, I hope ſucceſs will make him reſtitution.</p>
