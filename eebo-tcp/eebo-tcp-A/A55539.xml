            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To Her GRACE THE DUTCHESS OF ORMOND, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MADAM,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHere the Porticoes of Palaces stand like those of Temples, and the Great and the Fair leave their Accesses unbarr'd, Exalted Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in that condescending Goodness, is so far from lessening its Grandeur, that it rather heightens its State; when True Magnificence must certainly consist in the Numbers of wondring Eyes around it, and Crowds of bending Knees before it. This Argument, which I hope I have not mistaken, is my best Warrant for this Confidence.</p>
            <p>I confess, indeed, in my Approach to Your Grace, I ought to consider how I find your Court fill'd with Quality, whilst that Nobler Train throngs up Your Presence, that my poor Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion is a little too presumptuous. This truly I ought to consider, did I not at the same time reflect, that on the very Scaffolds at
<pb facs="tcp:50326:3"/>
Coronations, there are some remoter Benches, (or to speak in my own Province) some Upper Gallery Seats, even for poorer Homagers; the Voice of Adoration, and Echoes of Triumph being not only loudest but sweetest, where all Tongues unite in the Choire; whilst the lowest Humility may make up as hearty, though not so gay, a part of the Ceremony.</p>
            <p>From that Distant Bench, I beseech Your Grace to believe, that this Addressing Paper is handed down over the Heads of Honour to Your Grace's Feet. 'Tis true, I have dared to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this Trifle to Your Grace, and in it publish that piece of Boldness to the World, which how far they may forgive me, I am not so much concerned, provided Your own Descending Mercy vouchsafe my Pardon.</p>
            <p>And thus enter'd under Your Grace's glittering Roof, my daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Veneration presents me so large and so hallow'd a prospect, the concentring Worth of Two Illustrious Families, that in a long long Line from their Renown'd Originals, number their fair de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving Honours by Centuries. The Great <hi>Ormond,</hi> and Your bright Self, a fair last Branch of the Royal <hi>Plantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> so Noble an Union, in that successive Roll of Fame, bring up the splendid Reer to so distant a Front, Your Remoter Leading Ancestors, as requires a Travel into Annals for a full Survey; so ample Your Hereditary Glories, that 'tis a Voyage but to coast 'em.</p>
            <p>But whither am I rapt! I am wandring into so spacious a Field, a speculation so far above me, that the Theme is too sacred for the trembling Pen of so poor a Mushroom Scribler to venture at, Your Graces Herald, and Your Panegyrist, being both an Attempt beyond my humble Talent. Besides, there's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb facs="tcp:50326:3"/>
enough for my Adoration in a nearer View of Your Grace's radiant Vertues; an Influence so powerful, Greatness so prideless, Wit so elevated, Piety so exemplary; and to crown all these, Your Nuptial Glory, a Conjugal Affection, so inimitable, that a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string <hi>Cornelia</hi> might be proud to hold up Your Train; And all these lodged in so Beautiful a Personage, so sacred the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and so bright the Shrine. The prospect, I say, of these sublime Perfections intirely takes up my humble Devotion; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looking back into Urns and Monuments, Records and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, for their Glorious Derivation. But my Contemplation of those Adorable Vertues is not alone sufficient; give me leave to Congratulate their Felicities too, the attending smiles of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Vertues divine Rewarder; when, as an earnest-bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, the Great <hi>Ormond,</hi> under the Victorious Royal Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, has made his first Entry into a Grove of Lawrels, by hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the possession of his recover'd Patrimony, by a Sword and an Arm, worthy the Inheriting Son of so Heroick a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Continuance of whose Fortunate Successes, the rich, fair Harvest of a Field of Honour abroad, and Your Grace's no less Trophies, the Pride and Ornament of a Court at home, (a fair divided Triumph between You) shall ever be the Prayers of,</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AS a young sprightly Widow of the Town,</l>
               <l>That had some year's the marriage Comforts known.</l>
               <l>Believing She had once the best of Men,</l>
               <l>Resolves to try her Fortune o'er agin:</l>
               <l>So our Young scribling Fool, that found before</l>
               <l>Your kind Indulgence, needs must write once more.</l>
               <l>Plagu'd with an Itch that does through Poets run,</l>
               <l>Who once being enter'd, never can have done.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>He says my Intercession cannot fail,</l>
               <l>And that a pleading Female<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must prevail.</l>
               <l>I told him, I shou'd never help his Play,</l>
               <l>As having ne'er oblig'd, I mean your way,</l>
               <l>And that in times of War you Women chuse,</l>
               <l>Iust like Iack-Boots, only for present use.</l>
               <l>Till your Convenience serv'd to stand at door,</l>
               <l>Then laid by, by the Footman to be wore.</l>
               <l>Bus'ness of Love moves now no tender Passion,</l>
               <l>Your Heads are buzz'd with bus'ness of the Nation;</l>
               <l>And when your Ladies sigh for a soft word,</l>
               <l>Tou roar, Boy, bring my Pistols, fetch my Sword.</l>
               <l>What Hopes then I cou'd have he well might guess;</l>
               <l>Pray Heav'n<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> these jarring days may quickly cease.</l>
               <l>Women and Misers always pray for peace.</l>
               <l>Plunder of Gold, the Miser's fear does move,</l>
               <l>Ours, that we shall not plunder'd be of Love.</l>
               <l>For to say truth, tho' Souldiers all are brave,</l>
               <l>They're the worst Lovers that our Sex can have.</l>
               <l>For now adays, their duty grows so hard,</l>
               <l>They 're always Resty when they mount our Guard.</l>
               <l>However I must try my Luck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If then</l>
               <l>There chance to be amongst you, Gentlemen,</l>
               <l>Any so kind to hear what I can say,</l>
               <l>Them I invoke in favour of this Play.</l>
               <l>It has some Wit, tho' mix'd with many a Fau't,</l>
               <l>Some little Fancy too; but as for Plot,</l>
               <l>There are so many New ones found elsewhere,</l>
               <l>He thought not worth his time to make one here;</l>
               <l>And therefore tho' you can't that Part applaud,</l>
               <l>Clap now, for there's a Pumpkin Plot abread.</l>
