            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Letters, the uſefulneſs
and convenience whereof is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cleared in the Letter it ſelf,
and has not, that I know of,
been attempted by any other.
If it had, I ſhould very willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have ſpared my own pains.
My manner of performance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
has been at once to ſhew the
Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ces <hi>rational</hi> and to have

<pb facs="tcp:95950:5"/>
ſo it might be fitted for all ſorts
of concerned Readers, both
ſuch as are <hi>able</hi> to judge it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſuch as are <hi>not.</hi> I
have therefore ordered the whole
in ſuch a <hi>ſeries</hi> of diſcourſe as
that the <hi>ſequel</hi> muſt needs be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by him who has granted
the <hi>principles</hi> lay'd down at the
beginning; and the <hi>firſt principle</hi>
is that which the <hi>Church</hi> her ſelf
firſt enquires into, even a <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential
Call from God,</hi> or a <hi>motion
of the Spirit,</hi> as far as that may
be credited without danger of
<hi>Enthuſiaſme;</hi> and accordingly
the inferences have generally been
examplified in ſuch inſtances as
have been approved by our
<pb facs="tcp:95950:6"/>
               <hi>Church</hi> ſince her <hi>reformation,</hi> that
ſo I might, as well as I was able,
prevent objections againſt my
deſign from the <hi>inconſiderableneſs
of my perſon,</hi> an artifice too uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as it is weakly and unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably,
made uſe of for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating
the moſt commendable
projects. The objection in it
ſelf is in truth ſo very little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
as that I ſhould not
think it worthy to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, if I were not more ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
for my <hi>cauſe</hi> than my <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
But ſeeing it is ſo <hi>obvious</hi>
in the way of perſons that may
be concerned to croſs my deſign,
and withall ſo <hi>taking with the
vulgar,</hi> I doubt it will concern
<pb facs="tcp:95950:6"/>
me even <hi>in prudence</hi> to crave
your <hi>Graces patience</hi> for a <hi>brief
Apology.</hi> Omitting therefore my
own <hi>juſtification,</hi> which I confeſs
a task too great for my weak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities
(though if I did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it on a publick account, I
might for an excuſe of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſty,
urge the example of
the <hi>great Apoſtle,</hi> who, out of
<hi>tenderneſs</hi> for his <hi>cauſe,</hi> was (as
himſelf confeſſes) neceſſitated to
ſuch a <hi>folly</hi>) yet I conceive it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denyable
that the <hi>merit</hi> of the
<hi>cauſe</hi> is abundantly ſufficient to
compenſate the <hi>demerit</hi> of my
<hi>perſon,</hi> and for my part, ſo that
the cauſe may not be prejudiced,
I ſhall very heartily ſubmit the
<pb facs="tcp:95950:7"/>
choice of <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of God himſelf. Beſides
further that it is extreamly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to urge <hi>perſonal deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
againſt a <hi>cauſe.</hi> Indeed if
the cauſe had been recommended
on <hi>perſonal regards,</hi> the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>perſon</hi> might have
<hi>invalidated</hi> ſuch a <hi>recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
But conſidering that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
here is pretended, but the
<hi>ſolidity of the reaſons</hi> ſubmitted to
an impartial examination; none
can ſay that they are the weaker
for being propounded by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
perſon. Neither indeed
is the ſuppoſal true, that even in

is recommended onely by my <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>OW much the reputation of
<hi>Religion</hi> is concerned in the
honour of its <hi>relatives,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the <hi>perſons teaching</hi> and
<hi>profeſſing</hi> it, as it has been the
<hi>ſenſe</hi> of all <hi>prudent Nations,</hi> ſo it is too
<hi>evident</hi> from the <hi>experience</hi> of <hi>ours.</hi> For
if we ſeriouſly reflect on that <hi>Irreligion</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95950:9"/>
and <hi>Atheiſm</hi> which has lately ſo overrun
that part of the <hi>Gentry</hi> who have had that
<hi>freedome of education</hi> as to diſcern beyond
the <hi>groſser ſuperſtitions</hi> of the <hi>credulous vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi>
and yet wanted that <hi>depth</hi> and <hi>ſolidity</hi>
of <hi>judgment,</hi> or that <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>diligence,</hi>
which had been requiſite for a <hi>poſitive ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,</hi>
concerning the <hi>true meaſures</hi> of
things; I think there cannot be a more
probable <hi>Original</hi> aſſigned for it, than this
of the <hi>contempt of the Clergie.</hi> For
when upon pretence of a maintenance of
their <hi>Chriſtian liberty,</hi> ſome perſons of a
better <hi>meaning</hi> than <hi>Information,</hi> were
ſeduced by their more ſubtilly-deſigning
<hi>Leaders</hi> to reſiſt ſome <hi>indifferent Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of their <hi>Superiors;</hi> they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
obliged in purſuance of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to call in <hi>Queſtion</hi> their whole <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
For conſidering that they were
not any particular <hi>abuſes</hi> of a <hi>juſt Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
not any bare <hi>inexpediency</hi> in the <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>
already eſtabliſhed (for which <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi>
not <hi>Subjects,</hi> had been reſponſible,
and for which a redreſs ought to have
been deſired by <hi>Subjects</hi> in a <hi>modeſt</hi> and
<hi>peaceable way,</hi> which, if denyed, could not
have juſtified a ſeparation, ſeeing that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
under <hi>ſin</hi> can excuſe that, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion
to Superiors in confeſſed inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediencies
cannot be proved a <hi>ſin</hi>) but
the very <hi>Authority</hi> by which they had been
<pb facs="tcp:95950:9"/>
eſtabliſhed; and finding further that this
Authority was of that kind that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
intrinſecally involved in all <hi>exerciſe</hi>
of <hi>Government,</hi> ſo that it was impoſſible
to plead and exception of <hi>duty</hi> upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal
that their Superiors had tranſgreſſed
the bounds of their <hi>juſt power;</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
themſelves reduced to this <hi>extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to juſtifie their own <hi>diſobedience</hi> by a
<hi>renunciation</hi> of their <hi>Authority.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
all <hi>Government</hi> muſt needs prove uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
that is denyed a <hi>power</hi> of <hi>impoſing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
obligations,</hi> and that power muſt
needs be denyed where all things <hi>neceſſary</hi>
are ſuppoſed <hi>antecedently determined,</hi> and
what is not ſo is thought uncapable of any
<hi>juſt determination.</hi> Having therefore thus
deveſted the <hi>Clergie</hi> of all power properly
ſo called, yet that they might ſeem to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
ſomething to the eminency of
their place in the Church, they were wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to allow a power of <hi>perſwading</hi> ſuch
as were willing to obey, onely with this
difference (that I can perceive) from the
meereſt <hi>Laick,</hi> that <hi>Laicks</hi> might <hi>perſwade</hi>
others to piety, but <hi>Clergiemen</hi> muſt; that
it was <hi>charity</hi> in them, but <hi>duty</hi> in theſe;
that it was onely the <hi>general Calling</hi> of
thoſe, but the <hi>particular</hi> of theſe; that
the <hi>Laity</hi> might diſcharge it <hi>privately,</hi> but
the <hi>publick performance</hi> of it was onely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the <hi>Clergie.</hi> This ſeems to have
<pb facs="tcp:95950:10"/>
been the uttermoſt deſign of their moſt
ancient <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> none of them, that I
know of, ever enduring to hear of any
<hi>Laical</hi> encroachments on the <hi>Calling</hi> it
ſelf. But whileſt they were ſo Studious

<hi>reverence</hi> it ſelf muſt needs prove very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable.
For firſt, they had oppoſed
profeſſedly all difference betwixt the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie</hi>
and <hi>Laity,</hi> and indeed all <hi>relative Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
as <hi>Popiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the uſurpation of a <hi>Lordſhip over

left to the <hi>Clergie</hi> that might as much
as challenge a reſpect of the <hi>Laity</hi> but
their perſonal skill in the <hi>objects</hi> of their
<hi>Profeſſion,</hi> which both left the <hi>unskilful
<pb facs="tcp:95950:10"/>
Clergie</hi> deſtitute of any <hi>pretence</hi> of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging
reverence; and was no <hi>curb</hi> to the
<hi>more skilful Laity;</hi> and indeed in the event
made them <hi>perfectly equal,</hi> ſeeing that the
<hi>skilful Laity</hi> might as well challenge reſpect
from the <hi>unskilful Clergie,</hi> as the <hi>skilful
Clergie</hi> from the <hi>unskilful Laity,</hi> their <hi>order</hi>
being indeed no ingredient in the ground
of ſuch a challenge. Beſides ſecondly,
their making the <hi>Scriptures</hi> an <hi>adequate
Rule</hi> for all <hi>prudential eſtabliſhments,</hi> and
obliging the <hi>Laity</hi> to a <hi>particular enquiry</hi>
into the <hi>merit</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions,</hi>
even in <hi>probable,</hi> as well as <hi>certain, ſenſes</hi> of

nor indeed letting them underſtand
their <hi>incompetency</hi> in any caſe where they
might hope for the <hi>aſſiſtance</hi> of a more able

or by the <hi>Spirit</hi> whereby it was written, or

theſe pretences, I ſay, ſeem to deprive the

it were not coincident with the <hi>truth,</hi>
whereof if neither could appear upon a

might have an influence in their <hi>determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95950:11"/>
But, as the <hi>vulgar</hi> is very <hi>willing</hi> to

<hi>competent Advocates</hi> for their <hi>own

or if they be heard, yet with no <hi>indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
the <hi>intereſt</hi> of the <hi>Clergie</hi> being thought
inconſiſtent with that of the <hi>Laity:</hi> a way

very <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> it being every way as
<hi>weak</hi> to conclude a cauſe <hi>falſe</hi> as <hi>true</hi> on no

However this argument, ſuch as it is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by <hi>prophane perſons</hi> taken for granted
from the conceſſions of the <hi>Religious Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
and they withall further diſcovering

upon pretence of <hi>honouring Religion</hi> had
brought a <hi>contempt</hi> upon its <hi>principal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors</hi>
and <hi>defenders;</hi> it was eaſie for them
to conclude Religion it ſelf <hi>diſhonourable</hi>
and <hi>ſuſpicious</hi> from this repute of its chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Champions; for if what make; for the

what conſequences he will be likely

that this <hi>diſhonour of the Clergie</hi> was like
to invalidate the uſe of all <hi>coercive means</hi>
for inducing the <hi>Laity</hi> to a <hi>practice</hi> of their
<hi>duty,</hi> and ſo to leave them intirely to the

which though at firſt they might be <hi>heated</hi>

will return with a <hi>violence</hi> propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable

when men are come to this <hi>extreme</hi> they
will then be as much concerned that thoſe

the <hi>Clergie intereſſed</hi> in their <hi>truth,</hi> and
therefore may be preſumed as <hi>partial.</hi>
And when men are <hi>willing</hi> and <hi>intereſſed</hi> to

               <hi>disbelieve Religion,</hi> how very <hi>weak reaſons</hi>

any one that would conſider the <hi>perſons</hi>

the <hi>gradation</hi> of their <hi>disbelief.</hi> As it has
therefore thus appeared both from <hi>reaſon</hi>
and <hi>experience</hi> that this <hi>contempt of the

<hi>Irreligion;</hi> ſo on the contrary the beſt
prevention of theſe horrid conſequences
will be their reſtitution to their due <hi>reſpect</hi>

by a <hi>praemonition</hi> of perſons <hi>deſigning this
Calling,</hi> that they may neither <hi>engage</hi> in

Papers, which I hope all they who ground
their hopes of <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>future proſperity</hi> on

there is alſo another of no ſmall moment,
<hi>the ſatisfaction of our well meaning ſeparating
brethren.</hi> For whatever other <hi>weak reaſons</hi>
are pretended (as indeed I think they

indeed ſeems to be the great reaſon that

               </gap> and <hi>unſerious way of Preaching</hi> ſeem to
be the true grounds of that <hi>irreverence.</hi>
Now my way of <hi>defence</hi> is not the leaſt to
juſtifie their <hi>

they ſeem to miſunderſtand us, when they
charge us with the <hi>Patronage of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs</hi>
upon account of theſe perſons)
but to let them underſtand how little our
<hi>Church</hi> is indeed concerned in their <hi>defence.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:95950:13"/>
For if the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Clergieman</hi> here
deſcribed anſwer the true deſign of the
Church (as I have ſhewn that it does by
<hi>Injunctions</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> produced from her

that ſuch perſons are ſo far <hi>unconformable</hi>
as they are diſliked (for it is plain the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>here deſcribed</hi> can neither prove <hi>impious</hi>
in his <hi>life,</hi> nor <hi>imprudent</hi> or <hi>trifling</hi> in his
<hi>Preaching</hi>) and ſure themſelves will not
think it equitable that our <hi>Church</hi> ſhould
be charged with the errors of <hi>non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts.</hi>
The onely thing therefore that
may ſeem <hi>blameworthy</hi> here is that the

on ſuch perſons with <hi>due ſeverity.</hi> But
neither will this <hi>excuſe</hi> their <hi>ſeparation;</hi>
for firſt, they are not concerned to ſee this
<hi>juſtice</hi> done ſo as to be obliged upon <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi>
of it to withdraw from our <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>

            <p>Now though the <hi>following Advices</hi> be

that is, as <hi>fundamentals;</hi> and which

            </p>
            <p>In the Second <hi>Letter,</hi> I confeſs many
things in the <hi>improvement</hi> of the propoſals
there laid down, and in the <hi>Catalogues</hi> of
<hi>Books,</hi> might have been more accurately
enlarged, but that I conceived theſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to <hi>initiate a Novice,</hi> which I have
there ſignified to have been my <hi>uttermoſt
<pb facs="tcp:95950:16"/>
deſign,</hi> and I doubt whether it would be
<hi>prudent</hi> to diſcourage beginners with the
<hi>Proſpect</hi> of <hi>too greater a task.</hi> In my cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of <hi>School Divinity,</hi> there is one
<hi>fundamental defect</hi> omitted, which I look
on as ſo very <hi>conſiderable,</hi> and of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
<hi>fullacious conſequence</hi> to them that
rely on it, and yet never obſerved, that I
know of, that I thought it worthy a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
mention here. That is, <hi>that the
greateſt and moſt Sacred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> myſteries of the
<hi>Trinity</hi> and <hi>Iucarnation</hi> are explained as
to their <hi>Theological conſequences</hi> from the
principles of the <hi>Peripa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>etick Philoſophy</hi> as
borrowed by them from the modern tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Commentaries of the <hi>Arabians.</hi>
               </hi>
It is plain that all the uſe of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> in
affairs of this nature cannot be to <hi>diſcover</hi>
any truth <hi>anew,</hi> but onely to <hi>explain</hi> the
ſenſe of the <hi>Authors</hi> delivering it, and that
that <hi>Philoſophy</hi> alone can be uſeful to this
purpoſe, whoſe <hi>Language</hi> was obſerved by
them; and that not <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> but <hi>Plato</hi>
was then generally followed not onely by
the <hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> of that
age, but in accommodation to them his
<hi>Language</hi> obſerved by the <hi>Scriptures</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
eſpecially St. <hi>John</hi> I. and by the
<hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> thoſe of greateſt
repute in both the <hi>Occidental</hi> and <hi>Oriental
Churches,</hi> the <hi>pretended Areopagite</hi> and St.
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> himſelf, to whom the <hi>Schools</hi> are
<pb facs="tcp:95950:17"/>
moſt beholden, St <hi>Baſil,</hi> both St. <hi>Gregories
Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Nyſſen.</hi> St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> &amp;c.
So that this way of proceeding is lyable to
two very <hi>fundamental miſtakes</hi> (which
ſhould be ſtudiouſly avoided in affairs of
ſo <hi>great concernment</hi>) Firſt of <hi>explaining
Platonick language by Peripatetick Philoſophy;</hi>
Secondly of <hi>explaining the ancient Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Philoſophy by the preſent expoſitions of the
modern Arabians.</hi> Theſe with the other
<hi>defects</hi> there mentioned would methinks
invite ſome generous <hi>Advancers of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
to review the whole <hi>foundations</hi> of our
<hi>Modern School-Divinity</hi> which would be an

of the <hi>age</hi> we live in. And ſeeing
I have taken this occaſion of mentioning
ſuch a deſign; it may be it may not prove
altogether <hi>unacceptable,</hi> perhaps ſomething
<hi>neceſſary</hi> to <hi>clear</hi> my <hi>meaning,</hi> to propoſe
ſuch a way of managing it, as I conceive
moſt convenient, which I moſt willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to the <hi>cenſures</hi> of perſons more <hi>skilful</hi>
and <hi>experienced.</hi> That I think would be
Firſt to diſtinguiſh accurately betwixt ſuch
Queſtions as are to be decided by <hi>reaſon,</hi>
and ſuch whoſe <hi>principles</hi> are either <hi>wholly</hi>
or <hi>principally</hi> derived from <hi>Revelation.</hi> In
the <hi>former</hi> the <hi>Schoolmen</hi> may be more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
truſted, their excellency lying in the
<hi>cloſeneſs</hi> of their <hi>diſcourſe.</hi> But here it
ſelf, it were well that their <hi>principles</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:95950:17"/>
               <hi>reformed;</hi> eſpecially in ſuch an age as this
is, care ſhould be taken that nothing be
taken up <hi>precariouſly</hi> upon the <hi>Authority</hi> of
any however <hi>celebrated Philoſopher</hi> (a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
too frequent among them) but what
might ſufficiently recommend it ſelf by
its own <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>intrinſick reaſonableneſs.</hi>
And then for thoſe which are derived from
<hi>Revelation</hi> it is plain that their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
muſt be derived from <hi>Teſtimonies</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of <hi>Scripture</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

glorious in the eſteem of inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Mortals, are ſubordinate by
God himſelf in a capacity as ignoble
as is that of the Body to the Soul;
ſo, the hazard is proportionable: the
miſcarriage of thoſe noble beings
for whoſe redemption nothing but
the blood of God was thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
valuable; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accountable according to the eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
God himſelf has been pleaſed
to impoſe upon them: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you remember that you ſtand
in need of greater natural Abilities
and providential Auxiliaries, as it is
more difficult to take care of a <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi>
than of a <hi>ſingle perſon;</hi> that
if ſupernatural aſſiſtances be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

               </gap>herefore you never venture on it

cannot prudently preſume a
<hi>Call</hi> but upon theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
that you are princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
created for the Divine
Service in the improvement
of Mankind; that you are
engaged in Gratitude to
perform your Duty in it for
the many benefits by him
conferred on you;<note place="margin">Answ. I truſt ſo. Ordering or Deacons.</note> that
you cannot approve your self grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95950:31"/>
unto him unleſs you love him,
nor veraciouſly pretend to love him
unleſs you moſt deſire what you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
moſt pleaſing to him; whence
it will follow that you muſt addict
your ſelf to that courſe of life which
is moſt pleaſing to him, if you find
your ſelf qualified for it, for this is
the onely truly <hi>rational Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Call,</hi> which can without <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſme</hi>
be expected and judged of.
Now theſe qualifications muſt be a
<hi>pure intention, natural abilities,</hi> and
<hi>a firm immoveable reſolution;</hi> for if
any of theſe be wanting, you can
never be ſecure of your <hi>own endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi>
much leſs of the <hi>Divine aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi>
for avoiding ſo imminent a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. But becauſe I am not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
theſe Qualifications under a
meerly natural or moral notion, but
as they may ingratiate you with
God, and ſo intitle you to that aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
without which, as has been
ſhewed, you cannot ſecurely venture
on a ſtate of life ſo extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous;
I conceive it therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95950:31"/>
to warn you what it is you
may ſafely truſt in this enquiry. Firſt
therefore, <hi>for the purity of your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,</hi>
you may obſerve that <hi>purity</hi>
implies <hi>a freedom from mixture of
what is more baſe with what is more
noble,</hi> whether that which is baſe be
<hi>predominant</hi> or onely <hi>equal.</hi> And
therefore that your deſigns may be
<hi>pure,</hi> you muſt take care that 1. You
deſign this courſe of life for thoſe
ends alone, which indeed do onely
render it worthy being deſigned by
you upon a rational account; for
this muſt needs be that which is moſt
excellent. 2. That you do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
this moſt excellent for any thing
leſs excellent as a more ultimate
end: Nay, 3. That you do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
any thing leſs excellent as an
end even <hi>coordinate</hi> with the more
excellent, but onely as <hi>ſubordinate.</hi>
The latter points are thoſe wherein
you may be moſt eaſily miſtaken, and
wherein it will be moſt difficult to
ſatisfie your ſelf of your own ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
At preſent you may take this
Rule: if you find your ſelf ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95950:32"/>
with the leſs noble end as
that without it you have reaſon to
think that you ſhould not undertake
ſuch a difficult duty for the more
noble end alone, you have reaſon to
ſuſpect that the more noble end is
<hi>onely ſubordinate,</hi> and the leſs noble
<hi>truly ultimate;</hi> and if you find that
your deſires of the <hi>leſs noble end</hi> are
ſuch, as that, if you ſhould fail of it,
you would find leſs complacency in
your duty, though you were ſure
thereby to attain that which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>more noble,</hi> you will have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to ſuſpect your deſigns of the leſs
noble end to be, at leaſt, partial and
coordinate. Both deſigns are <hi>ſinful;</hi>
but with this difference: that the
deſigning the more noble end for
the leſs noble, argues the Will <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
depraved,</hi> and implies no <hi>voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
but onely a <hi>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eity,</hi> for that which
is more noble, and therefore can no
way entitle ſuch a perſon to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
favour; but the making the
leſs noble end <hi>coordinate,</hi> argues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a <hi>volition,</hi> but ſo imperfect, as
cannot move the Divine favour, who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95950:32"/>
cannot chooſe but take ill ſuch a
diſhonourable Competitor, and who
will by no means yield any of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to another; nay, who has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
declared it his pleaſure, either
to have the whole heart, or none;
who will by no means partake with
his Adverſaries, but nauſeates and
abhors the lukewarm perſon. But
though, where this is expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
it can no way <hi>deſerve his love,</hi>
yet, where it is irreptitious and by
way of ſurprize, it may, at leaſt, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
his pity,</hi> upon the ſame account

this conſideration ſuffice to excuſe

that which onely renders the <hi>Cleri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

               </hi> is
that to which it is upon a <hi>rational

in <hi>the world</hi> (the deſign of this

ſuch things the World calls <hi>good</hi>)
but onely <hi>the ſervice of God</hi> in a

therefore that the ſervice of God,

that your choice is irrevocable,

incur by a conſcientious diſcharging
of your duty: in admoniſhing ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
perſons, <hi>openly,</hi> and others,
<hi>ſecretly,</hi> of their Vices, and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the <hi>great ones</hi> as well as the

as their example is more peſtilential;
in generally weakning the hands and

of impious perſons, by ſhaming
them out of countenance, by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
their companions, and generally
awing them by a conſtantly grave

            <p>VI. And by this experiment you <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
may alſo perceive whether any leſs
noble end be ingredient in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
this Calling: whether it be
to gratifie the humours of your
Friends, or a vainglorious ſhewing of
your parts, or a more honourable
condition of life even in this world,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95950:35"/>
or a more plentifull maintenance, or
a politick deſign of making your
ſelf conſiderable in gaining a party
for your own deſigns, though, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
the humour of our <hi>Proteſtant
Laity</hi> is generally ſo ſelf-confident,
and ſo little dependent on their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
(if they do not deſpiſe them)
as that this laſt Temptation cannot
now be very dangerous. For if you
can as cheerfully ſerve God in the
abſence of theſe temporal encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
as with them; if you can
for your own ſake patiently bear
with the ſucceſleſneſs of your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
and ſatisfie your ſelf in
the conſcience of having performed
your duty; if you be as induſtrious
and careful of a Cure leſs temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
advantagious, as of one that is
more, and of perſons that cannot, as
well as of thoſe that can, reward
you; if you know, with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
how to be abaſed, as well as how
to abound; if you can praiſe God as
cheerfully in a low, as in a proſperous
condition; nay more, as having then
a title to many bleſſings of which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95950:35"/>
your proſperous condition is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable;
if you can find your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſo diſintangled from the World,
that you are, like<note n="i" place="margin">Phil. i. 23, 24, 25.</note> St. <hi>Paul,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of living, upon your own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
but onely for the Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
then indeed, and not till then,
you may be ſecurely confident of the
integrity of your intentions, and
venture your ſelf in this <hi>warfare,</hi> as
the <hi>Clerical Calling</hi> is expreſly
called by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. II. 3, 4.
And as it were certainly moſt ſecure
that your affections were thus gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
alienated from theſe more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble
deſigns, that you may ſatisfie
your own conſcience of your own
freedom from the ſuſpition of them;
ſo, becauſe the heart is ſo intolerably
deceitful as that its inclinations can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be certainly diſcerned till the
objected be veſted with advantagious
particular circumſtances; and theſe
cannot be ſo prudently foreſeen in
general; it will, at leaſt, concern you
to make the experiment full in ſuch
caſes as you are by your own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
obnoxious to, and whoſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95950:36"/>
may very probably and
frequently occur, and therefore may
rationally be expected. Remember
that this enquiry be performed, as
in the ſight of God, to whom you
muſt return an account of this Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip,
and whom it is impoſſible to
deceive; and for your own ſake,
whoſe intereſt is not meanly, but,
greatly and eternally, concerned in
it: not onely for your perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
which you may incur by your
imprudence herein, but alſo thoſe
miſchievous conſequential miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
which will involve you deeply
in the guilt of the ruine of as many
Souls as ſhall be engaged therein by
the example, or imprudence, or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of their guide, who ſhould
have been exemplary to them. It
were well if you made this the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of a Communion-exerciſe before
you take Orders; for when you
have deveſted your ſelf of all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſigns, and have God alone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your eyes, and ſpiritual conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
and have acknowledged
your own inſufficiency to diſcern the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95950:36"/>
deceitfulneſs of your heart, and
have therefore humbly implored the
Divine aſſiſtance, and intirely placed
your confidence in him, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirations,
not <hi>extraordinary and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtical,</hi>
but, <hi>Providential and
moral:</hi> That he may be pleaſed to
clear your underſtanding from all
prejudices of your will; that to
your underſtanding, thus prepared,
he would ſuggeſt the ſecureſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
that he would enable you
with a prudent and diſtinguiſhing
ſpirit in paſſing your judgment, and
making your election of them; when,
I ſay, you have done all this, you will
then have the greateſt moral proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
that is poſſible, that your
judgment (if you can ſatisfie your
ſelf of your ſincerity in obſerving
theſe Rules) <hi>is the judgment of
right Reaſon,</hi> and conſequently, in
the way we are now ſpeaking of, <hi>the
Will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VII. But neither is this purity of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VII"/>
deſign alone ſufficient (unleſs you
have abilities for it) either to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
a <hi>Call from God,</hi> or to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95950:37"/>
ſecurely and prudently on it.
Not the former; for Gods deſigning
men for particular Callings, is, in a
<hi>Providential way,</hi> to be concluded
from his gifts, which are the talents
he intruſts us with, and therefore
obliges us to improve, and that after
the moſt advantagious way; ſo that
where God has given natural gifts
peculiarly fitting a perſon for a <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Calling,</hi> and where it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
evident, that either they fit him
for no <hi>other Calling,</hi> or, at leaſt, not
<hi>ſo advantagiouſly,</hi> or to a <hi>Calling not
ſo advantagious;</hi> there, if he follow
the dictate of <hi>right Reaſon</hi> (which
is the onely <hi>Providential voyce of
God</hi>) he muſt needs conclude him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in <hi>prudence</hi> obliged to follow
this, rather than any other. But you
may be here miſtaken, if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
either your <hi>Gifts,</hi> or your <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>
partially. Your <hi>Gifts</hi> you
are to conſider <hi>univerſally,</hi> in regard
of <hi>themſelves,</hi> or their <hi>effects,</hi> which
may with any great moral probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be foreſeen, whether <hi>natural,</hi> or
<hi>accidental:</hi> whether, as ſome of your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95950:37"/>
               <hi>Gifts</hi> do fit you for the <hi>Clerical
Calling,</hi> ſo, they may not equally
fit you for <hi>another?</hi> whether, if
they fit you <hi>onely,</hi> or <hi>peculiarly</hi> for
this, yet, you may not have other
qualifications that may make it <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous?</hi>
whether, if you have ſuch
as may render it dangerous, the <hi>dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>
be <hi>greater,</hi> or <hi>more probable</hi> to
come to paſs, than the <hi>advantage?</hi>
whether, if you have <hi>none,</hi> yet, you
have not onely <hi>ſome,</hi> but <hi>all,</hi> the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications
for this Calling? whether,
if some be <hi>wanting,</hi> they be either
<hi>fewer,</hi> or <hi>leſs conſiderable</hi> than those
you have? So alſo, concerning the
<hi>Calling</hi> it ſelf, you are to conſider
whether, all things being allowed

or <hi>diſadvantagious,</hi> to

ſuſpect me of <hi>Pelagianiſm</hi> as to put
me to the trouble of an <hi>Apology</hi> for
calling theſe <hi>qualifications natural.</hi>
My meaning is not, that theſe <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
qualifications</hi> alone are ſufficient
for diſcharging the <hi>Clerical Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</hi>
Or, that thoſe <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> that
are ſuperadded are onely <hi>natural;</hi>
but onely, that all ſuperadded Aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries
are grounded on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of ſuch as are natural,
not as <hi>merits</hi> rigorouſly obliging
God <hi>in point of Juſtice,</hi> but as <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
mercifully perſwading and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
him, who is of himſelf alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<hi>munificent;</hi> ſo that the principal

theſe <hi>ſupernatural Auxiliaries,</hi> which
can onely be hoped for by them
who are peculiarly called, can <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedently</hi>
(as it is plain that the
ground of their hope muſt be <hi>ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent</hi>)
be grounded on nothing
but what is <hi>natural.</hi> To let this
therefore paſs (that this whole Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
may be deduced home to
your caſe) it will be neceſſary to
ſhew what theſe qualifications are,
which will beſt be underſtood by
their accommodation to the deſign
for which you intend them. That
therefore I ſuppoſe to be the taking
of a particular charge upon you of
the ſouls of a particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
ſo that according to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wayes of the miſcarriage of ſuch
ſouls, you ought to be contrarily
qualified for their ſecurity. And the
miſcarriage of their ſouls being oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
by their <hi>non performance of
their duty,</hi> your qualifications muſt
conſiſt in ſuch requiſites as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them to that performance. And
theſe will, in general, be reduced to
two heads: <hi>ſuch as may be neceſſary
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95950:39"/>
for informing them in their duty, and
ſuch as may induce them to practice it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
for in both theſe put together their
ſecurity does adaequately conſiſt.
And in order to theſe two ends you
muſt be endued with two requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites:
<hi>knowledge,</hi> for convincing
their underſtandings; and <hi>prudence,</hi>
for perſwading their wills. By
<hi>knowledge</hi> I do not ſo much mean
that which is <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical,</hi>
as that which is more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<hi>Practical.</hi> For I ſuppoſe your
charge to conſiſt principally of the
<hi>illiterate multitude,</hi> and that if you
have any <hi>intelligent learned Laick</hi>
that may be capable of higher
things, yet that it is more rare and
caſual; and that in theſe qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
I am ſpeaking of, we are not ſo
much to conſider what is <hi>rare</hi> and
<hi>extraordinary,</hi> as what is <hi>frequent</hi> and
<hi>uſual;</hi> what is <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>convenient,</hi>
as what is <hi>abſolutely neceſſary.</hi> For
both thoſe <hi>extraordinary occaſions</hi>
cannot ſo much oblige to a peculiar
proviſion, eſpecailly in thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
which are neceſſary for theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95950:39"/>
ſervices of the Church, all which
cannot be expected capable of them;
and thoſe caſes, being <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
may be ſupplied by a few peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
gifted that way, ſeeing it is
Gods uſual way thus to diſtribute
thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are indeed
<hi>convenient</hi> for the edification of the
Catholick Church <hi>in general,</hi> but
not <hi>abſolutely neceſſary</hi> for every <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi>
charge. For theſe ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
wherein your other ſtudies of
more neceſſary concernment, or the
averſion of your own <hi>genius,</hi> may
not incline you, or afford you oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
or enable you, to attain ſuch
skill your ſelf as were convenient;
it will be ſufficient that you hold
correſpondence with ſuch as have it,
whom you may conſult with as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſhall require, and ſo not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unprovided even for theſe
extraordinary occurrences. But that
which will more peculiarly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably
concern you, is that
<hi>more immediately practical</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which all are ſome way bound
to obſerve, and of which none,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95950:40"/>
which act prudently in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
concernments of the world,
may be preſumed uncapable. And it
were well that you would reduce
all other ſpeculative knowledge to
this, as it is certainly deſigned by
God. My meaning is, that you
would not begin with <hi>notions</hi> in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
others, but that you would
firſt ſtir them up to <hi>practice</hi> ſuch
duties as are by all parties acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be eſſentially obligatory
under the ſtate of Chriſtianity (as,
God be praiſed, principles ſufficient
for moſt of theſe are admitted by all
conſiderable parties that violate the
peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> however other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
diſunited among themſelves)
and ſo by that means bring them to
a <hi>carefulneſs of their wayes,</hi> and <hi>a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
of conſcience,</hi> and <hi>an inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveneſs
after their duty univerſally</hi>
whatever it may be; which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for what other inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they may afterwards prove ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of; and will be of excellent
uſe, both for rendring your advice
acceptable and uſeful to them, when
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95950:40"/>
they firſt ſenſibly experience its ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
before it be communicated;
and for preventing the infuſion of
any frivolous and unprofitable noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which are very dangerous to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
capacities (who are uſually
more <hi>paſſionate</hi> than <hi>judicious,</hi> and

            <p>IX. I could have ſhewn you, in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IX"/>
many regards, how incomparably
more advantagious this way is, even
for the reduction of <hi>Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> than that which is
ordinarily made uſe of, an abrupt
diſputation: for by this means you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95950:41"/>
will find that the onely true cauſes
of <hi>heretical</hi> and <hi>ſchiſmatical pravity,
obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>perverſity of will,</hi> and
<hi>prejudices of the world,</hi> and <hi>the vain
deſire of applauſe and victory,</hi> and
<hi>their preingagement in a party,</hi> and
<hi>that ſhame and unwillingneſs to yield</hi>
(even to truth it ſelf, when it appears
their Adverſary) which unawares
ſurprizes the moſt innocently mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, will be removed before
your reaſons be propounded, which,
if by them they be thought more
convincing, they muſt, upon theſe
ſuppoſitions, needs prevail; and that
the want of the removal of theſe is
that which ordinarily makes diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
ſo ſucceſſeſs; nay that the
<hi>converſion</hi> it ſelf of the <hi>perſons</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>purgation</hi> of theſe <hi>prejudices,</hi>
might indeed enlarge our <hi>party</hi> (a

any peaceable pious Chriſtian) but
would never be advantagious to the

their ſatisfaction) becauſe
it were hardly probable that the
truth it ſelf could be embraced <hi>on
its own account,</hi> and ſo <hi>for virtuous
motives,</hi> whileſt theſe humors were
<hi>predominant;</hi> and to receive the
truth it ſelf for <hi>vitious ones</hi> were
a deſecration and proſtitution of it,
which muſt certainly be moſt odious
and deteſtable in the ſight of God,
who judges impartially of the <hi>ſecret

the <hi>exteriour profeſſions,</hi> of men;
that, I ſay, theſe things are true, if
<hi>Reaſon</hi> do not, yet <hi>ſad experience</hi>
will, prove a full conviction. Beſides
their receiving the truth it ſelf upon
<hi>humour.</hi> (and it cannot be judged
to be upon any other account where
it is not embraced upon a pious ſenſse
of its <hi>uſefulneſs</hi>) would both be
<hi>ſcandalous</hi> to thoſe that might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it (as Hypocrites cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

cauſe that makes it. Nay if, after
you had reduced them to this good

an aſſent to what you ſay, either
through the <hi>weakneſs of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,</hi>
or <hi>your own unskilfulneſs</hi> in
pleading for a good cause with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
yet you muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them invincibly ignorant, and
therefore <hi>excuſable</hi> before God in
this regard, as well as <hi>poſitively acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable</hi>
in others; and therefore muſt
be as charitable in your demeanour
to them, as, you believe, God will
prove favourable in their final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence;
which muſt needs be a great
ſecondary ſatisfaction and comfort
(that their errors themſelves are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent)
to ſuch as are more intent
on the improvement of Chriſtianity
it ſelf than any ſubdividing denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
for it God himſelf, though

failing thereof shall not prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judical
to them; if, I ſay, God may
<hi>do thus,</hi> and may <hi>be preſumed to do ſo
by you;</hi> I do not ſee how you can
excuſe your ſelf (if you diſſent)
from forfeiting the glory of <hi>unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi>

you may hence conclude, that
all that your people are obliged to

to know; and that not onely
as a <hi>Practitioner,</hi> who may be ſecure
in knowing his own duty, in the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity

to be skilled in the <hi>Originals;</hi> for
all <hi>Tranſlations</hi> being performed by
fallible perſons, and being capable
of ſuch aequivocations which may
frequently have no ground in the
Originals; the ſenſe, as collected
from ſuch Tranſlations, may very
probably be miſunderſtood, and
therefore cannot be ſecurely truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But, of the two Originals, the
<hi>Greek</hi> is that, which can with leſs
ſecurity be neglected upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
already praemiſed. For, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

peculiarly due to thoſe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations
of the Divine love in the
Goſpel, greater than could have
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95950:48"/>
been expected from the <hi>Divine Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy,</hi>
as it appears from reaſon
alone; both of theſe are proper to
the <hi>Goſpel-ſtate,</hi> and therefore are

            <p>XII. And upon the ſame account,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XII"/>
I do not, for my part, ſee how you
can well have neglected <hi>the Fathers
of the firſt and pureſt Centuries,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
thoſe that are, by the conſent
of all, concluded genuine, and that
lived before the Empire turned
Chriſtian, who conſequently were
free from thoſe ſecular enjoyments,
which, in a ſhort time, ſenſibly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
that generoſity and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
ſeverity, which were ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably
conſpicuous in the Infancy
of Chriſtianity. For, though it be
confeſſed that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
clear in all matters indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſably
neceſſary to Salvation (which
are the onely ſubjects of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
diſcourſe) yet I conceive that
perſpicuity to have been mainly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
to the preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of the perſons then living,
many of the phraſes being taken
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95950:49"/>
from doctrines or practices then ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
prevailing among them, and
obviouſly notorious to all, the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
as well as perſons of greater
capacities. But that all things, that
were then clear, might not, as other
Antiquities have done ſince, in a
long proceſs of time, contract an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
obſcurity by the <hi>abolition,</hi>
or <hi>neglect,</hi> of thoſe then notorious
<hi>Antiquities</hi> on which that perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is ſuppoſed to depend; or that,
ſuppoſing this perſpicuity ſtill to
depend on ſuch Antiquities, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
ſhould have been obliged to
keep ſuch Antiquities themſelves
unchanged, or any other way noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
than by the monuments ſtill
extant of thoſe ages; cannot, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
with any probability be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed:
either from the nature of
the thing; or the deſign of the
Scriptures, which both ſeem to have
been written in accommodation to
particular exigences, and on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
occaſions; and rather to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
than inſiſt on, ſuch things as
were already preſumed notorious,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95950:49"/>
and muſt needs have been either
more intricate, if brief; or more
tedious and voluminous, if accurate,
in explaining ſo numerous particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.
Now, if this perſpicuity
were accommodated to the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
of them to whom they
were, more immediately, revealed;
then certainly the Holy Ghoſt muſt
needs be preſumed to have intended
ſuch ſenſes as he knew them ready
and likely to apprehend (eſpecially
in ſuch caſes wherein the terms were
taken from ſomething already noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
among them, and wherein they
could have no reaſon to ſuſpect their
miſapprehenſions, much leſs, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
means to rectifie them) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
on the contrary, what we can
find to have been their ſenſe of the
Scriptures, in things perſpicuous and
neceſſary, that we have reaſon to
believe verily intended by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealer.
Beſides that this is the uſual
practice of our moſt accurate Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
to expound their Authors,
where difficult, by comparing them
with other writers of the ſame time,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95950:50"/>
or Sect, or Subject, which mention
the thing doubted of more clearly;
and therefore cannot prudently be
refuſed here, where we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ordinary moral means of
finding out the true ſenſe of the
Scriptures. I do confeſs that the
Fathers do not write in a method ſo
accurate and fitted to the capacities
of beginners as our modern <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemes,</hi>
but withall, I think, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed but that they are, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon that account, more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible
than the Scriptures, ſo that
they who are obliged to be skilful
in the Scriptures cannot, upon any
account, be preſumed uncapable of
underſtanding the Fathers. Nor
ought it to be pretended that the
writings of the Fathers are too vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous
and tedious a taſk for a
young man to undertake before his
entring into the Clerical calling;
for both I do not ſee how that way
can be counted tedious, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
and onely ſecure, how long
ſoever it may be; nor is it indeed
true, that the Fathers of the firſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95950:50"/>
three Centuries were a taſk ſo very
tedious (for as for others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
the more remote they are, the
leſs competent alſo they muſt be
for informing us of the ſenſe of the
Apoſtles in an <hi>Historical way</hi> of
which alone we are now diſcourſing;
nay ſeeing that the later writers
can know nothing this way, but
what has been delivered to them by
the former, it will follow that they
cannot be able to inform us of any
thing new, after the reading of
their predeceſſors, and therefore,
though it might be <hi>convenient,</hi> yet,
after the Primitives, the reading of
the later Fathers cannot be ſo <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably
neceſſary</hi>) eſpecially if the
counterfeited Authors and writings
be excepted, together withall thoſe
that are lyable to any just ſuſpicion,
and are reputed ſuch by learned and
candid men; and if their time were
improved, as it might by moſt, and
would by all, that would undertake
this ſevere Calling upon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>us
accounts I have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
deſcribing. Beſides I do not
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95950:51"/>
know why they ſhould complain
for want of time either <hi>before,</hi> or
<hi>after,</hi> the ſuſception of holy Orders,
when as we ſee other Callings re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſeven years learning before
their liberty to practice, whereas a
much leſs time well improved would
ſerve for this, even for ordinary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities,
that were grounded in the
neceſſary rudiments of humane
learning; and they have afterwards
a maintenance provided for them
without care, that they might addict
themſelves without diſtraction to
employments of this nature. All
things therefore being conſidered,
I do not ſee how this requiſite (how
much ſoever it may amuſe ſome by
its ſeeming novelty) is either <hi>unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
or <hi>unpracticable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

from <hi>neceſſity,</hi> I might produce o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of <hi>conveniency</hi> why young
practicioners of Divinity ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
their Doctrine more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from the fountains. As firſt,
that by this means they may be beſt
able to judge impartially, when they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95950:51"/>
are leſs poſſeſſed with the favour
of a party; whereas it is, I doubt,
too frequently, the practice of thoſe
that do otherwiſe, firſt eſpouſe a
partly, afterwards to ſee with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſpectives than what preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
and interest will permit, not ſo
much to enquire what does indeed
appear truly derived from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
as what theſe conveighers
of Apoſtolical Tradition ſay in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of their own, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of their Adverſaries faction.
And Secondly, this would certainly
much contribute to the infuſing a
peaceable Spirit into the Catholick
Church (a bleſſing vigorouſly to be
proſecuted and prayed for by all
good Chriſtians) which certainly
could not chuſe but conſiderably
contribute further to the actual peace
of Chriſtendome, whoſe principles
might undoubtedly in many things
be better accommodated, if their
Spirits were leſs exaſperated. This
it would do, partly by the inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the reaſons, when exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
for it is generally the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95950:52"/>
confidence that is moſt
bold and daring; partly in deriving
principles of accommodation from
thoſe fountains which all do ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
applaud, and wherein
therefore they are moſt likely to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
if ever Providence reduce
them to a reconciliation: and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe by this means they will
be leſs likely to broach any offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

that they muſt needs from hence
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95950:53"/>
make a truer eſtimate concerning
the real deſign and duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
from thoſe times wherein
it was undertaken upon choice and

all the contrary averſations of
worldly intereſts, merely for its own

the ſimplicity of it, without any

this knowledge of the prime neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:95950:54"/>

For theſe alſo your flock, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
as well as learned, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to practice. For it is certain
that they muſt be obliged to make
uſe of the Sacraments as the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
channels where Grace may be
expected, and therefore muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with ſome <hi>Church;</hi> and
ſeeing every Church does not onely
aſſert its own, but cenſure other
Communions differing from her, and
therefore will not permit any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that enjoyes her Communion to
Communicate with any other; it
will follow that they muſt all be
concerned, as far as they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
to underſtand a reaſon, not
onely of their Communion with
ours, but their conſequent ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from other Churches. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Schiſme</hi> is a ſin of as malignant
an influence to Souls as many others
which are more infamous in the
vulgar account; it muſt needs be
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:95950:54"/>
your duty to ſecure them from that,
as well as other ſins. Now the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
imputable notion of <hi>Schiſm</hi> as
a ſin being the <hi>no-neceſſity</hi> of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Churches peace; that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
party of men may be excuſable
from it, they muſt be ſatisfied: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that not they, but their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries,
were the cauſes of the
diviſion; or that, if themſelves
were, yet it was on their part neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
which it is impoſſible for you
to do even to your own prudent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
if you do not underſtand
the true ſtate of the Controverſies,
and the full force of what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
on both ſides. And for
knowing the true ſtate of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,
you must remember, that
the Obligation incumbent on you
for knowing them does not concern
you as they are the <hi>diſputes</hi> of <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Doctors,</hi> or <hi>even tolerated Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
but as they are the <hi>Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſticks
of Communions;</hi> and
therefore they muſt be the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils</hi>
and <hi>Canons,</hi> or ſuch other pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

and the conditions practiced among
them without which their Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

be preſumed skilful in. I do not
think it ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary
that you be ſkilled in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Controverſies of meaner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
even betwixt different
Churches themſelves, but thoſe that
are mutually thought ſufficient to
<hi>ſeparate Communion;</hi> nor in all thoſe
themſelves, but in any. For as, for
joyning in a Communion, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
that all the Conditions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
for it be lawful; ſo on the
contrary, if onely one be unlawful,
it is enough to prove the ſeparation

nay, that it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>obligato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi>
and ſo ſufficient to ſatisfie him
in as much as he is concerned to

that the companion of a

without involving the good

of the blame; which
is certainly, in a more ſevere
ſenſe, verifiable of a perſon
engaged in the <hi>Clerical
Calling,</hi> becauſe of the
charge with which they are peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly
intruſted. The charge it ſelf
you may read in <hi>Ezech.</hi> xxxiii. (a
paſſage I conceive very well worthy
ſome ſerious thoughts before you
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95950:58"/>
undertake Orders) If the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
come, and take away any of
your charge, whoſoever he be, he
dyes in his ſins; but you, if you
have not warned him, are reſponſible
for him. Now I do not ſee how
you can be ſaid to have warned
him, when you have not taken the
pains to inform your ſelf of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
for conſidering that you are
not now to expect <hi>Revelations,</hi> but
to judg <hi>a poſteriori,</hi> by the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances
and ordinary courſe of
things; you cannot warn any of
danger but ſuch as appear in a ſtate
of Demerit, to whom God has
threatned it, and that, how culpable
it is, cannot be judged without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
For do not believe that
the <hi>Pulpit-denunciation</hi> of judgments
can ſuffice, or that it can reach the

(whoſe very judgment being

to diſcern them to be ſo, and his
very conſcience by that means either
<hi>actually</hi> or <hi>habitualiy</hi> ſeared) he can
be never likely to condemn himſelf,
unleſs he be reduced by a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
conſideration of his own, for
which he is not beholding to the
<hi>Miniſtery;</hi> or they are ſo managed
as that indeed no man can have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
upon that account to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
terrified. For conſidering
that thoſe denunciations that are
general do concern thoſe remainders
of ſin which are as long-lived as
themſelves in the moſt pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and accordingly that the

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:95950:59"/>
the <hi>pious</hi> as well as the <hi>impious</hi> are
concerned to joyn, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
diſſimulation or falſhood, are
ſuch as are confeſſed, in the very
ſame forms, to deſerve the penalties
ſo denounced, and yet it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that <hi>no condemnation does belong
to them;</hi> nay, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
commit the like ſins, and
therefore periodically have need of
reiterating the ſame <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> as
not being encouraged to believe it
poſſible to relinquiſh all ſuch ſins,
but onely to ſtrive againſt them; by
this means perſons are accuſtomed
to confeſs themſelves <hi>ſinners,</hi> nay,
and great ones too, and to deſerve
the ſevereſt of theſe <hi>Comminations,</hi>
and yet all this without any terrour,
ſuppoſing all this to be common to
them with the Holyeſt men living,
to whom undoubtedly no terrour
does belong; theſe things, I ſay,
being conſidered, they cannot here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be obliged to believe themſelves
actually in danger of theſe threats,
and therefore cannot, for fear of
them, be obliged to relinquiſh ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95950:59"/>
their endangering demerits.
I doubt many a poor Soul does feel
this experimentally, who, though
they have lived for many years un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a terrible Miniſtery, yet never
have been thereby actually terrified
from thoſe vices to which themſelves
acknowledg the curſe of God to be
due, eſpecially if they were ſecret,
and ſo might eſcape the cenſures and
particular reproofs of men. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that by this means of onely
<hi>Pulpit-reproofs</hi> you cannot pretend
to ſay that you have warned ſuch
perſons as either through <hi>Irreligion,</hi>
or <hi>Prophaneneſs,</hi> or <hi>contrary perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
(occaſions too frequent now a
dayes, and comprehending multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of Souls) forbear the Church,
or conſequently clear you from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accountable for them. But,
though in publick Preaching ſins
were particularized more than they
are, and charged with that peculiar
ſeverity they deſerve; yet you muſt
remember that they are very few
that can prudently be ſo dealt with:
<hi>ſuch as generally prevailed, and ſuch
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95950:60"/>
as were notorious;</hi> ſo that for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that are not reducible to theſe
heads, (many of which may prove
of as dangerous conſequence to the
concerned perſons themſelves as
these, if they periſh in them.) I do
not ſee how you can chuſe but be
Reſponſible, if you do not reprove
them by a more cloſe and particular
addreſs.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XVI"/> XVI. I know the degeneration
of our preſent Age is ſo univerſal
herein, and that men are naturally
ſo disingenuous, as that rather than
they will acknowledge themſelves
faulty, they will ſtrain their wits
for Palliations and Apologies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when countenanced by the
practice of men of an otherwiſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
converſation; that you may
not admire if you may find ſome
who may conceive me ſevere in this
point. But you must remember the
liberty I have deſigned in this whole
diſcourſe, not to flatter any one in
affairs of ſo hazardous conſequence;
and I do not doubt but that even
thoſe my opponents themſelves will
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95950:60"/>
believe this way, though more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
yet certainly, more excellent
and more ſecure, and therefore
though it were onely <hi>doubtful,</hi> yet
it were <hi>more conveniently practicable.</hi>
But for my part, I think it ſo little
doubtful, as that, laying aſide that
unwillingneſs that either <hi>intereſt,</hi> or
<hi>the ſurpriſal of a Novelty,</hi> may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
in many againſt its reception;
I think there can be little pretended
that may cauſe a rational ſcruple to
an unprejudiced underſtanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
For if a general denunciation
of Gods anger againſt impenitents
had been ſufficient, and no more
particular application had been ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to have been made than what
had been the reſult of the guilty
Conſciences, or the good natures,
of the perſons themſelves, or the
peculiar Providential preventions of
God; I do not ſee what neceſſity
there had been of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> as
Watchmen, of old; or of <hi>Preachers</hi>
now. <hi>For that God is a rewarder
and puniſher of the actions of wicked
men,</hi> none ever yet denyed that held
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95950:61"/>
a Providence, much leſs ſuch as
owned any written Revelations,
which were able more diſtinctly to
inform them what theſe rewards
were; and we know it is the reply
of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Dives,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S. Luke. xvi. 31.</note> that if <hi>Moſes</hi>
and the <hi>Prophets</hi> were not able to
aſſure them of the certainty of
theſe future rewards on ſuppoſition
of their impenitency, neither would
they be convinced though a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
were ſent them <hi>from the Dead,</hi>
ſo that upon this account the ſending
of Prophets muſt have been need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
eſpecially of ſuch as were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
from the penmen of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical
books, and were ſent on
proviſional meſſages, for concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuch alone I am at preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing.
Beſides the credibility of
theſe rewards depended on the
credit of the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf, which was
antecedent to the miſſion of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
as being that by which they
were to be <hi>tryed,</hi> and therefore
could not in any competent way be
proved by their Teſtimony; which
will appear the rather credible
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95950:61"/>
when it is remembred that temporal
calamities were the uſual ſubjects of
theſe ordinary Prophetick meſſages.
The onely thing therefore that they
muſt have been ſent for muſt have
been a particular application to the
parties concerned. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is their method ſtill to deliver
their meſſage to the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
when to the <hi>People,</hi> as it was
moſt frequently, in their <hi>publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies;</hi>
when to their <hi>Princes,</hi> or
to other <hi>particular private perſons,</hi>
ſtill their practice was accordingly.
Nor did they ever excuſe themſelves
(as too many are apt to do now)
when perſons apprehended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
particularly concerned, by
pretending that the application was
none of theirs; but ſtill they owned
it, and were ready to ſuffer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of thoſe whom they had
thus exaſperated. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
we find it reckoned among the
principal qualifications of a <hi>Prophet</hi>
even by the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves, that
he be, not onely <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>rich,</hi> but
alſo <hi>valiant.</hi> And <hi>Jeremy</hi> is thus
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95950:62"/>
encouraged to <hi>harden his face like
braſs,</hi> and that he be againſt the

               <hi>an impregnable for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,</hi>

and <hi>Eſay,</hi> as a Type of our Saviour,

which I do not know of what pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
uſe it could prove in this caſe,
unleſs it were to embolden them
that they might not fear the threats
or malice of the great ones in the
performance of their duty, which
they had not been in ſuch danger of
without this application. Beſides,
if this application were not the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
employment of an ordinary
Prophet, I do not underſtand what
it was that was blamed in the <hi>falſe
Prophets,</hi> who<note n="q" place="margin">Jer. vi 14. viii. 11.</note> 
               <hi>Preached peace
when there was no peace.</hi> For that
ever any of them was ſo impudent
as to deny the truth of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations
againſt ſinners indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is no way credible; or that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo, they could find credit in a
Nation ſo ſignally convinced of a
Providence. Their crime therefore
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:95950:62"/>
muſt have been, that they flattered
the wicked, and either made them
believe their faults to be none at all,
or not ſo great as indeed they were;
or that God would either <hi>excuſe</hi>
them <hi>particularly,</hi> or not <hi>puniſh them
in this life,</hi> or <hi>not ſuddenly,</hi> or <hi>not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely.</hi>

the nature of theſe

that, as <hi>virtue</hi> is the <hi>improvement,</hi>
ſo, <hi>vice</hi> is the <hi>debauching</hi> of the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
faculties, and therefore you
cannot expect to prevail on mens
intereſts and inclinations by a bare
repreſentment of the unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their actions; for it is clear
that <hi>Reaſon</hi> is no meaſure of the
actions of <hi>Brutes;</hi> and therefore
whileſt men live not above the <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

this you can never expect to be

you fear ſhame, or the ſpoyling of
your goods, or the pain of your
body, or death it ſelf; you muſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95950:67"/>
needs fear thoſe in whoſe power it
is to inflict them on you; and if
you do ſo, then, conſidering that
they are ſo fondly enamoured of
thoſe things that tend to their ruine
as that they bear their deprivation
with impatience, and, like madmen,
proſecute their benefactors with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions
and hoſtilities (ſo little
ſenſible they are of the favour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
on them, in diſſwading and
reſtraining them from them) you
can never, upon thoſe terms, be able
to reſcue them from their danger.
This is a qualification, though now
extremely neglected, of ſo very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous
conſequence, as that I ſhall
beſeech you to be tender of it, for
your <hi>Flocks</hi> ſake, if not for your
<hi>own.</hi> For, believe it, their everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
welfare depends more nearly on
the fidelity of your admonition;
and it is to little purpoſe for you to
keep the <hi>watch</hi> if you do not give

that may deſerve the exerciſe
of this dreaded ſeverity (as men
are generally too ingenious in palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
the occaſions of their own

the ſecurity of ſo many Souls is ſo

think it difficult, how to bring

your ſelf unſociable. For acquiring
it I ſhould adviſe you to take care
of ſpending your Tyrocinium under

a one as would be offended with
your <hi>Freedom;</hi> but rather in a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement

of an inferior little <hi>Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
1 Tim.</hi> iii. 4. 5. And this may
ſerve for acquiring an habit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.
But then for the reaſon of
it, if I may take you for the perſon
the former qualifications have ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
you to be, you cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided:
for he who values not
any <hi>Worldly enjoyment</hi> as great, can
never be awed by any worldly
<hi>Pomp;</hi> and he that undervalues e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<hi>death</hi> it ſelf, the King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
can never be affrighted by
the means of any mortal, how great
ſoever, whoſe power can extend no
further, from the performance of
his duty. But then for avoyding
the other extreme of <hi>petulancy;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it Firſt, that, if you could not
avoyd it, yet it were much the ſafer
exceſs both for your flock, and for
your ſelf: for your <hi>flock,</hi> who muſt
needs be leſs prejudiced by being
charged with fau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ts they are not
guilty of, or unſeaſonably, than by
being permitted in a total ignorance
of ſuch as are unqueſtionably dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
<hi>a falſe alarm being ſometimes
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95950:68"/>
more ſecure than none at all;</hi> and
for your ſelf, your imprudences in
this kind being alleviated by many
commendable ingredients, a zeal for
God, and a conſcientious ſenſe of
your duty, and a good intention,
and the preſervation of a vigilant
and active Spirit, which is more
frequently <hi>uſeful</hi> in your profeſſion
than its <hi>reſtraint.</hi> But Secondly,
for avoyding it, if you take care
that neither your ſelf, nor the perſon
concerned, be in a paſſion when you
adviſe him, you will both find him
more tractable, and your ſelf more
ruleable, and more ſteady, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
the preſcriptions you have
reſolved on before. And then for
furniſhing you with ſuch rules of
reſtraint of anger other ordinary
books may be ſufficient; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I forbear.</p>
            <p>XX. So also for your <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XX"/>
that it must be <hi>Sweet</hi> and
<hi>Winning,</hi> may appear from the
ſuppoſals already premiſed. For,
conſidering that the perſons, you
have to deal with, are not as yet
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95950:69"/>
ſuppoſed capable of reaſon; and
your very preſcriptions themſelves,
bluntly propoſed, are ſufficient to
make them averſe from hearkning
to you, and ſo to fruſtrate your
whole deſign by an unſeaſonable
precipitation; you muſt therefore
firſt allure them, not by the reaſons
of the duties themſelves, but by
that great good will you are to ſhew
to them, whereby they may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
as Children are, upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of their Parents, or other
friends they are fond of, to believe
that you would never adviſe them
ſuch things if you were not very
confident that they would effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
conduce to their good. Now
to convince them of this your good
will, you muſt condeſcend to their
Childiſh apprehenſions as far as is
lawful, that is, you muſt ſhew it by
a ſweet and willing readineſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
that which themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
to be for their good where it
may not prove really inconſiſtent
with it, by an avoyding all needleſs
occaſions of offending them, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95950:69"/>
by that means ſhewing an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to impoſe any thing on them to
which they are averſe, without a
great conviction of its being uſeful
for their greater intereſts. But for
this end you need not imitate them
in all their actions; for that were
not <hi>to reach them out of the ditch,</hi>
but <hi>to fall in your ſelf for Company.</hi>
But you muſt bear with their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies,
and ſtill (as near as you
can) proportion their preſent duty
to their preſent habitual abilities,
not diſcouraging them in their fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
but rather thence taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to ſtir them up to a greater
future diligence; and have a care
of making them entertain harſh and
unworthy notions of Religion: <hi>that
it is a ſtate of life, melancholy and ſad,
and a perpetual valediction to all joy
and comfort; that it renders a man
burdenſome to himſelf, and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
to all the Society with whom he
does converſe; that it is ſo wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for future hopes as that it can
have no portion in preſent enjoyments.</hi>
Rather let them know by your
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95950:70"/>
doctrine and behaviour, <hi>that it is not
an exchange of joy for ſorrow, even
in this life but of inferior, baſer, leſs
ſolid and leſs laſting ones for ſuch as
are incomparably more valuable and
more ſecure; and that it is ſo far
from diſturbing or embittering Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as that, on the contrary, it obliges
both to love and to be worthy to be
beloved, to do all the good we can to
all mankind, which muſt needs mutually
endear them; and qualifie them for a
mutual renunciation of their own wills
in complyance with each other, and
that indeed, not onely by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement.</hi>
By all means therefore be
chearful before company, that you
may not bring an ill report upon the
pleaſant land of Promiſe, like the
murmuring ſpies<note n="h" place="margin">Num. x<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

chearful as well as your ſelf (it was

any offence to any, but where justice
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95950:70"/>
and their own greater intereſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it; and even then, take care
that their offence rather be, at their
own <hi>guilt,</hi> than your <hi>way of admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
at leaſt beware that they may
have no <hi>juſt reaſon</hi> to do ſo. But
eſpecially take care to behave your
ſelf chearfully in your exerciſes of
auſterity that they may underſtand
that there are indeed other joyes
beſides thoſe of ſenſe, and that they
are chiefly then to be expected
when the mind is freeſt from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſolaces. But that which will be
a ſpecial endearment of you to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
will be neither to ſpeak evil
of any behind their backs your ſelf,
nor to hearken to ſuch as would;
to prevent all quarrels before your
preſence, which will be eaſier, either
by preventing the occaſion or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of paſſion, which will be alſo
ſo much eaſier if it be taken before
it grow unruleable; or by diverting
the diſcourſe, or withdrawing one
from the other; or, if they be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
fallen out, by endeavouring
their reconciliation, and a good un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95950:71"/>
among them for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
to be the common preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of peace among your flock, and
the Arbitrator of their differences.
Yet you must withall take heed that
this complyance be not prejudicial
to that <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi>
which is neceſſary for preſerving
that Sacrd reſpect to your <hi>Office</hi>
primarily, and to your <hi>Perſon</hi> in

for deterring many, even in
a mute way, from their sins, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of thoſe unobliterated impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Conſcience and Modeſty, and
that ſlavish honour of virtue and
ſhame of vice, which naturally ſeize
on the moſt debauched perſons ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable.
And ſeeing that the whole
recommendation of your Doctrine
is, as I ſaid before, in accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to theſe Childiſh apprehenſions
of the vulgar, reſolved into their
eſteem of your perſon; you ought
above all things to be tender of
thoſe requiſites that are neceſſary
either for acquiring this eſteem, or
its preſervation. And this ſeeming
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:95950:71"/>
contradiction that ſeems to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this <hi>Complyance</hi> and <hi>Awful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
may thus conveniently be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
if you obſerve, that your

your <hi>Awfulneſs</hi> in your <hi>Practice;</hi> by
being a mild Judge of other mens
Actions, but a ſevere cenſurer of

things in others, but the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of it in your ſelf (as you
muſt needs do if you would be <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,</hi>
and you muſt be exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

XXI. But that which is the firſt
ſecond and third requiſite for this
Calling, as the <hi>Orator</hi> ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Pronunciation</hi> in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> is <hi>a
Holy and an exemplary Life.</hi> For
ſeeing that the vulgar is thus to be
decoyed to embrace your Doctrine,
not for its <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but for the <hi>reſpect</hi>
they are firſt to entertain <hi>for its
Preacher;</hi> as you muſt maintain
your own credit among them, that
they may be ready to believe what
is taught them by you, ſo you muſt
alſo let them underſtand that what
you teach them is indeed believed
by your ſelf, and they can have no
reaſon to believe you do ſo unleſs
they ſee you practice it. For do
not the ſame duties oblige, and the
ſame menaces belong to you, as to
them; and cannot you (even by
your own confeſſion) expect a more
favourable hearing (if you may
not fear one more ſevere for the
reaſons already mentioned) and is
<hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Damnation</hi> the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
reward of thoſe actions you are
guilty of your ſelf? If you were
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:95950:73"/>
fearful that this were true, certainly
you would not venture on them;
if you be not, how is it credible
that you do believe them? If you
do not believe them your ſelf, how
can you perſwade others to believe
them for your ſake, who are (as I
ſaid before) uncapable themſelves
of judging of your ſolid Reaſons.
How little ſolid ſoever this way of
arguing be in it ſelf, yet aſſure your
ſelf, it is that on which the practices
of the vulgar, to whoſe apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
you are to accommodate your
ſelf in this affair, are mainly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
I might have ſhewn you alſo
further, what influence this would
have in procuring the qualifications
already mentioned, that belong to
Morality. For <hi>Experience;</hi> you
muſt needs be better acquainted in
dealing with other mens conditions,
when you had firſt tryed their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
in your ſelf. This would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you how tender a thing <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
is, and yet how ticklish;
how many miſunderſtandings it is
obnoxious to, and how it is influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95950:73"/>
by the difference of mens hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
and conſtitutions. And this
muſt, at leaſt, make you tender and
cautions in dealing with them.
For <hi>Prudence</hi> alſo, that being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but the <hi>impartiality where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
right Reaſon is able to judge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
circumſtances;</hi> and the <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Reaſon</hi> conſiſting in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of the underſtanding from
all prejudices, either <hi>intellectual</hi> or
<hi>moral;</hi> holineſs of life contributing
to this immunity, removing thoſe
moral prejudices which are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
concernment here, must also be
conſiderably advantageous for ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
it to judge <hi>prudently.</hi> So alſo
for <hi>Courage</hi> and <hi>Confidence,</hi> how
can he fear the faces of men who
undervalues all that for which they
fancy themſelves ſo very terrible,
even <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf with whatſoever
aggravations; who has the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of glorious future hopes,
and preſent viſitations; who is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confident of the good will of
God (from whom he receives them,
when incurred in his Service) that
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:95950:74"/>
his Tribulations ſhall be proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to his abilities; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that, if they be great, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
ſhall be the more, which
are ſo much valuable beyond them,
that the <hi>ſevereſt Tribulations</hi> prove
in the event the <hi>greateſt Bleſſings,</hi> as
intitling him to them? So alſo it
has been already ſhewn how a <hi>ſweet</hi>
and <hi>ſociable,</hi> yet <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſerious,</hi>
behaviour is either the expreſs duty
of <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf, eſpecially that of
a <hi>Clergieman,</hi> or a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
from that excellent temper
Religious exerciſes are likely to

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXII"/> XXII. Now becauſe this <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of life,</hi> as in you, muſt alſo be
<hi>Exemplary,</hi> it will therefore be
neceſſary that it have two qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
that it be <hi>Excellent,</hi> and
that it be <hi>Conſpicuous.</hi> For an
<hi>Example</hi> must be understood, in
regard of them to whom it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
to have the notion of a
<hi>Rule;</hi> and a <hi>Rule</hi> muſt be able to
rectifie the Actions that are to be
ruled by it; which it cannot do if
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95950:74"/>
either <hi>there be any obliquity in it ſelf,
or if its rectitude be unknown to the
party concerned in it.</hi> Its <hi>Excellency</hi>
muſt be neceſſary in reſpect of the
<hi>Vulgar,</hi> who are concerned to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
it; and therefore muſt exceed
the ſtrict duty of a <hi>Laick;</hi> for uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Learners do allow themſelves a
liberty of falling ſhort of their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
and therefore if ever the Laity
do reach the ſeverity of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor;
either they must thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
not make his Practice their
Precedent, or be incurious of a
further progreſs. The former I have
already intimated, how diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
it is to their ordinary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.
And how dangerous
the later is, every mans experience
may inform him; that whileſt he
growes negligent, he looſes what he
<hi>has,</hi> as well as fails of the gains he
<hi>might have</hi> made; and beſides that
is never likely to reach to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
at which, it is the duty of a
<hi>Laick,</hi> as well as a <hi>Clergieman,</hi> to
aim. And you muſt remember
with what savour they are likely to
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95950:75"/>
judge their own having reached
your example. Beſides, you ſhould
conſider that they will not meaſure
their own perfection by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of duties, but the excellent
manner of performing them; and
that they are all ſenſible (of what
is truth whether they were ſo or
not) that you are obliged to ſome
duties in which they are not any
wayes concerned; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they diſcharging their own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as well as you do yours, though
they be fewer, yet that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
with you. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſo behave your ſelf as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
no part of your duty: whether
as to your <hi>general,</hi> or your <hi>particular
Calling;</hi> as a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or as a <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gieman,</hi>
that may be ſubject to the
obſervation of men (for this kind
of <hi>Perfection</hi> is acknowledged poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
by all <hi>Protestants</hi>) and that,
not onely in omitting no duty, but
in performing all the good that may
be expected from your <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>

theſe minute things with a

the weightier matters of the Law
without reluctancy. But eſpecially

               <hi>the

that our good Actions be
known, or that we are alwayes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to conceal them; but that it
is expedient that we conceal them
when their publication may not be
peculiarly ſerviceable for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of others; not to publiſh
them for any complacency we are
to take in them our ſelves, but mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that Service to God for which
we may be enabled by our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
among men. I confeſs the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of virtues is very diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
in ſeveral regards for the
perſon: partly because <hi>Experience</hi>
ſhewes that the <hi>heats</hi> of <hi>Religious
Paſſions</hi> themſelves, as well as others,
<hi>evaporate</hi> by being <hi>vented;</hi> partly
becauſe it expoſes us more to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
and <hi>Cenſures of men,</hi> which,
whatever they be, may prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to us if they be intended by
us. For it is hard to intend them
without ſome <hi>complacency</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernedneſs</hi>
in them, which, whether
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:95950:78"/>
it be for <hi>God's ſake</hi> or <hi>our own,</hi> is
alike dangerous. For if we be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</hi>
then we muſt needs be <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged</hi>
if they fall <hi>contrary</hi> to our
expectations; or if they prove <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable,</hi>
it will be very hard to
diſtinguish what is uſeful for the
Service of God, and what onely
gratifies our own humours in the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our complacencies; which
difficulty is by ſo much the more
dangerous, inaſmuch as it is more
Spiritual, and leſs eaſily diſcernible,
virtues either ſuppoſed or real being
its moſt dangerous temptation;
which is a deplorable caſe, to be
at the expence of denying our
ſelves, and ſuffering all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of materially virtuous Actions,
and yet to looſe the reward of them
by ſeeking it unduly and prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly.
But on the other ſide, the
conveniences of having your Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
and ſeveral of your Actions
known, are: that expoſing your
ſelf hereby to <hi>publick cenſure,</hi> you
may, <hi>if true,</hi> take them for warnings
and admonitions; if falſe, for tryals
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95950:78"/>
and exerciſes of your Patience;
that you may therefore terrifie and
awe your ſelf into a greater caution,
when you remember ſo many <hi>Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
eyes ready to obſerve your lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
that you may avoyd many
impertinent temptations which all
will be aſhamed to motion to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
unlikely to entertain them.
And aſſure your ſelf that it were
much more beneficial for the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of your <hi>Flock,</hi> that you were
<hi>Hypocritical</hi> than <hi>Licentious;</hi> and
that it is the ſafer extreme to e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

threatning of our Lord,<note place="margin">Mar. vii. 38. Luk. ix. 26.</note> that <hi>of
them who are aſhamed of him before
men he will alſo be aſhamed before his
Father and his holy Angels.</hi> Now
that you may accommodate theſe
difficulties together, and ſo let your
other virtues appear, as that their
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95950:80"/>
appearance may not prove prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to your modeſty; you muſt
take heed that that publick applauſe
do not provoke you to think better
of your ſelf than you really deſerves
which you may have reaſon to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd,
if you remember: that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
men think of you, yet <hi>you are
really no greater than God knowes you
to be,</hi> and that by this meaſure you
muſt expect your reward; that men
are fallible in their judgments, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to <hi>Fondneſs,</hi> or <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
or <hi>Charity,</hi> which will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
provoke, but oblige, them to
judge well when they find no reaſon
to the contrary, though indeed
there be; by which means good
men themſelves may be miſtaken in
judging <hi>too favourably</hi> of you, and
that <hi>commendably,</hi> in reference to
themſelves; and in their Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
knowing nothing but the bare
action, but not the intention from
whence all its morality is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
and moſt ſecurely, eſtimable.
Be ſure therefore that this ſhewing
your works to others be like the

               <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. xiv. 14.</note>

on the one ſide enlightned the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi>
but on the other darkned the
<hi>Egyptians.</hi> So let their excellencies
appear outwardly, that they may
ſtir up your Spectators to the praiſe

onely their Imperfections may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
inwardly to your ſelf, which
may proſtrate you to as low a Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.

beſides what they knew, you would
reſerve ſome greater Excellencie

have regard to God, who ſees in

For if you can do any Excellent
action for which you can have no
motive or deſign in <hi>this World,</hi> then
it will be clear that, even in thoſe
whereby you may gain ſecular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe,
yet that is not your either
onely, or ultimate, motive. And in

it ſtir you up to a <hi>virtuous ſhame</hi> of
<hi>being</hi> leſs worthy than you <hi>ſeem.</hi>

this building, it cannot be <hi>finiſhed</hi> if
it be not <hi>maintained.</hi> You muſt
therefore beſides the former quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications,
which are requiſite to this

for your life, and therefore your
choice, if imprudently made, will
<hi>therefore</hi> be of worſe conſequence,
becauſe it is irrevocable; ſo that
your chief care muſt be to foreſee
whether you be able to perſevere
afterwards in maintaining what you
have begun, and that for your whole
life. And for this end you muſt
conſider your qualifications them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
whether they have appeared
onely in <hi>ſingle Acts</hi> or in <hi>Habits;</hi> or
if in Habits, whether they be <hi>newly
acquired</hi> or <hi>ſtrongly confirmed</hi> and
<hi>rooted</hi> by <hi>cuſtome;</hi> for you cannot
truſt any other Habits for their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

And for thoſe you must not

you not to be, you may be tempted
to think all that has hitherto been
ſaid digreſſive and unſeaſonable.
But you will find no reaſon to do ſo
after a little recollection. For as,
if you be not, there will be no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
for ſuch a ſurmiſe; ſo if you
be, yet it will be uſeful to you, if
not as a warning to ſhew you what
you are to do, yet at leaſt as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
both what you ought to
have done before, and what you
ought therefore to be penitent for,
if you hitherto have neglected it,
and upon what you are to lay out
your whole endeavours for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But, to proceed, ſuppoſing
now that you are the perſon I have
been hitherto deſcribing, you cannot
ſtand in need of any <hi>particular
Rules;</hi> for if you be thus called by
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95950:83"/>
God you ſhall be <hi>taught by him</hi> in
the performance of the duty to
which he has called you (I mean this
<hi>Teaching</hi> as well as the <hi>Call</hi> in an <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Providential ſenſe,</hi> which is
that wherein the Propheſies concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it are verified under the Goſpel)
for both this <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>other abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities</hi>
will be able to guide, and this
<hi>Piety</hi> to ſuggeſt, what is fit to be
done upon all particular exigencies;
and as thoſe themſelves are gifts of
the Spirit, ſo their improvement
will intitle you to greater, ſo that
their direction and influence is rather
to be imputed to God than man,
though it be true, that now by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of the Evangelical Covenant
they are uſually conferred in the uſe
of ordinary means, and this reaching
particular circumſtances muſt needs
make all rules unneceſſary. If you
do not underſtand this coherence,
you may more clearly by this chain
of principles: First, the Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
teaching and direction of God is
that of right reaſon, ſo that they that
are led by it are led by God; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:95950:84"/>
that we may be led by right
reaſon two things are <hi>neceſſary,</hi> and
theſe two are <hi>perfectly ſufficient:</hi>
First, that the rational faculties be
rectified; and Secondly, that the
lower appetite and other executive
faculties be in a ready diſpoſition of
being obedient to reaſon. And
both theſe muſt needs have been
ſuppoſed in the qualifications now
mentioned. For the rectifying of
the rational faculty does require
onely: that nothing be taken for
granted precariouſly, and that the
underſtanding be not diverted from
its ordinary natural courſe of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
things to the full; for it is
from the firſt principles of reaſon
<hi>impoſſible</hi> that the underſtanding
taking no principles for granted but
ſuch as deſerve to be ſo, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
orderly in deducing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
from them, ſhould be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
I do not mean that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
proceeding thus is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
infallible as to the <hi>nature of
the thing,</hi> becauſe it may miſtake
ſome principles for ſelf-evident that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:95950:84"/>
are not ſo, merely upon an account
of that natural dulneſs it contracts
from the body; but it is alwayes
infallible <hi>as a rule of Morality,</hi> that
is, <hi>the lower faculties conforming to it
can never be guilty of any Immorali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
becauſe the error, if any be, muſt
needs be <hi>invincible,</hi> and ſo <hi>inculpable.</hi>
And upon this account God, who
does not undertake, nor is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to direct the underſtanding any
further than it is neceſſary for the
ſaving of the perſon, cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
conceived to have any other
Infallibility in his deſign than this
moral one, at least, is not obliged
to have it. Now for the rectifying
of the rational faculties you are
<hi>Firſt,</hi> ſuppoſed to have uſed means
for informing it by your ſkill in thoſe
ſeveral Studies which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
adviſed; you are <hi>Secondly,</hi>
diſſwaded and prevented from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibing
any prejudices, or any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
affections for one party by
your immediate recourſe to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginals
themſelves; you are <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
adviſed for the most accurate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:95950:85"/>
of your judgment in a
clear and advantageous method of
reaſoning; and <hi>Fourthly,</hi> in the uſe
of all theſe means you have been
ſhewn how you may in an ordinary
way be confident of the aſſiſtance
of Divine Providence in ſuch caſes
as you cannot ſecure your ſelf in by
your moral diligence: whether for
removing ſuch prejudices as you
could otherwiſe hardly diſcover to
be ſo; or by Providential placing
you in ſuch circumſtances wherein
thoſe reaſons may offer themſelves
to your cognizance which you could
otherwiſe never have diſcovered;
or by capacitating your judgment
for a more equal cenſure concerning
them; whether by improving your
natural capacity to a more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
perſpicuity; or by rendring
intellectual objects more intelligible
by your greater experience, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
and fixation of your mind
upon them; or by fitting them to
ſuch times when your judgment
may be leſs diſtracted, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
more quick and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:95950:85"/>
and by giving his holy Spirit
by virtue of which they are to be
diſcerned. Now when all theſe
things are thus ſecured, certainly
there cannot be more probable hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
means thought on for finding
even the truth it ſelf, and therefore
the rational faculties must have the
greateſt ſecurity they are capable
of, and to greater they cannot be
obliged. And then, conſidering
that natural reaſon thus purified is

               <hi>Herod,</hi> that the judgment of
Reaſon thus rectified is <hi>not the voice

the ſecond thing required to this
rectitude of Reaſon, the ſubjection
of the lower Appetite to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
part of the Soul thus rectified,
that is the whole deſign of a <hi>good

of at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XXVI"/> XXVI. So that, if you be already
Ordained, you ſee, that according to
theſe principles, your main duty
will be, either ſeriouſly to ſet your
ſelf to the acquiring theſe qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
if you have hitherto neglected
them; or, if you have not, <hi>to take
a care of keeping your Garment that
none may ſee your ſhame, and reteining
your firſt love</hi> (the very warnings of
our Saviour himſelf to thoſe of
your profeſſion <hi>Rev.</hi> iii. 18. ii. 4.)
to perſevere in thoſe excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
that you have ſo happily
begun, and from thence to deduce
Rules for your following practices.
For rendring theſe requiſites a little
more uſeful, I ſhall onely add two
things more, and ſo put an end to
your preſent diſturbance. The firſt
ſhall be concerning the manner ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of acquiring, or exerciſing th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe
gifts, eſpecially relating to practice,
that may be moſt beneficial both to
your ſelf, and the publick; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:95950:86"/>
concerning the manner of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with your Pariſhioners that may
make them capable of your Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.
Concerning the former, it
has been already intimated before,
that the moſt proper way of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading
mankind is firſt to allure
them to the performance of actions
<hi>materially virtuous,</hi> and by a frequent
repetition of them to beget an <hi>eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>
and <hi>delight,</hi> and a <hi>rooted habit,</hi>
which, when acquired, and that
<hi>averſeneſs</hi> and <hi>ſenſuality,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had rendred men uncapable of
good counſels, being removed, you
may then propound your reaſons
with ſucceſs, and rectifie their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions,
and render them <hi>formally
virtuous.</hi> That therefore which
will moſt concern you for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
as well as your <hi>own Soul,</hi> is, the
rectifying your intention. Seeing
therefore right intention is to be
meaſured from the due end, you
muſt take care that all your Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
actions in general be deſigned
with an intention ſo habitual and
deeply rooted, as that all particular
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95950:87"/>
ones may, according to the degree
of deliberation they proceed from,
partake of the ſame either <hi>virtually</hi>
and <hi>interpretatively,</hi> or <hi>explicitely</hi> and
<hi>particularly.</hi> Now the proper end
of Religious actions being the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and pleaſing of God, you muſt
take care that they be performed
with that deſign which you know
to be moſt pleaſing to him: and
that is the doing them purpoſely
for his ſake; and that they are ſo
done you may beſt ſatisfie your ſelf
by examining whether they proceed
from a principle of Divine love.
Exerciſe your ſelf therefore daily
to bring your ſelf to this habitual
ſenſe of the Divine love, which will
even in this life abundantly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
the pains you may be at in
acquiring it. For both in reſpect of
<hi>your ſelf</hi> and of <hi>your Flock</hi> you ſhall
find it advantageous. To your ſelf
the advantages will be: that by
this means you ſhall best ſecure the
reward of your virtuous actions,
when you do not onely perform
them, but perform them upon a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95950:87"/>
motive; that by this means
your duty ſhall become, not a <hi>task,</hi>
but, a <hi>real pleaſure,</hi> proceeding from
ſuch a pleaſing and endearing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and having the omnipotence
and good will of God to <hi>ſecure you</hi>
from the fears of diſappointment
when your deſires are <hi>reaſonable;</hi>
and as a ſure <hi>refuge</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary</hi> to
have recourſe to, when they <hi>are not;</hi>
and that you will not be ſubject to
the ſlavery of ſuch deſires them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which are the Originals of
all miſery even in this life; and your
performance of your duty will be
more univerſal; not onely in things
<hi>agreeing</hi> with your humour, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in thoſe which are moſt <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory</hi>
to it, which will be ſo much
the <hi>more acceptable</hi> to God by how
much it is <hi>leſs ſo.</hi> to our ſelves. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
it were well that you would
endeavour to render your love as
<hi>rational</hi> as you can, and as little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
on the paſſions of the lower
appetites; for by this means your
tranquillity will be continual, and
not depend on the viciſſitudes of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95950:88"/>
humours; ſeeing, if you be led
onely by reaſon, that being alwayes
<hi>true,</hi> muſt conſequently be alwayes
<hi>ſeaſonable;</hi> and that the reaſon
whereby you judge concerning your
own condition were rather ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on your <hi>Actions</hi> than your <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
ſo as never to think better
of your ſelf when you find your
affections <hi>warm,</hi> if your actions are
not correſpondent; nor the worſe,
when your affections <hi>Flagg,</hi> your
actions ſtill continuing conformable.
This rational rectifying of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
would ſtill oblige you to
keep an habitual attention and
watchfulneſs over your actions, and
yet would make attention it ſelf
leſs neceſſary by being habitual, and
make it leſs affected. It would
make it <hi>leſs neceſſary,</hi> becauſe <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
habits,</hi> as well as <hi>vitious,</hi> would
breed a <hi>facility</hi> and <hi>inclination</hi> to
<hi>virtuous actions</hi> even antecedently to
<hi>deliberation.</hi> It would make it <hi>leſs
affected,</hi> becauſe Piety would appear
in ſuch actions where affectation
could not take place, as well as
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:95950:88"/>
where it might (for indeliberate
actions are not capable of affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
and becauſe it would make an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformity
in all actions of your life,
which were remarkable. Which

the intereſt of friendſhip, nor
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:95950:110"/>
my own inclination, nor the copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of the ſubject wherein you
have employed me, nor my little
leaſure for things ſo unſignificant, will
permit me to retaliate your comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
and therefore, I hope, you
will excuſe me though I be abrupt
in my addreſſes to the reſolution of
your propoſal. And that I may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
that generality and unpractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs
and obſcurity to which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>methodical
diſcourſes are very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious;
and may contrive my
thoughts in as few words and as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
time as the ordinary frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
of my other Studies will
allow me, and withall more uſefully
and diſtinctly to your purpoſe: I
conceive it moſt convenient to ſhew
1. <hi>the deſign of Scholaſtical Divinity,
and the general requiſites thereunto;</hi>
and thence Secondly, <hi>the more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
influence of ſaecular learning in
order to it;</hi> and Thirdly, <hi>ſome few
books to initiate you herein, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
directions that are adviſeable in
your ſtudies of them;</hi> and Laſtly,
<hi>the order wherein I conceive them moſt
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:95950:110"/>
ſucceſsfully intelligible;</hi> in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of which method you will
have, not onely my <hi>counſel,</hi> but my

            <p>II. For the firſt, that I may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/>
a miſtake which I believe you
will be ready to take up becauſe of
the ordinary ſignification of the
term, it will be neceſſary to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn
you, that by <hi>Scholaſtical Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
I do not intend that onely which
is rigorouſly ſo called, but more
largely all, wherein there is required
ſkill for the deduction of inferences;
whether for the reſolution of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,</hi>
or <hi>doubts of Conſcience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi>
as it comprehends that which is
<hi>Textuary</hi> as well as what is <hi>purely
Rational</hi> in oppoſition to that which
is <hi>Practical</hi> and <hi>Inartificial,</hi> as <hi>Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
For concerning this later, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
being a vice moſt repurgnant
to its end, which is ſerious perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
and to which Scholars are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
too much addicted for this very
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:95950:111"/>
reaſon of their too Critical obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of the rules of <hi>Art;</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it most expedient that it be
contrived as <hi>natural</hi> as is poſſible,
to which it will be neceſſary that all
things which may have an influence
on your particular end be prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidered, your <hi>Subject,</hi> and your
<hi>Auditory</hi> and your own <hi>Genius,</hi> and
your very manner of delivery, to
which every thing may ſo agree as
if they had been your onely incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
and what you ſaid had been
without any <hi>deliberation;</hi> and to
this purpoſe though you may read
ancient and late Authors that are
reſpectively commended in their
kind, I ſhould not adviſe you the
imitation of any particularly, but
let your own diſpoſition chuſe for it
ſelf without any deſigned reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
But this onely by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion,
though I believe pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
becauſe poſſibly pertinent to
your purpoſe. <hi>Scholaſtical Divinity</hi>
in the ſenſe now explained is that
which I conjecture more principally
intended by you; and to which I
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:95950:111"/>
ſhall therefore confine my future
diſcourſe. Its deſign therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for the clearing of ſuch propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as, although they be neceſſary
for faith or practice, yet their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
depends upon the explication
of ſuch terms as are not obviouſly
intelligible by the vulgar: the
moſt convenient way for determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the requiſites of this will be by
ſhewing the nature of thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
from whence it deduceth its
particular Concluſions. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is requiſite for underſtanding
the true ſenſe of them, muſt alſo be
ſo to the certainty of their <hi>Illations;</hi>
and therefore Religion <hi>objectively</hi>
taken being <hi>a Revelation of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
will as the meaſure of ours, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

our duty in order to happineſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the
difference of theſe principles which
are <hi>per ſe nota</hi> in their kinds muſt
ariſe from the different lights under
which they are manifeſted, that
matters concerning Religion are
diſcovered by a <hi>ſupernatural Divine
light</hi> as exceeding that of our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:95950:112"/>
Reaſon,</hi> the onely meaſure of
all our <hi>natural knowledg</hi> (which yet
is not to be underſtood, as ſome
dangerouſly conceive, of the <hi>light of
the faculty,</hi> as if <hi>Reaſon</hi> were not
able certainly and evidently to
know the credibility, at leaſt, of
what is ſo propounded; nor of the
<hi>light</hi> of the <hi>formal object</hi> of <hi>aſſent,</hi>
as if that were not alwayes propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to the faculty (which if it
were not, it were both impoſſible
to be diſcerned, and unſafe to be
aſſented to, ſeeing many things may
and do very falſely pretend to ſuch
a plauſible title) but rather in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the material object, which
ſometimes has a <hi>natural connexion</hi>
with the <hi>formal,</hi> and ſometimes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>voluntary inſtitution</hi>) for ſo,
that I may clear my mind by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
when we know <hi>God</hi> from
the <hi>Creatures,</hi> this whole <hi>light</hi> is
<hi>natural,</hi> not onely in regard of the
<hi>faculty,</hi> nor of the <hi>creatures</hi> which
have a <hi>natural proportion</hi> to it, but
alſo of the naturally-dependent
connexion of the Creatures on God,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:95950:112"/>
who is known by them, but when
we know the <hi>Trinity</hi> from <hi>Divine
Revelation</hi> propounded by <hi>men,</hi> and
atteſted by <hi>miracles,</hi> although both
of them are natural in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſenſes; yet neither this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
propoſition nor theſe atteſting
miracles have any natural or neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
connexion with the doctrine of
the <hi>Trinity,</hi> which is propounded
as credible by them; but with the
<hi>ſupernatural will</hi> of the <hi>Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent,</hi>
upon which account alſo
this <hi>Light</hi> in relation to this object
is called <hi>ſupernatural.</hi> Theſe things
though poſſibly as yet you may not
ſee the uſe of, yet hereafter you
may perceive to remove the very
material miſunderſtandings of moſt
<hi>Schoolmen</hi> in this queſtion, and to
be very fundamental to what we
ſhall hereafter adviſe conſequential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to theſe principles.</p>
            <p>III. Seing therefore that from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/>
hence it appears in general that the
<hi>light of the faculty</hi> is abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the improving all that
is <hi>objective,</hi> whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural;</hi>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:95950:113"/>
I conceive it very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to exerciſe frequently your
discurſive faculty in <hi>Theſes</hi> upon ſome
<hi>difficult Queſtion</hi> which you may
meet with in your ſtudies, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
in ſuch as are <hi>intricate</hi> and
<hi>ſubtle;</hi> for theſe will beſt enable
you to conceive aright in others of
a like nature, though of a different
matter. The time for this, if you
ſhall think fit to deſign a particular
one, were I believe fitteſt in the
<hi>morning,</hi> when the Spirits are more
clear and ſubtle, and your thoughts
more compoſed, and ſo every way
more apt for <hi>Contemplation.</hi> In the
performing hereof I would not have
you inſiſt on your Authors method.
(For which purpoſe it were well
your morning-Theſis concerned a
Queſtion you had ſtudied the night
before) but rather endeavour up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
full deliberation of what has
been produced for both opinions,
to deliver your own conceptions,
and to exerciſe your own invention
as much as is poſſible; and withall
in your method, not to mind onely
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95950:113"/>
the <hi>private concernment</hi> of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
you are then handling, but
alſo the <hi>general</hi> of others of the
ſame kind, ſo as that your experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in this may capacitate you for
others: as to conſider the <hi>true ſenſe</hi>
of the <hi>terms,</hi> if there be any mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
ambiguity that is ſuſpicious of
being miſunderſtood by the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
parties; but not to ſpend
time on them when they are obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and trivial, and of none or little
moment for determining the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Queſtion; and then faithfully to
enquire into the true ſtate of the
Queſtion, which you were not to
think you underſtand, and ſo not to
define your own thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, before you have firſt candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examined the true ſenſe of both
<hi>Adverſaries,</hi> the want of which you
will find to be an original of moſt
of thoſe <hi>Logomachyes</hi> which are ſo
frequent in the <hi>Schools,</hi> and I believe
generally received in very many of
thoſe Controverſies which divide
the <hi>Communion</hi> of whole Churches;
whence it proceeds that many of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:95950:114"/>
the arguments of both parties need
no other ſolution than the clearing
of their Adverſaries meaning, which
being once performed, they are
found impertinent and unconcluſive,
And for the attaining of this I would
not have you rely on violent <hi>Bigots,</hi>
or the followers of factions, who
ſpeak onely by roat, and beſides the
deſign and reaſon of their Maſters,
and are <hi>reſolved,</hi> nay and many times
<hi>obliged,</hi> to defend them in whatever
they ſay, though never ſo <hi>Paradox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical,</hi>
and are frequently put to their
ſhifts to invent defenſible gloſſes,
how expreſly ſoever the Author has
explained his meaning, and where
he is the leaſt obſcure, are much
more favourable to what is more
eaſily defenſible; nor on the bare
words of the firſt Authors, it being
ordinary for Controvertiſts to <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak</hi>
themſelves, and to bring in
many things <hi>ex abundanti,</hi> which
though they might think <hi>probably
true,</hi> yet might well be ſpared with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
prejudice of their cauſe; and
much leſs from the partial relations
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:95950:114"/>
of their Adverſaries: but rather
from the riſe and occaſion of the
Queſtion, from the deſign and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of themſelves and their
Adverſaries, where, if on either
ſide you will allow any thing for
violence, you will have more reaſon
to ſuſpect it of the <hi>later Aſſailant</hi>
than the <hi>firſt Proponent,</hi> who, no
Adverſary appearing, may reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
be preſumed to have delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
his mind with leſs deſign, and
more ſimplicity; and from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with their other Principles.
And never ſatisfie your ſelf of your
ſucceſs in this enquiry till you have
found out ſome great veriſimilitude
that might very plauſibly perſwade
a judicious and ingenuous man to
your Adverſaries opinion, if ſwayed
with his prejudices; for it is hard
to be ſo generally uncharitable as
to believe that there are not ſome
ſuch that maintain all much received
opinions. And to this purpoſe I
conceive it very convenient that
you be converſant with other works
of the Author from whom you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:95950:115"/>
that you may thence perceive
what principles he does <hi>otherwiſe</hi>
much rely on, and what his <hi>moral
diſpoſition</hi> is, for this may be very
effectual for ſwaying him when the
main arguments uſed are <hi>popular</hi>
and <hi>declamatory;</hi> and of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are moſt of thoſe Queſtions
which divide great and numerous
Eccleſiaſtical ſocieties, as were eaſie
to inſtance and evince if I were not
affraid of being tedious. When
you have thus gained the <hi>true ſenſe</hi>
and <hi>uſe</hi> of the Queſtion, your nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
approaches to its reſolution you
may make in this order: Firſt to
conſider the nature of the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
for though in ſome caſes they
may contribute, yet they are never
to be the onely motives for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
your aſſent; and therefore
you are to ſee that Firſt, they never
hinder you from embracing a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
evidence <hi>more convincing</hi> than
that on which themſelves are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
nor Secondly, from <hi>impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſidering</hi> the force of that which
does onely pretend it, though in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:95950:115"/>
the event it do not prove ſo; but
onely Thirdly, when upon full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
you find the contrary but
equally probable with what you do
at preſent believe, there you may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
ſubmit your ſelf to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
that has placed you in ſuch
circumſtances as thus incline you ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than hazard your preſent peace
for an <hi>onely equal</hi> contentment in the
contrary, ſo that it be done <hi>modeſtly,</hi>
without any cenſorious reflections
on ſuch as diſſent from you; and
that you would conſider what they
are diſtinctly, and if you find your
ſelf partially affected to either of
them, there to be cautious that it
do not betray you to any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable.
And in general, for
the avoyding of them all, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it very adviſeable that you be
not too prodigal in uttering your
thoughts concerning any Theologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Queſtion of moment before a
multitude with any concernedneſs
and vehemence before you have firſt
examined it by theſe forementioned
Preſcriptions. After this, for the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95950:116"/>
moſt faithful diſcovery of the <hi>nature</hi>
and <hi>force</hi> of the <hi>proofs,</hi> you ſhould
diſtinguiſh from their <hi>differences</hi>
thoſe things wherein both parties
are <hi>agreed,</hi> and on which as on <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
principles</hi> they ground their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.
For theſe you will find
to be of very great uſe for judging
the particulars, unto the which, if
you be ſatisfied with them, you may
deſcend more cloſely, aſſuring your
ſelf that, however their opinions
may, yet, it is impoſſible that their
reaſons ſhould, be really contrary:
That you may therefore find diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly
how far they are concluſive, and
to whether opinion they are more
favourable; it were well that Firſt
omitting that multitude of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
ones that are produced for both,
the whole force were ſummed up
in one <hi>a priori;</hi> wherein you might
at one view perceive the whole ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of their <hi>principles:</hi> and then
that you divide them into ſo many
<hi>Propoſitions,</hi> diſpoſed in the order
wherein they follow from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which when you have done,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95950:116"/>
you may then examine Firſt, the
abſolute truth of theſe principles
diſtinctly; and Secondly, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
from each other; and
then Thirdly, the truth of theſe
premiſes relatively: what ſenſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to be true that theſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
may be inferred from them;
and whether they be indeed true in
theſe particular ſenſes that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite;
and by theſe means you
will moſt probably find the true
and faithful meaſure of diſcerning
how far they are concluſive, which
you may then compare with the
true ſenſe of the contrary Opinion
as you have formerly explained it,
and ſo of the contrary proofs with
this, and an you find them exactly
agreeing ſo you may determine.
Theſe rules I have the more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
inſiſted on, becauſe, as they
are rarely taken notice of, and more
rarely obſerved by our modern <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertiſts,</hi>
ſo, to me they ſeem the
moſt ſucceſsful for the avoyding
thoſe miſtakes and fallacies which
are too frequent among them; for
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95950:117"/>
by this means you will more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
underſtand the Queſtion, your
proofs will be more directly levelled
againſt your Adverſary, and his
main objections will be ſuppoſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
before you are determined,
and for others which ſtand in need
of more particular anſwers (they
being weaker) you may be leſs ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous.
Nor do I think all of theſe
neceſſary in all Queſtions to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
conſidered, but principally
for the moſt important ones of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity;
and ſome, at leaſt, to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to all of what nature ſoever;
and that ſuch regard be had of thoſe
which are not, that before you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
them you be aſſured that they
are indeed <hi>impertinent.</hi> And in the
management of the whole, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
where you do endeavour <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfaction,</hi>
it were well you were
as <hi>brief,</hi> as <hi>clear,</hi> as <hi>diſtinct,</hi> and as
<hi>methodical,</hi> as is poſſible.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> IV. Having thus ſhewn you the
form of managing reaſon in general,
I believe you do expect that I ſhould
deſcend particularly to direct your
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95950:117"/>
Studies that you may be furniſhed
with materials. And this I ſhall
attempt in purſuance of my former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſigned method, in both thoſe
kinds of <hi>Principles,</hi> by which, as I
ſaid, all <hi>Theological Controverſies</hi> are
to be determined. For the firſt,
thoſe which are <hi>rational,</hi> I would
commend that too much decried Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
among moſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of <hi>School-Divinity:</hi>
for conſidering that the
very foundations and principles of
all Religion are <hi>natural,</hi> that all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural
Revelations are but <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory
complements</hi> to theſe, where
Nature was <hi>actually debauched,</hi> or
<hi>originally inſufficient,</hi> but never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to give a <hi>compleat digeſt</hi> of
them; and indeed do either not
mention them at all, or where they
do, yet not <hi>profeſſedly,</hi> but upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of others; and then it ſelf
they are rather <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
or, where <hi>preſcribed,</hi> yet
rather as to the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of
their exerciſe than as to their <hi>moral</hi>
and <hi>univerſal obligation;</hi> ſo that
here, <hi>Reaſon</hi> is wholy left even by
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:95950:118"/>
God himſelf to the evidence of its
own inquiry; and this not onely as
to thoſe particulars which are ſo
plain and obvious as that they even
offer themſelves without inquiry,
and it is impoſſible to be ignorant
of them without a <hi>groſs negligence,</hi>
or a <hi>reſolved obſtinacy,</hi> but ſuch

your wit to make any Teſtimony
deſenſible before you are otherwiſe
convinced of its credibility, and at
leaſt let it not be as a principal mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of your determination; that
you never trouble your ſelf much
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:95950:122"/>
with thoſe reaſons themſelves which,
as they are onely propounded as
probable, ſo they, are confeſſed to
be unneceſſary; but Firſt, conſider
the nature of the Queſtion, whether
the arguments, whereon the whole
ſtreſs of its aſſent can onely be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
grounded, and which if they be
weak the definition cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
be <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or <hi>Authority;</hi> and
if it be <hi>Reaſon grounded on Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
(as moſt of the <hi>School-Queſtions</hi>
are) that then you urge the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
no farther than the Authority
will warrant you; and remember
that a leſs will ſuffice, when all the
uſe of reaſon is for rendring the
Concluſion it ſelf <hi>defenſible,</hi> for that
proceeds on particular evidences
whereby it appears to us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
does not require a <hi>real,</hi> but <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-way
apparent,</hi> credibility; but
where the reaſons grounded on theſe
phraſes and manners of expreſſing
the Article are drawn to the direct
proof of its real truth, or are taken
as principles for the probation of
others; it were then reaſonable to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:95950:122"/>
have recourſe to <hi>Lombard</hi>'s Text,
and to examine Firſt, whether that
doctrine be really taught by that
Father, who is by him quoted for it?
and Secondly, whether it be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by him as his own private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
or as the ſenſe of the Church;
and whether dogmatically, or in heat
of controverſie? if as the ſenſe of
the Church, then Thirdly, what was
the ground of it, whether the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of univerſal Tradition, or
aequivalencies in the Scriptures; or
the general ſenſe onely of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
and whether they took it up
for the evidence of its proper rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or originally from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of ſome private perſon, who
was commended in theſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and from whom it was derived
by the reſt without any new exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination?
for in ſome of theſe
things you will find moſt of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bards</hi>
principles to be deficient, they
being for the much greater part
tranſcribed from St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> But
it may be a more direct way for
knowing the rational modes of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:95950:123"/>
whereon the Church
grounded her arguments (in thoſe
Articles which are generally and
ſurely believed for Revelation, and
wherein ancient and univerſal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may be preſumed more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
expreſſive of the genuine
ſenſe of Tradition than our private
reaſonings, as in the Trinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation)
will be by examining
what principles of this kind are
ſuppoſed in her diſcourſes with the
<hi>ancient Hereticks</hi> in the firſt general
Councils, moſt of her definitions
there being, as I formerly ſaid,
grounded on <hi>Theological reaſon.</hi>
And therefore I would adviſe you
in general before your particular
enquiries, to ſatisfie your ſelf how
far your reſolution is to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on particular reaſon, that ſo,
if they ſhould fail, as they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
in many things which yet
upon other accounts are very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
credible, you may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
<hi>condemn</hi> the Concluſion as
<hi>ſimply falſe</hi> becauſe of the falſhood
of their improper principles. And
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:95950:123"/>
what Queſtions are onely determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
by reaſon you have ſeveral
inſtances in the beginning of the
former Paragraph.</p>
            <p>VI. But it remains, for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="VI"/>
of this firſt part of
my taſk, that I proceed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſort of principles, namely ſuch
as are known by <hi>Divine Revelation.</hi>
And here ſeeing the reſolution of
no Parties is againſt the <hi>plain words,</hi>
or at leaſt the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
and it is farther agreed that
the bare Grammatical ſignification
of the words is of no other force
for expreſſing the ſpeakers mind
than as it is ordinarily reaſonable
to preſume that he intended this
where there are not particular ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious
of believing otherwiſe;
therefore for the bringing theſe
things home to the deciſion of our
preſent Controverſies, it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
to enquire Firſt, what ſenſe
of them is aequivalent with the
Concluſions to be proved by them?
and Secondly, what reaſon there is
to believe that this ſenſe was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:95950:124"/>
by the Speaker; and where this
is ambiguous and both of them ſeem
applicable without abſurdity, the
onely way for determining which of
them was intended by him muſt be
by examining all thoſe things which
may be ſuppoſed as notorious to
that <hi>Auditory</hi> to whoſe underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
he was to accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and what was onely likely to
prove efficacious in reference to his
deſign. And though this later be
to be performed by <hi>reaſon.</hi> by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
their <hi>miſapprehenſions;</hi> and
then conſidering what were in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
moſt proper for their <hi>correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and which particular ſenſe is
moſt rationally reducible to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
yet the former will be moſt
ſatisfactorily reſolved by <hi>Philologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
learning: by enquiring how the
ſame Author uſed the ſame expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in other clearer parallel places;
how the Auditors themſelves uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
underſtood it, and ſo to examine
the <hi>Idiomes</hi> either of the place or
Country from other their contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
writers; and if the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95950:124"/>
of the Speech depended on
a matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> to which it allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and of which none of them
could probably be preſumed igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
then the moſt ſure way both
for underſtanding that particular
phraſe and all other diſcourſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
of the ſame ſubject, will be
by clearing the thing it ſelf, and
poynting at thoſe inſtances, in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to which thoſe expreſſions
might have been occaſioned, which
had been otherwiſe unintelligible.
And to this end you may more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
diſcern Firſt, the neceſſity of the
<hi>Tongues</hi> wherein they were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
written; for it is very poſſible,
either by reaſon of the <hi>affinity</hi> or
<hi>homonymy,</hi> or for want of anſwering
words in the other Tongues, for
<hi>Tranſlations</hi> to be miſtaken, at leaſt,
not to be ſo ſecure as to ground ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which may be very much
endangered by the very uncautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the expreſſion; and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
the <hi>Idiomes of thoſe Tongues,</hi>
which are frequently occaſions of
miſtakes in them that rely on Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95950:125"/>
that render them <hi>verbatim,</hi>
without conſidering their impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the <hi>Originals,</hi> as is uſual
both in the reputed LXXII and the
<hi>vulgar Latine,</hi> which were generally
followed by the <hi>Greek</hi> and later <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>
Fathers, and many perplexities
might be inſtanced which are raiſed
by them from thence, which have
no difficulty in the Originals. And
for this it will be convenient to be
acquainted, not onely with the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
<hi>Text</hi> it ſelf (which, eſpecially
in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> are all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
remaining of the purer anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Hebrew,</hi> and therefore can give
little light to the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> but
alſo with thoſe Tongues, which
ſeem at firſt derived from it, as moſt
of the <hi>Orientals</hi> are; but thoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
into which it afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated
after the ruine of their
Government, by reaſon of their
mixture with other conquering Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Such was the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity,
as appears from part of <hi>Jeremy, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and thoſe parts of the
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:95950:125"/>
               <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſes</hi> which are truly
inſcribed to <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Onkelos;</hi>
and <hi>Syriack</hi> in the time of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
as is obſerved by learned men
from moſt of theſe <hi>Hebrew words</hi>
mentioned in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> by
mixture of the <hi>Syro-Macedones</hi> after
the prevalency of the <hi>Grecian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy;</hi>
for in theſe it ſeems more
probable that the words which were
afterwards impoſed in ſtead of the
genuine <hi>Hebrew</hi> without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
where the things were pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed,
and whileſt the Notions were
freſh in memory, did more exactly
anſwer them than thoſe that wanted
theſe advantages; and Thirdly, the
<hi>Idiomes of the Perſon</hi> himſelf, of his
wit, of his Country, of his educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for it is clear that the Style of
the Scriptures is very different: ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lofty, or low; or eloquent, or
rational, in accommodation to the
writers natural abilities. For thus
the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> writers have many
<hi>Hebraiſms,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſome <hi>Cilicia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſms,</hi>
as you may find inſtanced by
St. <hi>Hierome ad Algas. Q.</hi> 9. and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95950:126"/>
on the Romanes.</hi> And theſe are
of great moment both for varying
the ſignification of the ſame phraſes,
and making them more or leſs-accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately
intelligible in grounding ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
on them; and Fourthly,
<hi>the Antiquities alluded to;</hi> and theſe
not onely ſuch as are <hi>directly aimed
at,</hi> and with approbation, but alſo
ſuch as are <hi>purpoſely oppoſed;</hi> for
thus <hi>Maimonides</hi>

the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Chaldaean</hi> and

there are no very great aſſiſtances
for it in our now-extant writers;

them to their proper place. In

of its traditional doctrines

and here it ſelf betwixt what they
reputed ſuch from ſome judicial infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences

For in the former I then endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſhew their fallibility from that
unaccurate way of arguing which
prevailed generally among them;
and thoſe unſecure principles on
which they relyed, which though

learning in order to thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
deſigns of the <hi>Study of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi>
I ſhall inſiſt on the method
already obſerved in that. And
though it were eaſie by an induction
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95950:129"/>
in all humane ſciences whatſoever,
to ſhew this ſerviceableneſs; yet
becauſe ſo large a taſk might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
diſcourage you, as not being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable
in one life; and their uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
is very different in its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
ſome being onely convenient,
and ſome abſolutely neceſſary; ſome
neceſſary for your own ſatisfaction,
and ſome for the information of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
ſome for more rare and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual,
and ſome for your ordinary
Auditories: and you will find their
uſe in your obſervation of theſe,
and may accordingly more or leſs
engage your ſelf in them as you
ſhall find your ſelf invited by your
own <hi>Genius,</hi> or <hi>Curioſity;</hi> I ſhall
therefore mainly meddle with ſuch
as are introductory and general,
and are of uſe for the moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ends; your own ſatisfaction, and
that of your ordinary Auditory.
And firſt, for that which is rational,
and rigorouſly called <hi>School-divinity,</hi>
moſt of the terms wherein its
Questions are expreſſed being <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical,</hi>
the uſe of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95950:130"/>
that of the <hi>modern Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
which in later Ages has ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally
prevailed in the <hi>Schools,</hi> is
ſo obvious as that I cannot ſuſpect
you ignorant of it. But yet, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
you may be deſirous to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of the diſtinction of thoſe
parts which are neceſſary from thoſe
which are not; that ſo you may
know at preſent where to fix your
thoughts more cloſely in ſubſervien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to your future Studies. For
your ſatisfaction herein,
I think<note n="x" place="margin">This aduice was addreſſed to a <hi>Graduate,</hi> who was therefore to have been preſumed to have read over his Courſe already once. This is war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that others to whom it does not belong, may not imprudently apply it to themſelves.</note> you may ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
give over your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it diſtinctly by way of
<hi>Courſe,</hi> and apply your ſelf
more immediately to the
Study of <hi>School-Divinity;</hi>
for the <hi>School-men</hi> allowing
themſelves that liberty of
largely diſcuſſing <hi>Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Queſtions</hi> on the <hi>Summes</hi>
and <hi>Sentences;</hi> as you ſhall by this
means want none of them that are
<hi>neceſſary,</hi> ſo you will be diſengaged
from many of them that are purely
<hi>heterogeneous.</hi> But becauſe they do
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:95950:130"/>
frequently uſe this liberty licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,
therefore it will be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to determine more diſtinctly
what parts are neceſſary, and to
what ends. Firſt therefore, for
that <hi>natural Divinity</hi> which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
true antecedently to <hi>Divine
Revelation,</hi> and which is therefore
onely intelligible by <hi>reaſon;</hi> it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
commonly reduced to two main
principles: <hi>the Divine nature and
exiſtence, and the Soul's immortality;
and the nature of its faculties and
the manner of its operations,</hi> in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
to which all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Precepts and Auxiliaries are
deſigned; the former will be beſt
advanced by <hi>Phyſical</hi> arguments
drawn from the nature of the <hi>cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
motions,</hi> and the neceſſity of
an univerſal ordinator of the <hi>ſecond
cauſes</hi> both to their own ends, in

               </gap>ſe that are inanimate, and at
leaſt to that of the Univerſe, in thoſe
that are not; &amp;c. which as they are
evidently more <hi>perſwaſive</hi> and <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi>
and of a more general accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
to ordinary capacities, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:95950:131"/>
ſuch as we find principally made uſe
of by St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, not onely in
his <hi>popular diſcourſes</hi> Rom. i. 20.
but even in his <hi>diſputes</hi> with the
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> Act. xvii. 27. 28. and
xiv. 17. ſo I do really conceive
them more ſtrong than thoſe <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical</hi>
ones, that have been lately
again urged and improved with the
general applauſe of our late <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi>
by the famous <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
And there is one Queſtion, which as
I confeſs exceedingly intricate, and
yet omitted by moſt that I have
ſeen of our late ingenious Authors
that handled the argument, at leaſt
not conſidered with that accuracy it
deſerved; ſo I conceive it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for the conviction not onely
of <hi>Atheiſts</hi> (which yet the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
of our Age has rendred not
altogether unſeaſonable) but alſo
of ſome ſubdivided Chriſtians, thoſe
eſpecially of the <hi>Romane Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and that is the diſtinction of
<hi>true</hi> from <hi>counterfeit</hi> miracles, which
will require <hi>natural Philoſophy,</hi>
wherein the notion of a true mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:95950:131"/>
by the confeſſion of all, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that it be above the power of
<hi>natural Agents,</hi> for the determining
of that it will be neceſſary to ſhew
how far that does extend; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is yet farther agreed, that
all ſenſible effects of created ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
muſt depend on matter and
motion; therefore this will require
two things to be examined; <hi>their
utmoſt efficacy in general;</hi> and then
particularly <hi>the uttermoſt efficacy of
thoſe that are preſent at the producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſuppoſed effect that is to be
tryed;</hi> the knowledg of which I
preſume you are not ignorant to be
the very deſign of natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;
wherein notwithſtanding you
are not now to be confined to the
<hi>Peripatetick</hi> Principles, but may
more ingenuouſly examine others,
and accept what you your ſelf ſhall
conceive moſt ſatisfactory. But the
inveſtigation of the particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Attributes will be beſt perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
by <hi>Metaphyſicks,</hi> wherein all
the terms requiſite to this way of
arguing are proſeſſedly handled:
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95950:132"/>
the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>Entity</hi> and <hi>Bonity</hi> in
general; the notion of those <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi>
which are called <hi>ſimpliciter
ſimplices;</hi> and the examination of
what are particularly ſuch by their
<hi>compatibility</hi> with others greater
than themſelves, and which are not
reducible to any other Sciences,
from whence it has even in<note n="y" place="margin">
                  <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph</hi> I. vi. c. 1. Text. 2.</note>
               <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf the name of <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Divinity.</hi> And from hence alſo
depend all thoſe terms whereby even
<hi>ſupernatural Revelations</hi> are made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
with <hi>natural Reaſon,</hi> and
upon which moſt of thoſe objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
depend that are indeed materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
and neceſſary to be anſwered;
for the whole force of theſe relyes
on ſuch Principles as are univerſally
concluſive in all ſorts of Entityes;
for otherwiſe the confeſſed <hi>Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
participation of the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
in <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi>
will be ſufficient to invalidate all
Inferences drawn to him from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
experiments in other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which are the uttermoſt that
all other Sciences are able to reach.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95950:132"/>
And to theſe ends you will find the
General Part very neceſſary; and
the particular, where it goes no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the perfect explication of
their Nature, and confines it ſelf
within it own moſt immaterial ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction.
And therefore you may
obſerve this Part moſt taken notice
of by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and you will find
it moſt generally ſerviceable to the
whole deſign of <hi>School-Divinity.</hi>
But then for the other Part that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<hi>the nature of the Soul, and of
its operations;</hi> the ſupernatural aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances
being proportioned to
them, it will be neceſſary to know
them for the underſtanding this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
And becauſe ſome of
theſe aſſiſtances are extended as
well to the <hi>nature</hi> of their <hi>Acts</hi> as
their <hi>Morality:</hi> and the moral man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of the operations is moſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the <hi>nature</hi> of the <hi>Agent,</hi> and
accordingly beſt intelligible by its
relation: therefore it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to know them, firſt <hi>Phyſical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
as they are handled in <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s
books <hi>de Animâ</hi> and there eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:95950:133"/>
the rational and intellectual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and others no otherwiſe than
as they conduce to the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
their preſent organical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
way of operation, and that
diſcourſe <hi>de Animâ ſeparatâ</hi> which
you will find adjoyned at the end by
ſome Authors; and then <hi>Morally,</hi> in
<hi>Ethicks,</hi> from whence you are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to deduce all thoſe obligations
that are purely moral; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
and deſign of thoſe that are
poſitive and ſupernatural, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all thoſe univerſal Rules, on
which depends the prudential pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of <hi>Caſuiſtical Divinity.</hi> For
<hi>Controverſie Logick</hi> I mention no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
becauſe I believe there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in it neceſſary to your purpoſe
but what is borrowed from <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicks,</hi>
or ſome few things concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,</hi>
which you will find ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
to your purpoſe diſcuſſed on
the <hi>Summes</hi> and <hi>Sentences.</hi> And as
it will be thus ſerviceable in general
to know the main deſign of thoſe
Sciences, and their influence in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:95950:133"/>
for diſcerning the neceſſity
of particular Queſtions, how far
they are reducible to it; ſo in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
you may conſider, Firſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it was firſt raiſed from any
Theological occaſion, accordingly
to the Rules formerly preſcribed;
or whether it be capable of being
uſed as a principle for the deciding
any Theological Controverſie? and
if it be, then Secondly, whether
that Theological Controverſie it
ſelf be of any moment? and then
Thirdly, whether that Philoſophical
Principle be capable of any certain
reſolution, and eſpecially in that
ſenſe that is requiſite for this deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
But for the improvement of
principles of this kind in proving the
<hi>immortality of the Soul</hi> (not now to
reflect upon the piouſly-deſigned
attempts of ſeveral ingenious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in this regard) for my part,
how convincing ſoever they may
prove in the event, I can diſcern no
great neceſſity of having recourſe
unto them, or relying on them. For
though indeed the exiſtence of God
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:95950:134"/>
cannot be proved by <hi>Revelation,</hi> it
being ſo antecedent to it as that he
that doubts of it cannot admit of
<hi>Revelation</hi> to prove it by; yet is
there not the ſame neceſſity here,
ſeeing the Soul may really be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal,
though its immortality could
not be made out from any natural
appearances falling under our cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
(daily experience furniſhing
us with inſtances of moſt certain
truths which are yet uncapable of
being proved from ſuch appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
in which caſe we may yet be
aſſured of it by <hi>Revelation.</hi> For
our doubting concerning the proof
of the Souls immortality by <hi>reaſon</hi>
does not upon any rational pretence
oblige us to queſtion the <hi>exiſtence of
Revelations;</hi> and ſuppoſing that the
real immortality of our Souls is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
and revealed by God, our
own antecedent ignorance of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
natural accounts cannot ground
the leaſt ſuſpicion of the Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
concerning it; nay it is
from our prime a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tions of ſuch a
being moſt certain that infinite truths
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:95950:134"/>
are evident to him which are not
obvious to our groſſer obſervations,
and it cannot be diſproved that this
is one. Suppoſing therefore that
God has revealed the immortality
of our Souls; and that he is in this,
as well as in other Revelations, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racious;
and that he certainly does,
though we do not, know the truth
even in this particular affair; it muſt
needs follow that we muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to believe it upon account of
ſuch Divine Revelation, though an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
we could never have
known it by natural diſcoveries.
This I have onely obſerved by the
way, to ſhew the <hi>no-neceſſity</hi> of inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on ſuch proofs, and to let Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical
irreligious perſons underſtand
how little indeed Religion is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
in their weakneſs; though,
I think, I might have added that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting</hi>
this way of proof, and inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>onely</hi> on Revelation in this caſe
is not onely more <hi>ſecure,</hi> but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
regards more <hi>convenient</hi> and more
<hi>aggreeable</hi> with the principles of
Chriſtianity, and better ſitted for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:95950:135"/>
ſolving difficulties which are leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
on other principles. But
what I have to ſay to this purpoſe
is both ſubject to be miſunderſtood,
and too tedious for my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
and therefore I forbear.</p>

Divinity that is Textuary, beſides
the knowledg of the <hi>Tongues</hi> and
<hi>Phraſes,</hi> which will be gotten by
reading ancient Authors in their
own words upon other occaſions,
and for which your own experience
will hereafter be your more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
directory; for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of the doctrinals of the
<hi>Old Teſtament</hi> (which you will find
very neceſſary for the <hi>New,</hi> there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing pretended to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the <hi>New,</hi> but what was at leaſt
myſtically preſigured in the <hi>Old,</hi> and
there being many doctrines at that
time generally believed by the
<hi>Jewiſh Church</hi> which were not ſo
clearly expreſſed in the <hi>Old,</hi> which
as they ſeem to be connived at by
our <hi>Saviour,</hi> ſo they ſeem generally
to have been received without any
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:95950:135"/>
New Revelations by the <hi>Primitive
Chriſtians</hi> (and yet the way is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
as fallible in ſome inſtances as
true in others, and therefore ought
to be accurately diſtinguiſhed)
the onely way will be to examine
the credibility of doctrines that
pretend to be originally <hi>Jewiſh Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</hi>
And for this you are not
onely to truſt the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> both for
their notorious <hi>fabulouſneſs,</hi> and
their little <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and their plain
imitations of the <hi>Graecian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
even before our Saviour's time,
upon occaſion of their acquaintance
with them by the <hi>Macedonian</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts,
whom yet together with
<hi>Philo</hi> and <hi>Joſephus.</hi> I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to you for the <hi>Hiſtorical Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of thoſe opinions and practices
that afterwards prevailed, and are
frequently alluded to in the <hi>New
Teſtament;</hi> but that which is the
main deſign of the primitive <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Apologies,</hi> what the <hi>Graecians</hi> had
either preſerved entire from the
diviſion of <hi>Babel,</hi> or in after-Ages
derived from the <hi>Jewes,</hi> which yet
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95950:136"/>
are both more numerous and more
ancient than thoſe that are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
of the <hi>Jewes</hi> themſelves; for
by this means as you ſhall diſcover
much of that truth which was myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
involved in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi>
though otherwiſe certainly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
where otherwiſe there is no
clear mention of the <hi>Immortality of
the Soul,</hi> of the <hi>Reſurrection of the
Body,</hi> or the <hi>future Judgment,</hi> which
are the very foundations, not onely
of <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but of all <hi>rational, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;</hi>
but alſo the Original of
many errors both among the later
<hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> For this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I conceive it convenient to read
the ancienteſt <hi>Greek Poets</hi> together
with their <hi>Greek Scholiaſts,</hi> and that
you do not look on them barely as
<hi>idle Romances,</hi> but as <hi>grave Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
and <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> for ſuch they
were reputed not onely in their
own times, but alſo by all their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
as involving <hi>Divine,</hi> and
<hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> notions of
their <hi>Gods</hi> and <hi>Heroes</hi> under <hi>myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi>
and <hi>Parabolical</hi> expreſſions.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:95950:136"/>
Thus the name was uſed for <hi>makers
of Lawes,</hi> for <hi>Eſtabliſhers of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths,</hi>
for <hi>Diſcipliners of youth</hi>
and <hi>women,</hi> as you may ſee proved
from the Teſtimonies of <hi>Homer</hi>
himſelf and others by the excellent
<hi>Heinſius</hi> in his <hi>Prolegom. ad Heſiod.</hi>
Hence they were after imitated by
the <hi>Oracles,</hi> and accounted <hi>Sacred,</hi>
and <hi>Prophetical,</hi> and inſpired with a
<hi>Divine fury,</hi> as were eaſie to prove
if I had leiſure. But yet becauſe
thoſe things are related on the faith
of much later Authors, and are
mingled with their own inventions,
and are expreſſed in dark, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly-obſcure,
reſemblances;
therefore two things will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to be inquired into: Firſt,
whence they originally proceeded,
whereby will appear both how far
they are credible, and what was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſuperadded by the <hi>Graecian</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation
of vain glory; and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
what was their diſtinct ſenſe.
For the former, I confeſs the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Graecian Barbariſm,</hi> their late
incorporations into civil Societies,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:95950:137"/>
their then it ſelf being divided into
<hi>little Republicks,</hi> which could not
chuſe but continually allarm them
with perpetual Factions and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
jealouſies of one another, and
leave little time for incouragement
for Studies, and their late invention
of Letters, or of any means for
communicating Tradition to Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
make me unwilling to adviſe
you to truſt them for any thing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
that is Hiſtorical. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I believe your beſt way were to
examine with what other ancient
learned Nations they had commerce,
from whom they might probably
derive their <hi>Philoſophical</hi> or <hi>Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
learning,</hi> and particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
ſuch notable Perſons as
were acknowledged to have had
ſome eſpecial influence in their
improvement; ſuch were <hi>Orpheus</hi>
for the <hi>old,</hi> and <hi>Pherecydes Syrius</hi> for
the <hi>later Theogonyes;</hi> whether they
were <hi>Indigenae</hi> or <hi>forreigners,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they <hi>travelled,</hi> and to what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
And because the ambition of
the later <hi>Greeks</hi> has endeavoured
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95950:137"/>
to ſuppreſs thoſe teſtimonies that
might ſeem to make them beholding
to other Nations for what they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
themſelves to be the first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventors
of; either by confounding
forreigners of the ſame name with
their own, and by that means arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating
the glory of their actions to
themſelves, or by deriving their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
from their Gods, and thoſe
ſuch as were Hiſtorically many or
uncertain, as they do with <hi>Orpheus,</hi>
when they make him the Son of
<hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Calliope,</hi> it were well to
collect out of creditable Authors
what is mentioned concerning them,
that ſo you may from other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
conjecture whence they did
moſt probably derive their learning.
And there are three Nations eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,
who, by reaſon of their unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable
Antiquity, and their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
government, and their eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of Learning, and their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and opportunities, and
publick deputation of ſome orders
of men for that end, might be very
credible for the conveyance of the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:95950:138"/>
               <hi>Traditional Divinity,</hi> and who, by
reaſon of their familiarity with the
<hi>Jewes,</hi> might eaſily have corrected
themſelves where they had been
miſtaken: the <hi>Chaldaeans,</hi> the <hi>Phoeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>
and the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> whereof
the two later muſt needs have been
known to them as anciently as their
ancienteſt inventions: the <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
by occaſion of their notorious
trafficking at Sea; and the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi>
as appears both by the affinity of
their <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Letters,</hi> from the
<hi>Graecian Apis,</hi> whether the <hi>Sicyonian</hi>
or <hi>Argive,</hi> ſuppoſed after his death
to have been Canonized in <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
from the ſtories of <hi>Aegyptus</hi> and
<hi>Danaus</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> of <hi>Tithonus</hi> and
<hi>Memnon</hi> and <hi>Phaëthon</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi>
mentioned by the moſt ancient
<hi>Graecian Mythologiſts,</hi> from the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of very many of themſelves,
if I had leaſure to produce them;
and eſpecially in that moſt of their

of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> thoſe of
them eſpecially that are <hi>traditional,</hi>
and who are known themſelves to
have travelled to theſe Countreys:
for the later ſubdiviſions ſeem gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
to have been built on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

concerning whom, eſpecially
the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> what my thoughts are
you may eaſily diſcern from my
<hi>Prolegomena</hi> to my dear Tutor's
Book <hi>de Obſtinatione:</hi> 
               <q>that if their
<hi>Rational diſcourſes</hi> be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
as converſant about ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
as are uncapable of <hi>ſolid
demonſtrations</hi> from purely natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
principles, ſuch as the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
notions of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and
the <hi>Hierarchyes of good or evil
Daemons,</hi> and <hi>the ſtate of the Soul
after death,</hi> and <hi>the rewards and
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:95950:139"/>
puniſhments of the other World;</hi>
theſe will further admit of a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
conſideration, either as to
that <hi>uſe</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> that may be
grounded on their <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and
that cannot be acknowledged ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſiderable, both becauſe the
caſes are ſuppoſed ſuch as are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of any ſolid proof of that
kind; and the reaſons they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
are therefore at the beſt one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>conjectural,</hi> and frequently
<hi>Captious;</hi> and they are unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
arguments from <hi>Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation;</hi>
and for affairs of this
nature their <hi>Antiquity</hi> gives them
no ſpecial advantage over us, and
they are more clearly and cloſely
managed by later Authors: or as
to that <hi>purely Hiſtorical</hi> uſe which
may be made of their Opinions,
how weak ſoever their <hi>reaſons</hi> are,
for explaining thoſe paſſages of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> which are expreſſed in
their language and allude to their
ſenſe, whether as <hi>approved</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi>
And thus howſoever <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:95950:139"/>
the proof of ſuch Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
might have been ſuppoſed
formerly, yet it might merit a
confident aſſent as grounded on
the <hi>ſurer word of Propheſie;</hi> nay
though they be <hi>rejected</hi> in the
Scripture as <hi>falſe,</hi> yet ſo it ſelf
they may help us to underſtand
thoſe very Scriptures that were
ſuppoſed to condemn them. For
the <hi>terms</hi> being ſuppoſed <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,</hi>
the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
muſt needs be preſumed fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
to explain their own ſenſe of
them (which is moſt likely to be
the ſenſe intended by the Holy
Ghoſt) and by underſtanding the
terms we come to underſtand the
Propoſitions reſulting from them,
ſo condemned; which being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
will help us further to
diſcover what is neceſſary for
bringing ſuch a diſcourſe home to
the purpoſe, which muſt needs be
very advantageous for diſcovering
the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt in
it, as that is alſo for judging of
<hi>conſequential modes of expreſſion,</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:95950:140"/>
of which kind are many <hi>proviſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and
<hi>doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Schoolmen.</hi> But
then ſuppoſing the <hi>Rational Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes</hi>
of the <hi>Philoſophers</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
about affairs within their
own reach, whereof they might
be preſumed competent judges,
they may again be two wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered:
either as to their <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
concluſiveneſs,</hi> or as to the
<hi>actual reputation</hi> they had gained
among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and thoſe other
Nations among whom they were
diſperſed, for whoſe uſe the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were primarily deſigned,
and to whoſe defects they may
therefore be preſumed to have
been originally accommodated.
In the <hi>former</hi> regard their diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
will have ſo much and no more
credibility than what a <hi>particular
examination</hi> of their ſolidity will
afford to a perſon <hi>competent</hi> to
judge of it; or than the fame of
their <hi>skill</hi> and <hi>integrity</hi> in affairs
of this nature, might have been
conceived ſufficient to perſwade
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95950:140"/>
to ſuch as were unskilful them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and ſo expoſed to a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of relying on their bare Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
But in the <hi>later,</hi> their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
may be much greater as far
as it may be thought to have been
further confirmed and approved
by the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> himſelf. For
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> undertaking in an
<hi>extraordinary way</hi> to ſupply the
defect of <hi>ordinary means</hi> in the
diſcovery of ſuch <hi>truths</hi> or <hi>falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods</hi>
as might prove <hi>neceſſary</hi> or
<hi>pernicious</hi> in order to the ſalvation
of mankind; it is to be preſumed
that wherein he did not offer a
correction, there he preſumed the
uſe of ordinary means ſufficient.
And then the onely ordinary
means of diſcovering their <hi>preſent
duty</hi> and their <hi>future intereſts</hi> (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
for the <hi>vulgar</hi> for whoſe
uſe <hi>Revelations</hi> were principally
calculated) being natural reaſon
as managed by its ableſt <hi>Profeſſors,</hi>
the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> they having no
other light antecedently to <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;</hi>
it will further follow, that
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:95950:141"/>
nothing taught unanimouſly by
ſuch <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> if uncorrected
by the Holy Ghoſt, was by the
Holy Ghoſt himſelf thought dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the ſalvation of perſons
obliged, in prudence, to rely on
ſuch an Authority; nay that all
things ſo unanimouſly agreed on,
in matters neceſſary to be reſolved
in order to ſalvation, if the Holy
Ghoſt did not undertake a new
reſolution, were ſuppoſed by him
to have been already reſolved
rightly by the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which no leſs than <hi>Divine
approbation</hi> of ſuch diſcourſes
muſt needs add more than a bare
<hi>Humane Authority</hi> to them.</q> This
is the ſum of what I have more
largely diſcourſed and proved in
the forementioned place, which
you may perceive principally to
concern ſuch Philophers as are
profeſſedly <hi>moral,</hi> who as they
are alſo generally applauded by
<hi>Scholars</hi> for the generoſity of their
temper and principles; and their
aggreeableneſs to <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> ſo
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:95950:141"/>
they are not indeed guilty of that
<hi>unpracticableneſs</hi> wherewith they are
charged by ſome leſs conſiderative
perſons. It is true indeed that they
thought the <hi>Soul</hi> alone to be the
<hi>eſſential man,</hi> and the <hi>body</hi> the <hi>Organ</hi>
and <hi>priſon</hi> of it, and indeed <hi>praeterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
to it, upon which account they
made its <hi>impriſonment</hi> here a <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi>
if not a <hi>puniſhment,</hi> of its <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy,</hi>
and its <hi>reſtitution</hi> to its
<hi>primitive proſperity</hi> to conſiſt in its
<hi>compleat purgation</hi> from all <hi>corporeal
faeculencies.</hi> But this is not ſo to be
underſtood as if they had thought
the ſoul incorporated (upon what
account ſoever) to be as free from
being affected with corporeal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
as the <hi>Muſician</hi> is from
thoſe of his <hi>inſtrument,</hi> or the <hi>Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>
of the place of his <hi>Captivity;</hi>
or had accordingly perſwaded the
Soul to her duty by a naked propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
of its reaſonableneſs without any
prudential praeſcriptions for making
her capable of reaſon. For it is
plain that they themſelves conceived
the Soul to be more than locally uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:95950:142"/>
to the body by virtue of the
<hi>Nepheſh</hi> as the <hi>Jewes;</hi> or <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> as the <hi>Chaldee Oracles,</hi> or
the <hi>umbra,</hi> as <hi>Virgil,</hi> calls it; which
being thought of a middle nature
betwixt <hi>material</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> beings,
and participating of the qualities of
each, was thought to bind the Soul
inſeparably to the body, and to
ſubject it to a <hi>ſympathy</hi> in corporeal
paſſions. Thence that <hi>forgetfulneſs</hi>
of all its old notions, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>

               </gap>, the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs

by <hi>Cebes,</hi> which made their
ſo frequent exhortations to be <hi>ſober</hi>
and <hi>vigilant,</hi> imitated alſo by the
Apoſtle himſelf ſo very neceſſary.
And in complyance hereunto it was
that they held that the truth it ſelf
was <hi>undiſcoverable</hi> and <hi>unintelligible</hi>
by <hi>impure perſons,</hi> and accordingly
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:95950:142"/>
they were as ſolicitous in concealing
the <hi>ſecrets</hi> of their <hi>Philoſophy</hi> from
the <hi>prophane vulgar</hi> as the <hi>Pagan
Prieſts</hi> were in diſcovering their
<hi>Idols</hi> to <hi>uninitiated perſons;</hi> and as
the revealers of the <hi>myſteries</hi> of the
Gods were puniſhed with death, ſo
<hi>Hipparchus</hi> the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> had a
monument erected for him by thoſe
of his own profeſſion ſignifying his
death in a moral ſenſe for divulging
their <hi>Acroamati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ks.</hi> So that, though
they held not the body to be any
<hi>part</hi> of the <hi>man,</hi> yet they held ſo
near a connexion with it as was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſufficient to render it unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of pure and naked reaſon
(which would indeed have proved
unpracticable to ſuch perſons) and
were therefore as well <hi>obliged</hi> by
their <hi>principles,</hi> as they did <hi>obſerve it</hi>
in their <hi>practice,</hi> to accommodate
their perſwaſions to the <hi>opportunities</hi>
and <hi>abilities</hi> of the <hi>perſons</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which being conſidered muſt
needs make them practicable. All
this might have been ſhewn and
proved at large if it had now been
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95950:143"/>
ſeaſonable. Nor is this practice
proceeding on the <hi>principles</hi> of the
<hi>Philoſophers,</hi> repugnant to the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi>
and <hi>fundamentally-virtuous</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
from whence onely actions are
denominated <hi>ſupernaturally-good</hi> in
the ſenſe of <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> ſuch as
<hi>Humility,</hi> and <hi>a ſenſe of our own
weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>a perpetual actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on the Divine favour,</hi> and
<hi>a pure and primary intention of his
glory,</hi> and <hi>no ſatisfactory reflections
on our own condition here;</hi> but <hi>a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
preparation to endure anxieties
of mind,</hi> and <hi>deprivations of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
comfortable preſence,</hi> and <hi>the
peace of our own Conſcience,</hi> and <hi>ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
apprehenſions concerning our
eternal welfare,</hi> and <hi>frequent occaſions
of disquietude</hi> in the <hi>rational Soul,</hi>
as well as in thoſe <hi>outward goods</hi> of
the <hi>body</hi> or of <hi>Fortune.</hi> For it
might have been eaſily ſhewn how
that all theſe things as far as they
are <hi>truly</hi> ſubſervient to the deſigns
of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> are admitted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by the Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and that which is indeed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:95950:143"/>
by them is not <hi>approved</hi>
by our <hi>Chriſtian Revelations.</hi> That
<hi>humility,</hi> and <hi>a ſenſe of our own
weakneſs,</hi> and <hi>a perpetual dependence
on the Divine favour,</hi> muſt needs
have been owned by the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi>
appears from what I have ſaid to
evince their acknowledgment of the
neceſſity of the <hi>Divine aſſiſtance</hi> in
all <hi>good performances,</hi> in my <hi>Proleg.</hi>
Sect. LV. LVI. LVII. LVIII. LIX.
to which I ſhall add nothing more
at preſent. And if doing good
actions for <hi>the glory of God,</hi> be
Firſt, to do them out of a ſenſe of
our <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi>
and a <hi>ſubjection</hi> to his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi>
(however notified to us,
whether by the <hi>light of nature</hi> and
<hi>Conſcience,</hi> or by <hi>poſitive Revelations,</hi>
can make no difference, if the <hi>light
of Nature</hi> and <hi>Conſcience</hi> be owned
for the <hi>voice of God</hi>) and Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
to <hi>teſtifie</hi> by them our <hi>honourable
ſenſe</hi> of the <hi>wiſdome</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of
<hi>God</hi> in his Providences even where
they ſeem to carnal ſenſual judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
moſt <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>rigorous;</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:95950:144"/>
and Thirdly, not onely to entertain
and manifeſt this <hi>honourable opinion</hi>
in our <hi>ſelves,</hi> but alſo to endeavour
by ſuch our Actions to propagate the
like honourable opinions to <hi>others;</hi>
and Fourthly, to renounce all vain
glory of our <hi>own,</hi> whether as it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a <hi>complacency in other mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions;</hi>
or <hi>an aſcribing to our ſelves</hi>
thoſe actions which had been indeed
performed by the <hi>Divine aſſiſtance;</hi>
if, I ſay, theſe things be meant by
<hi>acting for the glory of God;</hi> then
theſe <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> how rarely ſoever
they mention the <hi>word,</hi> moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have owned the <hi>thing,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which alone learned and
candid perſons would be ſolicitous.
And it may be they who would
make more neceſſary would find it
more difficult to <hi>prove</hi> than to <hi>aſſert.</hi>
So alſo for <hi>our unſatisfiedneſs with
our condition here;</hi> if thereby be
underſtood a <hi>murmuring</hi> and <hi>repi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
at the condition allotted us by
<hi>Providence,</hi> however <hi>ungrateful</hi> it
may ſeem to <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood;</hi> that is
ſo far from being <hi>commendable</hi> in the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:95950:144"/>
repute of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> as that it is
indeed a very great <hi>Rebellion</hi> and
<hi>Perverſeneſes</hi> againſt the <hi>Divine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.</hi>
But if by <hi>our unſatisfied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
here</hi> that alone be meant (which
onely can be meant the former ſenſe
being excluded) <hi>an opinion of the
unſufficiency of ſublunary fruitions
for the ſatisfaction of our more noble
and capacious Souls;</hi> the way of
bringing men to ſuch an opinion
ſeems to be the <hi>principal;</hi> if not the
<hi>adaequate,</hi> deſign of this <hi>moral Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi>
I am now diſcourſing of. The
greateſt <hi>ſeeming Paradox</hi> is how to
explain how <hi>Philoſophy</hi> does diſpoſe
perſons for enduring the <hi>deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of thoſe good things of the mind
which have an intrinſick moral
goodneſs,</hi> ſuch as <hi>anxieties of mind,
a ſenſeleſsneſs and dulneſs in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of duties,</hi> and the other
inſtances already mentioned. And
the difficulty here ſeems the more
conſiderable becauſe the two funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
principles of theſe perſons
in this affair, ſeem, if not utterly
<hi>falſe,</hi> yet, very <hi>unſecure:</hi> Firſt, that
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95950:145"/>
               <hi>God never exerciſes good men with the
loſs of any thing that is really good;
and that ſuch are all, and onely, the
goods of the mind,</hi> which is the onely
ſeat of happineſs. For by this
means perſons are taught not to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect</hi>
evils of this kind, which muſt
needs both render them more <hi>ſecure</hi>
and <hi>unprovided</hi> for their <hi>reception,</hi>
and the <hi>unexpectedneſs</hi> of ſuch <hi>evils</hi>
would alſo <hi>aggravate,</hi> their <hi>vexatiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
And Secondly, that <hi>it is in
the power of good men to avoyd even
all ſurpriſals to any thing indecent that
might deſervedly procure by way of
puniſhment any intervals of Divine
diſpleaſure,</hi> wherein all their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
muſt tend to their further
diſquietment. Beſides that by the
<hi>former principle,</hi> God never inflicting
<hi>ſpiritual evils</hi> on <hi>arbitrary accounts,</hi>
but in caſe of <hi>demerit;</hi> and this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit,</hi>
by the <hi>later,</hi> never agreeing
to a <hi>good man</hi> (ſeeing its very ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
does <hi>ipſo facto</hi> make him
ceaſe to be ſuch) <hi>good men</hi> will not
ſeem obliged to expect it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not to be provided for it. But
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95950:145"/>
notwithſtanding all this, I conceive
it certain First, that <hi>underſtanding
all theſe things concerning him whom
the Philoſophers call a <hi>wiſeman,</hi> and
we Chriſtians a perfect man</hi> (though
they, as well as we, did queſtion the
<hi>actual exiſtence</hi> of ſuch a perſon, as
I have already ſhewn in my afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
<hi>Prolegom.</hi> Sect. LXII.) yet I
ſay <hi>ſuppoſing ſuch a perſon,</hi> all that
they ſay on this ſubject would be
true concerning him; <hi>he would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be obnoxious to diſturbances of
this kind,</hi> as <hi>never deſerving</hi> them,
and therefore would <hi>need no defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
againſt them. But then Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
for thoſe other ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who do moſt frequently occur
in ordinary practice, I do confeſs
that to apply theſe principles to
them would indeed be ſubject to the
mentioned inconveniencies; but I
muſt withall profeſs that I think it
never was their deſign to make ſuch
an application; and therefore they
muſt needs have been far from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
others from ſuch <hi>expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or from <hi>providing</hi> againſt them.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:95950:146"/>
For theſe weaker perſons therefore,
it is plain Firſt, that they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
ſuch not to act <hi>rationally,</hi>
and therefore unlikely to be moved
by <hi>rational arguments;</hi> ſo that their
diſcourſes on this account could not
have been unpracticable as if they
had onely <hi>ſhewn</hi> them their <hi>duty,</hi> but
not <hi>conſidered</hi> their <hi>abilities</hi> for <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticing</hi>
it. And Secondly, that in
perſons acting ſo <hi>irrationally,</hi> paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were not ſo <hi>avoydable,</hi> nor their
<hi>irrigularity</hi> eaſily ſeparable from
<hi>themſelves,</hi> nor their <hi>demerit</hi> from
their <hi>irregularity,</hi> nor conſequently
that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that is, to believe the <hi>things</hi> really
correſpondent, to their <hi>appearances,</hi>
to <hi>be</hi> ſuch as they <hi>ſeem,</hi> which muſt
needs infer a parity of reſentment
in the rational, which had before
poſſeſſed the ſenſitive appetite.
And thus much they do not deny
concerning their <hi>wiſeman</hi> himſelf,
of the <hi>ſecond order,</hi> ſuch as was
conceived <hi>exiſtent</hi> in <hi>this life.</hi> But
further <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in weaker inferior
perſons they thought this <hi>ſympathy</hi> ſo
<hi>naturally-conſequent</hi> to thoſe <hi>exterior
impreſſions</hi> as that it could not be
prevented by <hi>particular ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi>
but by <hi>long exerciſes,</hi> and
<hi>ſolemnly-premeditated reſolutions.</hi> So
that to <hi>ſenſualiſts</hi> or <hi>weakly religious</hi>
perſons they both allowed reaſons
to <hi>expect</hi> ſuch <hi>diſturbances of mind,</hi>
and the ſame latitude of <hi>providing</hi>

<pb n="236" facs="tcp:95950:147"/>
by any other <hi>prudence</hi> whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
For though indeed they
might ſay that God would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any <hi>real evil</hi> to befall <hi>Religious
perſons,</hi> yet they never undertook
(<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay they warned the contrary)
that no <hi>apparent evil</hi> ſhould do ſo
too; or that <hi>imperfectly virtuous
perſons</hi> ſhould alwayes value things
according to their <hi>real worth,</hi> and
not be <hi>ſeduced</hi> ſometimes to miſtake
their <hi>appearances</hi> for <hi>realities;</hi> or
that doing ſo, they, as well as others,
would not prove lyable to diſſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions
of mind, was never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be affirmed by them. And
it might have been ſhewn how moſt
of the diſturbances now mentioned
are imputable to the miſtakes of
<hi>weak underſtandings,</hi> and either are
no <hi>realities</hi> at all, or, at leaſt, not
really <hi>ſuch as they are conceived to
be.</hi> Thus thoſe <hi>anxieties of mind,</hi>
and <hi>dulneſs</hi> and <hi>diſtraction in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of ſpiritual duties,</hi> which
are uſually repreſented as ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
to <hi>piouſly deſigning</hi> perſons,
are no more originally than a meer
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95950:147"/>
revolution of their <hi>humours</hi> and
<hi>complexions,</hi> and miſtakes adequate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
occaſioned by the <hi>indiſpoſition</hi> of
the <hi>recipient,</hi> not by any <hi>malignity</hi>
of the <hi>things</hi> themſelves. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
what reaſon is there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
their condition bad becauſe
their complexion is clouded with
<hi>melancholy,</hi> a thing as little in their
power, and as obnoxious to viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes,
as the vaineſt of thoſe exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
fruitions ſo ſolemnly renounced
by all pious perſons? And what
elſe but complexion can be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why they are within a while
(without any acceſſion of new
<hi>guilt</hi>) diſquieted with <hi>jealouſies</hi> and
<hi>ſcrupuloſities</hi> concerning that which
not long before in a mature proceſs
of judging they had pronounced
perfectly innocent, and recover pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodically,
when the cloud is over,
without any further <hi>rational convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
Yet this is that which melancholy
perſons miſcall the <hi>fruition</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion</hi>
of the <hi>Divine internal visita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
For if it were a real conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of <hi>demerit</hi> that were the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95950:148"/>
of ſuch an alteration of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning their own conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
either the demerits muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<hi>frailties</hi> and <hi>inadvertencies,</hi> and
thoſe are known unſufficient to put
us out of a ſtate of grace; or they
are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>habitual,</hi> and ſuch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
agree to perſons ſuppoſed <hi>Pious,</hi>
who onely, according to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of theſe Philoſophers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are entitled to <hi>ſolid joy</hi> and
<hi>comfort.</hi> And the ſame <hi>untoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of complexion</hi> ſeems to be the
principal, if not the onely, cauſe of
that <hi>unquietneſs of Conſcience</hi> of
which ſuch perſons do complain,
for if the guilt were <hi>rationally</hi>
grounded, they could not be the
perſons we are ſuppoſing them. So
alſo for <hi>ſolicitouſneſs concerning
perſeverance,</hi> it is certain that by
the promiſes of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> he that
does improves his preſent grace ſhall
not be left deſtitute in any future
exigences, but ſhall either have his
abilities enlarged, or his temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
proportioned to his preſent abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;
which he that believes (as
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95950:148"/>
he muſt who profeſſes to believe
Chriſtianity) can have no <hi>reaſon</hi> for
<hi>ſolicitouſneſs,</hi> and a <hi>ſolicitouſneſs
without reaſon</hi> can be imputed to
nothing but <hi>complexion.</hi> So that
the moſt likely means of prevailing
on ſuch perſons practicable in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance
of their principles, are; both
to <hi>perſwade</hi> the perſons that their
preſent actings are <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and
<hi>erroneous,</hi> and to remove ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices
as may <hi>immediately</hi> be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
upon <hi>conviction,</hi> and to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
with ſuch as cannot till in proceſs
of time they may be made more
capable of <hi>better impreſſions,</hi> and in
the mean time preſcribing ſuch <hi>Rules</hi>
and <hi>exerciſes</hi> as may at once make
their preſent condition <hi>moſt tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and put them in a ſtate of <hi>moſt
probable proficiency</hi> for the <hi>future,</hi>
The onely thing therefore that may
be complained of in this <hi>moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy</hi>
is, <hi>that it wants thoſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
arguments for comforting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
which are afforded by Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
which will be no reaſon of <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting,</hi>
but <hi>improving,</hi> it by ſuch
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95950:149"/>
auxiliary ſuperadditions. And it
may be that want of complyance
which is complained of, may upon
thorough conſideration be found to
be, not ſuch as may ſo miniſter <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi>
for the <hi>preſent</hi> as that it may
withal tend to the <hi>conviction</hi> of his
error, but ſuch as might <hi>nouriſh</hi> and
<hi>confirm</hi> it, and <hi>detain</hi> the perſon
perpetually in ſo <hi>imperfect a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
an inconvenience to which No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
in a Religious life are too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
obnoxious. For certainly a
ſtate of Religion prudently managed
would be obnoxious to <hi>fewer</hi> diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances
of the rationally ſuperior
ſoul than now we find it, if indeed
to <hi>any</hi> at all. And laſtly it might
have been ſaid, according to ſenſe of
the myſtical Divines as well as the
Stoicks, that theſe viſitations, which
are ſo eagerly aimed at by beginners
in devotion, are meerly <hi>indifferent,</hi>
and no <hi>real rational excellencies,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
as making the perſons enjoying
them <hi>better</hi> nor <hi>more honourable,</hi> nor
as arguing them <hi>more acceptable to
God,</hi> both becauſe of the difficulty
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95950:149"/>
of diſtinguiſhing <hi>Divine conſolations</hi>
from <hi>Diabolical illuſions,</hi> and becauſe
they dare not ſay that <hi>true conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
themſelves are diſtributed in
proportion to their <hi>perſonal excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi>
but many times <hi>greater</hi> to the
<hi>weaker,</hi> who need them more for
their <hi>encouragement,</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> and
<hi>fewer</hi> to <hi>more excellent perſons;</hi> ſo
that ſtill the doctrine of theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
may hold, that good men
are not arbitrarily exerciſed with
the loſs of any thing <hi>truly excellent;</hi>
Nor are the remedies of theſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
<hi>onely</hi> ſo <hi>ſtupefactive</hi> as
they are by ſome conceived, as if
they were onely addreſſed againſt
the <hi>pungency,</hi> but did not <hi>eradicate</hi>
the <hi>malignity</hi> of the <hi>diſtemper,</hi> the
ſame way as a <hi>natural bold complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
nay ſometimes <hi>diſtemper of the
brain,</hi> does free from the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of
<hi>evil at preſent,</hi> which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on <hi>ſober thoughts</hi> will prove as
<hi>afflictive</hi> as ever in this life, beſides
the more ſevere conſequential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences.
For it was their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
doctrine that <hi>virtue</hi> was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:95950:150"/>
               <hi>ſolid ſecurity</hi> of <hi>happineſs,</hi> which
muſt needs have obliged them not to
accept of any other <hi>indolency</hi> but
what muſt ariſe or be conformable
thereunto, which no prudent conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
perſon will deny to be not
onely a <hi>ſolid cure of preſent mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi>
but alſo a <hi>ſecure prevention</hi> of
<hi>future miſcarriages.</hi> And it is really
a miſtake of the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi>
of theſe <hi>excellent perſons</hi> to think
that they made their preſent ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
ſo adaequately the end of
their <hi>Philoſophical performances</hi> as
that they ſhould make no <hi>Conſcience</hi>
of committing thoſe <hi>vices</hi> which
were leſs liable to <hi>preſent moleſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
or of acquiring thoſe <hi>virtues</hi>
which were either <hi>contrary</hi> or <hi>not
contributive</hi> to <hi>preſent happineſs,</hi> and
that <hi>ſolid purity</hi> was hardly intended
by them, they being more ſolicitous
for <hi>ſenſual</hi> than <hi>ſpiritual purity;</hi> for
<hi>purity</hi> in <hi>exterior appearance,</hi> than in
the <hi>intention.</hi> For it is plain that
happineſs was by them thought <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
conſequent</hi> to <hi>virtue,</hi> and
<hi>miſery</hi> to <hi>vice</hi> under their very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95950:150"/>
notions, which, whatever <hi>ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts</hi>
might think, could not leave
them any ground of ſuch a <hi>diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of any <hi>virtues</hi> that were at <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
afflictive,</hi> or, <hi>vices</hi> that might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
any <hi>preſent real ſatisfaction,</hi>
which muſt have obliged them to a
<hi>proſecution</hi> of <hi>all virtue,</hi> and a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation</hi>
of <hi>all vice,</hi> without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
And then the advantages
they propoſed to themſelves being
onely grounded on the <hi>intrinſick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
of the <hi>duties</hi> themſelves, and
not being thought the leaſt promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by other mens <hi>opinions,</hi> muſt
needs have made ſuch duties deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
independently on <hi>common fame;</hi>
beſides that they did expreſly <hi>decry,</hi>
and teach men to <hi>deſpiſe,</hi> other mens
opinions, than which nothing can be
thought more effectual for the era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication
of all <hi>vain glory</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie</hi>
and <hi>conceitedneſs,</hi> of which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candid
cenſurers <hi>ancient</hi> as well as
<hi>modern</hi> have been ſo forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
them. I will not undertake
to juſtifie their <hi>perſons</hi> in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars;
but I think I may very
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95950:151"/>
juſtly except againſt this way of
proceeding to cenſure their <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
from their <hi>practices,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
affairs of this nature concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their <hi>ſecret intentions</hi> are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to be known by men who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
diſcern <hi>their hearts,</hi> and in ſuch
caſes <hi>common humanity</hi> as well as
<hi>charity</hi> obliges to believe the <hi>beſt;</hi>
and becauſe there were ſome of
them ſo <hi>wary</hi> as that they never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
guilty of the leaſt <hi>affectation</hi>
as far as <hi>humane obſervation</hi> could
diſcover them, nay gave evidences
of the contrary (it had been eaſie
to have produced inſtances if I had
not been afraid of being too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
digreſſive) and if the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
for which any ſhew of proof
can be pretended were granted,
that they had been <hi>vain glorious</hi> and
been ſo <hi>univerſally;</hi> yet what is that
to diſcredit the goodneſs of their
<hi>principles,</hi> (for the defence of which
alone I am concerned) the beſt
profeſſions of the World being apt
in their own caſe to think themſelves
hardly and unkindly uſed, if their
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95950:151"/>
               <hi>principles</hi> ſhould be condemned for
their <hi>unconformable practices?</hi> And
I have already ſhewn that ſuch <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices,</hi>
if they had <hi>been,</hi> muſt needs
have been <hi>unconformable.</hi> Thus
much may ſuffice at preſent for vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating
the <hi>rational uſe</hi> of these

thoſe <hi>myſtical ſenſes</hi> which were

Strom. IV. the <hi>beſt</hi> means,
where there be any <hi>regular</hi> ones
<hi>poſſible;</hi> will be to examine what
theſe were both among <hi>themſelves,</hi>
and other <hi>Nations</hi> from whom they
received them. And theſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the two wayes whereby
the <hi>Gods</hi> were thought to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
themſelves to <hi>men:</hi> either
by viſible repreſentation of <hi>things</hi>
whoſe natures had ſome <hi>Analogy</hi> with
what they intended, or more <hi>directly</hi>
and <hi>familiarly</hi> by way of <hi>voice;</hi>
may ſeem alſo to have been twofold.
For the former, you may, I believe,
get much advantage from that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
reputed <hi>late</hi> and <hi>unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>
as well as <hi>ſuperſtitions,</hi> learning
of the <hi>Graecian Oneirocriticks,</hi> which
as they were evidently thought <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi>
and the main inſtance of that
ſort of <hi>Revelation</hi> among all anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Nations; ſo they had incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
greater advantages for their
conveyance to Poſterity than any
other kind of learning. And the
<hi>Graecians</hi> being confeſſedly none of
its firſt Authors, but the <hi>Aſiatick
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:95950:152"/>
Telmiſſij</hi> (whether thoſe of <hi>Caria</hi> or

it ſeems evident that they derived
it <hi>Eaſterly.</hi> And for the <hi>Lycian
Telmiſſus,</hi> it being, according to
<hi>Suidas,</hi> founded by <hi>Antenor's</hi> Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
it is impoſſible that they ſhould
be its firſt <hi>Inventors,</hi> ſeing that from
<hi>Homer</hi> it appears that it was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by the <hi>Graecians</hi> themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that; and for the other, moſt
of thoſe <hi>Aſian</hi> colonies being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
to have proceeded
<hi>Eaſternly</hi> (for moſt, if not all the
<hi>Graecian</hi> colonies, that were there,
were planted there after the deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>Troy</hi>) may probably give
much light for diſcovering the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the <hi>Eaſtern learning,</hi> and of
thoſe Nations eſpecially that were
anciently famous for it, the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans,</hi>
and the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> from
whom in all probability they deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
moſt of their <hi>Traditions.</hi> And
another advantage of this, above
all other, ſorts of <hi>myſtical learning</hi> is,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95950:153"/>
that, whereas the explication of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
was either reſerved with the
<hi>Prieſts</hi> themſelves, or afterwards
communicated to ſome few <hi>initiated
perſons</hi> after very ſevere and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
tryals of their ſecrecy, as you
may ſee in <hi>Lucas Holſtenius</hi>'s notes
upon <hi>Porphyry de vitâ Pythagorae,</hi>
which it is probable very few would
undergo, &amp; might therefore be more
obnoxious to <hi>corruption</hi> or <hi>forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
which I ſuſpect to be the true
reaſon of thoſe corruptions among
the <hi>Graecians</hi> themſelves, till they
were again repaired by the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi>
by a new intelligence with
thoſe Nations from whom they had
originally derived them; the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
practice and profeſſion of this
made its explication alſo not at all
ſubject to thoſe inconveniences. So

it, which made themſelves ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred

But for the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and
<hi>Aethiopians,</hi> I do not think it ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved that they received their
Circumciſion from the <hi>Jewes.</hi> For
First, I know no ground of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it an innovation among them,
the Scripture it ſelf never upbraids
them with <hi>uncircumciſion.</hi> And
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95950:155"/>
Secondly, the <hi>Circumciſion</hi> it ſelf
was differently practiced among
them from the cuſtomes of the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
It was not as with the <hi>Jewes</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred

ſo that at leaſt in regard of them
this argument for their deriving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things from the <hi>Jewes</hi> together
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95950:155"/>
with their <hi>Circumciſion</hi> will not hold.
Nor do I think the cuſtomes of the

ſome of their <hi>ſacred rites</hi> mentioned

as the <hi>true Religion</hi> was by degrees

in the bad ſenſe ſeems to have been
nothing but a further degeneration
of <hi>ancient Idolatry.</hi> Onely the
notion is creater here than among

they borrowed very many
of them, wherein though both the
likeneſs of the Character, and the
ſignification of many of their words,
may be eaſily diſcernible; yet both

will make the difference more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
and where they do not, it
would at leaſt concern you to know
their convenience, for the Hiſtorical

there was any thing proportionable?
And poſſibly you will find ſome aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance

in this whole way of deriving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known

you muſt allow many varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
either for want of anſwerable

which were committed to <hi>writing,</hi>
and enrolled in the <hi>publick Canon</hi> of
the <hi>Church,</hi> ſhould be <hi>underſtood</hi> by
the perſons concerned in them. For
otherwiſe it could not properly be

that God ſhould publiſh Revelations

an evidence of his own knowledge

indeed that it ſelf cannot be known

Propheſies,</hi> without any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of <hi>rational confutation</hi> by the

muſt be preſumed as ignorant of

prudent way of avoyding this <hi>uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs</hi>
and <hi>dangerouſneſs</hi> but by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
them intelligible to the perſons

concerned in theſe kinds of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
cannot be the <hi>Prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi>
or any other <hi>private perſons</hi> of
the ages wherein they were delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
but the <hi>Church in generall</hi> alſo

ſuch of them as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

have been of a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>permanent

Church concerned in thoſe <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi>
cannot onely be thoſe Ages
which were to ſurvive their accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment,
but alſo thoſe before;
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95950:161"/>
and therefore it cannot be ſufficient
to pretend, as many do, that theſe
Propheſies ſhall then be <hi>underſtood</hi>
when they are <hi>fulfilled,</hi> but it will
be further requiſite to aſſert that
they may be ſo before. For the
onely <hi>momentous reaſon,</hi> that muſt
be conceived concerning theſe, as
well as other, Revelations, muſt be
ſome duty which could not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
have been known, which muſt
have been ſomething <hi>antecedent,</hi>
for all <hi>conſequent</hi> duties of <hi>patience</hi>
and <hi>reſignation</hi> are common to them
with other <hi>Providences,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may be known in an <hi>ordinary
way.</hi> Now for <hi>antecedent</hi> duties,
ſuch as ſeem to be intimated in the
<hi>Propheſies themſelves</hi> where any are
mentioned, nothing can ſuffice but
an <hi>antecedent information.</hi> Beſides
to what end can this <hi>poſt-nate</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
ſerve? for ſatisfying <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
of the <hi>Divine preſcience</hi> upon
the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of his <hi>predictions?</hi>
This is <hi>needleſs;</hi> for they already

it therefore for the <hi>conviction</hi> of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95950:161"/>
               <hi>Infidels?</hi> But neither can this be
preſumed on a <hi>rational account.</hi> For
how can it be known that a <hi>predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
was fulfilled when it is not known
what was <hi>predicted?</hi> or how can it
be known what was predicted when
the prediction is ſo expreſſed as to
be capable of <hi>many ſenſes,</hi> and no
means are acknowledged poſſible
for diſtinguiſhing the <hi>aequivocation?</hi>
Nay will not ſuch a <hi>deſign</hi> of <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguity</hi>
ſeem to ſuch a perſon ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
of that <hi>ſtratagem</hi> of the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick

of a <hi>Prophetick Spirit</hi> by a
proviſion beforehand for avoyding
the danger of <hi>diſcovery?</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
this kind of Propheſie will be
ſo weak an argument for proving
<hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> as that indeed it
may agree to any natural man of
<hi>ordinary prudence.</hi> For in <hi>publick
affairs</hi> (the ſubject of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies)
which proceed more <hi>regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly</hi>
and are leſs obnoxious to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition
of <hi>private liberty,</hi> the
<hi>multitude</hi> who are the cauſes of ſuch
evolutions generally following the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95950:162"/>
               <hi>complexion</hi> of their bodies, and
therefore being as eaſily determined,
and therefore, predicted from <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cauſes</hi> as ſuch their <hi>complexions;</hi>
it will not be <hi>hard,</hi> at leaſt, very
<hi>probably,</hi> to conjecture <hi>future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies</hi>
from <hi>preſent appearances</hi> of
their <hi>natural cauſes.</hi> And then by
foretelling them in <hi>ambiguous expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
he may provide that if any of
thoſe ſenſes, of which his words are
capable, come to paſs, that may be
taken for the ſenſe intended, ſo that
a miſtaking in all but one would not
be likely to prejudice his credit.
And at length if all ſhould <hi>fail,</hi> yet
a <hi>refuge</hi> would be reſerved for the
<hi>ſuperſtitious reverencers</hi> of his <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi>
that themſelves had rather
failed of underſtanding his <hi>true ſenſe</hi>
than that had failed of <hi>truth;</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if among a multitude of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
but <hi>one</hi> hit in <hi>one ſenſe</hi> (as
it is hard even in a <hi>Lottery</hi> that any
ſhould alwayes miſs, much more in
matters capable of <hi>prudential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures</hi>)
that <hi>one</hi> inſtance of <hi>ſucceſs</hi>
would upon thoſe accounts more
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:95950:162"/>
               <hi>confirm</hi> his credit than a <hi>multitude</hi>
of <hi>faileurs</hi> would <hi>diſparage</hi> it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in point of <hi>ſucceſs</hi> they would
be confident of their underſtanding
him rightly, but in <hi>miſcarriages</hi> they
would lay the <hi>blame,</hi> not on the
<hi>prediction,</hi> but their own <hi>miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</hi>
Now ſeeing this way is
ſo very eaſily pretended to by <hi>Cheats</hi>
beyond any probable danger of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
it cannot to perſons not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<hi>favourably affected</hi> (who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
need <hi>conviction</hi>) prove any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a <hi>Divine inſpiration;</hi> and
therefore will, even upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
be perfectly uſeleſs. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
therefore that it is neceſſary
that theſe predictions be underſtood
<hi>before,</hi> as well as <hi>after,</hi> that they are
<hi>fulfilled;</hi> it will follow <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
that where they were not <hi>explained</hi>
by the <hi>Prophets themſelves,</hi> there they
were intelligible by the uſe of <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
means,</hi> ſuch as might, by the
perſons to whom the Revelations
were made, be <hi>judged ordinary.</hi> For
that they ſhould be explained by
<hi>new Prophets</hi> to be ſent on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95950:163"/>
occaſion, there is no ground
to believe; and if theſe Propheſies
were ſo expreſſed as that they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a <hi>new Revelation</hi> for <hi>explaining</hi>
them, they muſt have been <hi>uſeleſs,</hi>
and indeed could not have deſerved
the name of <hi>Revelations,</hi> they ſtill
tranſcending the uſe of <hi>humane
means</hi> as much as formerly. For if
they had been revealed <hi>formerly</hi>
what need had there been of a <hi>new
diſcovery?</hi> and if this need be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
it muſt plainly argue that the
former <hi>pretended Revelation</hi> was not
ſufficient for the information of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
in the uſe of <hi>ordinary means,</hi>
and that which is not ſo, cannot
anſwer the <hi>intrinſick ends</hi> of a <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>
This therefore being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that <hi>old Revelations</hi> are thus
intelligible without <hi>new ones,</hi> it muſt
needs follow that their explication
muſt be derived from the uſe of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
means.</hi> And then for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
further what theſe <hi>ordinary
means</hi> are that might have been
judged ſuch by thoſe to whom theſe
Revelations were made, I conſider
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95950:163"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that this whole indulgence
of God in granting the Spirit of
Propheſie was plainly accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>Heathen</hi> practice of <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
This might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplyfied
in ſeveral particulars.
Thus firſt, the very practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing
<hi>future contingencies,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of <hi>ordinary conſultations</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the affairs of <hi>private</hi> and
<hi>particular perſons,</hi> cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
grounded on <hi>reaſon,</hi> (otherwiſe
it would have been of <hi>eternal uſe,</hi>
even now under the <hi>Goſpel</hi>) but a
condeſcenſion to the <hi>cuſtomes</hi> and
<hi>expectations</hi> of the perſons to whom
they were communicated; and
Secondly, that an <hi>order</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of <hi>Prophets</hi> was eſtabliſhed in
<hi>Analogy</hi> to the <hi>Heathen Diviners</hi> is
by a very ingenious perſon<note n="s" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling-fleet</hi> Or. Sacr. L. II. c. iv. N. 1.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from that famous paſſage of
<hi>Deut.</hi> XVIII. 15. 18. to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he alſo produces the concurrent
Teſtimony of <hi>Origen Cont. Celſ.</hi> L. I.
and Thirdly, that the ſenſe of the
<hi>Platoniſts</hi> and other <hi>Heathens,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Divine Inſpiration,</hi> its <hi>nature</hi>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:95950:164"/>
and <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>different degrees,</hi> and
<hi>diſtinction from Enthuſiaſm</hi> does ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much agree with the notions of
the <hi>Rabbins</hi> concerning it, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to any that conſiders the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of both produced by Mr.
<hi>Smith</hi> in his excellent Diſcourſe on
this ſubject. Hence it will follow
Sixthly, that as this Divination of
which they were ſo eager, was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
<hi>Heatheniſh,</hi> ſo they were moſt
inclinable to make uſe of thoſe
means of underſtanding it to which
they had been inured from the ſame
principles of <hi>Heatheniſm,</hi> eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where God had not otherwiſe
either expreſly provided for it, or
expreſly prohibited the means for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
uſed, and thoſe means, others
failing, were moſt likely by them to
be judged ordinary. And that
<hi>Oneirocriticks</hi> were the proper means
among the <hi>Heathens</hi> for explaining
their <hi>Divinatio per ſomnium</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> degree of <hi>Propheſie
by Dreams;</hi> and indeed the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
art of the <hi>Harioli</hi> and <hi>conjectures</hi>
concerning <hi>Viſions</hi> as far as they held
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:95950:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Analogy with thoſe repreſentations
which were made to other leſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
perſons in their ſleep, will not
need any proof. It might have
been ſhewn how the principal Rules
of the <hi>Jewiſh Cabbala</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> among

by the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> ſo they were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the <hi>Heathen Occult Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</hi>
And certainly it is moſt likely
to have been ſome kind of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and explaining <hi>Propheſies,</hi> and
ſome kinds of <hi>learning</hi> ſubſervient
thereunto, which was ſo ſolemnly
ſtudied by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> candidates for
<hi>Propheſie</hi> in their <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Colled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi>
and which made it ſo ſtrange
that perſons wanting that preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſuch as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> ſhould be
by God honoured with it; beſides
that we find the punctual fulfilling
of ſeveral predictions of the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daeans</hi>

he obſerved the <hi>Oneirocritical rules</hi>
in their ſignification; for it is not
probable that revolutions managed

could have been foreknown or ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
by the <hi>Devil,</hi> he being fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
put to his ſolemn ſhifts of
<hi>aequivocation</hi> for concealment of his
ignorance in affairs of <hi>greater moral
probability,</hi> and conſequently of
<hi>eaſier prediction.</hi> And it cannot
ſeem more ſtrange that God ſhould
obſerve the Rules of <hi>Oneirocriticks</hi>
and <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> in his <hi>Reſponſes</hi>
when made uſe of with a pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

<hi>Daniel</hi> who was ſo famous for

thought by the <hi>Heathens</hi> to do ſome
things by the <hi>Inſpiration of the Holy

education,</hi> Chap. i. 4. and was a

thought in things not exceeding the

And they as well as the <hi>Jewes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

that it was, though hardly, in the

by humane wiſedome. Certainly
<hi>St. Irenaeus</hi> underſtood him ſo when

amount to ſuch a number. I do not,
by all that has been ſaid, intend that
all <hi>Propheſies</hi> are explicable by any

I know many of the <hi>Heathen Oracles</hi>

means,</hi> may thence be conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that ſeeing that, according to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:95950:167"/>
the <hi>Jewes,</hi> this is made the <hi>Characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtick
diſtinction</hi> betwixt <hi>true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie</hi>
and <hi>Enthuſiaſme,</hi> that though
both of them (the <hi>gradus Moſaicus</hi>
of <hi>Propheſie</hi> onely being excepted,
which is <hi>extraordinary</hi>) do imply a
<hi>mixed influence</hi> of the <hi>Intellectual</hi>
and <hi>Imaginative facultives,</hi> yet that
in <hi>Enthuſiaſme</hi> the <hi>Imaginative</hi> were
predominant, but in <hi>Propheſie</hi> the
<hi>Intellectual;</hi> whence alſo they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferred that though <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi>
might have <hi>Prophetick Inſtincts</hi> as
little underſtood by themſelves as
others, yet <hi>true Prophets</hi> perfectly
underſtood their own condition,
and made <hi>prudential reflections,</hi> and
were inquiſitive after the <hi>ſenſe,</hi> and
were therefore importunate with
God for a further Revelation of
what they underſtood not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what they did not enquire after,
nor conſequently was not upon ſuch
their ſolicitations revealed to them,
was in all probability to be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
already rightly underſtood by
them <hi>without Revelation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in the uſe of <hi>ordinary means.</hi>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:95950:167"/>
Indeed it might ſo fall out that what
was in the uſe of <hi>ordinary means</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
might yet actually not be
underſtood, and God might for that
time be pleaſed that it ſhould not be
ſo, eſpecially where no duty <hi>antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi>
might be prejudiced by ſuch a
concealment; yet is not ſo late an
underſtanding of ſuch <hi>Propheſies</hi>
grounded on <hi>their obſcurity,</hi> but that
of the <hi>event,</hi> which when come to
paſs will be found, without any <hi>new

Fathers</hi> you will find by their names,
but for thoſe that are <hi>leſs volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,</hi>
you muſt have recourſe to the
<hi>Bibliothecae:</hi> both <hi>Graeco-Latine</hi> and
<hi>Latine,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>laſt Editions,</hi>
though you may find ſome in the
firſt that were afterwards expunged
out of the later by the <hi>Popiſh party.</hi>
For the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> I ſhould rather
counſel you to read the prime Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
than the abettors of <hi>Parties,</hi>
unleſs it be, when you have ſatiſfied
your ſelf of their ſenſe, for the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
proſecution of their arguments;
for they are indeed very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by their <hi>ingenious Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators.</hi>
For <hi>Aquinas,</hi> you need
hardly read any thing but his <hi>Sums,</hi>
which you will find to contain the
Sum of his <hi>works</hi> (which mount to
that voluminouſneſs they have, very
much by repetitions) as well as of
<hi>Divinity,</hi> and that with this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
that theſe were his laſt and
moſt praemeditate thoughts, ſeeing
he dyed before he compleated them.
Theſe you may read with <hi>Cajetane.</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:95950:175"/>
Then <hi>Scotus on the Sentences</hi> together
with <hi>Lychetus;</hi> and for the <hi>Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
Occham</hi> and <hi>Ariminenſis,</hi> if you
can get them; if not, <hi>Biel,</hi> who is
more eaſily procurable. If you
would read any more of the ancient
Schoolmen, let them be ſuch as are
not addicted to <hi>Factions,</hi> or thoſe
that are <hi>moderate;</hi> ſuch are <hi>Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Durand, Gerſon, Almain, Aliaco</hi>
and <hi>Cameracenſis.</hi> For <hi>Critical learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
you are to take notice of the
<hi>unuſual</hi> or <hi>ambiguous Phraſes</hi> of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
and mark them on the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
of the books themſelves, if
they be your own, and when you
ſhall meet with any thing parallell,
compare them together, and, if
they be rarely obſerved, note them
in <hi>MSS.</hi> prepared for that purpoſe.
For the <hi>Antiquities</hi> of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and the <hi>Jewiſh Cuſtomes</hi> in the
<hi>New,</hi> you may read the <hi>Talmud,</hi> the
<hi>Chaldee Paraphraſts,</hi> the <hi>Old Rabbins,</hi>
with <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo.</hi> For the
<hi>New Teſtament ſects,</hi> the <hi>Phariſees,
Sadduces</hi> and <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> beſides what
you will meet in the Authors alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:95950:175"/>
preſcribed and <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who
had himſelf been formerly a <hi>Jew,</hi>
you may read the <hi>Trihaereſes</hi> of <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,
Serarius,</hi> and <hi>Druſius;</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
upon <hi>Baronius</hi>'s <hi>Apparatus.</hi>
But the <hi>Praxis</hi> of all matters of this
nature is ſufficiently contained in
thoſe late Editions of the <hi>Polyglotta</hi>
and <hi>Criticks,</hi> that I need not trouble
my ſelf to give you an <hi>Inventory</hi> of
any more Authors, than what you
will find quoted upon ſeveral occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
The knowledge of the old
<hi>Aegyptian Divinity</hi> and <hi>Tongue</hi> you
may have from <hi>Herodotus, Plutarch
de Iſid. &amp; Oſtride,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> the
<hi>Prodromus, Oedipus</hi> and <hi>Theſaurus</hi> of
<hi>Athanaſius Kircher;</hi> the <hi>Phaenician</hi>
from <hi>Sanchoniathon</hi> in <hi>Euſebius de
Praep. Evang.</hi> from thoſe <hi>Fragments</hi>
of <hi>Pherecydes Syrius</hi> in ancient Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
for he is ſaid to have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
them hence by <hi>Suidas,</hi> though
poſſibly with alterations of his own,
and the works of <hi>Porphyry</hi> who was
their Countryman; the <hi>Chaldaean</hi>
from their <hi>Magick Oracles</hi> bound up
with a collection of all the reſt of
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:95950:176"/>
what nature ſoever, with the <hi>Greek
Scholia</hi> of <hi>Pſellus</hi> and <hi>Pletho</hi> by <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopaeus,</hi>
and <hi>Jamblichus de myſter.
Aegyptior. &amp; Chaldaeor.</hi> For the
<hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of the <hi>ancient
Poets</hi> you may ſatisfie your ſelf from
<hi>Gerardus Johannes Voſſius de Poetis</hi>
and <hi>Gregorius Giraldus</hi> in his <hi>Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,</hi>
concerning the ſame ſubject.
The <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Opinions</hi> of the <hi>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Philoſophers</hi> you may read in
<hi>Diogenes Laërtius, Plutarch de Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
the <hi>Greek Lexicographers,</hi> and
very many other ancient Authors,
particularly in what is remaining of
<hi>Porphyry</hi>'s work on that Subject, his

very much of that <hi>Eaſtern,</hi> both
<hi>Babylonian</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> learning in
the expeditions of <hi>Apollonius Tyane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
written by <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> and the
late Mr. <hi>Stanley;</hi> eſpecially for their
Opinions you may conſult the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
collection of <hi>Stobaeus.</hi> And
though all the three Sects of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,</hi>
both <hi>Jonick, Italick</hi> and
<hi>Eleatick,</hi> ſeem originally to have
been derived from the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:95950:176"/>
(as you may ſee learnedly diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

               <note n="z" place="margin">Strom 1.</note>

and ſo would be beneficial to your
deſign; yet I think there are hardly
any profeſſed works remaining of
any of them but the <hi>Pythagoraeans</hi>
and the <hi>Platoniſts.</hi> For the former
you may read the <hi>golden verſes</hi> with
<hi>Hierocles,</hi> and his <hi>Symbols</hi> with <hi>Giral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
on them, uſually both bound to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with <hi>Hierocles</hi>'s works, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the late <hi>Collection</hi> of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoraean
Authors</hi> and <hi>Fragments</hi> at
<hi>Cambridg,</hi> MDCLXX. For the later,
you may have <hi>Plato</hi>'s works and

and others that have endeavoured
to reconcile him to <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> The
<hi>myſtical ſenſes</hi> of the <hi>Poets</hi> (beſides
what you ſhall meet with common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the Ancients) you have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained

               <hi>Achmedes</hi> alone, and <hi>Aſtrampſychus</hi>
at the end of the forementioned
<hi>Edition</hi> of the <hi>Oracles.</hi> For their
<hi>Hiſtorians</hi> and <hi>Geographers,</hi> I refer
you to <hi>Bodinus</hi> his <hi>Methodus Hiſtoriae,</hi>
at the end whereof he has a <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue</hi>
of them, and an account of
the times which they lived in, but

and <hi>Petavius</hi> for the one, and
<hi>Ortelius</hi> and <hi>Bochartus</hi> for the other.
And this may ſerve for your initiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in theſe Studies, which is, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
my uttermost deſign.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="XI"/> XI. But the way for avoyding
<hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>diſtraction</hi> in ſuch a
<hi>variety</hi> of them, which will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to the Fourth particular of
my propounded Method, will be to
ſhew which of them are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to be Studied at the ſame time,
but in order; and for them which
are ſo, what times diſtinctly are <hi>moſt
ſeaſonable.</hi> For the former, you
may, from what has been ſaid, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
what Studies are requiſite
for others, and therefore neceſſary
to be firſt proſecuted; and beſides
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95950:177"/>
what are more neceſſary for your
preſent uſes, and what may as yet
be more conveniently omitted:
onely it were well you would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to overcome the <hi>rudiments</hi>
of whatever you deſign as ſoon as
you can, though they be not of
<hi>preſent uſe,</hi> for you will find them
more <hi>tireſome</hi> when you are <hi>older.</hi>
Of theſe therefore it will be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to ſpeak any more. That
therefore, in thoſe that are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to be followed, you may avoyd
<hi>diſtraction,</hi> and yet looſe as little
time as is poſſible: you may diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
them into ſuch as are more
<hi>easily apprehended,</hi> and entertained
with more <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>ſenſible plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi>
and ſo leave a <hi>more tenacious
impreſſion</hi> on the <hi>memory;</hi> and theſe
you may apply your ſelf to imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after your <hi>recreations,</hi> and
afer a little reflection, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to thoſe that are more ſerious,
and require a greater recollection:
for ſuch I eſteem <hi>Hiſtory</hi> and <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy;</hi>
for which I would have
you begin with the <hi>Ancients</hi> in their
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:95950:178"/>
               <hi>own tongues,</hi> with the <hi>Annotations</hi>
of <hi>noted Criticks,</hi> who both may
put you in mind, and ſatisfie you in
difficulties which you had not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
expected, and refer you to
Parallel places in other Authors,
where you may find that which
probably you may ſometimes be
deſirous of, ſome things diſcuſſed
more largely which in your preſent
Author are more briefly intimated,
which it will be very beneficial to
read immediately whileſt the other
things are more freſh in your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory;
and when you are ſo far
ſkilled in them, you ſhould have
your <hi>Paper Books</hi> by you, to note,
and compare, and exerciſe your own
conjectures concerning what is <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular,</hi>
and worthy of <hi>eſpecial obſervation;</hi>
or ſuch as will more <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi>
your <hi>judgment,</hi> and require a
mind more <hi>compoſed</hi> and <hi>ſerious,</hi>
and therefore afford leſs pleaſure in
reading, and upon that account will
require more meditation: for ſuch
I intend <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> for
which I think it were well you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:95950:178"/>
your <hi>morning-Studies</hi> wholly,
allowing onely ſome time <hi>before
Dinner</hi> for <hi>Meditation;</hi> wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
I would have you not onely
exerciſe your <hi>memory</hi> in reflecting on
what was produced by your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
but alſo your <hi>judgment,</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
what means may be uſed
for the determination of the whole
<hi>Controverſie.</hi> And the ſame way
you may take at <hi>Night</hi> which is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
convenient time, in preparing
materials for your <hi>morning Theſis</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Praeſcriptions already
mentioned. The reſt of the <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon</hi>
you may deſign for the <hi>Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
and your other <hi>humane Studies.</hi>
And I think it very commendable
if you would employ the <hi>Praxis</hi> of
your <hi>Grammatical Studies</hi> for the
underſtanding of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and
therefore that you would with them,
together with your <hi>Devotions,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
and conclude your <hi>Morning</hi> and
<hi>Evening Studies,</hi> but ſo as that you
may afterwards draw from them
ſome moral and practical obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that may be of uſe for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:95950:179"/>
or examination of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
for the whole day. And
the ſame advantage you may get by
reading the <hi>Leſſons</hi> at <hi>Publick Prayers</hi>
in your <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Hebrew Bible,</hi> and
noting in the <hi>Margent</hi> with <hi>Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead</hi>
the <hi>unuſual Idioms,</hi> or <hi>obſcure
paſſage</hi> you may meet with, that ſo,
if afterwards you remember, or find,
any thing that may contribute to
their explication in your other Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
you may know whither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
them. And thus, I think, I have
gone through all the particulars of
your preſent propoſal: both <hi>how to
order your Studies to Divinity, what
were moſt conducing to that end,</hi> and
<hi>what firſt to be taken in hand,</hi> as <hi>briefly,</hi>
as was poſſible, conveniently, though,
I confeſs, very much more <hi>largely</hi>
than I had originally intended, and
I muſt ingenuouſly acknowledge
that, as I have already profeſſed my
ſelf willing, ſo I am my ſelf ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
that it will be neceſſary, that
I be corrected in ſome inſtances,
wherein I cannot pretend to any
conſiderable experience. I believe
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:95950:179"/>
you may your ſelf eaſily gueſs what
they are, for I cannot now ſtay to
enumerate them particularly; and
as I ſhould be willing my ſelf, ſo I
ſhall adviſe you to conſult men
whom you know to be ſkilled in
each of them ſeverally (if you have
any conveniency) before you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
them. But if in any of the
reſt, wherein I am able, or in any of
your particular Studies, you ſhall
meet with any important difficulties,
I hope you will uſe the Ingenuity of
a Scholar in freely communicating
them to</p>
