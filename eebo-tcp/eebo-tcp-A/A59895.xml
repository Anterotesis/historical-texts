            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BEING A

Preacht on that Occasion.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe reason, why I publish this Sermon, is partly to
gratifie the desires of some, partly to prevent the
misrepresentations of others, but chiefly for the same
end, for which I preacht it, <hi>viz.</hi> to take the advantage of this
present opportunity, to make some impressions upon mens minds,
which I fear at other times, they will not so easily receive.</p>
            <p>I hope all honest men, even Dissenters themselves, do from
their hearts abhor those villanous designs against the Life
of our King, which God of his great mercy to these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
has so lately brought to light: and while they are pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
with such an abhorrence of the Treason, it seems to me,
to be a very proper season to put them in mind by what means
such evil designs have been first formed and encouraged and
brought to ripeness and perfection; that those, who have
been cheated into a Faction by some plausible pretences, and
have followed the general noise and outcry in the simplicity of
their hearts, may take warning for the future, and avoid
every step and advance towards Sedition and Treason, as well
as abhor the Treason it self.</p>
            <p>It was impossible to do this, without calling to mind a
great many things, which to be sure, those who are any ways
concerned, are not now willing to hear of; and that with such
plainness, as is necessary to convince men of the evil nature
and tendency of such practices: but God is my witness, that
I did not this with the least design to upbraid or reproach
any men, or party of men, but with the same honest and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
intentions, though it may be not with the same skill,
that a Chirurgeon uses in searching a wound to the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;
which is very painful indeed, but absolutely necessary
to a Cure.</p>
            <p>Some persons, I hear, have objected against this Discourse,
that I seem to charge this Plot upon the <hi>Protestant Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:50722:3"/>
and insinuate that it is <hi>a Fanatick, a true Protestant
Plot.</hi> God forbid that all Protestant Dissenters should be
concerned in this Plot, I hope better things of many of
them; nor do I undertake to meddle with such matters.
All that I meant, is nothing but what is evident to any man,
who believes a Plot, that this horrible Conspiracy has been
contrived and carried on by those men, who of late have
pretended to be the only <hi>true Protestants;</hi> a name, which
they would not allow to any man, who appeared zealously
concerned either for the King, or the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
Whether such men have any Religion or none, whether they
go to Conventicles, or to give the better grace to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
sometimes hear the Common Prayer, is all one to me.
I am sure the turbulent spirit, which has of late acted our
Dissenters, and their unwillingness to believe any Plot still,
gives too just a suspicion of many of them.</p>
            <p>Though we are all bound to praise and adore the Divine
goodness in defeating such wicked designs, yet I am so far from
triumphing over these men, that I cannot but pity and mourn
over them; my heart bleeds for that scandal, that is done to
Religion, that advantage which is given to the common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
for the sin and the fall of great Men, and the ruine of
Noble Families; but what is done, cannot be undone again:
our care must look forward, to times to come, to remove the
occasions, to root up the very seeds and principles of Sedition,
that these shakings and convulsions of State may at last settle
in a profound and secure Peace and Tranquillity. If this
plain discourse can contribute any thing to so happy an end, I
have all that I aim'd at both in Preaching and Printing it;
however, I have the satisfaction of an honest design, which is
a reward to its self; and gives that inward contentment and
pleasure, which the reproaches and censures of the World,
which too often attend such undertakings, can never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb.</p>

SERMON.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>XVIII. PSALM, v. 50.</bibl>
               <q>Great deliverance giveth he to his King, and
sheweth mercy to his Anointed, to David and to
his Seed for evermore.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Psalm was pen'd by <hi>David</hi> in a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
remembrance of those many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
deliverances, which God had
wrought for him; and particularly his
deliverance from the hands of <hi>Saul,</hi> a
jealous, powerful, and implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as we are expresly told, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. 1.</p>
            <p>This Pious Prince, though he were immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
to the Throne by God himself, could not escape
the Conspiracies of his enemies both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
for Men of Turbulent and restless Spirits, will be
sure to find or make some pretences or occasions of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
under the most just and equal Government.</p>
            <p>Sometimes men dispute the right of Succession; but
this they could not do here, unless they would dispute
Gods right to place and displace Princes; for <hi>David</hi> was
immediately chosen by God, and anointed by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and yet this could not secure him from Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and Rebellions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:50722:4"/>
Others pretend great Oppression and Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Government, though their licentious noises
and clamours sufficiently confute it; for men, who are
most opprest dare say the least of it. The Liberties and
Properties of the Subject, is an admirable pretence to
deprive the Prince of his Liberties and Properties; and
those who have any Liberty and Property to loose, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
gain any thing by this: for when they have secured
their Liberties and Properties against their Prince, it is a
much harder task to secure themselves from their fellow-Subjects.
Men who have no Property have some en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Rebel, and fight for Property; for it is
possible they may get something in the scramble, when
all Law and Property ceases, but the property of the
Sword: but methinks men of Honour and plentiful
Fortune, should not be so zealous for transferring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties,
to enrich Beggars, and submit their necks to the
Yoke and Government of their own Slaves; which our
late experience has taught us to be the glorious effect of
Rebelling for Liberty and Property.</p>
            <p>Others make Religion a pretence for their Rebellion,
Religion, the greatest and the dearest interest of all;
but methinks it is a dangerous way for men to Rebel to
save their Souls,<note place="margin">13 Rom. 2.</note> when God has threatned Damnation
against those who Rebel: but this is as vain a pretence
as Liberty and Property; for no men fight for Religion,
who have any. Religion is a quiet, peaceable, gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
thing; it teaches men to suffer patiently, but not
to Rebel. And were there any true concernment for
Religion in this pretence, can we imagine, that the most
profest Atheists, the most lewd profligate wretches, the
greatest Prodigies and Monsters of wickedness, should
be so zealous for Religion? But it's evident, it is not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
such men are zealous for, but a Liberty in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that is, that every one may have his liberty to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50722:4"/>
of any Religion, or of none; which serves the Atheists
turn, as well as the Sectaries, but is not much for the
honour or interest of true Religion.</p>
            <p>So that whatever the pretences are, it is an ambitious,
discontented, revengeful spirit, an uneasie, restless, fickle
and changeable humour, which disturbs publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and undermines the Thrones of Princes; and
therefore it is no wonder, if the best Princes and the best
Governments in the world be disturbed by such men;
<hi>David</hi> himself could not escape, he had a great many
enemies, but <hi>Davids</hi> God was greater than they all,
<hi>for great deliverance giveth he to his King, and sheweth
mercy to his Anointed, to</hi> David <hi>and to his seed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is something peculiar in these words, which
cannot be applied to any other Prince: for as <hi>David</hi> was
King of <hi>Israel,</hi> so he was a Type of the <hi>Messias,</hi> who
was to descend from his loynes, and that promise or
prediction that he would shew mercy to his Anointed,
to <hi>David</hi> and to his seed for evermore, received its full
accomplishment, in the Kingdom of the <hi>Messias,</hi> who is
said to set upon the Throne of <hi>David;</hi> but yet those
deliverances God wrought for <hi>David,</hi> were personal too,
and an example of Gods care and protection of Pious
and Religious Princes. And when we see the same good
providence watching over our Prince, and securing him
from the bloody designs of wicked men, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thankfully to acknowledge it, as <hi>David</hi> did; <hi>great
deliverance he hath given to our Prince, he hath shewn
mercy to his Anointed. Now know we, that the Lord sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
his Anointed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">20 Psalm, 6, 7, 8.</note> 
               <hi>he will hear him from his holy Heaven
with the saving strength of his right hand. Some trust
in Chariots, and some in Horses, but we will remember the
Name of the Lord our God: they are brought down and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,
but we are risen and stand upright.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:50722:5"/>
My present Discourse therefore shall consist of those
two parts. 1. Briefly to observe to you, those many
great Deliverances which God hath wrought for our
King. 2. I shall make some practical Reflections on
it, especially with reference to this late Discovery.</p>
            <p>1. To observe to you, those many great deliverances
which God hath wrought for our King. His troubles
have not been much unlike, I am sure not inferiour to
<hi>Davids,</hi> and his Deliverances have not been less strange
and wonderful. I am not a going to give you a Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of his Life, but only to point you to some remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
passages of it, which it becomes us all thankfully to
remember.</p>
            <p>I suppose no man doubts, how many dangers a Prince
is exposed to, who flies before an enraged and victorious
enemy; who knows not whither to go, where to hide
himself, whom to trust: this was the condition of our
Dread Soveraign, who was hunted as a Partridge in the
mountains, pursued by his own Rebellious Subjects, who
had usurpt his Throne, and thirsted after his Blood. But
then God found a hiding place for him, and delivered
him from the desire and expectation of his enemies.</p>
            <p>But still his condition was calamitous, he was forc't
to live in Exile and Banishment, divested of Royal pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and all the ensignes of Majesty, reduced to a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,
and sometimes a necessitous state, while he
saw his Friends impoverisht and ruined, his Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
opprest, his Enemies triumphant, too vigilant, and
too powerful to allow any hope to see an end of these
troubles. But that God, who can do what he pleases,
and oftentimes does such things, as no humane force
nor power can effect, put an end to these troubles also;
and restored him to his Fathers Throne in Peace and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and with the universal joy and triumph of his
Subjects: and I suppose you will reckon this a delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50722:5"/>
a great and wonderful deliverance both to Prince
and People; a deliverance immediately wrought by
God; without Humane policy, contrivance, or power.
To see a Prince whose Father was Murdered, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
forc't into banishment by his own Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any power of his own, without the help and assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Forreign Allies; while his Friends at home were
opprest, while the same power that drove him out, was
still in the hands of his enemies; while so many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
who were in greatest power were concerned for
their own preservation to keep him out; while those
who wisht his return, durst not whisper any thing tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to call the King back again; I say, to see a Prince in
such circumstances, without striking a blow, without
shedding a drop of Blood, return again in the throngs
and crouds, and with the acclamations of his Subjects,
is no less a Miracle, than dividing the sea to give a safe
passage to the <hi>Israelites:</hi> for the Psalmist represents it
as an argument of equal power to <hi>still the noise of the
the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the
people.</hi>
               <note place="margin">65 Psal. 7.</note> 
               <hi>This is the Lords doings, and it is marvellous in
our eyes; now know we, that the Lord saveth his Anointed,
he will hear him from his holy Heaven with the saving
strength of his right hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that good Providence, which brought our King
back again, has watcht over him ever since. Though
he returned in a happy day, when the Seas were smooth
and calm, when no frowns were to be seen on mens for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,
but such cheerful looks as signifyed the inward
pleasure and serenity of their minds, yet it could not
be expected, that this calm would always last. I think
we may now venture to say, without fear of being cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that there are two sorts of men, that are restless
and implacable, and always working under ground, and
both of them with an equal pretence of Religion: I
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50722:6"/>
mean the Papist and the Fanatick. I shall not take notice
of those several weak attempts they have made since the
happy Restauration of our Prince; there is something
greater to imploy our thoughts at this time, some more
signal demonstrations of that great deliverance God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
to his King.</p>
            <p>We have now for many years had little other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
than of a Popish Plot, a wicked hellish design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Life of our King, and the Religion and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
of his Subjects. This was a formidable design,
laid close and in the dark, prosecuted with deep Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and combined interests. We may remember, for I
think we cannot easily forget, what horror and conster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
surprized us at the news; we lived in perpetual
fear of the Life of our Prince, in perpetual fear of our
own: how did the name of Popery deservedly stink
among us! how did men abhor a Religion, which is
nourisht with Blood, with Royal and innocent Blood!
How zealous were men in their discoveries, how watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in their Guards, how devout in their Prayers for the
preservation of their Prince, and of their Religion!
And though possibly we have not seen to the bottom of
that Plot to this day, and it may be never shall, yet bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be God, there was enough discovered to prevent
the mischief; we still enjoy our Religion, we still see
our Prince, and rejoyce under the benigne influences of
his Government; hitherto God hath saved his Anointed
from a Popish, I pray God still defend him from a Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Plot.</p>
            <p>A Fanatick, a true Protestant Plot? surely that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
there can be no danger from that corner; this
is only a scandal cast upon innocent and peaceable men.
Truly this has been so often said, and with so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
that we had like not to have believed it possible,
till it had been too late. It was sufficient to prove any
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50722:6"/>
man to be a Papist, who durst own it possible, for such
good men to Rebel, or Plot against the King and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and yet it was very hard not to think that
possible to be done, which had been done once already,
and that so lately, as not to be forgot, though it was
pardoned; an Act of Oblivion could not wipe it out of
mens memories, especially when they saw the same
things begin to be acted over again, with the same Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
pretences. I am apt to think, we had been
more secure from the Popish Plot, than for ought I
know, we may yet be, had not these men abused peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
fears and dangers of Popery to the disturbance of
the Government, and to the carrying on their Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical
and Fanatick designs. We remember how
soon the Popish Plot was turned into a great noise and
cry against the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and no way was
thought so fit to keep out Popery, as to pull down the
Church; and thus the poor Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
had escaped the rage and fury of <hi>Rome,</hi> had like to
have been sacrificed to a true Protestant zeal, which no
doubt had given a fatal blow to Popery. <hi>Hoc Ithacus
velit, &amp; magni mercentur Atridae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How things proceeded after this to the disturbance of
the publick peace, and the interruption of the ordinary
course of Justice, you all know, as well as I; and wise
men quickly saw, and honest men could not forbear
warning the people, whither these things tended: and
they met with a good reward for it; they were all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
in Masquerade, and especially the Loyal Clergy
were loaded with all the contempt and ignominy, which
an inraged and envenomed zeal, and some witless scrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
could cast on them. Whole vollies of Pamphlets
flew about to poyson the people with lewd and Seditious
Principles; but to talk or write or preach about Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to Government, or patient suffering for a good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50722:7"/>
cause, was to betray the Protestant Interest, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
a Popish Successour to cut our Throats: and what
all this ends in, thanks be to God, we now see, and I hope,
time enough to prevent it.</p>
            <p>I do not pretend to tell you any thing which you do
not all know; Time, and the care of our Governours,
and the guilty Consciences of Rebels, and the good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God, I hope, will make further Discoveries, and
bring these secret works of darkness into open view; but
we know enough to praise God for his great deliverance,
which he hath given his King; we know enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
and adore that infinite wisdom who by the most
seemingly casual and contingent events, can so easily
disappoint and defeat the designs of wicked and bloody
men. Who ever suspected, that the fire at <hi>Newmarket</hi>
was sent by God for the preservation of our King and
his Royal Brother, for the preservation of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
of our Liberties and Religion? <hi>Wonderful are
thy works, O Lord, and thy ways past finding out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This short account I have given you, is an excellent
Comment upon my Text, a case very parallel to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids.</hi>
The deliverances of our Prince are no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to that mercy God shewed to <hi>David,</hi> when he
delivered him from the Lyon and the Bear, from the
uncircumcised Philistin, from a persecuting <hi>Saul,</hi> from
a Rebellious <hi>Absolom,</hi> from a Treacherous <hi>Achitophel,</hi>
from the strivings of the people. <hi>Great deliverance
sheweth he to his King, and sheweth mercy to his Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And thus I proceed to make some practical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
and Observations on this, which was the thing
I principally designed. And they are these.</p>
            <p>1. What a vain and fruitless attempt it is to Plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Life and Crown and Dignity of our Prince,
when God undertakes the defence and protection of him.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50722:7"/>
Setting aside the wickedness and impiety of it, it is a
foolish and dangerous design. Whoever considers only
the probable events of humane actions, will be easily
convinc't, how unlikely it is, that such Plots should
take effect. To miss the very critical m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nute, spoils all
the design; and yet after all the skill and contrivance
they can use, there are ten thousand casualties to disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
them. Such designs cannot be acted alone, but
require numerous confederates; and what security can
there be, that no one man in such a number shall betray
the Secret? Some possibly may be toucht with remorse
and horror of Conscience, may be frighted with the
very thoughts of that Villany which they designed to
act; and then they need no body to betray them but
themselves, for no man can long together conceal the
fire, which burns in his own breast. Other men may
get into the company, and acquaint themselves with all
their Intrigues, and act so cunning a part, as to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
for confiding persons; may appear most zealous
and most forward in the business, and all this while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
their Counsels, and put an effectual stop to them,
when they are ripe for execution: and it is impossible
for the cunningest men to prevent this, who have not
a Casement into mens Breasts. Other men, who enter
into the Confederacy to make their Fortunes, may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to consider, that it is much the safest and most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
way to do this by discovering the Plot, than by
acting it. The power of Wine sometimes unlocks a
Secret, and saves a Kingdom; some unexpected Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels
and Animosities among the Conspirators, a mutual
jealousie of each others greatness; a hasty dispute about
dividing the Riches and Honours and Power of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
before they have it, may tempt them to hang one
another, and leave the Spoil which they had already
devoured in their hopes and expectations, to the right
owners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:50722:8"/>
A desire to rescue some friend out of the common
ruin, may save a Kingdom. Walls and Hedges have Ears,
and the very Birds of the Air may tell the matter.
Their Cabals may be observed and suspected, and their
affectation of Secrecy may betray them. Their guilt is
often seen in their looks, and creates jealousies and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicions
of some secret design; and an unlucky word,
which he meant nothing by, who spoke it, may make
them think themselves discovered; and this is a ready
way to make them discover themselves. The Heart of
the stoutest Rebel may fail him, when he comes to
give the fatal blow; or he may miss of his aim, or his
Gun may not go off, or he may distrust his own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scape,
and not be hardy enough to sacrifice his own life
in the Cause; and a thousand other accidents, which it
is impossible for me to reckon up, may save the Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Prince, and Hang the Conspirators: and those had
need be men of very desperate Fortunes, or very little
understanding, who engage in such desperate designs.</p>
            <p>But when to this we add the consideration of the
Divine Providence, which peculiarly interests it self in
the disposal of Kingdoms, and in all the great Changes
and Revolutions of Publick affairs, unless these men were
of the Privy-Council of Heaven, and could hold intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
with the Secret Decrees and purposes of God for
the Government of the World, they can never be secure
of Success, how hopeful soever their projects and designs
appear.</p>
            <p>If God take any care of human affairs, if he concern
himself at all in the Government of the World, we may
certainly conclude that his providence does principally
order the Fate and Revolutions of Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths.
Some Philosophers have questioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God condescended so far, as to take notice of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
creatures; but all who acknowledged his Providence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50722:8"/>
thought the great Concernments of Kingdoms, the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
or displacing of Princes, worthy of his care and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
regard: and therefore we, who are assured by our
Saviour, that Gods care and providence extends to the
Sparrows, and the Lilies of the Field, cannot doubt,
whether he Rules and Governs in the Kingdoms of men,
whether he who takes care of every particular creature,
takes care of the general concernments of humane Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
wherein the happiness of all particular men is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.
And can these men then think to pull down and
to set up Princes at their pleasure? God may sometimes
suffer Treason and Rebellion to be prosperous, but it can
never prosper, but when God pleases; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
Rebels should ever know that, and therefore
it is impossible, they should have any reasonable securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of success.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more expresly contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
will of God, than Treasonable Plots and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies
against Soveraign Princes: and though God does
many times permit those things to be done, which he
has forbid to be done, or else no man could ever be
Guilty of any Sin; yet his forbidding of it is a plain
argument, that he does not approve it, that he will
not countenance it, nay, that he will not permit it, but
where he sees great and wise reasons to do so.</p>
            <p>God never indeed interposes by an irresistible power
to hinder men from choosing that which is wicked, for
he offers no force and violence to mens Wills: but when
this wickedness is injurious to others, who are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his care and providence, he many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposes
to prevent the mischief. The lives of private
men are not at the disposal of every Ruffian; not a
Sparrow falls to the ground without our Father, much
less a man, much less a Prince, on whose life and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
the lives and fortunes of so many thousands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:50722:9"/>
And therefore no man can reasonably promise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
success in Plotting against his Prince, but he who
certainly knows, that God for some wise but hidden
reasons, will suffer such a Villany to take effect; which
no man can know without a Revelation; and we cannot
think, that God will encourage any man by an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Revelation to do that, which he himself has
expresly forbid, and threatned with Eternal death.</p>
            <p>So that all such men act at infinite uncertainties;
besides the punishments of the other World, which are
reserved for Traitors; besides the many Natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
and uncertainties of humane actions: if they
believe, that there is a Providence which Governs the
World, they have ten thousand to one against them,
that God will not permit them to do, what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign:
and those are bold men indeed, who dare vie Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems
and Power with God!</p>
            <p>Especially when they Plot against a Prince who seems
to be the Darling of Providence, who has received so
many wonderful and miraculous deliverances, as if he
were still reserved for some Extraordinary service in the
World. One would have thought, the discoverie of
the Popish Plot, which no doubt was managed with as
much Secrecy, with as wary Councils, and deep In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
as any thing ever was, should have discouraged
any new attempts in this Age: it should have brought
to mind that Triumphant Psalm,<note place="margin">2 Psal. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>Why do the Heathen
rage, and the people imagine a vain thing? the Kings of the
earth stand up, and the Rulers take Counsel together</hi> (a
more powerful Faction than some private Male-contents)
<hi>against the Lord, and against his Anointed, saying, Let
us break their Bonds asunder, and cast away their Cords
from us. He that dwelleth in the Heavens shall laugh
them to scorn, the Lord shall have them in derision.</hi> At
least it is time now to take warning, lest we be found
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50722:9"/>
fighters against God: it is a vain and a dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to conspire his ruine, whom God hath hitherto
so miraculously preserved.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is another Observation on these late
Plots and Conspiracies, which no man can avoid making,
and that is, how dangerous the disputes and differences
of Religion are to the publick Peace and welfare of any
Nation. Christian Religion indeed is the greatest secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of Government, both in its precepts and examples;
It commands every Soul to be subject to the higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and threatens eternal Damnation against Rebels;
It teaches us to give to every one their due; <hi>Tribute
to whom Tribute is due, Custom to whom Custom, Fear to
whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour.</hi> It strictly enjoyns
the practise of all sociable Vertues, and charms those
boisterous passions, which disturb humane conversation;
it requires us to obey our Superiours in all lawful things,
and quietly to submit and suffer, when we can't obey.
And the blessed Jesus, who was the Author of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and our great Pattern and Example, did himself
practise these Laws, which he gave to us. He lived in
obedience to the Civil powers; and though the Jewish
Nation, which was a free people, the lot and inheritance
of God himself, were then in subjection to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
yet he would not give them the least encouragement
to shake off the yoak, but commands them to <hi>give nn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things
that are Gods.</hi> Though he was a King, yet he was not
<hi>Caesars</hi> Rival; for his Kingdom was not of this world,
&amp; therefore he did not arm his Subjects to fight for him,
as he told <hi>Pilate.</hi>
               <note place="margin">18 Joh. 36.</note> His Kingdom was not to be set up in
the world by force and power, but he gave testimony
to the truth with his Blood, and commanded his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to do so too. He died himself upon the Cross,
and made this the condition of our Discipleship, to take
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50722:10"/>
up our Cross and follow him; and thus the Apostles
and the Primitive Christians did, they cheerfully fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
their Master to the Cross, and conquered by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering.
Christianity was planted in the world by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
arts but the foolishness of Preaching, by preaching
that absurd and ridiculous Doctrine, as the world then
accounted it, of a Crucified Jesus; and it defended it
self only by a resolute and patient suffering for the
Name of Christ. This is the true temper and spirit of
Christianity. Under the most barbarous and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Emperours, no Christian ever suffered as a Rebel;
they gave no other disturbance to the Government, than
by confessing themselves Christians, and suffering for it.
Their numbers indeed were very formidable, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else; for in imitation of their great Master, they
went as Lambs to the slaughter, and as sleep before their
shearers are dumb, so they opened not their mouths.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding this, our daily experience tells
us, that when Religion is divided into Factions and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
or rather men are divided into Factions and Parties
upon account of Religion, there is nothing more imbit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
mens spirits against each other, nor gives greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance
to publick Government. All the troubles and
miseries, which for these late years have overwhelmed this
unfortunate Island, have been owing to this cause; Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
has been made either the reason or the pretence of all:
Papists plot and conspire the death of a Protestant Prince
to bring in Popery, and profest Protestants, it seems, do
the same thing to keep out Popery; and thus a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Prince, and a truly Protestant, or rather a true Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
and Apostolick Church, is in danger of both.</p>
            <p>And is there not great reason then for Princes, who
love their Lives and their Crowns, to keep a watchful
eye over such busie, potent, and dangerous Factions?
shall it be called Persecution for Religion, to punish Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50722:10"/>
or to keep under a factious and turbulent Spirit?
If the Consciences of Subjects will serve them to Rebel
for Religion, it seems a very hard case, if the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Prince must not allow him to hang 'em for
their Rebellion: and yet no wise Prince will put it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that hazard neither, if he can help it, to suffer his
Subjects to deserve to be hanged. To curb a growing
Faction by prudent and timely Restraints, is a much
better and safer way.</p>
            <p>The truth of this is readily owned, when it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Papists. They are men of such dangerous
Principles and Practices, as not to be suffered to live in
any Protestant Kingdom; and truly so they are, and
thanks be to God, we have very good Laws against
them; and whatever they may do in private, they dare
not out-face Government with their publick and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Conventicles; they walk in the dark, and dare not
own themselves to be what they are.</p>
            <p>But yet I cannot but wonder upon what Principles
those men Act, who are so Zealous against Popery, and
think it such an unpardonable fault in Governors, to
suffer any Papist, especially a Popish Priest, though never
so obscurely and privately, to live among us, and yet
at the same time think it Persecution, a horrible Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not to grant a general Liberty and Indulgence to
all other Dissenters. The difference between these two
cases must either respect their Religion, or the security
of the Government.</p>
            <p>As for their Religion, I believe Popery to be a very
corrupt Religion, and the greatest Apostacy from
Christianity of any other Sect or Profession, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the name of Christian; but yet I am so profest
an enemy to Popery, that Iabhor that Popish principle
of persecuting men meerly for Religions sake, which can
no more be justified in Protestants against Papists, than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50722:11"/>
in Papists against Protestants. It is certainly the duty
of a Prince to use his power and interest to Establish
the true Religion in his Kingdoms, to encourage the
sincere professors of it, and to lay such restraints up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
others, as may be sufficient to make them consider,
and hearken to wise instructions, that it may be no
mans temporal interest to dissent from the Religion of
his Prince: and it is the duty of Church-Governors not
to receive any into the Communion of the Church, or
to cast them out again, who do not profess the same
Faith, or will not conform to the Worship and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of the Church. And this is all, that I know of in this
matter; and if men will call this Persecution, it is a
sign, they know not what Persecution means; for the
Primitive Christians, who were indeed persecuted, would
have thought such usage as this, a very easie and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
State.</p>
            <p>So that the difference must lie, if any where, in the
Security of the Government. That no Protestant
Prince or Kingdom, can be secured from the attempts
and Conspiracies of Papists, whose Principles and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
are destructive to Government: and this is the
very true reason of those severe Laws, which were
made in this Kingdom against Popery. And it must
be acknowleged, that there was formerly a vast diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between Papists and Protestants upon this account,
and therefore a sufficient reason for any Prince to make
a difference between them; and I wish, I could say, it
were so still, but I dare not, I cannot say so. To deny
that profest Protestants have ever Rebelled against their
Prince, is to deny, that there ever was a Civil War in
<hi>England,</hi> that there ever was a Protestant Prince Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by his Protestant Subjects with all the mock-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
of Law and Justice; and he must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than the impudence of a Jesuit, that can
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50722:11"/>
deny this. And I would to God, we had but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this, though that was a very bad one; it might
have left some place for hope still, that this was not the
temper nor the Principles of the men, but some unlucky
juncture of Affairs, which transported them beyond the
bounds of their Duty, and their own avowed Principles.
The happy Restauration of our Banisht Prince might in
some measure have expiated their former guilt, and they
might have recovered their innocence, and the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Protestant Loyalty, had they manifested the
sincerity of their repentance by abhorring all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices of Rebellion: but he must be a
bold man indeed, who dares make excuses for those
who prove Rebels a second time; and he must be a bolder
Prince, who will trust them.</p>
            <p>And when every little Creature is so vastly concerned
for Liberty and Property, can we think our Prince
should be the onely unconcerned Person, when the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
and Property of his own Life and Crown is at
stake? Or can any reasonable man expect, that he
should encourage those Religious Factions, which by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
experience he finds troublesom and dangerous to
his Throne? When Religion turns into a State-faction,
to curb and restrain and quell such pretences, is not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
the rights of Conscience, or the liberties of Religion,
but to secure the publick Peace, and to prevent the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassions
of new Rebellions. And no sober Dissenter can
reasonably blame his Prince for this, though he may
blame those, and ought to express a just indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them, who forfeit this liberty by abusing it <hi>for a
Cloak of maliciousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we ever desire to see the peace and prosperity
of our Sion, is it not high time to unite in Religion,
which is the onely thing, that can bless us with a firm
and lasting peace? All our late troubles have been ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50722:12"/>
to the differences of Religion; and while the
cause of dissentions remains, though there may be some
expedients at present found out to palliate the distemper,
yet nothing can remove it. All men seem to be very
sensible of this, and very desirous of an Union; but the
question is, how or in what we shall Unite.</p>
            <p>Shall we unite in Popery? God forbid! the salvation
of our Souls is somewhat dearer to us than temporal
peace, and that we believe to be exposed to infinite ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
in the Communion of so corrupt a Church. A
firm and universal Agreement indeed in any thing, will
secure the publick peace, but we must not make our
Religion so wholly subordinate to temporal ends. If we
can save our Souls, and secure the publick peace toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
such a Religion ought to be chosen upon a double
account; but if both these interests cannot be united, we
must take care to save our Souls, and trust the Providence
of God with our other concernments.</p>
            <p>Shall we then unite with the different Sects and Parties
of Christians, which are among us? This is to unite
without Union. It is to unite indeed <hi>against</hi> something,
but to unite <hi>in</hi> nothing. The several parties of Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who separate from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> differ
as much from each other, as they do from us. They
may unite and combine together in pulling down, but
they can never unite in setting up any thing: they can
unite in Tumults, and publick Disturbances, but they
can never unite in Peace. When they had pulled down
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they could set up nothing in
its room, but a prodigious encrease of Heresies and
Schisms.</p>
            <p>There is nothing then to unite in, but the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> as by Law established, which will both secure
the interests of our Souls and the publick peace. And
why should we not unite in this Church? which is the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50722:12"/>
Glory and the Bulwark of the Reformation, the envy
and the terror of <hi>Rome.</hi> Whose Fathers and first Reformers
were Martyrs against Popery, and who her self has
been a Martyr for Loyalty. Those infinite dangers we
are surrounded with on all hands, methinks should
strongly encline all honest men, impartially to examine
the reasons of their Separation: and I am confident,
not onely what has been formerly written in the Defence
of this Church, but what has been lately offered for
the satisfaction of Dissenters, would open the Eyes of all
sincere men to see their mistakes, if they would but
calmly, without prejudice or passion, read and consider
it. It is demonstrable, we can unite no where else; and
is it a desirable state, to be perpetually strugling and
contending with intestine Commotions? to be hating,
reviling, undermining, each other? For Gods sake, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Christians, let us at last <hi>consider the things which
make for peace, and those things, whereby we may edifie each
other.</hi> And in order to do this, I observe further,</p>
            <p>3. How dangerous a rash boisterous intemperate
Zeal is, though it be for the best things, and against
the worst. Whatever private discontents, revengeful or
ambitious designs, might secretly act some great men,
who know how to practise upon the zeal and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the people; yet nothing is more evident, than
that the first visible occasion of these new Troubles and
Conspiracies, which have endangered the Life of our
King, and the Ruine of his Government, was laid in a
mighty zeal against Popery, and for the preservation
of the Protestant Religion. The Popish Plot was the
first Scene in this new Tragedy. Those bloody designs
raised the fears, the jealousies, the indignation of men;
and a love to their Prince and to their Religion, kindled
and blew up their Zeal into such a violent flame, as
threatned an universal desolation, and became more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50722:13"/>
than the danger it intended to remove. A great
and passionate Zeal, like a distempered love, blinds mens
eyes, and makes them mistake both their Enemies and
their Friends. It fills their head with endless jealousies
and fears, and makes them start and run away from
their own shadow. Such a boisterous Zeal is the Frenzy
and Calenture of Religion, which makes men uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of all sober Counsel, and prudent Resolves, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates
them into the most wild extravagant and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
attempts. There is nothing more pernicious
than Zeal when it gets a head, and bears down all the
considerations of Reason and Religion before it. When
men are conscious to themselves, that they are engaged
in a good Cause, and have honest designs, it makes them
more bold and venturous: for though few men dare
own it, yet the actions of too many sufficiently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
that they think they may strain a point, and
dispense with strict duty, when it is to serve a good
Cause, when the honour of God, and the interest of
Religion is concerned: such a zeal does violently push
men forward, but it does not steer well, nor observe
its Compass; and thus it is too often seen, that men who
begin with a zeal for Religion, insensibly slip into State-Factions,
and are engaged vastly beyond what they first
designed, and engaged so far, that they cannot retreat
with safety or honour, but must either Conquer or be
Conquered.</p>
            <p>Let us then above all things have a care of our Zeal,
that we may not mistake an earthly fire, which burns
and consumes, for that divine and harmless flame,
which is kindled at Gods Altar. A true Zeal for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is nothing more nor less, than such a hearty love for
it, as makes us very diligent in the practise of it our
selves, and contented, if God sees it fit, to lay down
our lives for it, and very industrious to promote the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50722:13"/>
knowledge and practise of Religion in the world by all
lawful and prudent means. A true Christian Zeal will
not suffer us to transgress the strict bounds of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to God, or of our duty to Men, especially to Kings
and Princes, whatever flattering prospect of advantage
it may give. To lie, to forswear our selves, to hate and
revile each other, to Reproach and Libel Governours in
Church and State, to stir up, or countenance with the
least thought, any Plots, Seditions, or Rebellions against
the King, is not a Zeal for God, nor for Religion; for
<hi>this wisdom is not from above, but is earthly, sensual and
devilish: for where strife and contention is, there is confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and every evil work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Let our past experience therefore teach us, to watch
over the least stirrings, and first appearances of a sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
and factious Spirit, either in our selves or others,
however it may be disguised with a pretence of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Faction, like other Vices, has but very small be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings;
but when those beginnings are indulged, it
soon improves and gests strength. <hi>Omne in proecipiti vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium
stetit:</hi> when men once espouse a Party, like those,
who are a running down hill, they cannot stop, when
they please. Discontents and Jealousies are easily fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
when we have once given admission to them;
and the busie Factors and Agents for Sedition, when they
find us never so little disposed and prepared to receive
the impression, use their utmost art and skill, all the
methods of insinuation and address, to make us Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes.
I doubt not but many men have died Rebels, and
suffered as Traitors, who at first did as much abhor the
thoughts of Treason and Rebellion, as any of us can.
Thus I doubt not but it was in our late Troubles, and
thus I believe it is at this day.</p>
            <p>Let such examples as these make us wary, how we
begin to entertain, or to whisper our Discontents and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50722:14"/>
Fears; how we begin to listen to suspicions of our Prince,
or of his Government, and to hear with pleasure, any
scandalous stories or reflexions on either: those who can
with content and pleasure hear their Prince, and his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
reviled, will soon think him not fit to be
their King.</p>
            <p>And the great danger of such beginnings is, that we
are not apt to observe them in our selves or others, when
Religion is concerned in the quarrel. We think it all
Zeal, pure zeal, and cannot suspect our selves or others,
to be in any danger of turning Rebels. But whatever
is in its own nature a degree and tendency towards Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
is so, where ever, and in whomsoever it is found;
and there is always more danger, that the beginnings
of Vice should corrupt the best temper of Mind, than
any hope, that a sound and Religious disposition should
correct the malign influences of such a Vice. Some
mens Religion does as much incline them to Faction, as
secular interest does other men; and there is no such
dangerous Faction, as that which is bred and nourished
by the Corruptions of Religion. The Jewish Zealots,
and the Christian Enthusiasts of all sorts, are too plain
an example of it. And therefore when men, who make
great pretences to Religion begin to talk or act Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
a fair opportunity is as like to make them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
as any other men. Thus we often see it is, and this
is a sufficient reason to suspect all such beginnings, either
in our selves or others, whatever glorious pretences we
may have.</p>
            <p>Let this at last teach us to learn from experience. One
would wonder<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there should be any occasion for
such an Observation as this: for those, who have not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
nor reach enough to foresee the issues and
events of things, yet when they have once seen, what
the events of such actions have been, when they see the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50722:14"/>
same things acted over again, they expect to see the
same effects. Thus indeed it usually is, thus it ought to
be, if men ever intend to grow wise and happy; and yet
our late observations will tell us, that it is not always
thus. For if it had, the same Game would never have
been played over twice, by many of the same men, in
the same Age, and by the same Arts and Methods, and
yet the people deluded, and the world bore in hand, that
they designed nothing less, than to play the same Game
again.</p>
            <p>We saw all the Zeal, and all the Intrigues of 40. and 41.
return again, and yet it was an unpardonable crime for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man to say so, or for any man to look as if he
thought so. The cry against Popery was renewed, but
indeed with a great deal more reason, than they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
had, for we were in eminent danger of Popery; which
is the onely difference between those times and ours: but
then our real fears and dangers of Popery were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abused to Factious designs, and made a property of
to serve some more secret Intrigues. The old cry was
against Popish Bishops, and a Popish Liturgy, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Ceremonies, and in a word, against the Popish
Church of <hi>England;</hi> but one would have thought it
impossible, that ever the Church should at this time
have been charged with Popery, when the Popish Plot
was principally intended against the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and our King as the Supream Governour and Defender
of it; and yet this was done too, and the King and the
Church had like to have been brought into the Plot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
themselves. We heard new stories told of the
growth of Popery and Arbitrary Government, when
thanks be to God, we saw nor felt no such thing. This
was the main subject of those infinite numbers of Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets,
that flew about; the Bishops and Clergy were
sure never to escape, besides those many oblique and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50722:15"/>
scurrilous reflections, which were made upon the King
and his Government: and it is hard to name any step,
which was formerly taken to ruine Church and State,
which these men could possibly take, and did not. And
yet few men would see, whither all this tended, though
no men were thought fit for any publick Trust or
Office, but those who were eminent for their disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Church or State. I hope your eyes are opened
now, to see what all this meant; and methinks it is but
a reasonable request to you, that if ever we should be
so unhappy, as to see these things acted over again, you
would not need being put in mind, what the natural
tendencies and consequents are; which is the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why I mention them now. We had like to have
paid very dear for disbelieving our own eyes and senses,
and former experience; it is certainly a cheaper and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
way to learn by former experiences than by new
ones.</p>
            <p>6. Let us now learn how dangerous a thing it is to
interrupt the ordinary Course and Methods of Justice,
let the pretence be what it will. Justice is the only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and security of Humane Societies; and a stop or a
breach here, is as fatal and dangerous, as a failure in the
foundation, or the main pillars, which support the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
When men are rescued from the hands of Justice,
against the most clear and notorious Evidence, upon a
meer presumption of their innocence, and a good opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them. What security can there be to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
when let men do what they will, if they can
get and maintain a reputation of Zealous Patriots for
their Country and Religion, they are out of the reach
of Justice? Had not the good Providence of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed,
this very thing might have cost our King his
Life and his Crown, and involved this miserable Nation
in a bloody War This Plot might possibly have been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50722:15"/>
discovered sooner, before it was so ripe for execution,
had Justice had its due course; which I think, it becomes
all Persons, who are concerned in it, seriously to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with such guilt and confusion, as it deserves.</p>
            <p>7. I observe, that in times of publick danger, when
we have Enemies on both sides, it concerns us to keep
a watchful eye upon both extreams. It is indeed a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hard thing to do this, but it is impossible we should
be safe without it. While our thoughts are wholly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to secure our selves on one hand, where our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is present and visible, it gives opportunity to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
and unobserved Enemy, to assault us on the other.</p>
            <p>When the Popish Plot was discover'd, all mens mouths
were opened against Popery; we saw no other Enemy, we
feared none, we suspected none; nay, when there was too
much reason for our suspicions, we would believe none;
we thought it impossible, that men, who exprest such an
abhorrence and detestation of the Popish Plot, should be
laying new Plots themselves. And we see now, what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
they made of our security. And now the great
danger is, that the Discovery of this Anti-Popish Plot,
should make men secure of Popery, and think there is no
danger now from that corner. For my part, I am abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
satisfied, that we are in great danger of both,
and in the greater danger of both, because their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
assaults give great advantages to each other. The
Papists now may Father their Plots upon Protestants,
and Protestants upon Papists; and we may be involved
in Blood and Confusion, and neither know our Friends
nor our Enemies. God of his infinite mercy preserve
our King and these Kingdoms, our Liberties, Laws, and
Religion, from the wicked conspiracies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all our Enemies.</p>
            <p>Which is the last thing I shall recommend to you, to
praise God for his preservation of our King hitherto, and
earnestly to beg, that the same good Providence would
still watch over him for the time to come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:50722:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
And certainly if ever we had reason to praise God for
any Deliverance, we have for this, which is such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive
mercy, as extends to all our concernments
of Soul and Body in this world. If we value our
own Lives, our Liberties, and Religion, if we value the
Security of the Government, and the publick peace and
safety, we have reason to bless God for the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our King. Who can without horrour consider,
what a distracted face of things we had seen at this day,
had this Plot taken effect? who knows, who should have
acted his part in that Tragedy? by what Mark or Test,
they would have distinguished Friends from Enemies?
Or what comfort had it been to any Loyal Subject, and
good Christian, to have survived the Murder of his
Prince, and the ruines of Church and State, and to have
been an eye-witness of those barbarous Villanies, which
would have been acted under a Mask of Religion? Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be that God, who giveth deliverance to his King, and
sheweth mercy to his Anointed. Blessed be that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
Being, who sits upon the Circle of the Heavens,
and sees and laughs at, and defeats all the most secret
Plots and Conspiracies of wicked men. Let us bless
God, and let us honour our King, and receive him with
Joy and Thanksgiving as a new Gift and Present from
the hands of God. When we are heartily thankful for
the mercies we have already received, this will make our
prayers more effectual for the continuance of them.</p>
            <p>O Lord save the King, who putteth his trust in
thee: send him help from thy holy place, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
mightily defend him: let his enemies have no
advantage against him, nor the wicked approach to
hurt him. <hi>Which God of his infinite mercy grant, through
our Lord Iesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the
holy Ghost, be honour and glory and power, now and for ever.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
