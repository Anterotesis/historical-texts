         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>FOR THE KING and both HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT: Being a further Relation (in brief) of the Cruel <hi>Havock</hi> and <hi>Spoil,</hi> made on the <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Eſtates</hi> of the People of God in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers;</hi> For Meeting together to Worſhip God in Spirit and Truth.</head>
            <p>ALL which hath been inflicted on them ſince the late Act againſt Conventicles, which tends to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice and ruin of many Families in their outward Eſtates; and many more may be ruined, if a Stop be not put to the Cruelty of Men: For ſeveral of theſe Spoiles have been made upon the Goods of Widdows, Poor, Aged Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Fatherleſs Children, in ſeveral Counties; and many are left ſo deſolate, their very Beds being taken from under them, that they are fain to Lodge upon Straw: And ſome have had their wearing Apparrel taken from them; and many left deſtitute of outward things, having all ſwept away without any Pitty or Mercy: And others have had their Working-Tooles taken from them, wherewith they ſhould have laboured to have got a Maintenance for themſelves and Families: And in ſeveral places no Plea would be accepted on the behalf of the Innocent; ſome ſaying, Right or Wrong they muſt have it; and often times thoſe called Juſtices have bid the Officers take Three or Four times as much as the Fines, that they might allow good Penny-worths: And they have taken the very Kettle (in which Meat was providing for the Family's ſuſtenance) off from the Fire, and have thrown the Meat away into the Street; and have taken away the Children's Apparrel, which they ſhould wear; and have taken the Skillet off the Fire, in which Milk was boiling for the Children, and threw away the Milk.</p>
            <p>All theſe, and many more Cruelties, Barbarous and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Carriages and Actions, may be particularly prov'd, if requir'd; as taking away their very Fewel in the midſt of Winter; and not leaving Bed-Clothes, or other Clothes to keep them warm; but many have been fain to lodge on Straw this Winter.</p>
            <p>Oh the Sad Crys of the poor Children and Families, that have been, by reaſon of the Diſtreſs, that is brought upon them ſince this laſt Act! Many have laboured hard, it may be, moſt of their dayes, and had got a little outward things, whereby their Children and Families were ſupported, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved comfortably; and now all is ſwept away, and they and their Families ruined; and ſome have not ſo much as a Cow left to give their Children Milk: And all this is becauſe for Conſcience ſake they cannot forbear Aſſembling together to Worſhip God, and for no other Cauſe: For it is well known we have alwayes lived peaceably ſince we were a People; and there is no cauſe wherefore we ſhould be thus cruelty dealt withal, but for our keeping a good Conſcience towards God, and towards all men.</p>
            <p>And we expect the Performance of all the Kings Promiſes to us, for <hi>Liberty</hi> to our tender <hi>Conſciences;</hi> for we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes walked peaceably, and have not forfeited our <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in any wiſe: And our Cry hath alwayes been, and is at this day, for LIBERTY of CONSCIENCE, to Worſhip God: And it is becauſe we cannot act againſt the pure Principle of God in our Conſciences, that we have ſuffered ſo deeply ever ſince we were a People.</p>
            <p>And many Perſons of conſiderable Eſtates, and of good Repute in ſeveral Counties, have had their Eſtates given up to the Wills of a company of Mercileſs Informers, and other debauch'd looſe Perſons; who rejoyce that they have power put into their hands to deſtroy ſober people; and have boaſted that they will inrich themſelves thereby. And thus the Innocent are given up to be a Prey into the hands of unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Men; ſome having all their Goods, both within doors, and without, ſeized on, and their Cattle drove away, and their Corn threſht out, and all clean ſwept away, and in a few dayes not any thing left to help themſelves and Families; who before were a Succour and Help to many, and ſet many of their poor Neighbours on Work; &amp; thus many poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are like to be utterly Undone and Ruined in the <hi>Countries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely theſe things cry aloud in the Ears of the Lord, though men ſtop their Ears, and will not hear the Cry of the Oppreſſed.</p>
