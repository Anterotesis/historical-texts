            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epistle to the courteous Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is now sixe yeeres passed (courteous and gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) since importuned by the earnest requestes of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers my especiall friendes, (more presuming on that they conceiued to be in me than of the veritie it selfe, that thereunto might induce me.) I tooke vppon mee in satisfaction of their great importunitie, roughlie to laie out a platforme or Methode, for the inditing and framing of all maner of Epistles and Letters, insomuch as for the confirmation of the necessitie of the worke, &amp; the matter of their demaund, they had then shewed me manie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihoods and reasons, howe much the same might profite, and how well of diuers fortes of people the trauaile might be accepted.</p>
            <p>The worke beeing then superficiallie begun, without additio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either of any regard or industrie to the performance therof (my self hauing grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter desire to learne of others, then to become a speciall eye-marke to be noted of all others) as times and seasons altered, so the fancie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit therof in me quicklie changed, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of other exercises for the present more auailable, made me to forget, what therein I had before time promised, whereby the deuise lay dead, and as matter of noe account was euer
<pb facs="tcp:19624:5"/>
sithence turned in obliuion.</p>
            <p>Neuerthelesse about one moneth afore Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas last, the vacation hauing been long, &amp; little to doe, I ransacking diuers bundels of olde papers, among the rest found out this formost &amp; for worne beginning, and the Printer as then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by, and perusing what it was, told me also his opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the matter, &amp; that he deemed the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile thereof to be more then thanks-worthie, &amp; therewithall assured me would approue verie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, whereupon his desire &amp; perswasion was (as one greatlie affecting the benefite of his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie) that I would proceed on so good a ground, and so roundlie went the progression of our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments forwarde, that it was at length conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; I faithfullie promised, to finish some part thereof to bee published in this instant terme.</p>
            <p>But considering afterwards of the labour, and well perusing what before time I hadde therein done, the order therof so far misliked me, as that I altogether resolued to alter the forme thereby co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, &amp; by such resolution enforced my self to begin anew, by occasion of which, the latter grew greater then before, and I was compelled by my faithfull worde and promise now to finish vp that in hast, which before I coulde not frame my selfe to compasse, vpon long continued ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Manie no doubt shal you find the imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions herein, which aswel my self by ouer-great hast (not hauing so well as I might and would, if leisure had serued me) perfectly perused the same
<pb facs="tcp:19624:6"/>
haue happily omitted by lack of foresight, in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Printer a work, wherby I was (I protest) forced as fast as I could to scrible out the coppy, and to deliuer it to presse, least therby he should be compelled to stay and hinder his worke: as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by like default of ouer speedie dispatch in the Printer, therby misplacing diuers figures quoted in the magent, where they are either mistaken, or sometimes not vsed in those places at all. In oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence whereof I desire the learned Reader, as he shall find to correct, and the other vsers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to beare withal, promising that in the next set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth, the same with better regard shall bee considered, and God sparing life with more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection deliuered, the residue of the faults being not manie are in the page after this placed down and corrected.</p>
            <p>And nowe touching the order of this booke folowing, I must aduertise him that is desirous to take profite thereby, that he first do circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie consider with himself, the seuerall rules in the particuler chapters, preceeding the orders of these EPISTLES, in such sort as afterwardes they are distinguished, and therin see, what to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering and principall direction, of whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he shall take in hand to write, is therfore for his better instruction enioined.</p>
            <p>Next also by diligent animaduersion therof, hee shall the better vnderstande the seuerall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and properties, that in the partes of euerie EPISTLE, are ordinarily to bee required, besides
<pb facs="tcp:19624:6"/>
the vse of them in their seuerall places, and what force they bear, being so sorted out, according to their speciall purposes and directions.</p>
            <p>Next for the better inducement &amp; leading the learner into a plaine &amp; perfect platforme of this METHODE following, and to the intent hee may as neere as may be, or as his capacitie at leastwise may any wayes reach vnto, know skilfullie &amp; not by rote, how or in what sort he shal happen to do either well or ill, I haue first (in a preamble or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed discourse, either proceeding or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably passing, before or with the kindes of the su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of euery EPISTLE) declared the properties &amp; vse of those EPISTLES, vpon what parts and places, they and euery of them do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, with what vehemencie or lesse application they are to be inferred or quallified, so that hee who seemeth to haue lesse knowledge at al (be it that he haue perseuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue or to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the parts he seeth there laid out before his eies) may with great facilitie, and without anie shewe of difficulcie at all, attaine to whatsoeuer, herein prescribed, or by the circumstance therof intended to be in any sort deliuered.</p>
            <p>To the greater ornament whereof, I haue ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed such FIGVRES, SCHEMES, and TROPES in the margent of euerie EPISTLE, euen with the places where they are vsed. And at the finishing vp of this worke, haue determined in the ende therof (which in the next terme shal as a second part hereunto by gods grace be published) to set
<pb facs="tcp:19624:7"/>
them altogeather, and there to explane to the Learners view and for his readier vse, their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular natures and qualities, that they who (being vnlearned, and hauing a pretie conceit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This booke shewing these partes before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, I haue termed by the name of THE ENGLISH SECRETORIE, being in the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof nothing ignorant what great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is to bee required in suche a one, by whose title the same is christened, neither supposing the matter heerein contained to appeare so su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fficient, as perfectly therby to enable what in the same function is to be required, but because the
<pb facs="tcp:19624:7"/>
orderlie writing of Letters, being a principal part belonging to a SECRETORIE, is by the ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THODE heereof deliuered to any Learners capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, whereout the scholler or anie other that is vnfurnished of the knowledge thereof, may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ayde and furtheraunce, the better by suche means thereafter (if his industry serue therunto) to become a SECRETORIE.</p>
            <p>And for so much as this, beeing but the first part thereof, is also the first worke in shew that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer I deliuered, I determined as vntimelie fruite by occasion of the hastie gatheryng of the same, to put it foorth in common tast, the rather to be satisfied what liking it carrieth. The relesse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of beyng of the discrete and skilful sort allowed, to furnish a place in any one corner of their ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet: The other part heerefater shall I trust with better liking return, in the after publishing, &amp; to the followers thereof, ryght pleasing and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>Heerein (ouer and besides the Chapters gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng instruction as aforesaide to the METHODE of these Letters) is only two kinds of EPISTLES wyth their seuerall partes particularly handeled, that is to say, DEMONSTRATIVE &amp; DELIBERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE. The second part shall containe IVDICIAL and FAMILIAR LETTERS, and at the end of the same, the descriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the FIGVRES, SCHEMES and TROPES, as before I haue noted, and lastlie thereunto annexed a Discours of the partes and office of a SECRETORIE, all which Godwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

For the better manifestation of which, &amp; to the intent the ignorant and studious herein, may by degrees be led to the attaining of that which vnto the matter therof may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued most conuenient: I haue first thought good to draw vnto your consideration, certaine speciall points in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other principally to be regarded.<note place="margin">

neyther is it fit that in a letter framed to one of good cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, a man should there in deale with him in speeches: as when he directeth his seruaunt to seethe a peece of saltfish, or dresse a messe of potage, but such shalbe the stile as is the account of the partie to whome it must goe,<note place="margin">

That beeing verilye resolued in my soule, of all that I haue heere sayde vnto you, and hauing ordered mine actions,<note place="margin">Certaine notice and liking of death.</note> and prepared my selfe thereto accordinglye, I doe willingly, and with a right contented mind, leaue this transitory worlde so reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished as it is with so manye greeuous casualties, and hartely do giue my body to his naturall course, &amp; my soule into the hands of the Almighty creator, for euer in his glory (I trust) to be eternized. This speach ended, he continued till after midnight, at which time, he had about two howres slumber, and so beganne his paine to encrease againe. In which till wednesdaye following, almost in one state, he for the most part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, often-tymes accustoming him selfe with those that were about him to prayer, many times recording to him-selfe the goodnesse of God, and his mercies to him remembred, and that with such zeale &amp; enteire regarde of his hoped repose, as that it still seemed and

Insomuch as the vse hereof being so plenty as it is, it falleth out verye seldome in his owne proper nature of an Epistle to bee disposed, but in manye other sortes of Epistles is verye commonlye frequented: For examples sake, if in an epistle Commendatorie we endeuor to commende anye man to fauour, office, or seruice with an other,</hi>

The Prince came to the barre, and at the Iudges handes requyred his seruaunt: who aunsweared that he was the kinge his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers prysoner, and stood there, vpon his triall by law for his offences, and that he coulde not in iustice, nor woulde (by his pardon) permit his deliuerye without his triall.

As for example we may affirme, that not, for that wee deeme him slowe or not prompt inough to such things as wee require, we doe excite such a one to well doing, but as it were calcar, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere currenti: we put forward his readinesse by our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions and entreatie performe the same.

One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I must note, that heerein is no Exordium at all. But the Narration is the foremost induction to the matter of the Epistle, as the learner maye finde out by quotation of the margent. And now will we turne our selues vnto the next sort of this Deliberatiue kind, which falleth out to be Dehortatorie. The nature whereof, is by all forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that maye be induced, to dehort and with-draw from any matter offensiue, or that may be counted euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The places Hortatorie, were as you saw drawn from the qualities of praise, fortified in diuers sortes, as of the Person, of the Action, or of the Thing it selfe, vnder which was comprehended what might be called Honestum. Now these contrary wise, are enforced by the kinde of dispraise, or disco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of that which we dehort from, be it in the Person, Action or Thing, and is deriued from Inhone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum. In the matter hereof, it is tollerable, by all sortes of argumentes that may be, to infer and obiect any thing, to the diminution or defacing of that which we go about to impugne, as for example, if I should dehort a man from rebellion or infidelitie towardes his country. I will tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the action, shew how vnnaturall the cause is he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in hand, being against his natiue soyle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how horrible, by laying out the greatnes of the offence: How vniust, in respect that it is against his alleageaunce to his Prince: How impious, in that it retaineth no piety, turneth to the disturbance of a quiet state, and breedeth the subuersion of all peaceable gouernment. How insufferable, by reason that good and holesome lawes are thereby infringed, all sortes of honest and good men wronged, and consequentlye the common-wealth by such meanes topsie turuie tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>

                  <hi>Touching the Person, if in him there hath bene at any time reputed Wisedome, that might be alleadged, I will affirme it to be Follie, his Fortitude I will diuert to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritie, his Moderation to Crueltie, his Boldnes to Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, his Haughtints to Pride, his Libertie to Loosenes, his Liking to Lewdnes, and finally whatsoeuer other good part or Uirtue in him, to the worse and contrary qualitie, as he that by so bad an endeuour, hath ouerthrown what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise might in him be els deemed praise worthy.</hi>

Further might I proceed in these titles with some other examples, but that the order heereof bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so nerrely annexed to the others following of Swasory and Disswasorie Epistles, it seemeth the very selfe same ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the one, runneth almost both in the Hortato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and Dehortatory kind, into the intendment of the other. True it is, that in all thinges the disposition of either of these Epistles, are for the most part a like, vnlesse it maye be sayd this onelye difference to remaine betweene them, that as the Hortatorie stirreth vp with prickes, the Swaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie teacheth by prooues.

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Propositio.</note> It is long since in deed that you were with me, at which time you were in maner a Childe, neuerthelesse in those tender yeares yet so towardly giuen, and of so milde and gentle disposition, as there was great cause why then I shoulde esteeme of you, and much matter offered to all others that knew ye, wherupon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende you: But now if it be true as I am informed, your actions are tourned quite contrarye, you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a chaungeling, you are no more the same, but an other in qualitie, minde, and operation.

How vnhonest I pray you is the purpose of so great a wronge? How vnfit to be put forwarde in the worst kind of men, how intollerable in a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?

                  <hi>IT apeareth in this Epistle to be Responsorie to an other letter, wherein is to be conceiued, that the writer was perswaded to ioyne in that action, which herein so greatly he disswadeth. Herein the places are more effectuall then in any the other examples, for that in deed the matter of this letter induceth the forme thereof with farre greater circumstances. In this, because the purpose concerneth an attempt to be taken in hand, is laid foorth Difficulcie, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill and Impossibilitie, besides such other places as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the other Epistles you finde also to be applied. And this generally must I note, vnto you that aswel in these as in many others of like kind, the matter disswaded is made so much the more vehement by how much the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof are truely to be dispraised, or absolutely to be condemned, notwithstanding it falleth not out in all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles of this title in such sort to be handled.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:19624:87"/>
For sometimes men are disswaded from a matter, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the little necessitie thereof, &amp; the great vnquiet thereby ensuing, though not in an other sort perchaunce to be misliked, the waight resting peraduenture farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde their reache, and other suppositions, the nomber whereof I leaue in their selfe conceipts to be frequented: knowing the scope heereof to bee so large, and the occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents so infinite, as it were vnpossible to set downe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, conducing to the seuerall imaginations of the same. Much no question auaileth it for anye one that studieth well to write, to bee sufficientlye instructed in these two kindes of Swasorie and Disswasorie, to know the better vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon what groundes the force of each of them may be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, so common are their places in diuers other Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to be induced as in Petitorie, Monitorie, Reprehenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Inuectiue and such others. Let it therefore firmely be aduised for either of these, that whatsoeuer we endeuour to perswade, all the commodities thereunto incident may firste be considered, then by circumstaunces the same are againe to be amplified, againe if therein be anye discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to be supposed, them must we diminishe, or as much as we can refel, which vnder Confirmation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation are contained, and if anye other common reasons besides the meere matter of the thing may be imagined, they shall thereunto be annexed, as some peculiar virtue thereunto encouraging, liking and good opinion, benefite, honor, health<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> comfort<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pleasure, and a thousand others. In disswading likewise, that all the discommodities, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters offensiue, causes of detriment, insufficiencie, hazarde, or whatsoeuer before remembred, be herein collected, put forwarde and amplified, with like annexing of common reasons and inducementes, as in the other is aduised<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the examples hereof, you see to be tendred. And to say sooth, such intermixing of these two so ordinarily hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening in manye letters, as verye few matters do fall out
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:19624:88"/>
in which some one part of them is not somtimes handled: I know not what one thinge almost maye bee so certaine and sound, as by cunning skill may not at the pleasure of the writer in some sort or other be depraued, or out of the consuming flames thereof againe to be commended. For such causes therefore it shall be good that the ordinarye places heereof, for the better perfection of the learner, bee very wel studied and often exercised, which either by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to handle an vnlike matter in a like sort of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, or by often or continuall reading shall greatly bee furthered. And now will we see what in the other sorts of Epistles we haue to be performed, the next of which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing in order, and to be proposed in this Methode, is an Epistle Conciliatorie, whose vse is preferred in acquiring vnto our selues, the acquaintance of some one, whom espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially we make choyce of, or insinuating our selues into their fauours, whom we desire most to esteeme of. These Epistles in their directions, doe oftentimes passe as well from men of good accompt to such as are something their inferiours, as interchaungeably betweene those, who are accompted equals, but seldome or neuer is frequented to such as are our betters. The occasion of this Epistle, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the firste degree, it is likely that he who is much our better either of his honor, worship, or gentlenes, will in plainest termes alwaies deale with his inferiours, whom in such sort he desireth to be known vnto, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise him self would willingly repute of. The sentence of these Epistles are in the best sort to be adiudged, for that the purport of them includeth loue, liking, friendship, the scope whereof induceth matter heerin to be framed. Now touching the second degree, order therein requireth these brief considerations. First that pithily and plainly we set down the cause mouing vs to take knowledge of him we write to, or therevppon to mooue his acquaintaunce.</hi>

For proofe whereof, let it be considered, that if by an Epistle of thys title I should endenour to reconcile a man to his wife, or a woman to her husband, a seruaunt to his maister, or a maister to his seruaunt, the father and the childe, the friend to a friend, the neighbour to neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, or kinsman to kinred: Needes must I for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing thereof shew some reasons how and which waie to induce these, and therefro must I of necessitie ronne into diuers perswasions, in the qualitie wherof, by whatsoeuer action I goe about to transpose, the effectes must needes be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded.

thinges there are which fauourably and with great indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencie, are oftentimes to bee required, and bestowed as councell, aide, patronage, good speeches, naturall care and regard &amp; such other like. Some also and such sembla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble persons, as for whiche, or to whome, to aske or sue, a certaine kind of shame, is in a maner tied, viz. in crauing, borrowing, importuning, charging, or to vehement trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. The stile and order &amp; deliuerie appertaining to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these is greatly different. Touching the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of both, to either of them it is requisite that in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium, an endeuor be vsed wherby to adhibite vnto vs the good will, fauor, or good liking of him to whom we write. Next that therein we proceede accordyng to our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the party, his estate credit, or support where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to pleasure vs. Thirdly that the cause we take vpon vs to preferre, be iust, lawfull, and honest. Fourthly that it be in his habilitie, or power, to councell, ayde, protect, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre or relieue vs. Fifthly, the order or meanes whereby the same may be wrought and accomplished. Sixtly, our gratitude and remuneration, worthily tied to the thankeful acknowledgement or requitall of the same. In the first sorte of these, the cause standing fauorable, or indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, wee may the more bolder endeuour to produce or lay foorth the aptnesse or beseeming thereof. In the second: greater modestie, and a more shamefast deliueraunce is to be reteined, the preferring whereof would best be by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuation the better by couert meanes to wade into the depth of our Petition. In this place a more then ordinarie bathfulnesse to be admitted, which giueth no small furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to euery demand, as audacious and wanscot, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency on the other side returneth the greatest impediment in any thing to be obteined. For no man willingly would do benefit to such a one, which in maner goeth about as of dutie and not of courtesie to exact the same, and rather as a commaunder then crauer, would impudently thrust him
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:19624:95"/>
selfe to the obteining therof. And because the whol course heereof obserued by way of euery Petition, is by inference of many circumstances to bee altogether determined, the order as I haue related vnto you before, must be conueied by places Swasorie, resting very often in confirmation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honesty, goodnes, lawfulnes, &amp; needfulnes of our petition. And if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Exordium be happily framed of his person to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we direct our letters, it shal not be amisse that therein we briefly doe capitulate some part of his vertues, courtesies, humanity, bounty, readines to comfort, pleasure, or dorelief vnto any, wherby we may priuatly draw his fauor &amp; good acceptance vnto vs, besides if he haue made vs before time beholding vnto him, we shal gladly acknowledge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, and declare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> being already indebted, we study more ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to yoke our selues vnto him.

If of the the person of our aduersary against whom we demand any assistance, fauor, protection, or remedie, we may inferre (if any such be) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> common mislike of both of vs towards him, &amp; how ill he hath deserued at eythers hands, and therupon require aid against him.

                  <hi>MUch more might be handled in this kind, the method whereof is one of the moste ordinarye of any sortes of Letters that are invited, for that the greatest number of directions are commonly concluded in this matter, the requestes whereof doc either specially concerne the wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or are otherwise to be respected in the behalfe of some other. The occasion of which hath caried herein the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of so many examples, that by manifesting the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their orders and vses, the learner might not want wherein to be directed, and choyce of varietie wherwith to be delighted. Now besides these hereby already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, ther are letters also might besuted vnder this form, which from noble men or others, are many times written in fauour of sondry persons, containing requestes in their behalfes to be perfourmed, which notwithstanding the difference of estates, in that the same doe for the most part passe vnto their inferiours, yet seemeth the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be Petitorie, but in a different order of these to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togeather pursued. Insomuch as neither agreeth it, to vse lyke circumstaunces of humilitie and entreatie, nor of pleasures or courtesie, as in the other are required: but rather a necessarie supposall and assuraunce of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundes to be hearkned vnto, in respect that of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, reputations, or credites, it is intended they will require nothing, but what with reasonable tolleration may be liked of. But in truth Hold the vse of such kind of directions in choice of both, rather pertinent vnto the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Commendatorie, for that whatsoeuer is therein writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19624:102"/>
in fauour either of the person or of the cause, maye in respect of the honor or reputation from whom they come, be better deemed in sort of a courteous demaunde, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the regard of the partie or thing spoken of, then by the submissiue title of a matter craued, or by any order of humilitie otherwise to be sought for, for these causes I haue thought meet therefore to adioyne immediatly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, the same Epistles Commendatorie,<note place="margin">Epistles commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie.</note> being so nearelye affined with those of Petitorie as they are. To these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles belongeth diligent animaduersion, that (for asmuch as in them the parts both Demonstratiue and Deliberatiue are vsed, as well in describing and perswading what in the person or action is either to be liked or commended) we continue not ouer much vppon either of the twaine, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially writing to such a one, who being so farre before vs, our selues may also seeme in some sort to depend vpon, but with such breuitie to carrie the force thereof, as it maye thoroughly appeare the waight of our speeches, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stand as a testimonie of that we know or conceiue, then a disputation of a matter or thing like to be. The places appertaining vnto the kindes heereof, are altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as in the Petitorie are already declared, chieflye when the same, intendeth to a cause by writing preferred to be fauoured. But if the Epistle do concerne the person of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye one to be respected, we muste beware that in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible deliuerie of whatsoeuer occasion tendinge to his praise of matter of preferment, we doe the same either by warrant of our owne knowledge, or by such certaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of others, whose assured opinion can not bee misled in concluding the action. And otherwise, if neither of these do in truth fall out to be certified, then shal we shew what informacion we haue besides our owne conceipt, or perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture no other assurance at all but our owne simple li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. Peticions also are frequented in requiring fauour to these causes, wherein standeth in biest regard the state,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19624:103"/>
countenaunce or authority of him, from whom the letter is framed, who accordingly therunto may desire, that the rather at his request, or vpon his sute, or for his sake, or in regard of his liking, the person maye be accompted of, or the action furthered. Besides it may be added to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of a more speedy perfourmance, the loue (if any be, or occasion thereunto sorting) we owe to him we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, or in whose fauor we write, either solie for himself, or conuaied from his friendes, his parentes, the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his charge of wife, children, or seruants, the wrong offered, benefit to be attained, or whatsoeuer other matter to be deemed requisite or conuenient. Now from whence or out of what instigations, the matter of such commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation is to be drawne, you haue in the generall chapters of this booke already at large.

This R.L. whom your L. termeth to be a very poore man, is not (as in simple shew he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth himself apparantly to be) but is rather such a one, as from whom (being narrowely sifted) your L. might sooner draw a hundred pound of his money, then half an inche bredth of his honestie. The argument wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in nothing so much appeareth as in this one action, wherein against a poore man in deed, he hath verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuriously behaued himselfe, and hauing extorded from him this bonde nowe in sute (vppon some conclusion, though no good consideration at all) of the somme of one hundreth pounde, goeth about vpon a nice quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let in the condicion, to prosecute the forfeyture of the same, which in deede, by the district wordes of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, seemeth vtterly to be forfeyted.

And forasmuch as sithence your L.

Take no care for your kitchen, buttrie, or larder, for once a day he loues to see all cleane before him, Little apparell will serue him, for his liueries ensue weekely, out of the brewers mesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fat.

When you haue moste neede of him, you shall alwaies be sure to goe without him: if you delight in a pigs-nie, you may by receiuing of him, become sure of a hogshead. Great store of small liking you happely may haue to him, we know not what wonders the worlde may rend out, for nothing is impossible where al thinges may be compassed. It may please you for recreations sake to looke vpon him so you bee not in case to surfet, looke what ill liking you conceiue, report backe again I pray you in the inner facing of his chimney casket, Omnia sua secum portat he is somewhat a foolosopher, for he carries his possessions about him, for terram dedit filijs hominum, he must needes then haue a large dwelling.

Others againe so rise and abundant in teares, as the least shew of repetition in them, induceth matter enough of continuall mourning, for which cause, we will sort these matters of comfort into three seuerall orders. The first wherof shall

be at choyce, playnely and simplye as occasion serueth to be deliuered, in the argument whereof, we may by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie perswade, that beeing mortall and fraile as wee are, there is no cause for vs in heauie sort to greeue, seing vnto a wise man no one thing can returne cause of disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, but the shrowde of filthinesse, and darkened shame, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he be hurt of anye one without him-selfe. These (the more sensible they are with whome wee deale and of greater capacity) the more vehemently may we inforce by all sortes of forcible examples and assured promises. The second of these must by insinuation bee entered into, as suppozing a personage of a hie and statelie minde, the weightines of whose griefe suppressed by a kinde of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquered fortitude, we would go about to comfort. We may not with these deale, as in case of common sorrow of the others, but rather insinuating a deniall, that respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inuincible valure we knowe to be resting in their mindes, shonning to bee tainted with the least touche of sweltring griefe, wee doe offer our speeches or letters to comfort them, whose heartes we knowe cannot yeelde to any force thereof at all: but that, considering the great validity of their wisedome, a minde in them so vnconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any stormes of fortune, to be remaining, (not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing wee see daily in others before our eies, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie and imminent cause therunto, must of force confesse to be inducing) they neuerthelesse, by a most hie and state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instincte, by great skil and approoued experienee graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed within them, are and must be enabled stoutly to bear, what others, as weakelinges doe lie groueling vnder, by reason wherof, we find greter cause to reioyce in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines of so goodly a minde, then occasion and waies to go about to relicue their sorrowes. The thirde and last like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise must in an other sort be conuaied, as finding the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate and perplexed conceipts of some, yet fresh bleeding vpon the heauie wound of their sorrowes, we may not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly

                  <hi>LOng haue I continued the argument of these exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the more plentifully therein to shewe forth what varietie of matter may be induced, wherewith to procure occasions of comfort. The chiefest whereof are by extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or lessening the force of whatsoeuer accident, seming to aggrauate the weight of such sorrow or conceiued mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of griefe.

It is to bee intended that ouer and besides the places heereby opposed, the forces are also deliuered in causes of bannishment, in losse of children, parents, goods or frends, in times of imprisonment, slander, persecution, sicknesse, in miserable olde age, plagued by disobedience in all successe of marriages, in pouertie, and finally in whatsoeuer griefe

of mine trouble or aduersitie. In eche of all which is vsed a great efficacie of perswasion for the mittigation of all these, as by laying the troubles and vncertayn state of the world, with innumerable euilles annexed to the turninge wheele thereof, that the mischiefe cast vpon our neckes is not to vs alone, but common to all, who though not wyth the selfe same, yet in some sorte or other are alike disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, that the best way to expell the griefe thereof, is by meditation of our estates, the condition wherin wee liue, the ineuitable force of that which is befallen vs, whiche because we are worlolinges must needes in like sorte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side vs, how neere thereby we may be drawn in contempt of earthly vanities, the inticing baites, whereof are enue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomed with so many and sharp poysons, that troubles are sent vnto vs from God, to call vs thereby home vnto him, that they are the scourges of oure disobedience, that by such meanes we are discerned to be his children, that by patient sufferaunce, and entertainment of our harmes, we doe neerest approche vnto him, whiche beeing in humayne shape on earth, conuersing with men, was persecuted, slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, tooke vpon him the most despised estate of pouertie, and by cruell deathe was constrained, that they who are cloyed with most aboundance, haue therefore the greater charge layd vpon their neckes, and that no one then they are neerest to destruction, the height of whose estate, often times occasioneth theyr vntimely deathes, finallye that it were bootelesse to striue against their forces, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by seeme ignoraunt of Gods pleasure and ordinaunce, who working all things vnto the best, knoweth perchance that punishment to be most fittest for vs, wherewith if we were not entangled, we might happily forget him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come carelesse regarders of hys hie and mightie excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

But trust me, if in manye thinges I haue beene faultie vnto the worlde, vnto your good selfe I haue no waies erred, vnlesse in louing too much <hi>I</hi> haue beene offensiue to your fauor, and for that I long since craued pardon. Sithence which time, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint what I haue suffered, I haue studied so much as in me, to with-drawe and forbidde whatsoeuer might sound to the breach of your least deniall. And albeit my thoughts being free, by a curious desire and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence borne to your worthines, yoked my inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptes to the search of whatsoeuer pleasing and most affecting to the scope thereof, by reason of which, and by an inuincible determination thereunto, I had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the some of all my blisse, and ensuing happines, in the forward vse and practise of the same: yet soundeth it to very slender approbation, that in your selfe being beloued, there should so much coynes and little cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie be approoued. I do not suppose it to be vniust, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

great a scourge in these fruitles affections, <hi>I</hi> could with as little reason make challenge to your fauour, as you with small courtesie haue giuen me a sop of such sauor. But haply it falleth out as proper to your sexe, that till you know your selues to be certenly beloued, you haue curtesie at co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, &amp; liking at pleasure: &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good will is once offered, you by and by waxe coye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same is profered. Trust me, if <hi>I</hi> had thought that thinges had therefore beene of lesse price, because they are willingly bestowed, the market shoulde haue beene enhaunst before <hi>I</hi> would haue bowed. But see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is so farre difference between vs, as that your pleasure is turned to my pennaunce, and your nicenes to my annoyaunce, with as much losse as by restraint resteth hetherto vnrewarded, I will master my liking, til with more vsury I may be repaied in causes of loue. Neuertheles not so farre estranged from you, but that in anye cause of courtesie, <hi>I</hi> will not forget you are a Gentlewoman, and therefore yet be content (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore time) in such sort to respect you, whereof had it not beene your contrary pleasure, you needed not as you haue done to make any exception. Not meaning heereafter to trouble your remembraunce with anie more of my speaches, otherwise then beseemeth a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar acquaintaunce, I hereon doe conclude my laste determination and farewell.</p>
