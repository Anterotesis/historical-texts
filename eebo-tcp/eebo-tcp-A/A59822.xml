            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Author calls himself a Presbyter of
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and by what I
have heard, I fear it is too true: I pray
God preserve the Church from such
Presbyters, who Eat her Bread, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
her Faith.</p>
               <p>His pretence for Writing this Pamphlet,
is, The Controversy between Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th</hi> and Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the <hi>B. Trinity.</hi> I will say nothing of that matter, let
the Animadverter Answer it to God and his own Conscience;


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62123:4"/>
This Author has said enough about it, and I wish he had
but used the same Candour throughout, and then there
would have been no need of this Answer, but tho' it seems
he was <hi>Disinterested</hi> as to the contending Doctors, he was
deeply <hi>Interested</hi> as to the Cause of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> to which
he promised no small Advantage from this Dispute.</p>
               <p>And indeed it is too evident, what advantage our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian</hi>
Adversaries have made, and hope still to make of
this Controversy. This has occasioned that scandalous
Distinction between <hi>Real and Nominal Trinitarians;</hi> which
is such an open abuse upon the <hi>Nominalists,</hi> that were I one of
those whom he Reproaches with that Title, I could not bear
it: For the plain <hi>English</hi> of it is no more but this; those
who believe a Trinity, and those who believe no Trinity;
for <hi>Nominal Trinitarians,</hi> as opposed to <hi>Real Trinitarians,</hi>
can signifie nothing more. And could this Author, and his
Friends, persuade the World, That the greatest part of our
Clergy, nay, the Church of <hi>England</hi> it self, as he pretends, are
but <hi>Nominal Trinitarians,</hi> their Work were done; for a
<hi>Socinian</hi> is a much more honourable Name; and when Men
agree in the Faith, it is a vain thing to dispute about Words;
And therefore this Author is equally zealous to oppose the
Realists, that is, to overthrow the Doctrine of a Real Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and to persuade the Nominalists, that tho' they differ
in some peculiar forms of Speech, yet there is no reason
they should Quarrel, for their Faith is the same: And this
I thought a sufficient Reason to judge over again, <hi>the
Iudgment of this Disinterested Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I shall pass over the Account he gives of the History
of this Dispute, only observing, that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> did not
begin it; He wrote against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> without suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he should meet with such furious and bitter As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults
from another Quarter, and yet after such great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations
as might move a very tame man, he has made
no return, which unbecomes a true Christian Spirit in such
Cases.</p>

But there is one thing wherein this Author has done the
Dean right, by acquainting the world, That he has not
been the first Broacher of this Heresy (as they call it) <hi>of
Three Distinct Infinite Minds and Spirits in the Vnity of the
Godhead.</hi> He reckons up several others of the same mind,
some who appeared before, and some since <hi>his Vindication,</hi>
as Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> the late Archbishop <hi>Tillotson,</hi>
the present Bishop of <hi>Glocester,</hi> Mr. <hi>How,</hi> Mr. <hi>I. B.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Bingham.</hi> And I could tell him of many more, as
many as do sincerely believe, That God is a Father, and
has a True, Real, Subsisting Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>But yet he himself is sensible, and his <hi>Socinian</hi> Friends,
or rather he himself, in some former Pamphlets, has ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
very material differences between the Dean's Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,
and some of these Learned Men: He neither owns
the <hi>Platonick</hi> Inequality of Dr. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> nor the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellian</hi>
Composition and Union of others, but asserts
Three Real, Distinct, Coequal, Coeternal Persons; not in
one singular and solitary, but in <hi>one numerical Nature and
Essence.</hi> But I believe the Dean will heartily thank him
for giving him the late Archbishop and Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> two such
Names as will command Reverence, and shelter him from
the Imputation either of Novelty or Heresy, at least as to
this Point: And it is worth observing, from the example
of these two great Men, at what rate some Persons judge
of Men and Doctrines. The good Archbishop, by his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitarian</hi>
Adversaries, is charged with <hi>Socinianism,</hi> and by
his <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries with <hi>Tritheism;</hi> and yet he must
have very ill luck, if he could stumble upon two such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes.</p>
               <p>As for Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> his Learned and Elaborate Defence of
the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, was printed at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and received with
Universal Applause, as it highly deserved: None of them
to this day have charged him with the least Heresy, and I
believe will not yet venture to do it. And yet, as this


<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62123:5"/>
Writer confesses, and as every unprejudiced Reader must
own, the Doctrine of the Defence as to this Point, is the
very same with the Dean's Hypothesis, which these very
Persons have condemned <hi>as Impious and Heretical.</hi> So true
is it, <hi>Duo cÃ¹m faciunt idem, non est idem.</hi> All that this
<hi>Socinian</hi> intended by bringing Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> into the Fray, was
to follow the Blow which the Animadverter and the <hi>Oxford</hi>
Decree had given <hi>to a Trinity of distinct, proper, subsisting,
living, intelligent Persons,</hi> (which is all that Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> or the
Dean assert) by their Charge of <hi>Tritheism;</hi> which he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
would be a sufficient Answer to that otherwise unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable
Book, and together with Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> would confute
all the Fathers at once, on whose Authority he so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and to whom he perpetually appeals; for no Christian
must hearken to those men, whatever their Authority be,
did they really (as they are unjustly charged) preach Three
Gods; and thus he thinks he has got rid of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and of <hi>the Tritheistick Trinity</hi> with it. But still this
makes well for the Dean, who will be contended to stand
and fall with the Catholick Fathers, and will never desire
to be thought more Orthodox than they.</p>
               <p>That Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> asserts a Real, Substantial Trinity, in as
high and express Terms as ever the Dean did, is so plain
throughout his Book, that it is needless to prove it. All
his Arguments suppose this Hypothesis, and are unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible
without it; and therefore I shall take notice but of
one or two particular Passages, whereon, as we

and in, and after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, was used
by the Catholick Fathers for Subsistence, or
a particular thing which subsists by it self,
which, in intelligent Beings, is the same with

of the Son against those who denied him to be a distinct
Person from the Father, affirms him to be <hi>Substantiam &amp;

having by many irrefragable Instances proved this use of
the word to be very Catholick, he adds, That probably
this word <hi>Hypostasis</hi> would still have been used in this
sense, had not the <hi>Arians</hi> abused it to countenance their
Heresy, expounding it to a more general Notion of Essence,
Nature and Substance, and teaching, as the Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
did, That the Father and Son were two <hi>Hypostases;</hi>

In another place, speaking of some Modern Divines,
who allow the Son to be of the Father,
considered as a Son,<note place="margin">Addo ego, Personam hic sine essentia concipi non posse, nisi statueris Personam in Divinis nihil aliud esse, quÃ m merum <gap reason="foreign">

that he receives his Person, but not his
Essence or Divine Nature of the Father;
he observes that we cannot conceive the
Person without the Essence, unless by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the Divinity, we mean no more than the meer
mode of subsistence, which is plain <hi>Sabellianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that this Writer has done Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> a greater kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
than he was aware of, and as it will quickly appear,
has lost his own Cause by it; if Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> have truly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the sense of the Fathers, as all learned and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
men must own he has: For here are such a Cloud
of Witnesses to the Doctrine of a Real, Substantial, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
Trinity, as no later Authorities, whatever they are,
can stand against.</p>
               <p>What I have now quoted, is only what first came to
hand, but there is hardly any thing in the whole Book,
but what by immediate and necessary consequence, proves
the real dictinction of proper, subsisting Persons in the
Trinity; that each Person is by himself in his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Person, as distinguisht from the other Two, Infinite
Mind, Substance, Life, Wisdom, Power, and whatever
is contained in the Notion and Idea of God. Instead of
particular Quotations for the proof of this, I shall only
Appeal to the Titles of the several Sections of that learned
Work, which I believe no man can make common sense
of, without acknowledging a Trinity of proper, substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
subsisting Persons.</p>
               <p>The First Section concerns the Preexistence of the Son
of God, That he, who afterwards was called <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
did subsist before his Incarnation, or Nativity, according
to the Flesh of the Blessed Virgin, in another and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62123:7"/>
Nature than that of Man; That he appeared to
the Holy Men under the Old Testament, as a kind of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of his-Incarnation; That he always presided
over, and took care of his Church, which he was to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem
with his own Blood; That he was present with God
his Father before the foundation of the World, and that
by him all things were made. This is the Faith of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and this he proves to be the constant Doctrine of
all the Catholick Fathers for the first three hundred years,
and so it continued to After-ages: Now let any man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider,
what a pretty kind of dispute this is, about the
Preexistence of the Son, if he have no proper permanent
Existence of his own, but considered as a Divine Person,
is only another Name for the Father, or <hi>an immanent Act,</hi>
like the transient Thought, or transient Act of Reason in
Man. For if the Son be not a distinct Person from the
Father, and as proper a subsisting Person as the Father
himself is, the Question will amount to no more but this,
Whether God the Father had a Being before <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
was Born of the Virgin, or before the World was made?
Or, Whether he had <hi>any immanent Acts of Wisdom or Reason,</hi>
before he made the World? Or, Whether he took the
Name of Son upon himself, before he made the World,
or made any Creature to know him or his Name. The
Christian Fathers were Wiser men than to talk at this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent
rate; and therefore they did believe, that God
had a Son in a true and proper Sense; a subsisting, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
omnipotent Son, by whom he made the World;
who appeared in his own proper Person to several of the
Patriarchs under the Old Testament; and in the fulness
of time, was Incarnate of the substance of the Virgin
<hi>Mary.</hi> The very Question it self necessarily supposes this
to make Sense of it; much more impossible is it to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
what the Fathers say upon this Argument, upon the
<hi>Sabellian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> Hypothesis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:62123:7"/>
The Second Section concerns the Consubstantiality of
the Son with the Father; That the Son of God is not
of a created or mutable Essence, but perfectly of the same
Divine unchangeable Nature with his Father, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is True God of True God. Now, What Sense can
be made of this, if the Son be not as truly and properly
Substance in his own Person, as distinguished from the
Person of the Father, as the Father is in his own Person?
For, How can the Son be Consubstantial, or of the same
Substance with the Father, if he be no Substance at all?
Especially since this Learned man has proved, That the
Catholick Fathers rejected the <hi>Homoousion</hi> in the <hi>Sabellian</hi>
Sense, for one singular Substance of Father and Son, and
that they assert, as common Sense would teach us, that
nothing is Consubstantial to it self, but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, one
thing is Consubstantial to another.</p>
               <p>The Third Section concerns the Co-eternal Existence
of the Son with the Father: Now for Father and Son to
Coexist, necessarily supposes, that they both Exist, and
actually subsist by themselves; for two cannot Exist and
Subsist together, unless each of them actually subsist; For
as the Fathers observe, nothing can properly be said to
Coexist with it self: For it can admit of no Question,
Whether any one has been, as long as he has been: And
therefore, since the Co-eternity of the Son has been a
very serious Dispute between the Catholicks and the Arians,
it is certain, that both of them owned Father and Son to
be two distinct Persons, which did distinctly Exist and
Subsist.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Section teaches the Subordination of the Son
to the Father; that tho' the Son be Co-equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as having the same Divine Nature with the Father,


<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62123:8"/>
without any change or diminution; yet he is Subordinate
to the Father, as receiving the Divine Nature from him:
That the Father is God of himself; the Son, God of God.
Now if the Son receive the Divine Nature by an eternal
Communication from the Father, he must have it in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
in his own Person, and be a living, subsisting Son,
true God of God; and if he be a true proper Person, and
subordinate to the Father, he must be a distinct Person,
for no Person can be subordinate to himself. These
Questions Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> has discoursed at large, with great va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Learning, and acuracy of Judgment; and it is a
Mystery to me, how those, who pretend to admire Dr.
<hi>Bull,</hi> should quarrel with Dr. <hi>Sherlock;</hi> or that those who
pay any reverence to the Catholick Fathers, should quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
with either of them. This <hi>Socinian,</hi> as I observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
was glad to draw Dr. <hi>Bull</hi> into the number of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists,</hi>
but by that means he has drawn in all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Fathers too, and has now drawn together so many
<hi>Tritheists,</hi> as he will never know how to get rid of again:
or to speak more properly, he has unanswerably Confuted
the Charge of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and discovered the Trick and
Mystery of it, by charging the Catholick Faith it self,
and all the Catholick Fathers, the most zealous Patrons
and Advocates of it, with <hi>Tritheism.</hi>

               <p>THE very Name of <hi>Socinianism</hi> is justly abhorred by

humane Nature, all those great Assurances, which the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
gives us, of God's love to Sinners, in giving his own
Eternal Son for us, of the Expiation of our Sins by the
Blood of the Son of God, a price of inestimable value, and
of all the Blessings which we expect, both in this world
and in the next, from the powerful intercession of a Beloved
Son, and a meritorious High-Priest; I say, all these strong
Consolations dwindle into no more, than the Word and
Promise of a great and extraordinary Prophet, the Death
of a Martyr, and the Intercession of a Beloved Creature,
and humble Supplicant, who has no inherent Power and
Authority to save us. Our Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> are very sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
what an invincible prejudice this is; for few serious
Christians will be willing to part with their hopes of Heaven,
or to part with greater, infinitely greater hopes for less, or
to think so meanly of their Saviour, who is the object of
their Faith and Worship, as to thrust him down into the
rank and number of meer Creatures. This the Catholick
Church would never endure in the <hi>Arians,</hi> who yet attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
a most excellent Nature and Glory to Christ, next to
God himself, superior to the highest Orders of Angels, as
being before the World it self, and the Maker of it, but yet
not true and perfect God, as not having the same Nature
with his Father, nor Eternally begotten by him; much less
would they ever endure the thoughts of the <hi>Photinian</hi> or
<hi>Samosatenian</hi> Heresy, that is, of <hi>Socinianism,</hi> which makes
Christ but a meer man, who had no Being before he was
Born of his Virgin Mother.</p>
               <p>This, I say, being so invincible a prejudice against them,
they have of late tried new Arts, and have taken advantage
of some very unhappy Disputes, to impose upon unwary men,
and to appear abroad with new Confidence under a less
frightful Disguise.</p>
               <p>The late Controversy about Three infinite Minds and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62123:9"/>
in the Trinity, has given them the advantage of distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
between <hi>Real and Nominal Trinitarians,</hi> or such
<hi>Trinitarians</hi> as believe a Trinity of Real subsisting Persons;
and those who believe only one Real Person, who is God,
with a Trinity of Names, or Offices, or immanent Acts
and Powers. <hi>The Realists,</hi> they call <hi>Trithiests,</hi> or such
Hereticks, as assert Three Gods. <hi>The Nominals,</hi> they think
very <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and the <hi>Church;</hi> and tho' the <hi>Nominals</hi>
and <hi>Socinians</hi> differ in some forms of Speech, yet they say,
and I think very truly, that there is no considerable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in their Faith, as they state it, and seem well enough
inclined to exchange that odious name of <hi>Socinians,</hi> for the
more plausible and popular name of <hi>Nominal Trinitarians.</hi>
And thus they can Dispute as heartily as ever, and with
more safety and honour, against the Faith of the Trinity, so
they do but call it a <hi>Real Trinity;</hi> and may dispute for
<hi>Socinianism</hi> as earnestly as ever, so they do but call it a
<hi>Nominal Trinity.</hi>

               <p>That this is the whole Artifice of this present Pamphlet, any
one who reads it, may see with half an eye; and I hope
some men, if ever they can grow cool, will consider a little
better of it: I do not so much intend gravely to Dispute
with this Author, as to wash off his Paint, and bring the
Controversy back again to its right Owners, those truly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Parties of <hi>Trinitarians, Sabellians and Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That those whom he calls the <hi>Real Trinitarians,</hi> are the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men who believe a Christian Trinity, and that <hi>the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Trinitarians</hi> do not believe a Trinity, is evident in their
very Names; for a Trinity, which is the object of our Faith
and Worship, is certainly a <hi>Real Trinity,</hi> if it be at all; and
one would think, that a Trinity, which is not a Real Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
should be no Trinity at all: The Zeal which the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
express against a Real Trinity, is a good Argument,


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62123:9"/>
That that is the true Christian Trinity which they and their
Predecessors have always rejected in contradiction to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Faith; and the great fondness they express for a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Trinity, is as good a proof, that it is no Trinity at all.
Such a Trinity as is reconcileable with <hi>Socinianism,</hi> as all these
men own a Nominal Trinity to be, can never be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith, unless <hi>Socinianism</hi> be Christianity: Which I hope,
those men, whom this and some other late Writers call No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
Trinitarians, will not yet own; and yet if <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nism</hi>
be a Contradiction to the Christian Faith, that must
be the true Catholick Faith of the Trinity, which most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
contradicts <hi>Socinianism</hi> in the parting Points, and that
none but a Real Trinity does: So that it is in vain for them
to hope to conceal themselves under some insignificant
Names; let them deal fairly with the world, and Dispute
professedly against a Trinity; for a Real Trinity is neither
better nor worse than a Trinity; and then let them produce
their Authorities and Reasons to prove, that the Catholick
Church, even the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council it self, never believed a
Trinity, and that the Faith of a Trinity is <hi>Tritheism:</hi> This
becomes men of candour and honesty, let their Opinions be
what they will; but to sneak and sculk like men who have
a mind to steal a Cause, and are as much ashamed to appear
in open light, as such kind of Traders use to be, is mean and
pilfering, and unworthy of their Ancestors, who own'd
themselves at Noon-day, and bravely outfaced all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the Catholick Church, and all the Reason of
Mankind.</p>
               <p>That this is the truth of the Case, and that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
look upon this distinction as no more than a jest, is
evident from that account this Writer gives of the Doctrine
of the <hi>Realists</hi> and <hi>Nominalists</hi> concerning the Trinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>As to the Explication,<note place="margin">The judgment of a disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested person. p. 12.</note> the Party called <hi>Realists</hi> say,
The Holy Trinity, or the Three Divine Persons, are
Three distinct infinite Substances, Three Minds, Three


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62123:10"/>
Spirits; they are Three such Persons; that is, as distinct,
and as really subsisting and living, as three Angels, or three
Men are. Each Person has his own peculiar individual
Substance, his own personal and proper Understanding,
Will and Power of Action; an Omnipotence, Omniscience,
and all other Divine Attributes, divers in number from the
personal Omnipotence, Omniscience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the other two
Persons. In the Creation, as also in the Government of the
world, they are to be considered as distinct Agents, not as
one Creator, or one Governor; but only in this sense, that the
Father acts by the Son through the Spirit: of which the
meaning is, that the Father, in regard of his Paternal Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
acteth not immediately, but by the Son and Spirit.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Account, as far as it concerns the real Subsistence
of Three distinct infinite Persons in the Unity of the God-head,
does contain the true Catholick Faith of the Trinity;
and yet he has both imperfectly and falsly represented the
Opinion of the <hi>Realists.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. He tells us, <hi>They say that the Holy Trinity, or the Three
Divine Persons, are Three distinct infinite Substances, Three
Minds, Three Spirits.</hi> Now any one would hence conclude,
That this is the Universal Doctrine of all the <hi>Realists,</hi> and
that this Phrase of <hi>Three Substances, Minds, and Spirits,</hi> is the
Parting point between the <hi>Realists</hi> and <hi>Nominals:</hi> That
all who believe a Real Trinity, own Three Infinite Minds and
Spirits; and that no man can believe a Real Trinity, who
does not own this. Now this is manifestly <hi>false,</hi> as our late
Experience proves. The greatest number of <hi>Realists</hi>
(as far as I can guess) who believe a Real Trinity, a
Real subsisting Father, a Real subsisting Son, and a Real
Subsisting Holy Spirit, do yet reject those Expressions of
<hi>Three Infinite Minds and Spirits,</hi> which are liable to a very
Heretical Sense, either <hi>Arianism,</hi> or <hi>Tritheism;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
were very sparingly, and with great Caution used by
the Catholick Fathers, tho' they used <hi>Three Hypostases</hi> in


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62123:10"/>
the very same Sense, and did not condemn Three Natures
and Substances when <hi>personally</hi> used, as we have seen
above. And therefore the late Dispute about <hi>Three Minds,</hi>
does not in it self divide the contending Parties into <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
and <hi>Nominals,</hi> as the <hi>Socinians</hi> too hastily conclude,
and think to carry their Cause by it. Very good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
may dispute such expressions, as we know they did the
<hi>Homoousion</hi> it self; for <hi>One Substance</hi> is as liable to an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Sense, as <hi>Three Substances:</hi> for that may be <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianism,</hi>
and the other may be <hi>Arianism</hi> or <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and
both of them rightly understood may be very Orthodox;
but whether they are or no, must be judged by the Sense in
which they are used; and the Catholick Fathers, like good
Christians, have easily yielded to each other in a dispute of
words, when it has appeared that the difference has been
only in words, not in the Faith. What <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi>
says upon a like occasion,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>Ath. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Syn. Nic. p. 267.</note> is a very
good Rule to maintain Christian Peace and
Unity. To corrupt the Faith is always un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
tho' we palliate it with the most po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
and orthodox forms of speech: but a
true and holy Faith does not degenerate into
Impiety and Heresy by some new improper
expressions, while he who uses such words, has
a Pious and Orthodox sense.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. Tho' all <hi>Realists</hi> do not agree about
the use of those words, Three Minds or Substances; yet
they all do, and all must agree in what follows, <hi>viz. They
are Three such Persons, that is, as distinct, and as really
subsisting and living, as three Angels, or three Men.</hi> They
are so without doubt, if they be real proper Persons; for a
Person lives and subsists, and Three Persons must be really
distinct, or they can't be Three; that is, the Father's Person
is no more the Person of the Son, nor the Person of the
Son the Person of the Father, than <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>John,</hi> or <hi>John</hi>


                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:62123:11"/>
is <hi>Peter;</hi> but then they do not subsist dividely, or sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do. He adds, <hi>Each Person has his
own peculiar individual Substance, his own personal and proper
Vnderstanding, Will, and Power of Action; an Omnipotence,
Omniscience, and all other Divine Attributes, divers in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from the Personal Omnipotence, Omniscience,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the
other Two Persons.</hi> Now I except against nothing in this,
but the Phrases of <hi>peculiar and individual substance, and
divers in number;</hi> for <hi>peculiar and individual,</hi> I would say
<hi>a singular substance.</hi> for tho' <hi>a singular</hi> substance in created
Natures is a peculiar and individual substance also, it is not
so in the Divinity. The Catholick Fathers always distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
between <hi>One Substance,</hi> and <hi>One singular Substance</hi>
of the Godhead. To deny <hi>One Substance,</hi> or the <hi>Homoou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
was <hi>Arianism:</hi> To assert <hi>One singular Substance,</hi> was
<hi>Sabellianism;</hi> for One singular Substance is but One Person,
which denies a Trinity of Persons: But the Divine Nature
and Substance is both <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, One and Common,
and therefore not One singular Substance, which can never
be common; and by the same Reason, a Personal Substance,
though it be singular, and appropriate to such a particular
Person, and therefore as incommunicable as the Person is,
yet it is not <hi>peculiar and individual</hi> in the common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of those words, but the same One common un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
inseparable Essence of the Divinity, subsisting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
and singularly in each Person. Thus for the same
Reason, I will not say, that the Personal Omnipotence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of the Father, <hi>is divers in number</hi> from the Personal Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence
of the Son, because it is the same One Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
as it is the same One Divinity, which subsists di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
in each Person; but we may and must say, That
the Personal Omnipotence of the Father, is not the Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Omnipotence of the Son, no more than the Person of
the Father, is the Person of the Son. But this disguised
<hi>Socinian</hi> has taken great care in representing the Doctrine


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62123:11"/>
of the <hi>Realists,</hi> to conceal their Faith of the perfect undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
Unity and Identity of the Divine Nature in Three
distinct subsisting Persons, which yet he knows they as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly
profess, as they do the real distinction of Persons,
and is owned in as high terms by Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> himself, as
by any of his Adversaries, and is almost the only Pretence
of those many Contradictions he is charged with, by such
as will not understand a perfect distinction in perfect Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which yet is essential to the Catholick Faith of a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Unity, and Unity in Trinity. But as for this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whether he had thought such a Distinction and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
reconcileable or not, yet when he undertook to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Doctrine of the <hi>Realists,</hi> he ought to have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
it whole and entire, and to have left it to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Reader: whereas he is very careful to observe
that they say, the Three Persons in the Trinity are Three
Substances, Three Minds, and Spirits; [which yet only
some of them say,] but takes no notice that these Three
distinct Persons have One undivided Nature and Essence,
which they all agree in: For this would have spoiled his
Objections of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and what he immediately adds
about Three Creators and Governors of the World, which
they never owned, any more than Three Gods; for tho'
there are Three who are Omnipotent, and Three who
create, yet they are so inseparably united in Nature, that
they are but One Agent, One Omnipotent, and produce
but One Effect: As the Catholick Fathers concluded for
this Reason, that as the Scripture teaches us, That there is
but One God, and yet that the Father is God, the Son God,
and the Holy Ghost God; so it attributes the making and
government of the world both to Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, and yet there is but one and the same world which
is made and governed; which proves, that though they
act as distinctly as their Persons are distinct, yet there is
such an essential Unity of Will and Power, and Operation,


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62123:12"/>
from the indivisible Unity of Nature, that they are but
one Agent, and produce but one and the same effect.</p>
               <p>But still as for the main of the Charge, That every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Person in the Trinity, has a personal Substance, Life,
Will, Understanding, Power, of his own, which is not the
personal Substance, Life, Will, Understanding, Power, of
either of the other Persons, is what all, who believe a Real
Trinity, do and must agree in, whether they will agree to
call these Three Substances, Wills, Understandings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or
not. Nay, this is all that those very Persons who assert
Three Substances, Three Minds and Spirits in the Trinity,
ever meant by it. Own but each Person in his own proper
Person, to be infinite Substance, Mind, Spirit, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Person is each other, and they will consent to any other
form of words, and not dispute the reason or propriety of
them; all that they contend for is a real Trinity of true,
real, proper Persons; and that they are certain cannot be,
unless each Person by himself, as distinct from the other
Persons, be Substance, Mind, Spirit, Will, Understanding,
Power.</p>
               <p>This is the only Trinity which <hi>Socinus, Crellius, Slich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingius,</hi>
and others of that Party, have hitherto disputed
against; and therefore certainly they did apprehend, that
the Christians in their days, even all the Divinity-Chairs of
<hi>Europe,</hi> did assert such a Trinity; and those Learned Men
who opposed them, did believe so too, or there must be very
wise doings amongst them: tho' our Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> have
now made a discovery, that these <hi>Realists</hi> are not the true
Catholick <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> but that the <hi>Nominalists</hi> are the
Church; and now they are grown Friends with the Church,
and Orthodox, beyond their own hopes; and their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is only to defend the Church against this new Sect of
Real <hi>Trinitarians.</hi> Let it be so: but still they maintain the
same Doctrine that <hi>Socinus</hi> did, and dispute against the same
Trinity which he disputed against, and therefore these Real


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62123:12"/>
                  <hi>Trinitarians</hi> are no new upstart Sect, but their old Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,
who will never be cheated by new Names into an
accommodation or comprehension with <hi>Socinians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The plain state of the Case is this: Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, are the Christian Trinity; now the question is,
whether this be a Real Trinity or not; that is, whether
the Father be an Eternal, Infinite, Living, Omniscient, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,
subsisting Person, and did truly beget of his own
Nature and Substance, a True, Living, Omnipotent, Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient,
subsisting Son; and in like manner, whether the
Holy Ghost proceeds from Father and Son, a True, Living,
Omnipotent, Omniscient, subsisting Spirit. This is the
Doctrine of those whom our Modern <hi>Socinians</hi> call <hi>Realists,</hi>
that is, of True and Orthodox <hi>Trinitarians;</hi> and without
asserting this, whatever they teach besides, a Trinity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a name, and therefore such men may properly be
called <hi>Nominalists;</hi> so that the <hi>Realists</hi> only are <hi>Trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
the meer <hi>Nominalists,</hi> whatever they are else, are no
<hi>Trinitarians;</hi> and this new contrivance of opposing these
Real <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> is neither better nor worse than opposing
the Doctrine of the Trinity: And let but our People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
this, and we are where we were, and then the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi>
may call themselves <hi>Nominalists,</hi> or what they please.</p>
               <p>To proceed: He is as artificial and unsincere in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the <hi>Nominalists,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 13.</note> as of the <hi>Realists. We must not
conceive of the Divine Persons, say the</hi> Nominalists, <hi>as we do
of created Persons.</hi> Very right! there is an unconceivable
difference between them, as all <hi>Realists</hi> acknowledge, they
are perfectly distinct, but yet inseparably One; they never
did, never can subsist apart; the same One undivided Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
subsists whole and perfect, and yet distinctly in each
of them, and is as perfectly One in Three, as any one thing
is one with it self. And thus we allow what he adds to be a
very great Truth, and wish he himself would consider bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of it: <hi>That the conception we ought to have of their Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalities,


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62123:13"/>
or what they are as they are Persons, is as different
from the Personalities of any created Beings, as the Perfections
of the Divinity are paramount to Human or Angelical Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
This we are sensible of, and therefore do not presently
cry out of Nonsense and Contradiction, when we are forced
by Scripture and Reason to attribute such things to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature and Persons, as we can find no Images or Idea's
of in Created Nature: for we know that Creatures cannot
be perfectly like to God, and consequently we ought not to
oppose the Idea's of Nature to Revelation. But the present
question is not, Whether Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
are such Persons as created Persons, as Angels, or men
are; for it is certain there is an unconceivable difference
between them; but whether they may be called Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in the true and proper Notion of the word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi>
for one who does really and substantially subsist,
live, will, understand, act, according to his Natural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
And whether there be Three such subsisting, living,
willing, understanding Persons in the Godhead, or only One:
Whether as the Father hath life in himself, so the Son hath
life in himself; and as the Father knows the Son, so the Son
knows the Father; and whether the Spirit of life, and the
Spirit of Holiness, and Power, and the Spirit that searcheth
the deep things of God, be not a subsisting, living, knowing,
working Spirit; and this is the reason, why the Church calls
them Three Persons, (which the Scripture does not call
them) because the Holy Scripture distinctly Attributes life,
will, knowledge, power, to these Three, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, which is the Notion all men have of a Person when
applied to Creatures; and to talk of Three Divine Persons,
who are not subsisting, living, knowing Persons, destroys the
only Reason for calling them Persons.</p>
               <p>But he adds, as the Doctrine of the <hi>Nominalists,</hi> That
<hi>God is but One Being, but One Substance, Mind, or Spirit, with
One only will, understanding, energy, or power of action.</hi> But


<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62123:13"/>
is not this, in a true Catholick Sense, the Doctrine of the
Realists also, as I observed before? But this is what this <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interested
Person</hi> would be at; to distinguish the Realists
and Nominalists by <hi>Three Substances</hi> and <hi>One Substance</hi> of the
Divinity: And were this the whole Truth, the Realists
would certainly be Hereticks, and the Nominalists might be
the Orthodox Church: Whereas the Realists, as they own
Three real subsisting living Persons, so they as constantly
profess the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or One undivided Substance and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
subsisting and acting distinctly, but indivisibly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
in Three, which is a real perfect subsisting Trinity
in perfect Unity: But the Nominalists, truly so called, as they
own but One Substance in the Divinity, so but One single
Person, which is their One God, and can find a Trinity only
in a Trinity of Names, or Properties, or meer immanent Acts.</p>
               <p>That there are many such Nominalists among us, I fear is
too true; but I must say again, that the bare dispute concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the use of those words, <hi>Three eternal infinite Minds and
Spirits,</hi> for <hi>Three eternal infinite intelligent Persons,</hi> no more
proves those who reject such expressions, while they own
each Person by himself, to be infinite Mind and Spirit, to
be meer Nominalists, than the use of such expressions in a
qualified Catholick Sense, (as the Catholick Fathers have
formerly used them, or other Terms equivalent to them)
proves those who use them to be <hi>Tritheists:</hi> And yet this
is all our Author pretends to justifie this distinction between
<hi>Realists</hi> and <hi>Nominalists,</hi> viz. <hi>The Controversy depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Dr. Sâ€”th and Dr. Sherlock.</hi> But I cannot pass on
without making one Remark on this, That Dr. <hi>Sâ€”th,</hi> and
those who have espoused that side of the Question, are as
much concerned to vindicate themselves from the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which this Author has fixed on them, of being meer
<hi>Nominalists or Sabellians,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and his Friends are,
to vindicate themselves from <hi>Tritheism;</hi> and I confess, I
think, a great deal more; because in the heat of Dispute, or
through Inadvertency, if it be not their settled Principle


<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62123:14"/>
and Judgment, they have given more just occasion for such
a Charge. When One and the same Person, with Three
substantial Deaneries, shall be very gravely alledged as a
proper Representation of a Trinity in Unity; when a meer
mode of subsistence shall be given as a proper and adequate
Definition of a Person, as applied to the Trinity; when a
large Book shall be writ on purpose to demonstrate,<note place="margin">Considerations concerning the Trinity.</note> That
there is and can be but One Person in the Trinity, in the
true proper Notion, as it signifies <hi>an intelligent</hi> Person; what
can the most equal and impartial Judge make of this, but
downright <hi>Sabellianism?</hi> For, whether it be allowable to
say, Three Minds and Spirits or not, I'm sure without own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Three proper, subsisting, intelligent Persons, each of
whom is in his own Person, infinite Mind and Spirit, there
can be no Real Trinity. If their Sense be more Orthodox
than their Words, I do heartily beg of them for God's sake,
and the sake of our common Faith, so to explain their Words,
as to remove this scandal, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> has done, and not
to Charge a Trinity of real, subsisting, intelligent Persons,
(which is all he professes to own, or ever to have intended)
with <hi>Tritheism,</hi> till they can give us something in the room
of it more Orthodox than a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Trinity, which the
Catholick Church has always rejected with Abhorrence.</p>

men consider, who this Advocate is, it will do the <hi>Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists</hi>
no Credit, nor any Service to the Cause; For a <hi>Socinian,</hi>
tho' he change his Name, will be a <hi>Socinian</hi> still, that is, a
professed Enemy to the Catholick Faith of the Trinity, and to
the Eternal God head and Incarnation of our Saviour Christ;
and there is very good Reason to believe, that what he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
is the True Catholick Faith, and what he vindicates and
defends is Heresy. What Agreement there is between the
<hi>Nominalists</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> and what an easie accommodation
may be made between them, we shall hear towards the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion;
but this will not satisfie our Author, that the present
Orthodox Church (which to the reproach of the Church, and
to the advantage of his own Cause, he will have to be all
<hi>Nominalists,</hi> which is such an abuse as concerned Persons
ought to resent; I say, not satisfied that the present Church)
is on his side; nothing will serve him less, than to prove,
that this was always the Faith of the Catholick Church: A
brave and bold Undertaking, but what his wiser Predecessors,
<hi>Socinus, Crellius,</hi> &amp;c. would have laught at; and which I
doubt not but he Laughs at himself, and will have cause to
Laugh, if he can meet with any Persons soft and easy enough
to believe him.</p>
               <p>He well and truly observes,<note place="margin">Page 14.</note> that this Question, <hi>What has
been the Doctrine of the Catholick Church</hi> in this point, <hi>must be
decided by Authorities or Witnesses,</hi> and therefore he appeals
to Authorities, and those I grant the most venerable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
and Witnesses that can be had, even <hi>General Councils.</hi> I
wish he would continue in this good humour, and then I
should not doubt but he would quickly change his side: But
this is contemptible Hypocrisy in a man, who despises all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
not only human, but sacred, when they contradict
his own private Reasonings, to appeal to Authority: I can ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
bear with men of weak Understandings, but I hate Knave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
for Truth needs no Tricks: and how much <hi>Socinians</hi> value
Fathers and Councils is sufficiently known.</p>

He begins with the <hi>Nicene Council,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>which brought into the
Church the term Homoousios; by which is meant, that the Divine
Persons have the same Substance,</hi> or are of <hi>One Substance:</hi> But
then he says, it is disputed between <hi>the Nominalists and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists,</hi>
in what Sense the Council understood this One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
<hi>Whether the same Substance in number, the self-same
Substance? so that there is indeed, but One Divine Substance:
Or the same Substance for kind, sort, or nature, namely the same
in all Essential Propertiesâ€”So that in Truth, there are Three
distinct (or numerically different) Substances, which are the
same only in nature and kind.</hi> This he makes the Controversy
<hi>between the Church</hi> (that is, his <hi>Nominalists) and the Realists;</hi>
but this is far from being the true state of the Controversy:
All whom he calls <hi>Realists,</hi> own, that Father and Son are
but One and the self-same Substance, communicated whole
and undivided from Father to Son, so that the Father is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
the Son Substance in his own Person, and both the
same Substance; And the like of the Holy Spirit, that as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
Victorinus</hi> says, They are <hi>ter una Substantia,</hi> Thrice One
and the same Substance; and this is all that those mean,
who venture to say, they are <hi>Three Substances;</hi> for the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
between those <hi>Realists,</hi> who say there is but one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Divine Persons, and those who own Three, is not
whether the Son be true and real Substance in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
as distinct from the Person of the Father; for all but <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians</hi>
agree in this; but whether considering the perfect
Unity and Identity of Nature and Substance in Three, it be
Orthodox to say, Three Substances, and not rather One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
and Three who subsist; which is a more Orthodox
form of speech, and less liable to exception: And thus we
allow, That the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, by the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> did mean
One and the self-same Substance of Father and Son, but so
that the Son is a true and proper Son, a real subsisting Person,
Substance of his Fathers Substance; <hi>God of God, Light of
Light, very God of very God, Begotten not Made, of one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
with the Father, by whom all things were made;</hi> which


<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62123:15"/>
so expresly declares the Sense of the Council, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
durst not so much as mention, <hi>God of God, Light of
Light,</hi> &amp;c. which can never be reconciled with his Notion
of One Substance, which leaves no Substance, nor any real
subsistence to the Son distinct from the Father.</p>
               <p>It is a bold stroke, and worthy of our Author, to make the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Council determine for <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> in the term <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousios;</hi>
but yet he has a little Story, which he thinks proves
it beyond exception, for which he quotes <hi>Socrates:</hi> That
Historian tells us, That there happened <hi>a great quarrel in
Aegypt about the word</hi> Homoousios,<note place="margin">Socr. H. E. l. 1. c. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>which he says was like fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the dark, without distinguishing Friends from Enemies;
for neither of them seemed to understand each other, as to those
matters for which they reproached one another:</hi> This our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
takes no notice of, for it would not serve his purpose;
it appearing from hence, that the Accusations on both sides
were causeless, and like dealing blows in the dark: But now
our Author begins. <hi>Those Fathers of the Council that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the term Homoousios,</hi> (but <hi>those Fathers of the Council</hi>
are not in <hi>Socrates,</hi> but only <hi>those who declined the term Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousios;</hi>
but <hi>the Fathers of the Council</hi> served his purpose bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore he makes bold with the Historian) <hi>or of
One Substance,</hi> (which the Historian has not added neither)
<hi>accused such as were for it, as Sabellians and Montanists,</hi> (but
the Historian says, <hi>did suppose that those, who received that
Term, did introduce the Doctrine of Sabellius and Montanus,</hi>
that is, that this was their design in using that Term, which
as he observed before, was their mistake) <hi>calling them also
blasphemous, because they seemed to take away (by that word) the
real Existence of the Son of God: While on the other hand, they
that stood for Homoousios, believed that such as were against
it, did introduce more Gods, and therefore detested them, as
reviving Paganism.</hi> Here our Author leaves off; but I shall
go on with the History.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eustathius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> accuses <hi>Eusebius Pamphili,</hi>


                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:62123:16"/>
as Adulterating the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith; <hi>Eusebius</hi> denies, That he
in the least departed from the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, and accuses <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stathius</hi>
of <hi>Sabellianism:</hi> And thus they wrote against each
other as Adversaries, and yet both of them Taught, That
the Son of God was a true and proper Person, and had a real
Subsistence of his own; and that there was One God in
Three Persons: that one would wonder whence it came to
pass that they could not agree.</p>
               <p>From this Story, our Author thus Reasons. <q>This is a
deciding-testimony in the Case. For the <hi>Realists</hi> will never
be able to shew, that if by <hi>Homoousios</hi> the Council intended
Three distinct Substances, Three Beings, Minds, or Spirits:
How the Fathers of the Council could be accused of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanism</hi>
and <hi>Sabellianism;</hi> for Three intellectual infinite
Substances, Three Divine Beings, Spirits or Minds, was the
Doctrine chiefly opposed by <hi>Sabellius</hi> and <hi>Montanus,</hi> as all
confess:</q> (Then by his own Confession, his <hi>Nominalists</hi> are
<hi>Sabellians,</hi> and all those Fathers and Councils which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Sabellius</hi> were <hi>Realists,</hi> and then we have got the
<hi>Nicene</hi> Council again.) <q>And on the other hand, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
which contrived and defended <hi>Homoousios,</hi> could as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Censure those who were against it as introducers of
<hi>Tritheism</hi> and <hi>Paganism,</hi> if it had not been supposed, that
in opposing <hi>Homoousios,</hi> they professed to believe Three
infinite Substances in number, Three Divine Minds, and
Spirits; which is the very Doctrine of the Modern <hi>Realists.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>1. Now in answer to this, I observe first, That the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian
says all this was an angry mistake, (as angry men are
very apt to mistake, and to reproach each other with their
own mistakes) but neither of these Parties were guilty of the
Heresies they were charged with; neither the one were
<hi>Sabellians,</hi> nor the other <hi>Tritheists;</hi> Now this I think proves
the direct contrary to what he concludes from it: For if
those who were charged with <hi>Sabellianism</hi> for owning the
<hi>Homoousion</hi> were not <hi>Sabellians,</hi> then it is certain, that they
did not think, that the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council by the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or


<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62123:16"/>
One Substance, meant <hi>One singular Substance,</hi> for that is <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellianism:</hi>
And when those who professed the <hi>Homoousion,</hi>
and were no <hi>Sabellians,</hi> charged those who rejected the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousion,</hi>
with <hi>Tritheism,</hi> they must believe, That the <hi>Nicene
Homoousion</hi> is neither <hi>Sabellianism</hi> nor <hi>Tritheism,</hi> but the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
between both; such a Unity and sameness of Substance, as
is neither a <hi>Sabellian</hi> singularity, nor a <hi>Tritheistick</hi> diversity
and multiplicity of Substances; that is, where Father and
Son are in their own Persons, as distinct from each other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Substance, and yet but one Substance, One of One, God
of God, Light of Light. This is the Medium
which <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us they both agreed in; and
therefore wondered how they should come to
differ;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> That the Son of God was a true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Person, and had a real Subsistence of his own;
and that there was One God in Three Persons.</p>
               <p>2. But <hi>if by Homoousios the Council intended Three distinct
Substances,</hi> (that is, according to our Sense, Three, each of
which is true and perfect Substance, and yet but One Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance)
<hi>How could the Fathers of the Council be accused of
Montanism or Sabellianism?</hi> Had he consulted Dr. <hi>Bull,</hi> he
would have learnt the difference between these two; but let
that pass: He Phrases this, as if he would insinuate, That the
Council it self was accused of <hi>Sabellianism</hi> for this Term;
which is false. But this word <hi>Homoousios</hi> had sometimes been
abused to a <hi>Sabellian</hi> Sense, tho' the Council did not use it in
that Sense; and some men might still conceal their Heresy
under the Covert of an Orthodox Word; For this Reason,
some who professed the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith, yet disliked the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousion;</hi>
and when this Dispute had heated them, it was too
natural to charge those, who from the Authority of the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi>
Council defended the use of that word, with such secret
Heretical Senses as they thought that word chargeable with:
And this is the whole Truth of the Case, as <hi>Socrates</hi> tells us;
and this is a very strange way to prove the Sense of the
Council, from the groundless accusations of angry and jealous
men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:62123:17"/>
3. But <hi>how could the Council, which contrived and defended
Homoousios, censure those who were against it, as introducers of
Tritheism and Paganism, which the Historian witnesses that it
did with great earnestness?</hi> But <hi>Socrates</hi> (his Historian) says not
one word of the Council, but only of these angry. Disputants
censuring and accusing each other, and both unjustly; but
he would sain ascribe all this to the Council, because it is not
Fathers, but Councils he relies on; of which more presently.</p>
               <p>But there may be a very good Reason given, why those
who rejected the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Unity and Singularity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Essence, might yet charge those with <hi>Polytheism</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> or Consubstantial; and there may be
two accounts given of it. 1. That they suspected them of
<hi>Arianism,</hi> in opposition to which, the Council taught the
<hi>Homoousion;</hi> one Sense of which was Such a sameness of
Nature, as is between Father and Son, which in Creatures we
call a specifick sameness, in contradiction to the <hi>Arians,</hi> who
taught, That the Son was of a different Nature and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the Father, as different from God the Father,
as a created and uncreated Nature differ; and this is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Paganism;</hi> for this makes the Son and
Holy Spirit, how excellent soever their Natures are, but meer
Creatures: And for this Reason we know, the Catholick
Fathers charged the <hi>Arians</hi> with <hi>Pagan Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi>
And the <hi>Arians</hi> at that time were such zealous opposers
of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> even while they concealed themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
some other Catholick forms of Speech, that it was too
great a reason to suspect those of <hi>Arianism,</hi> who denied the
<hi>Homoousion,</hi> whatever they would seem to own besides: and
when men are angry, less reasonable suspicions than these, are
thought sufficient to form an Accusation; and this is one
fair account of it: Such men were thought secret <hi>Arians,</hi>
and therefore charged with <hi>Polytheism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But there was another Notion of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> which
the Catholick Fathers thought absolutely necessary to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of God, and consequently that the denial of it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce


<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62123:17"/>
three Gods, instead of three Divine subsisting Persons
in the Unity of the same Godhead: And that is, That when
the Son is said to be <hi>Homoousios,</hi> or Consubstantial with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the meaning is, that he is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, of the very Substance of
the Father, and not of any other created or uncreated Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
This St. <hi>Basil</hi> is positive in, That Two, who are of the
same Substance for Kind, are not therefore Consubstantial, as
Father and Son, but are rather Brethren, unless one be of the
other: But now many true Catholicks very much suspected
this Term, because it seemed to imply a Division and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Father's Substance; for, How can the Son be of
the same Substance with the Father, without a division of the
Father's Substance? The <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers answered, That the
very Name of Son, and the natural Notion of Generation,
did necessarily prove, that the Son must be of the Father's
Substance; but then the absolute purity and simplicity of
the Divine Essence, which is a perfect indivisible <hi>Monad,</hi>
proves, That this eternal Generation of the Son, can't be
by a division of Substance, as it is in human Generations;
but is whole of whole, in an ineffable and incomprehensible
manner, so as no Creature can understand; which is no
great wonder, when we can understand so little of Creature
Generations, especially when Creation it self is as perfectly
unaccountable as the Eternal Generation; for we can no
more understand, how the World was Created of nothing,
than how the Son was Begotten of his Father's Substance,
whole and perfect, without any division or separation: That
the whole Divine Essence is originally in the Father, and
communicated whole to the Son, subsists whole and distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in Both, and is One in Both.</p>
               <p>This is that sense of the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> which occasioned so
many warm Disputes between the Catholicks themselves;
for this reason, that Party which rejected the <hi>Homoousion,</hi>
accused those, who received it, of <hi>Sabellianism,</hi> because they
asserted, That there was but One and the same substance in
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, which was the Heresy of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius;</hi>


                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62123:18"/>
and the heat of Dispute would not suffer them to
see how vastly the Catholick <hi>Homoousians</hi> and <hi>Sabellians</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd,
tho' they both asserted but <hi>One Substance:</hi> for the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellians</hi>
asserted but One single Substance, which is but One
real subsisting Person; and therefore made Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, but Three Names of the same Person: But the
Catholicks asserted Three real subsisting Persons, who were
Substance, Substance, and Substance, and yet but One of
One, the perfect same of the perfect same: <hi>Vna substantia
non unus subsistens;</hi> One substance, not one that subsists;
and therefore generally rather called them Three Subsisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
than Three Substances; not but that they owned each
Subsistence to be a Substance, but they were in the common
acceptation of the word not Three Substances, but One
Substance, really and actually subsisting Thrice, which they
allowed to be One, and One, and One, but not Three.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, those who received the <hi>Homoousion,</hi>
accused those who rejected it, of <hi>Polytheism</hi> and <hi>Tritheism:</hi>
for in truth, to deny that Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are
so of one substance, that the Son receives his whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Father, and that the Holy Ghost receives his
whole substance of Father and Son, is to make them Three
absolute, independent, self-originated substances, which have
no relation to each other; Three such as the Father is, who
is of no other but himself, and the Catholick Fathers always
accused this of <hi>Tritheism:</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, Three Fathers, was
the same to them, as to say Three Gods; and they vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Doctrine of a real subsisting Trinity, against the
<hi>Sabellian</hi> and <hi>Arian</hi> Charge of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> by saying, That
they did not own Three Fathers, but only One Father, One
Self-originated Divinity, which communicates his own sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to the Son; and therefore they are not Two Gods,
but God of God.</p>
               <p>But now these good Fathers, tho' they were right in the
Notion of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Notion of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moousion,</hi>
yet they wrongfully accused those, who rejected that


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62123:18"/>
term, of <hi>Tritheism;</hi> for they owned that the Son was of the
Father; that all that the Son was, he was of the Father; that
he was <hi>God of God, Light of Light,</hi> and therefore not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Self-originated God, but One God with the Father;
but they did not like those terms of <hi>Consubstantial,</hi> and <hi>One
Substance,</hi> and <hi>of the Father's Substance,</hi> as having something
too material in their conception, and sounding harsh, as if
the Son were part of the Father's substance; which was
objected against the <hi>Homoousion</hi> in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council it self,
which yet disclaimed all such absurd senses, and received the
term as the most infallible Test against <hi>Arianism:</hi> But tho'
the Authority of the Council over-ruled the generality of
Christians; yet some, who were truly Catholick and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox
in the Faith, could not digest it; and this was the true
occasion of this dispute, and these mutual fierce accusations;
and let our Author now make the best he can of it; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of doing him service, he will never be able to defend
himself against it. After all, our Author was aware of a very
terrible Objection against his sense of the <hi>Nicene Homoousion,</hi>
for one single <hi>Sabellian</hi> substance and person; <hi>viz.</hi> that the
Catholick Fathers rejected and condemned this sense of it as
Heresy, even <hi>Sabellianism;</hi> and it is not probable that these
Fathers should not understand the sense of the Council; or
that while they contended earnestly for the <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith,
they should condemn the true <hi>Nicene</hi> Faith for Heresy, as he
owns they do.</p>
               <p>This would have put a modest man out of countenance;<note place="margin">P. 19.</note>
but he takes courage, and huffs at these Fathers and private
Doctors: <hi>Particular Fathers are but particular Doctors; 'tis
from general Councils only we can take the Churches Doctrine.</hi>
It is very provoking to see a man banter the world at this
rate, with the utmost contempt and scorn of his Readers:
It is plain how great an Admirer he is of General Councils,
and what he thinks of his Readers, whom he hopes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade,
that the Catholick Fathers, who made up the Council,
even <hi>Athanassius</hi> himself, who had so great a part in it, did


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62123:19"/>
either ignorantly mistake the sense of the Council, or wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pervert it; especially when all the <hi>Ante-Nicene</hi> Fathers
owned the same Faith, as he may learn from Dr. <hi>Bull;</hi> and
those Catholicks, who after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council, disputed the
use of that term <hi>Homoousios,</hi> yet agreed in the same Faith, as
I have already shewn.</p>
               <p>What follows is all of a piece. He expounds the <hi>Arian Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiousios,</hi>
or of a like Substance, to signify <hi>the same Substance
in sort, or kind, or properties;</hi> that is, specifically the same,
but only differing in number, as Father and Son have the
same specifick Nature, but are Two Persons: And thence
concludes, that the <hi>Nicene Homoousios</hi> which the <hi>Arians</hi> at
first refused, but afterwards fraudulently subscribed in the
sense of <hi>Homoiousios,</hi> must signify but One singular solitary
Substance, but one Person in the <hi>Sabellian</hi> Sense: But who
ever before heard, that the <hi>Arian Homoiousion</hi> signified a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick
Sameness and Unity of Nature? Or, that the <hi>Arians</hi>
owned Father and Son to have the same specifick Nature as
<hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> had? The Catholick Fathers themselves, as,
<hi>Athanasius, Hilary, Basil,</hi> the two <hi>Gregory</hi>'s, &amp;c. owned such
a likeness of Nature as this, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,
to be equivalent to the <hi>Homoousion,</hi> and to be True
Catholick Doctrine; and this they asserted against the <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:</hi>
But it is in vain to dispute with a man, who has either
Ignorance or Confidence enough thus to impose upon his
Readers.</p>
               <p>His next Appeal is to the Sixth General Council, which
was the Third of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and when I met with this,
I was not a little surprized to think what he would make of
it. This Council, as he himself tells the Story, determined,
<hi>That there were two Natural Wills,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>and two Operations in the
Lord Christ;</hi> and the Reason of this was, because they asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Two Natures in Christ, the Divine and Human Nature;
and that each Nature has a Natural Will of its own; and
therefore as there are Two Natures, there must be Two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
and natural Wills in Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:62123:19"/>
This is a plain proof of the Mystery of the Incarnation;
that the Divine Nature in the Person of the Son was Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
for there could not be two Wills, unless there were
two Natures (which was the foundation of this Decree)
in Christ: And this <hi>Macarius</hi> himself in his Confession of
Faith profest to own, both in opposition to <hi>Nestorius</hi> and
<hi>Eutyches.</hi> Now this Catholick Faith of the Incarnation,
which is so often and so expresly own'd by this Council, is
utterly irreconcileable with this <hi>Sabellian</hi> Unity of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature and Substance, without running into the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passian</hi>
Heresy, that the whole Trinity is Incarnate: For if
Christ in One Person hath Two Natures, be truly and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
both God and Man, and consequently has Two distinct
Wills, a Divine and Humane Will; either as God, he must
be distinct in Nature and Person from the Father and the
Holy Ghost; or if all Three Persons of the Trinity, are
but one single solitary Nature, and consequently but One
true and proper Person, all Three, Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost, must be Incarnate, and suffer in the Incarnation and
Sufferings of Christ, which the Catholick Church condemned
as Heresy.</p>
               <p>Well! But he tells us, That this Council owned that
there is but One Will in the Three Persons of the Trinity,
and therefore consequently they can be but one true and
proper Person. This we own with the Council, That there
is but one essential Will in the Trinity, tho' each Person
has a Personal Will: But this he says, cannot be the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Council, because <hi>the question was concerning Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Wills, or Powers of willing:</hi> This is all fallacy. A
<hi>Natural Will</hi> is such a Will as belongs to that Nature, whose
Will it is: As a Divine Nature has a Divine Will, and a
Humane Nature a Humane Will; the <hi>power of willing</hi> is


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62123:20"/>
Personal, and signifies a Personal Will: And it is evident,
the Council speaks of the first, not of the second: And not
to multiply Quotations, I shall give but one plain proof of it.
<hi>Theophanes</hi> askt <hi>Macarius</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi> Whether <hi>Adam</hi> had
a reasonable Soul? They answer, Yes. Then he askt them,
Whether he had <hi>a natural Will? Stephen</hi> the Monk answers,
That before the Fall he had a Divine Will, <gap reason="foreign">

<hi>Demetrius</hi> calls this Blasphemy; for if he was a Co-Willer, he

                  </gap>, that

one who Wills with another, then there must be two
who Will; and if these two are <hi>One Will,</hi> it cannot sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify

               <p>His next Authority is the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> under

That the Trinity is <hi>una summa res,</hi> One Supream Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">Concil. T. 11. P. 1. p. 143.</note>

in God,</hi> as Abbot <hi>Joachim</hi> had objected; And that
each of these Divine Persons is this Divine Substance,
Essence, and Nature. All this <hi>Athanasius</hi> himself would
have subscribed, who yet with the other Catholick Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
rejected the Notion of a singular and solitary Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>They add, That this one supreme Nature, Substance,
Essence, (which is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost) neither
begets, nor is begotten, nor proceeds: Nor did ever
any Man in his Wits assert, That the Divine Nature and
Essence, as common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
that is, That the whole Trinity did either Beget, or was
Begotten, or did Proceed; This belongs to Persons, not
to Nature formally considered; as they expresly teach,
That the Father Begets, the Son is Begotten, and the
Holy Ghost Proceeds, so that there is a distinction of


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62123:21"/>
Persons, and Unity of Nature; That the Father is <hi>alius,</hi>
another, the Son another, the Holy Ghost another; but
not <hi>aliud</hi> another thing: but what the Father is, and
what the Son is, and what the Holy Ghost is, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,
they are all perfectly the same; that according to
the Catholick Faith, we may acknowledge them to be
Consubstantial; for the Father from Eternity Begetting
the Son, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, gave his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to him, as he himself witnesses. <hi>The Father who
gave them me is greater than all:</hi> Nor can it be said,
that the Father gave part of his Substance to his Son,
and retained another part himself; for the <hi>Hypostasis</hi> or
Substance of the Father is indivisible, as being perfectly
simple: Nor can we say, That when the Father Begat
the Son, he so communicated his own Substance to him,
as not to have it himself; for then he must cease to be
an <hi>Hypostasis,</hi> Substance, and a substantial Person him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
So that it is evident, That the Son, when Begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
received the Father's Substance without any diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Father; and thus Father and Son have the
same Substance; and Father and Son and Holy Ghost are,
<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, one and the same supreme Nature and
Substance; which they call, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, the
Unity of Sameness and Identity: This is true Catholick
Doctrine, and the very Language of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers.
And if <hi>Joachim</hi> rejected this Essential Unity of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and asserted a meer collective Unity, as many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are one Church, as the Council affirms he did, he
was very justly Condemned, and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
would have Condemned him. The only thing
which looks like an Innovation in this Decree, is, That
whereas the Catholick Fathers allowed of those Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<hi>A Begotten Nature, Begotten Substance, Begotten Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
Begotten God; and that Substance begets Substance, and


<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62123:21"/>
Wisdom begets Wisdom,</hi> &amp;c. This Council denies, That
this One supream Divine Essence, Nature, or Substance,
which is the Blessed Trinity, does either Beget, or is
Begotten, or Proceeds, which some Schoolmen think ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
condemns those Expressions, That Substance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
Substance; and Wisdom Wisdom; That the Son
is <hi>Deus Genitus,</hi> and <hi>Natura Genita,</hi> Begotten God and
Begotten Nature, and Begotten Wisdom; which is to
condemn all the Catholick Fathers, who used these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
without any scruple; nay, who thought that
the Mystery of the Divine Generation could not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
without them. But I confes, I am of <hi>Petavius</hi>
his mind, (though I find the Learned Doctor <hi>Bull</hi>
dissent from him) that this Council never intended
absolutely to condemn all such Expressions, when
Personally used; For though the Divine Nature in a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Notion, as common to all Three Persons, neither
begets, nor is begotten; yet the Father begets the Son
by a true and proper Generation, and a true and proper
Son; and therefore that Learned Jesuit tells us, That the
<hi>Lateran</hi> Council considered the Divine Nature absolutely,
and in it self,<note place="margin">Pet. de Trin. l. 6. c. 12.</note> and as abstracted from the Three Persons,
not as subsisting distinctly in each Person; for so it is
very Catholick to say, That the Divine Nature in the
Person of the Father begets the Divine Nature in the
Person of the Son: For we cannot understand what a
Person is without its Essence and Nature; and it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
to say, That the Son receives his Person from the
Father, without receiving that without which he cannot
be a Person: And the reason he gives, why they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
chose to say, that the Father begets the Son,
than that Essence begets Essence, was to avoid
the ambiguity of that Expression, which might sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
the production of another Essence, as well as


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62123:22"/>
the generation of another Person; whereas
this Divine Generation is the communication
of the same Eternal Essence which is in the
Father to the Son,<note place="margin">Quippe essentia neque sic gignit essentiam, ut ei absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam existentiam tribuat, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que sic gignitur, ut existat, sed generare, cÃ¹m ad essentiam pertinet, est generando com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municare, gigni est commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicari.

that the Son by an Eternal Generation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
a true Divine Nature from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

               <head type="sub">The Arguments of the Nominals, against a Real
Trinity of proper subsisting Persons, Examined:
And the Three First Arguments, Answered.</head>
               <p>SEcondly, Let us now briefly examine his Reasons, which
he thinks <hi>so demonstrative, that the (so much talk'd of)
Mathematical certainty is not superior to them:</hi> But I have
heard some men brag much of Demonstration, who
have had nothing to say, that would amount to a good
Probability.</p>
               <p>Now to make my Answer plain and easy, I observe
first, That all his Arguments to prove the <hi>Realists</hi> to be
guilty of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> and to assert <hi>Three Gods,</hi> are levelled
against a Trinity of <hi>distinct, real, subsisting, intelligent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi>
as he himself owns; for those invidious terms, of <hi>Three
Substances, Three Minds and Spirits, and Wills, and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
signify no more than Three, each of which in his own
proper Person, is Substance, Mind, Spirit, Will, Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing:
So that all these Arguments are against the
Catholick Faith of a Real Trinity; that is, to prove the
Doctrine of the Trinity to be <hi>Tritheism;</hi> for that which
is not a Real Trinity, is no Trinity: And therefore these
Arguments do no more concern Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> and some
few others, whom this Author would fain single out
from the Body of Catholick Believers, by the Name of
<hi>Realists,</hi> than all other Christians, who heartily Believe


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62123:24"/>
in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and own <hi>Christ Jesus</hi>
to be the Eternal Son of God, and true and perfect
God himself.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I observe, That all these Arguments are
no farther considerable, than as they directly oppose
the Catholick Faith in its full Latitude; that is, a
Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
assures us, That there is but one God, but teaches
withall, That the Father is God, the Son God; and
the Holy Ghost God; We believe God concerning
himself, and his own Nature and Unity, because he
best knows himself, and therefore we believe, that
there is but one God, but not that there is but One
Person, who is God, for there are Three in the Unity
of the same Godhead, and each of them true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
God; so that it is not enough for these Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators
to prove, That there is and can be but One
Eternal Divinity, or one God; for we readily own it,
and as heartily Believe it as they do; but we say
withall, that this one Divinity subsists distinctly and
indivisibly, whole and perfect in Three, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is a Trinity in Unity: Nor is it sufficient
to prove, That in the Trinity of the <hi>Realists,</hi> there
are Three, each of which is by himself true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
God, and therefore that there are <hi>Three Gods;</hi>
for we own such Three, but say, that these Three are
not Three Gods, but subsist inseparably in one Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
Divinity, and therefore that there is <hi>a Vnity
in Trinity.</hi> But if they would consute either the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
or the Unity, they must prove, That there are
not, and cannot be, Three real subsisting Persons in
One insinite undivided Essence, and then they will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
Confute the Scripture, and a Trinity with it;
or they must prove, That though Three such Persons
should subsist distinctly in one undivided Essence, yet


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62123:24"/>
they are not one and the same Divinity, or one God;
and then they will Confute not only Scripture, but
common Sense; That Three, which are One, are not
One, or that One Divinity is not One God: Having
premised this, let us now consider his Arguments.</p>
               <p>1. In the first place,<note place="margin">P. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>he says,</hi> Three infinite Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Substances, or Three Eternal Omnipotent Minds or
Spirits, <hi>(or which we have heard is the same thing,
Three infinite intelligent Persons)</hi> can never be but One
God; because 'tis evident, nay confessed, That One such
Spirit, Mind, or Substance, is One (absolute and most
perfect) God.â€”If the Definition is multiplied, the
thing defined is also therewith multiplied,â€”Seeing then
'tis the definition of One God, that he is One infinite
(intellectual, spiritual) Substance, One Eternal, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and Omniscient Spirit or Mind; Therefore if we
multiply our definition, by saying, Three Infinite (intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual,
spiritual) Substances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we thereby multiply
the thing we pretended to Define, namely, GOD; which is
to say, we affirm more Geds, as many Gods as such Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and Spirits.</p>
               <p>Here our Demonstrator stumbles at the very Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold.
I grant, That <hi>an infinite intellectual spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
an Eternal, Omniscient, Omnipotent Mind or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
is the Definition of One, who is God, or of a
Divine Person; but I absolutely deny, That this is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
of <hi>One God,</hi> that he is <hi>One</hi> Eternal, Omniscient,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Personal Mind or Spirit, as he fallaciously and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly
represents it; and in so doing, instead of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what he undertakes, he very modestly and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
begs the Question. He is to prove, That Three
infinite Substances, Minds, or Spirits, are Three Gods:
His Argument is, Because One infinite Substance, Mind,
or Spirit, is the Definition of One God; and if you
multiply the Definition, you multiply the thing defined,


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62123:25"/>
and therefore Three infinite Substances and Minds must
be Three Gods; but how does he prove, that <hi>One</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Substance and Mind (personally understood as we
understand it) is the Definition of <hi>One God?</hi> for this is
the thing in dispute, which certainly no <hi>Trinitarian</hi> will
grant him, and therefore ought to be proved. Those who
Assert, as all <hi>Trinitarians</hi> do, That Three infinite intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Persons, each of which is infinite Substance, Mind
or Spirit, are but One God, will not be so good-natur'd
as to grant, That One infinite Substance and Mind (or
One Divine Person) is the definition of the <hi>One God;</hi>
this would not be to Dispute, but to beg the Cause
on one side, and to give it away on the other.</p>
               <p>But this may be thought perverseness, to put men
upon proving what is self-evident: For, Is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
intelligent Person, Substance, Mind, Spirit, true
and perfect God? Yes, most certainly; but it is not
the Definition of the <hi>One God,</hi> but only of a Divine
Person; and the Christian Faith teaches us, That Three
such Divine Persons are but One God. The Catholick
Fathers have given us another Notion of <hi>One God,</hi>
That <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>One God is One Divinity;</hi>
that is, an Eternal, Immutable, Indivisible, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
Omniscient, Life, Being, Essence, Nature: and
the Essential, Undivided, Unity, Sameness, Identity,
of the Godhead in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is
the Unity of God: For I take it to be more like a
Demonstration, than any I expect to meet with in this
Author, That where there is but One Essential undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Divinity, there is but One God.</p>
               <p>Now this I think may vindicate those obnoxious
Expressions as some think them, of Three infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
Minds and Spirits, from the Charge of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;</hi>
for since infinite Substance, Mind, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
is not the definition of <hi>One God,</hi> but only of <hi>a


<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62123:25"/>
Divine Person,</hi> to say, Three infinite Substances, Minds, and
Spirits, does not multiply Gods, but only Divine Persons.</p>
               <p>2. His second Argument is <hi>against Three Wills,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Three
Vnderstandings, Three Energies, or Principles, or Powers
of Action</hi> in One God: This he represents as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
absurd; when as in truth, if it be absurd,
the only absurdity is, That there should be Three
Divine Persons, that is, Three, who have a Personal
Will, Understanding, Power, of their own, in the
Unity of the same Godhead: Now the absurdity of
this I cannot see, nor has he made the least offer to
prove it. But the secret of all these monstrous Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities,
is this. He represents <hi>One God,</hi> to signifie
only <hi>One single Person,</hi> who is God, and then indeed,
Three Wills, Three Understandings, Three Lives, of
one single Person, is as Absurd and Monstrous as one
would wish; but before he had charged the Doctrine
of a Real Trinity with such Absurdities, he should
first have proved, That One God signifies but One
single Person, and have exposed the monstrous Absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of Three Persons and One God, and then we
would have given him leave to have represented Three
Personal Wills, Understandings, and Lives, as absurd as
he pleases; but if it be not absurd to own Three
Persons, I'm sure it is very absurd to deny, that there
are Three, who Live, and Will, and Understand, that
is, in his Language, Three Wills, Understandings, and
Lives, in One God.</p>
               <p>3. His Third Argument comes nearer the Business;
for he undertakes to prove, That the Second and Third
Persons in the Trinity, the Son and the Holy Ghost,
are not <hi>Substance and Spirit,</hi> but only <hi>Properties, or
immanent Acts,</hi> or <hi>relative Subsistences in the Notion of
the Nominals:</hi> And his Argument is made up partly
of Authority, and partly of his own Reasoning upon
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62123:26"/>
                  <hi>His Authority is the Council of</hi> Lyons <hi>in the year
1274. which</hi> Condemns those, who presume to deny,
That the Holy Spirit does eternally proceed from the
Father and the Son.â€”<hi>He adds,</hi> 'Tis evident at
first sight to any Learned man, who is conversant in
these Questions, and in the Writers, who (in several
Ages) have managed 'em, what the Fathers of this
Council meant, and what they aimed at in this Decree
or Canon: For because they believed that the Divine
Persons are not Minds and Spirits, but relative Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stences,
or what is the same, immanent Acts: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not but believe and define, That the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Person is eternally generated, and therefore called
the Son; That the Third is an Eternal Spiration, and
therefore called Spirit. <hi>I can't think what to call this,
and therefore shall say nothing of it, but only beg my
Reader's Pardon for giving it an Answer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first place this Council says nothing of <hi>the
Eternal Generation</hi> of the Son, and therefore this could
not be what they aimed at, as he pretends. In the
next place, The <hi>Eternal Procession</hi> of the Holy Ghost
was not the thing in question, but his Eternal Proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
from Father and Son, which the <hi>Latin</hi> Church
professed, and therefore added the <hi>Filioque</hi> to their
Creed; but the <hi>Greek</hi> Church had disputed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
it, and that was one great design of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
to bring the <hi>Greeks</hi> to consent to this addition: so
that it was not the <hi>Aeternaliter,</hi> but the <hi>Filioque</hi> which
the Council had principal regard to in this Decree;
not the <hi>Eternal</hi> Procession, but the Procession from the
Father <hi>and the Son;</hi> so little did they think of what
our Author makes their chief design. But there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Clause in this Decree which he has concealed,
which proves, that they thought quite otherwise; for


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62123:26"/>
they do not only condemn those, who deny that the
Holy Spirit proceeds Eternally from Father and Son;
but those also, who teach that he proceeds from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and Son,<note place="margin">Spiritus sanctus aeternaliter ex Patre &amp; Filio, non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ex duobus principiis, sed tanquam ex uno princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio, non duabus spirationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, sed unica spiratione pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit.</note> 
                  <hi>as from two Principles, and
by two Spirations, and not as from one Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
by one Spiration.</hi> Now had they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Son to be a meer <hi>immanent Act,</hi> such
an unsubsisting Reason and Wisdom as is in
Man, had not this been a very wise Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,<note place="margin">Damnamus &amp; reprobamus omnes qui negare praesumpse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint. Spiritum Sanctum aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliter ex Patre &amp; Filio proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere, sive etiam temerario ausu asserere, quÃ²d Spiritus Sanctus ex Patre &amp; Filio, tanquam ex duobus principiis, &amp; non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ex uno, procedat. <hi>Conc. Lugdun.</hi>
                  </note>
Whether this <hi>immanent Act</hi> were <hi>a
Principle of Spiration,</hi> either together with the
Father, or distinct from him? But nothing is
to be wondered at in an Author, who will
venture to say, That Eternal Generation, and
Eternal Procession, is not reconcileable with
the real personal subsistence of the Son and
Holy Spirit, but proves them to be meer <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Acts;</hi> and that those, who own such an Eternal
Generation and Procession, must consequently believe
so: for this is the only Argument he has to prove
the Fathers of this Council to have believ'd the Son
and Spirit to be meer immanent Acts, because they
assert the Eternal Generation and Procession; whereas
on the contrary it is evident, that all the Catholick
Fathers, who asserted the Eternal Generation and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
did as strenuously assert against the <hi>Noetians</hi>
and <hi>Sabellians,</hi> the true and proper Personality of the
Son and Spirit.</p>
               <p>But let us hear how he proves, That if the Son and
Spirit, <hi>The Second and Third Persons, be distinct Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
and Spirits from the First,</hi> (that is, if the Son
in his own Person, as distinct from the Person of the
Father; be Substance and Spirit, and so of the Holy
Ghost) <hi>it were heinous Nonsense to say, they were Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
generated, or Eternally proceed.</hi> His Argument is


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62123:27"/>
                  <hi>this:</hi> If the Persons are Substances and Spirits, it must
be said, that the Second was compleatly and finally gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from all Eternity; the like also of the Third Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
else they should be incompleat Substances, unfinisht
Spirits.â€”If they are Spirits or Substances, it can
never be said that one is Eternally generated, the other
does Eternally proceed: but the former was generated from
all Eternity, and the other actually and compleatly proceeded
from all Eternity.</p>
               <p>Now supposing the Reason of this to be unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
All that it amounts to is no more but this, That
the Catholick Fathers, who attested the true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Personality of the Son, and Holy Spirit, were very
absurd, and guilty of <hi>Heinous Nonsense,</hi> in saying, That
the Son is Eternally generated, and the Spirit Eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proceeds. These are Nice Speculations, which the
<hi>Arian</hi> Controversy engaged them in; but the <hi>Nicene</hi>
Fathers contented themselves to affirm no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Eternal Generation, than that the <hi>Son was
begotten of his Father before all Worlds, God of God,
Light of Light, Very God of Very God.</hi> And this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of an Eternal Generation our Author has no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
against, and we do not think our selves bound
to answer for all the Subtilties either of the Fathers
or Schools; nor to determine every Curious Question,
which Perverse and Heretical Wits can start concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Divine Generation and Procession, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Comprehension of Angelical Minds, and which
we know no more of, but that the Son is begotten,
and the Spirit proceeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:62123:27"/>
And yet this Reasoning is very absurd, when applied to
an Eternal and immutable Nature. Things, which have a
beginning, which are made, which are successively and
gradually perfected by Art, are incompleat and unfinish'd,
while they are a-making, and if they are always a-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
or always incompleat; but a Generation or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession,
without a Beginning, and without Succession,
must always be perfect, and always the same, if it be
at all; here is no new Production, no making any
thing, no transient Action; in which sence the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Fathers denied the Divine Generation to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,
or Action, but only an Essential <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, habitude, relation
between Father and Son, who both perfectly and eternally
subsist, and co-exist with each other, but so, that the Son
is of the Father, and the Holy Spirit of Father and Son:
Thus they were without any Beginning, and thus they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
are, and this is all they meant by an Eternal Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Procession, and this the Immutability of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature forc'd them to own; for though external Acts
and Relations make no Change in the Divine Nature, yet
what is <hi>ad intrÃ </hi> does; and therefore could we conceive
any distinguishable moments in Eternal Duration, when
God was no Father, when he begot a Son, and when he
ceased to beget, this would make an internal Change in
the Divine Nature it self, which is inconsistent with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Immutability. But the Son always was and is of the
Father, and this is his Eternal Generation, and the Holy
Spirit always was and is of Father and Son, and this is
his Eternal Procession, and thus the Divine Essence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
was and is the same, a Trinity in Unity, and this is
the perfect Immutability of God.</p>
               <p>And yet his Philosophy is very absurd, when he argues
from an Eternal Generation and Procession, that therefore
the Son and Holy Spirit must be incompleat and unfinish'd;
for this will not be granted him even in created Nature,


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62123:28"/>
much less in the Divinity. They are no mean Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
who tell us, that the World may very properly be
said to be perpetually created; that what we call Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or upholding all things in being, is the very same
Act and Power which at first gave Being to them; and
such a permanent Act is Creation still, though no new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of any thing: But these Men would scorn any
one who should hence conclude, that there is no compleat
or finish'd Substance, no really subsisting substantial World:
Much more absurd is it, to conclude this of an Eternal
Generation, which produces nothing new, nothing that
ever began to be, and is the same that ever it was, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Succession.</p>
               <p>And he defends the Nominalists just as wisely and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophically,
as he opposes the Realists, as if his only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
were to expose both.</p>
               <p>He says this Eternal Generation proves the Son and
Holy Spirit,<note place="margin">Page 41.</note> to be only <hi>immanent Acts</hi> in God, <hi>reflex Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
or the Wisdom that resulteth from Original Minds
Eternal Contemplation and Knowledge of the Divine Nature
and Perfections, and the everlasting Spiration of Love that
must proceed from the Original and reflex Wisdom of the
Deity.</hi> And here we have just such a Trinity in the God-head,
as there is in every particular Man, his Mind, and
the immanent Acts of Wisdom or Reason, and Love, which
all Learned Men know to be one kind of <hi>Sabellianism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Son is the Wisdom and Power of God, and
that the peculiar Character of the Holy Spirit is Love, is
the language both of Scripture and Fathers; but not as
<hi>immanent Acts,</hi> but the living subsisting Wisdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and living subsisting Love, eternal and infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
co-eternal and co-equal with the Father: But it is
a new Language, unknown to Scriptures and Fathers, to
call an <hi>immanent Act of Wisdom</hi> a Son, and the Minds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
such an Act, its generating or begetting a Son,


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62123:28"/>
and to call such an immanent Act in God, the Son of
God, and God; by which Rule, every Thought or Act
of Reason in any Man, is Man, and the Son of that Man
whose Thought and Act it is.</p>
               <p>And it as new Philosophy to talk of <hi>immanent Acts</hi> in
God; for there can be no immanent Acts, but where
there are Powers and Faculties, which is the Imperfection
of the Creature-State, not incident to the perfect Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>But besides this, what does he mean by the <hi>Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>
and <hi>Spiration of an immanent Act;</hi> an immanent
Act (according to all the Accounts I ever met with of it,
and as every Man may feel in himself) is not an <hi>abiding,</hi>
as he calls it, but <hi>a transient Act:</hi> it has no permanent sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Nature, no Subsistence of its own, but vanishes and
dies assoon as <hi>generated,</hi> to speak in his language; which
is a necessary Reason to remove all such immanent Acts
from God, in whom there is nothing vanishing, nothing
successive: but if Men will attribute <hi>immanent Acts</hi> to God,
<hi>(reflex Wisdom,</hi> as opposed to a living, subsisting, perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Wisdom) they must speak of them according to the
known Nature of such Acts, and then an Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of such an immanent Act, which vanishes, assoon as
generated, can signifie no more, than an <hi>eternal successive</hi>
Repetition (which is a Contradiction) of the Acts of
<hi>reflex Wisdom,</hi> that as one vanishes, another succeeds;
that though God has always this reflex Wisdom, yet he
has not always the same Act of reflex Wisdom, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
it a-new every moment, which he calls an <hi>Eternal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:</hi>
just as it is with Men who may have the same
Thought for kind some time together, but yet every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is new produced: To talk of such an Eternal
Son as this, and such an Eternal Generation, is Heresie
in Philosophy, and in common sense, as well as in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
and it would be loss of time to expose it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:62123:29"/>
                  <hi>I must no more</hi> omit <hi>than he, another surprizing Argument
whereby he proves, that</hi> the Catholick Church did believe,
that the second Person is the reflex Wisdom of God, and
the Third Divine Love,<note place="margin">Page 42.</note> 
                  <hi>because for this reason, as he
tells us,</hi> this Question has been very warmly debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Son is that Wisdom, wherewith the Father is
Wise. Those Fathers, who affirm this Question, usually al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
these two Arguments; that the Eternity of the Son
cannot be otherwise proved, but by this, That he is the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Wisdom of the Father; and that otherwise we must sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
Two Wisdoms in God, which is so absurd to a late
learned Ecclesiastical Historian, that he concludes his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertation
concerning this Question, with these Words: The
Father neither is, nor can be actually Wise, but by the
Word or Son. I. Cabassutius Notit. Eccl. p. 120. correct.
119. <hi>let the Reader now judge of all the rest by this.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this Question was disputed I own: But he has
assign'd a very false and a very absurd Occasion for it;
for had this been the received Faith of the Catholick
Church, that the Son is only the <hi>immanent Act</hi> of reflex
Wisdom in God, what Occasion had there been for this
Dispute, <hi>whether the Son is that Wisdom by which the
Father</hi> is Wise? that is, the <hi>personal</hi> Wisdom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for who ever disputed, whether immanent Acts
were Personal, or no? And therefore this very Dispute
proves, that they did not believe the Son to be a meer
immanent Act.</p>
               <p>But though they did dispute among themselves, in
what Sence Christ is called <hi>the Wisdom of God, and the
Power of God;</hi> and whether Christ be that Wisdom,
wherewith the Father is Wise, and in what Sence the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may be said to beget his own Wisdom; and how the
Son can be said to be <hi>sapientia de sapientia,</hi> Wisdom of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
if the Father in his proper Person be not Wisdom,
but only the Begetter of Wisdom, with many other Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions,


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62123:29"/>
as we see in St. <hi>Austin, lib.</hi> VI. <hi>de Trin.</hi> Yet they
never divided upon this Point, but did universally agree,
that the Father in his own proper Person is Original Mind,
and Wisdom; and that the Son in his own proper Person
is begotten Wisdom, even the Essential Wisdom of God,
not that personal Wisdom wherewith the Father is
Wise, but Wisdom truly and properly begotten of Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Wisdom; Living, Subsisting Wisdom; distinct in
Person from the Father, who is Original Wisdom, but
perfectly the same one undivided Essence, and therefore
not Essentially Two, but One and the same Wisdom,
which is the Wisdom of the Father: So that though
there was some Dispute about the true Signification of
such Expressions, yet here was no Division among the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks,
who all agreed on that Side of the Question,
which directly contradicts this Author's Catholick Faith
of <hi>immanent Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The true Occasion of this Dispute, as St. <hi>Austin</hi> tells
us in the same Place, was this; that some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
I think he might have said all the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers,
in their Disputes with the <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Eunomians</hi> about
the Eternal Generation of the <hi>Son,</hi> or <hi>Word,</hi> used this
Argument, that God was never <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> without his Word,
or Wisdom: not that they had no other Argument to
prove the Eternity of the Son, as this Author represents
it, but that they thought this a very good one: Now
the Force of this Argument seemed to be this, that God
is always Wise; and therefore that Person, who is the
Word and Wisdom of God, must have always been with
him, as Eternal as God is: And to make this a good
Argument, the necessary Consequence seemed to be, That
the Person of the Son, who is the begotten Word, and
Wisdom of the Father, is the personal Wisdom of the
Father, that Wisdom wherewith the Father is Wise: And
the Difficulty of this was, how this begotten Wisdom,


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62123:30"/>
which is a distinct Person from the Person of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
should be that Wisdom whereby the Person of the
Father is Wise: how they justified this Argument, and
yet avoided such Absurdities, is too long now to account
for; those who please may consult St. <hi>Austin</hi> for it; but
I hope every one sees that both the Reason of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
the Nature of those Difficulties, it was incumbered
with, and their Determination of the Point, are all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
Contradictions to what this Author alledged it
for.</p>
               <p>And now let us hear what our Author's learned <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassutius</hi>
says, but what the World will say of him, when
they hear what <hi>Cabassutius</hi> says, let other guess.</p>
               <p>This <hi>learned Historian</hi> takes Notice of this Dispute, and
gives the same Account of it which I have now done;
and vindicates that Argument of the Catholick Fathers
for the Eternity of the Son, because he is the Wisdom
of the Father, that were he not Eternal, the Father could
not be always Wise, from the Exception of St. <hi>Austin.</hi>
This he does by a Distinction borrowed from <hi>Aquinas;</hi>
that those, who taught the Son to be the Wisdom of
the Father, are to be understood<note n="*" place="margin">Verunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men non est caduca caete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum, quos nominavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Patrum adversus Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um instantia, si debitam ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibeas distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem insinuat praeclarÃ¨ S.

causal and illative Sence. For though the Son, as a Son,
is not that Wisdom, wherewith the Father is Wise</hi> (let
out Author first observe that) <hi>yet he is necessarily united
with it, and arises from it:</hi> So that the Son is not the
personal Wisdom of the Father, but is begotten of his
Father's Wisdom, and inseparably united to it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is the Wisdom of God, Wisdom of the Father's
Wisdom and inseparable from it; which are Two, One
of One, and indivisibly and inseparably One.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:62123:30"/>
But let us hear his Reason for this<note n="*" place="margin">Sapientia quippe quae in Patre est, non est habitus, aut facultas, aut potentia, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis est in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus creatis, sed est purus &amp; simplex Actus.</note>: <hi>For the Wisdom
which is in the Father, is not a Habit, or Faculty, or
Power, as it is in created Beings, but a pure and simple
Act.</hi> What is now become of <hi>his immanent Act, by which
he tells us Original Mind must be Wise?</hi> for if he believes
his learned Historian, Original Mind <hi>is a pure simple Act
it self,</hi> and therefore not Wise by immanent Acts of
reflex Wisdom, which suppose Habits and Faculties and
Powers, and have no Place in a pure simple Act; that
if the Son be only an Immanent Act of reflex Wisdom,
he will never find his second Person in a pure and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Mind and Wisdom, should be Wise by reflex Wisdom,
which is but a secondary Wisdom, which supposes a first;
and therefore, as one would guess, could not make the first
wise) but <hi>Cabassutius</hi> only says, that the Father is not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
wise <hi>without</hi> the Son, that is, as he explains it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
begetting that Eternal Word and Wisdom, which is
the Person of the Son. I shall make no Remarks on this, let
the World judge of the skill, or the honesty of this Author.</p>
               <p>What he adds about <hi>Emanations,</hi> is just to the same
Tune: The Eternal Generation of the Substance of the
Father, was by the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council represented by <hi>Light of
Light,</hi> and the Co-eternity of the Son with the Father by
the Co-existence of Emanatory Causes and their Effects,
as of the Sun and its Rays, which are as old as the Sun.
The Author, like other <hi>Socinians,</hi> thinking of nothing but
Body, and bodily and corporeal Emanations, falls present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a demonstrating; <hi>Let</hi> A. B. C. <hi>be three infinite Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 44.</note>
                  <hi>if</hi> B. <hi>and</hi> C. <hi>(infinite Substances) emane from</hi> A. <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Substance also: it is self-evident, that the two infinite
Substances must exhaust, and thereby in the end annihilate
one infinite Substance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a notable Demonstration as to corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances;
for if the whole flow out of it self, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
it must cease to be what it was, and become ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Whole, if it be not a Contradiction, that the same
Whole should flow out of it self, and become another
Whole, which in Bodies could make no other Change
in a Whole, but a Change of Place, for let a Whole
emane, (if that be not Nonsense, for a corporeal Whole
to emane) and go where it will, it is it self, and the
same Whole still.</p>
               <p>And I think it is no better Sense, to talk of <hi>exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an infinite Substance;</hi> for nothing can be exhausted,
but what is finite, unless what is infinite can have an
end: and an exhausting Emanation of an infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62123:31"/>
is no better Sense than the rest; for it necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
supposes an infinite Substance with divisible Parts,
which may be separated from it self and from each other,
which I take to be a Contradiction to the very Notion
of Infinity. It is certain, that such Emanations, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust
their Subject, can be only bodily Emanations, for
Bodies only have divisible and separable Parts, that I
defie the most absurd, self-contradicting <hi>Trinitarian</hi> in
the World, to put so many Absurdities and Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into one Sentence, as he has done in this: <hi>One infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Substance (whether corporeal or incorporeal) can never
eternally supply two infinite Substances: the two infinite Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
by continual Emanations must needs dry up the One, that
was their Fountain.</hi> To talk of <hi>an infinite corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
(which he here supposes) is absurd and unphiloso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical,
for nothing can be infinite which has Parts; for what
is infinite by Nature can never be finite; and yet if such a
supposed infinite Body were divided in the middle, (as all
Bodies may be divided) this infinite corporeal Substance
would prove two finite Substances, for each of them would
have one End, where their Substance was divided: to talk
of such Emanations from incorporeal Substances (which
have no divisible Parts) as <hi>can dry up an infinite Fountain,</hi>
which must be by a Partition and Division of Substances,
is another Contradiction; and to dry up an infinite Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as I observed before, is another; and to supply infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Substances by such Emanations, which cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,
if they want any supply, is a fourth very good
one.</p>
               <p>But allowing this Author to rejoice in such refined Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
I would desire to know, who those are who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
the Eternal Generation of the Son, and Procession
of the Holy Spirit, to such eternal, corporeal Effluxes and
Emanations, as will endanger the exhausting and drying
up the infinite Fountain of the Deity? If there be any such


<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62123:32"/>
Men they are arrant Hereticks, I assure him, for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Fathers abhorred the thoughts of all such Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.</p>
               <p>They did not indeed scruple the use of such Words, as
Emanation, Probole, Exition, and the like, whereby they
signified that the Son was truly and in a proper sense of his
Father's Substance, and a real distinct Person from the
Person of the Father, but they expresly rejected all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
Effluxes, all Division and Separation of the Father's
Substance; and taught that the Son is begotten whole of
whole, perfect God of perfect God, by a real Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
but not a Transfusion of Substance, not <hi>ad extra,</hi>
without, as Creature-Generations are, but within his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
as the Word is inseparable from the Mind, whose
Word it is. So that our Author disputes here without
any other Adversary, but his own gross Imaginations,
and he may triumph securely, and demonstrate these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal,
exhausting, dying Emanations, out of Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and the Realists no farther concerned, than to
look on, and see the Event of the Combate, or to wish
him better employed. If he would have effectually baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
these Realists, he should have proved, that God could
not communicate his own Nature and Substance to the
Son, Whole of Whole, without such an Emanation of
his Substance, as divides it from it self, and separates one
part of it from another, as it is in bodily Exhalations:
This would effectually have confuted a substantial Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
for all Men grant, that the Divine Substance can't
be divided, and this was the Objection of the <hi>Arians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, or the Son's being begotten of the
Substance of the Father, but the Catholick Fathers asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
a real substantial Generation, without a Division of
Substance, and taught them to distinguish between the
Generation of Body and Spirit.</p>

And whoever considers, how a finite created Mind can
communicate its Thoughts to another, which when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
communicated, are perfectly the same, whole and
entire in both, and but one and the same Thought, though
in two Minds; may conceive, that an infinite Mind, which
is a pure and simple Act, infinitely more simple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible
than Thought it self, may be able to communicate
its self more perfectly, than a finite Mind can commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
its Thoughts, and if it can, it must communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
it self whole and entire, and as indivisibly as a

                  <note place="margin">Page. 45.</note> That all Explications, by which
'tis endeavour'd to shew, how three infinite (intellectual

               <p>Now, suppose this true, that no Man can give a perfect
Account of the Unity of the Divine Nature in Three Distinct,
Infinite, Divine Persons; must we therefore deny either
the <hi>Trinity</hi> or <hi>Unity</hi> (both which, we say, are expresly
taught in Scripture) because we cannot fully comprehend
so Sublime and Venerable a Mystery? They pay greater
Deference than this to the Evidence of Sense; they will
believe their Senses, where their Reason and Philosophy
is at a loss, nay, in such Matters, as if they did not see


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62123:33"/>
them, they think they could demonstrate absolutely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious
and impossible: and did Men heartily believe
the Scriptures, why should they not as absolutely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their Reason to the Authority of God, as to the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of Sense? But let them answer for this.</p>
               <p>But the whole Strength of this Argument, which he
manages with great Triumph and Scorn, dwindles into
the old <hi>Socinian</hi> Sophism, that <hi>one God</hi> signifies but <hi>one
only Person,</hi> who is God; and that whatever other Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
you ascribe to three Persons, each of which is by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
true and perfect God, still they are three Gods; for
since <hi>each of these Spirits</hi> (or Persons, each of which is
an infinite Mind or Spirit) <hi>are said to be infinite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 46.</note> 
                  <hi>all-perfect,
they must be said to be Gods, mutually Conscious, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
inexisting, and the rest; but no more one God, than
they are one Spirit:</hi> and therefore <hi>the Realists may as well
pretend that by these Devices of theirs, they have contrived
three infinite Spirits into one Person, or into one Spirit,
as into one God.</hi> And that <hi>a disinterested Person</hi> (I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
he means such as himself) and Philosophers, and
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> he might have added <hi>Sabellians,</hi> and
<hi>Socinians,</hi> and <hi>Mahumatans,</hi> will call these <hi>three Gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now it is no wonder that this <hi>disinterested Person</hi> thinks
all our Explications of the Unity of God insufficient,
when we so vastly differ about the Notion of <hi>one God:</hi>
That we are so far from proving <hi>three Divine Persons</hi> to
be <hi>one God</hi> in his Sense, that we reject his Notion of one
God, as Judaism and Heresie; and herein we have the
Authority of the Catholick Church on our side. And
here I would desire the Reader to observe, that this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is not meerly against that Phrase of <hi>three Minds
and Spirits and Substances;</hi> but against three Persons, each
of which is in his own proper Person, <hi>Mind and Spirit
and Substance;</hi> for three such Persons, by this Authors
Argument, are three Gods, and can no more <hi>be contrived</hi>


                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:62123:33"/>
(as he prophanely speaks) into <hi>one God,</hi> than into <hi>one
Personal Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet since he graciously owns, that one infinite Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Spirit, is one God, what if we should prove these three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Persons, each of which is Mind and Spirit, to be one
and the same Infinite Eternal Spirit: And yet this has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
been the Faith of the Catholick Church, St. <hi>Austin</hi> is
express in it, <hi>The Father is Spirit, and the Son Spirit, and the
Holy Ghost Spirit, but not three Spirits, but one Spirit;</hi> that is,
not <hi>Personally,</hi> but <hi>Essentially</hi> One, they are three Persons,
but one Essence, essentially one Spirit: And if God be
perfect, pure, simple Essence, the Unity of Essence, is the
Unity of God. This was the Doctrine of all the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Fathers, and this we must insist on till our Modern
Demonstrators speak more home to this Point, that one
Divine Essence, one Self-originated Divinity, though subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in three distinct Persons, is but one God. I can't
discourse this at large now, that may be done, if there
be Occasion for it, another time, but at present I shall
only give a brief Account of the Doctrine of the Fathers,
as to this Point.</p>
               <p>They tell us, that there is but one self-originated
Divinity, but one Father, and therefore but one God;
that this Eternal Unbegotten Father, begets an Eternal
Son of his own Nature and Substance, and in like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that is, in the same Nature and Substance the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit Eternally proceeds from Father and Son: So
that there being but one Nature, one Divinity, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
whole and entire and perfectly the same, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Division of Substance, there is but one Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but one Divinity distinctly in three: not one meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a Species is one (though they often allude also
to a Specific Unity) but one, as one <hi>Individual,</hi> though
not one <hi>Singular,</hi> Nature is one: as one which subsists
wholly, indivisibly, and perfectly in three, is one; which


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62123:34"/>
is one, and one, and one, by a perfect Sameness, and
Identity of Nature, and Substance, but not three.</p>
               <p>That these three are inseparable from each other, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
did subsist a part, never can; but are in each other,
which they call the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Circumincession,</hi> which
makes the Divinity one simple, indivisible Monad: And
here we may allow a Place, (and he never intended
any other Place for it) to what Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> calls, <hi>mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Consciousness,</hi> which is the proper and natural <hi>In-being</hi>
of three, each of which is Mind and Spirit: which is
not barely a knowing each other by an external Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of Thoughts and Counsels, which is far from
being an essential natural Unity; but such an inward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Sensation, as each Person has of himself; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all the Noise and Clamour about it, seems to be a
very sensible Representation of the natural <hi>In-being</hi> and
<hi>Circumincession</hi> of the Divine Persons; and as natural a
Demonstration of the Unity of the Divine Essence, as
<hi>self-consciousness</hi> must be acknowledged to be of the Unity
of a Person.</p>
               <p>It is certain, without this they cannot be <hi>one Energy
and Power</hi> (wherein the Fathers also place the Unity of
the God-Head) one Agent, one Creator and Governour.
But where there is such an inseparable Union, such a
mutual conscious Sensation, there can be but <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,
as <hi>Greg. Nyssen</hi> speaks, One Motion
of the Divine Will, though distinctly and without Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in three: And this makes them one Agent, one Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Will, one Essential Wisdom, one Essential Power; so
that here is in the properest Sence, but one Omniscience,
one Omnipotence, one Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore but one
God, though Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are each of
them in their own Persons, Omnipotent, Omniscient, and
whatever belongs to the Idea of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:62123:34"/>
All this, indeed, does not make these three Divine
Persons one Person, and therefore not one God, in the
<hi>Socinian</hi> Sense of <hi>one God,</hi> which is the only Deficiency
this Author charges this Account of the Divine Unity
with; and is wisely done of him, because he knows we
reject this Notion of the Divine Unity, and therefore
here he is safe; we assert that the Unity of God, is not
the Unity of a Person, but the Unity of Nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence;
and to confute this, he gravely proves, that three
Persons are not, and cannot be one Person: But if he
would have opposed us, he should either have shewn,
<hi>First,</hi> That the Account the Catholick Fathers give (for
for we pretend to give no other) of the Unity of God,
does not prove, the perfect Unity of the Divine Essence
in three Persons: or <hi>Secondly,</hi> that one undivided Divinity
is not one God: or <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the same Eternal Essence
cannot subsist whole and perfect, distinctly and indivisibly
in Three; that is, that God cannot communicate his
own Nature and Substance, without Division and Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to his Son, and Spirit; or that God cannot have
an Eternal Son, and an Eternal Spirit: if he can do either
of these, we will very tamely and humbly follow his
Chariot; in the mean time (for I believe this will take
up some time) I will shew him the Difference between
three Divine Persons, each of which is true and perfect
God, and three Gods.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> then <hi>one God</hi> in the <hi>Socinian</hi> Notion, is one
infinite Mind and Spirit, one Eternal Divinity, in one only
Person: So one Person, and one Divinity, that no other
Person communicates with it in the same Divinity, in the
same one eternal Essence and Substance: Now according
to this Notion of <hi>one God, three Gods</hi> are three such eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Minds, Substances, Divinities, each of which in his
own Person, has a whole, perfect, undivided Essence


<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62123:35"/>
and Divinity, which is not common to any other Person:
So that three Gods are three absolute Substances, Essences,
Divinities, which have no Essential Relation to, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
with each other. There can be no other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of three Gods, if as this Author, and all the <hi>Anti-Trinitarians</hi>
assert, One God is One absolute Divinity in
One Person; for then three Gods must be three absolute
Divinities in three Persons: Now every one sees, what a
vast difference there is, between three such Gods, and the
Catholick Faith of a Trinity of Person, in the Unity of
the Divine Essence.</p>
               <p>Why, you'll say, is not every Person in the Trinity, <hi>by
himself,</hi> in his own Person, true and perfect God? Yes,
most certainly; but he is not one absolute, separate Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
he has not a Divinity so peculiarly his own, that
no other Person communicates in it; there is but One un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided
Divinity in all Three, and therefore there is a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
in Unity.</p>
               <p>But is not each Person in the Trinity infinite Mind,
Spirit, Substance? Nay, do not some <hi>Realists</hi> venture
to call them <hi>three Minds, Spirits, Substances?</hi> and what
are such Three, but three Gods, if One infinite Mind and
Spirit, be one God?</p>
               <p>I answer: An infinite Mind and Spirit, is certainly true
and perfect God; but one Personal infinite Mind and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is not the <hi>One God,</hi> so as to exclude all other Persons,
unless he have one absolute, separate Divinity also, so
proper and peculiar to himself, that no other Person does
or can communicate in it; for if more Persons than One
can perfectly communicate in the same One Divinity,
there must be more Divine Persons than One, and each of
them perfect God, but neither of them the One God, in
Exclusion of the other Persons, but all of them the One
God as the One Divinity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:62123:35"/>
This, I think, the <hi>Socinians</hi> will grant, That One Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is but One God, and that One God is One absolute
Divinity; and the Reason why they assert the One God
to be but One Person, is because they think it impossible,
that the same undivided Divinity should subsist distinctly
and perfectly in Three; but then before they had charged
the Faith of the Trinity with <hi>Tritheism,</hi> they should have
remembred, that the Persons of the Trinity are not three
such Persons, as <hi>their One Person</hi> is, whom they call the
One God: and therefore though three such Persons, three
such Minds and Substances, as their One Person, and One
Spirit is, who is the whole Divinity confined to One sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Person, would be Three Gods, this does not prove,
that Three such Persons as the Catholick Church owns in
the Ever-blessed Trinity, who are all of the same One
Substance, and but One Divinity, must therefore be three
Gods also.</p>
               <p>2. Three such Persons as these, who are three Gods,
our Author, and every one else, who understands any
thing of these Matters, must acknowledge to be three
<hi>self-originated</hi> Persons; for God, in the full and adequate
Notion of <hi>one God,</hi> is <hi>a self-originated Being;</hi> and those,
who assert, that the <hi>One God,</hi> is but <hi>One Person,</hi> make
him <hi>a self-originated Person:</hi> now it is evident, that in
this Sense the three Persons in the Christian Trinity are
not three God's, for they are not <hi>three self-originated Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons:</hi>
The Father alone is <hi>un-begotten,</hi> or <hi>self-originated,</hi> but
the Son is begotten of his Father's Substance, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost eternally proceeds from Father and Son; so that
here is but one self-originated Person, with his Eternal Son,
and Eternal Spirit. And let this Author try to make three
Gods of three, two of which are not self-originated Persons.
They might more plausibly dispute against the Divinity of
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, from this Topick, that they


<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62123:36"/>
are not <hi>self-originated</hi> Persons, than prove them to be a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third God, by their perfect Communication in a
<hi>self-originated Nature,</hi> which is the Person of the Father.
For though a perfect Communication of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
makes a true Divine Person, who is true and perfect
God, yet no Person can be <hi>the One God,</hi> who is not <hi>self-originated;</hi>
and <hi>a self-originated Person,</hi> who is <hi>a Father,</hi>
cannot be the <hi>One God,</hi> so as to exclude his Son, who is
of the same Nature and Substance with him; nor the
Holy Spirit, who by an Eternal Procession from Father
and Son, perfectly communicates in the same Eternal
Nature.</p>
               <p>3. Three such Persons, as in a strict and proper Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are three Gods, must be three separate Persons, who
have not only distinct, but separate Natures, and Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and have no internal Union, or Communication with
each other; and therefore are in a proper Notion three
Principles, three Agents, three Wills, three Lives, three
Omnipotents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who always act a-part, and can never
concur as one Agent, in any one Action; cannot make
and govern the same World; have no Relation to each
other, no Order, no Union, as it is impossible three ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,
independent Divinities should: But the Catholick
Faith concerning the three Divine Persons in the Trinity,
is directly contrary to this, that as Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, are but One Substance, One Divinity;
so they are so perfectly in each other, that they have
but one Essential Will, Omnipotence, Omniscience, are
but one Agent, one Creatour and Governour of the
World.</p>
               <p>Let this Author, or any other Adversaries, talk what
they please, of the Absurdity, Nonsence, Contradiction,
of all this, which is not our present dispute, I stand to it,
that they can never make <hi>Tritheism</hi> of it; for the three


<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62123:36"/>
Divine Persons in the Trinity, though each of them be by
himself true and perfect God, yet as they are owned by
the Catholick Church, and as we have now explain'd it,
are not three such Persons, as they themselves must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
three Persons must be, who are three Gods.</p>
               <p>What I have now discoursed will help us to give a plain
and short Answer to those Fallacies, whereby such <hi>disinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested</hi>
Persons, as this Authour, charge the Catholick
Faith of the Trinity with <hi>Tritheism;</hi> for they manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
equivocate both in the Notion of <hi>one God,</hi> and of <hi>one
Person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By <hi>One God,</hi> they understand one who is true and
perfect God, and every one, who is true and perfect
God, is one, and now instead of all other Demonstrations,
they only desire you to number the Persons of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
upon your Fingers, and if you can but tell to three,
you will infallibly find three Gods: The Father is true
and perfect God; there, say they, is One God: the Son
is true and perfect God; there are Two Gods<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> the Holy
Ghost is true and perfect God; there are Three Gods: <hi>quod
erat demonstrandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But do they think that all the Catholick Fathers knew
not how to find Three in the Trinity, till they taught
them to tell three upon their Fingers? and if they found
three, but yet could not find three Gods in the Trinity,
they might in Modesty have thought, that something
more than <hi>Arithmetick,</hi> or telling their Fingers, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to make good this Charge, and because they either
are, or would seem to be ignorant of this, I will tell
them what it is.</p>
               <p>In that Dispute, whether there be only One God, or
more Gods than One; By <hi>One God,</hi> in the first place, all
Men understand One Divinity, one Infinite, Omnipotent,
Essence and Nature; for all the Arguments relating to the
Unity of God directly prove no more than the Unity of


<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62123:37"/>
the Divine Essence: that God is but One Person, as well
as One Divinity, (as most Men did, and as all Men might
reasonably conclude before the Revelation of a Trinity of
Divine Persons in the Essential Unity of the God-head) is
not owing to any direct and positive Proof, but to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Presumption: For since we have no Example in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Nature, of more than one proper Person in one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
inseparable Nature; most Men hence concluded,
naturally enough, that one Divinity was but one Divine
Person also. But God, who understands his own Nature
best, has revealed to us in Scripture, that there are Three,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who equally and perfectly
communicate in this One infinite and undivided Essence,
and therefore that there are Three Divine Persons, and
One God. And this has occasioned a Confusion of Terms,
on which our <hi>Socinian</hi> Adversaries have grounded all their
noisie Triumphs: for now <hi>One God,</hi> and <hi>One Person,</hi> signifie
very differently in the Mystery of the Trinity, from what
they do in common Acceptation, and must of necessity
do so.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>One God,</hi> in natural Religion, before the Revelation
of this Sacred Mystery, signified One Divinity, One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Nature and Essence, without any Notion of more
than One Subsistence, and One Personality; and then
consequently One Person, who is this One God, must
signifie One, who has this whole Divinity, perfectly
in himself, and exclusively to all other Persons. But
in the Christian Mystery; <hi>One God,</hi> signifies also One
perfect undivided Divinity, but <hi>communicable whole and
perfect, and indivisibly to more than One,</hi> and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
subsisting in three distinct Persons, Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost; and therefore consequently, <hi>Person</hi> also in
this Mystery, signifies One, who has the whole Divine
Nature perfectly in himself, and therefore is true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
God, but has not the whole Divinity incommunicably


<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62123:37"/>
in himself, exclusively to all other Persons, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is not the <hi>one God,</hi> in the Sense <hi>of one perfect incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
Divinity,</hi> peculiar to himself, and communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to no other Person, nor subsisting in any other. And
now let any Man judge of the mean Sophistry of our
Adversaries, who from their Notion of <hi>One Person</hi> and
<hi>One God,</hi> which the Catholick Church with great Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
rejects, charge the Catholick Faith of a real,
subsisting, <hi>Trinity,</hi> with <hi>Tritheism,</hi> for they do not dispute
<hi>ad idem,</hi> but impose upon Men with an equivocal
Use of Words. Three such Divine Persons indeed,
as they own, that is, each of which has a whole
perfect Divinity in himself, which no other Person
communicates, or can communicate in, must be in a
proper Notion, three Gods, or three perfect, self-origina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
separate, Divinities; but this does not prove (and
yet in the last Result this is all the Proof they offer at)
that three Persons, who have but one comon Divinity,
though distinctly and perfectly subsisting in each of them,
are therefore three Gods; for neither of these Persons is
so God, as to exclude the others from the same Divinity,
and therefore are not three Divinities, not three self-origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
divine Essences, and therefore not three Gods, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the natural Notion of <hi>Tritheism:</hi> God, and
God, and God, who have the same One Divinity sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
in them all, are not Three Gods, but One God,
because One Divinity. Here it is they should attack us,
and if they have any thing to say to this Point, we are
ready to join Issue with them.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>His last Argument, which he places great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in, is very easily answered. It is this.</hi> That all
the Reasons used by Philosophers, or Divines, to prove that
there is but one God, do as certainly and as clearly prove,
that there can be but one infinite and all-perfect Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:62123:38"/>
All this still is nothing but the same Equivocation and
Fallacy, which I have already sufficiently answered: <hi>One
infinite and all-perfect Spirit</hi> may either signifie <hi>one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
who is <hi>infinite Mind or Spirit</hi> in his own Person, and
here we are ready to joyn Issue with him, that all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
which prove, that there is but one God, do not
prove that there is but one Divine Person, but One, who
is this One God: or it may signifie one Divinity, which is
<hi>Essentially</hi> one infinite all-perfect Spirit, but <hi>personally</hi> three;
and in this Sense we agree with him; for we assert one
undivided Essence <hi>Essentially</hi> one in three, that is, we
believe there is but one God, who is One in Nature and
Three in Persons. And this seems a pretty surprizing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
to prove that the Arguments for one God
confute a Trinity of real subsisting Persons in the Unity of
the same God-head: It is certain, before he can do this,
he must make three Gods of these three Divine Persons;
for if they be but one God, the Arguments for the
Unity of God, can never confute a Trinity of Persons;
and here I might reasonably leave this Argument, till he
has answered, what I have already said in this Cause.
But let us hear his Arguments against <hi>Polytheism,</hi> and
see how he applies them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That created Nature has nothing needless or in
vain, much less can we suppose, that the uncreated Divine
Nature hath ought, that is, superfluous or redundantâ€”
But now, is it not a Superfluity, say they, to suppose more
Gods, when (because one is sufficient) more Gods are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and wholly in vain?</p>
               <p>I do not remember, that I have met with this Argument
in these Terms, in any of the antient Apologists for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity:
I think, it is a very bad Argument against the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of any thing, but much more so, when applied to the
Divine Nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62123:38"/>
                  <hi>That Nature does nothing in vain,</hi> has been allowed
for a Maxim among all Philosophers, who have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
a God, or that all things are made by a wise Cause,
the necessary Consequence of which is, that nothing is
made in vain, and this is the only Proof, and the only
Reason of that Maxim: but, <hi>that created Nature has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
needless, or in vain,</hi> is not a self-evident Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but must be proved by an induction of Particulars,
and is very hard to be prov'd in this way, because we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
so little of the Designs, and Contrivance and
Wisdom of Nature; that many who begin at this end
of the Question, reject a wise Cause and Maker of the
World, because they think, they discover many Defects,
or many superfluities in Nature, that is, many things which
are needless or in vain: and this looks like an unfortunate
Beginning thus to mistake his Maxim.</p>
               <p>But to allow him this: What Philosopher ever preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to prove by this Argument, that such things either
were, or were not, as they apprehended to be either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective,
needless, or superfluous? Whether such things are,
or are not, is pure Matter of Fact, and must be proved
by such Ways, as the Nature of the Thing admits; Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Sense by Sense, Matters of Revelation by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:
and when Men know, that such things are, and
what they are, then they judge of them, whether they
be vain and needless, defective or superfluous, or wisely
made, as they begin at the right or wrong End of this
Question. Those who are perswaded, that the World
was made by a wise Cause, hence conclude, that all things
are wisely made, though there are many things which
they do not understand the Reason and Philosophy of:
Others presuming upon their own Skill in Nature, pick
many Quarrels with it, and find few things, which
thoroughly please them, and thence conclude that the
World was not made by a wise Cause, because they do
not see the Wisdom of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:62123:39"/>
But whatever Truth or Force, there be in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it can relate only to created Nature, to such things
as are made, and are made to serve some particular End;
for then only a thing is vain and needless, when it is
made so in whole, or in Part, as to serve no wise End:
but surely we must not dispute at this Rate concerning
an eternal, uncreated, self-originated Nature, which was
not made by any Cause, and therefore has no end but
it self: and yet this his Argument, to prove two or
three Gods <hi>superfluous, needless, in vain, because one God
is sufficient: sufficient</hi> for what? why, to make and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
the World; Well! Is God then only for the Sake
of Creatures? Can a Being, who was never made, who
has no Cause, no Beginning, have any End but it self?
Was one God a superfluous, needless Being, before he
made the World? or was the World from Eternity as well
as God? And does not an <hi>Athiest,</hi> who can make and
govern a World without a God, conclude from this very
Argument, that there is none, because he is a superfluous
and needless Being? which shews, what a dangerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
this is, when proposed in such loose general
Terms. God is indeed the Maker and Governour of
the World, and we can prove, that the World could not
be made and governed but by God, and that one God
can make and govern the World, and there needs no
more for this Purpose, and the Unity and Harmony of
the World, that is made, proves that there is but one
Maker and Governour of it, and therefore but one God:
Such Arguments as these, together with the Notion of an
absolute perfect Being, which can be but one, were
urged by the antient <hi>Apologists,</hi> against the <hi>Pagan Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theism;</hi>
but to make God a <hi>superfluous</hi> or <hi>needless</hi> Being,
any farther than he has a Respect and Relation to Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
which this Argument against the plurality of Gods
supposes, is very irreverent to God, and liable to very


<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62123:39"/>
ill Consequences. It was never used in this Sense by
any of the antient Fathers, and the first time <hi>Petavius</hi>
observes it is in <hi>Abaelardus</hi> and <hi>Edmundus Cantuariensis:</hi>
and that more cautiously expressed, and better qualified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His Second Argument is much of the same
Nature:<note place="margin">Page 49.</note> 
                  <hi>The multiplicity of Beings, of any sort, arises on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
from the weakness, imperfection, and unsufficiency (in some
regard or other) of those Beings;</hi> which is such a wise
Reason for <hi>the multiplicity of Beings,</hi> as I never in my
Life before met with. The Reason why any <hi>imperfect
Beings</hi> are, is because they are made, for what is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
can't be without a Cause; and what ever is made
must be <hi>imperfect,</hi> because it must have <hi>a finite and limited
Nature;</hi> for an infinite Nature is self-existent, and
can't be made: and what is finite and limited, may be
multiplied; for there is nothing in its Nature and Idea
to hinder it, if it find a Maker; and the Wise Maker of
the World thought fit to make many Creatures of the
same Kind: and now he may bring in his Reasons, if
he pleases, why God made so many Creatures of the same
kind, to supply Mortality, or for mutual Help or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
&amp;c. but all these Reasons relate only to such Beings,
as are made, and have a wise Cause, and I perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with him, that God has none of these Defects, and
therefore none of these Reasons can make it necessary
that there should be more Gods than one; but then he
should have remembred, that God was not made, and
therefore not made for any End; and this would have
made him thought twice before he had added. <hi>To sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
more Gods without assigning a final Cause for such a
Supposition, is to imploy our Fancy and Invention</hi> (to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
no Cause) <hi>not to exercise our Reason: 'tis to amuse
our selves with Conceits and Chimera's, not to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phize.
You imagine more Gods without giving a Reason,


<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62123:40"/>
whether final or declaratory. You ought to know that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Name for this is Whimsie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I want a Name for this Argument, only I think
it is neither Reason nor Philosophy, to talk of assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a final Cause, why there is a God, either one or
more.</p>
               <p>A final Cause is the Reason and End, for which any
thing was made; but that which was not made, could be
made for no end, and therefore it is absurd to talk of
the final Cause of a necessary and eternal Being.</p>
               <p>But though he has managed these two Arguments at
such a rate, that no Man has any reason to reverence
him as an infallible Dictator, either in Philosophy or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
yet we allow him, what he would have, that two
Gods are more than we have any need of, and that there
is not the same Reason for more Gods than One, that
there is for a Number of Creatures, of each kind; and
what then? What then? sure that is very evident, that
there can no more <hi>be three all-perfect, all-sufficient Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi>
than <hi>three Gods:</hi> Right! not three such <hi>all-perfect,
all-sufficient Spirits,</hi> as are <hi>three Gods;</hi> but what does he
think of Three, each of which is an all-perfect, and all-sufficient
Spirit, and all Three but one Divinity, one
God? But <hi>one Spirit, who is really all-sufficient and all-perfect,
is enough to all Purposes and Intents whatsoever:</hi>
I grant, One Divinity is so; but if this One Divinity
essentially and necessarily subsists in Three, in Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, each of which is an <hi>all-perfect,</hi>
and <hi>all-sufficient</hi> Spirit, and yet but one whole undivided
Divinity, one <hi>all-perfect, all-sufficient</hi> Being, these Three
are not more than enough, not redundant and superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in the Divinity: and therefore he should have proved,
that by the same Reason, that three absolute, indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
self-originated Divinities are superfluous and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less;
three Divine Persons, of the same one undivided Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62123:40"/>
are superfluous too. Three Divinities, three sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
self-originated Divine Essences and Natures, are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous;
but I hope one Divinity, one Divine Nature and
Essence is not: and if three Divine Persons are Essential
to one undivided and inseparable Divinity, I hope they
are not superfluous neither: and this is the Catholick Faith:
not three Gods, or three Divinities, but three Persons in
one infinite, undivided, Nature and Essence. Three, which
never did subsist, never did, never can act a-part, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
though three, are but one all-wise omnipotent Agent;
and one omnipotent is not <hi>more than enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>none of these Imperfections which are the Reasons,
why Beings of the same Kind are multiplied, are found in
any one of these all-perfect, all-sufficient Spirits.</hi> Very true,
but the same one whole perfect Divinity is found in them
all, and therefore though they are three, the Divinity is
not multiplied, but they are One God; and this is all we
are to account for: those who believe but one God, I
hope, need not <hi>give a Reason, whether final or declarato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
why there are more; but if he expects a Reason,
why there are three living, subsisting, omniscient, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
Persons in this one undivided God-head, a <hi>final
Reason</hi> I can give none, for I have learnt to give no such
Reasons of a necessary and eternal Nature; <hi>a declaratory
Reason,</hi> as he aclls it, I can give, because our Saviour has
assured us, that so it is, and has given Command to his
Ministers to baptize <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the
Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And this answers his third Argument, that the
Works of Creation, though they prove the Being of a
God, yet give us not the least Intimation of more Gods
than One: We own the Argument against a Plurality of
Gods; but now for the Application: He says, this is <hi>as
direct a Proof against our professing more Infinite and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62123:41"/>
mighty Spirits. Of one such Mind or Spirit, the Works of
Creation are a clear Demonstration, but they shew us not the
least Foot-steps or Track of more such Spirits and Minds.</hi> [Or
of three such Divine Almighty Person;] and I know not
how they should, when as the <hi>Realists</hi> themselves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
these three are but one essential Wisdom, Power, and
Goodness, and therefore but one Maker and Governour
of the World.</p>
               <p>But he thinks, that if there were more than One such
Mind or Spirit, or as we say, infinite Person, who is an
infinite and all-mighty Mind, <hi>that also would have been
made known to us, either by the Works of Creation or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
that are visible to all, because all are concerned to
know it.</hi> But though there were (as we profess to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
three such Divine Persons in the Unity of the
God-head, yet he knows according to our Principles, the
Works of Creation could give no such Notice of any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of Persons in the God-head, because the Father
makes all Things by his Word and Spirit, by an undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
and undistinguished Wisdom and Power, and when
these Divine Persons have not distinct and separate Parts
in the Creation, it is impossible, that this visible Frame
of Nature should distinguish them; and therefore this
Distinction cannot be learnt but by Revelation.</p>
               <p>Nor consequently were all Men concerned to know
this, till God thought fit to reveal it: It was sufficient
in a meer State of Nature to worship the Maker of
the World with an undistinguisht Devotion: but the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Mankind by the Incarnation and Death of
the Son of God, and by the Sanctification of the Spirit,
made the Revelation of this Mystery necessary; and
though the Works of Creation did not visibly distinguish the
Divine Persons, yet the Work of Redemption does, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Son, and Holy Ghost, have their distinct Parts and
Offices in this Glorious Work, and such as prove each of


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62123:41"/>
them to be a distinct Person, and each Person to be true
and perfect God; but this Author will not stand the Trial
of Revelation: for he tells us plainly, that the Doctrine
of the <hi>Trinity</hi> (for that is all he means by three Minds
and Spirits) <hi>is a Point of so much Importance, and so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Concernment, that were it true, it must have been found,
where all other necessary Parts of Religion are registered;
in the Works of Creation, or the Methods of Providence,
or the congenit Notions, which are inseparable from our ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Natures.</hi> Here he speakes out, and we thank
him for it; he hath done with all Revelation, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
where there is the least need of it, <hi>viz.</hi> such Matters
as may be known without a Revelation; and now he has
pulled off his Disguise, it is time for all Christians to
have done with him. He has hitherto concealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
under the Character of a <hi>Nominalist,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own Rule he ought to shew us this <hi>nominal</hi>
Trinity <hi>registered in the Works of Creation, or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of Providence, or those congenite Notions, which are
inseparable from our rational Natures:</hi> and when he has
done this, we will shew him a <hi>Trinity</hi> of real proper sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
Persons.</p>
               <p>As for what he adds, that our Saviour tells us, <hi>God is
(not three Spirits) but a Spirit,</hi> it is like all the rest:
<hi>Spirit</hi> there, as in many other Places, signifies the <hi>Nature,</hi>
not <hi>the Person,</hi> and therefore these are not contradictory
Propositions; <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and there are Three in the
Unity of the God-head, each of which is infinite Mind
and Spirit.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Defence this Author makes for the Nominalists,
against the Objections of the Realists.</head>
               <p>THis Author having, as he thinks, sufficiently expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the <hi>Tritheistick</hi> Trinity of the <hi>Realists,</hi> proceeds
to vindicate the <hi>Nominalists</hi> from those Exceptions,<note place="margin">Page 52.</note> which
are made against them: I need say little more to this, than
to explain that Defence he makes for them; and leave the
Persons concerned to vindicate themselves from his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
which seems to me a very scandalous one.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>first</hi> Objection is, That <hi>the Explication</hi> (of
the <hi>Nominalists) is a bare-fac'd yielding the long-controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Question of the Trinity, to the</hi> Sabellians <hi>and</hi> Samosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenians,
<hi>and consequently to the</hi> Socinians, <hi>who differ in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from</hi> Noetus, Sabellius, <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>of</hi> Samosata; (they
are near of Kin indeed, but there is some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them.) <hi>The God of the</hi> Sabellians <hi>and</hi> Socinians,
<hi>and the God (or pretended) Verbal Trinity of the</hi> Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
<hi>is perfectly the same: the latter have explained away
the Trinity to the former. The three Divine Persons of the</hi>
Nominals, <hi>do all make but one Divine Person of the</hi> Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<hi>and</hi> Sabellians. This is certainly true, (as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
the Doctrine of the <hi>Nominals,</hi> which, I hope, they
can give a better account of) but for fear some Men
should not believe it, he takes great pains to prove that
it is so. Now this is a very formidable Objection: for
if the <hi>Nominals</hi> have revived <hi>Sabellianism</hi> and <hi>Socinianism,</hi>
they have been condemned many hundred Years since by


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62123:42"/>
all those Catholick Fathers and Councils, who condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Noetus, Sabellius, Photinus, Paulus Samosatenus,</hi> and
such like <hi>Anti-Trinitarian Hereticks.</hi> And this justifies
the <hi>Realists,</hi> and undoes all that he has hitherto been
doing; for there is no <hi>Medium</hi> between a <hi>Real</hi> and a <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi>
Trinity, a Trinity of three real, living, subsisting,
Persons, and One living, subsisting Person, with a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Names, Offices, Modes, or immanent Acts, and
therefore as far as the Authority of the Catholick Church
reaches, the Condemnation of a <hi>Sabellian</hi> and <hi>Nominal</hi>
Trinity must justifie a Trinity of real subsisting Persons.
And what now does he answer to this? Why he owns
it, and says the <hi>Socinians</hi> at length see it, and hope to
make their Advantage of it: <hi>That it is indeed an invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Objection, and that is the whole strength of it: Invidious,</hi>
I confess, it is, because all sincere Christians abhor these
Names, and it would in a great measure put an end to
this Controversie, were our People satisfied, that a <hi>Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Trinitarian,</hi> and <hi>Socinian,</hi> perfectly agree in renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the true Catholick Faith of the Trinity; though the
<hi>Nominalist</hi> still retains the Name of Trinity and Persons,
which the <hi>Socinians</hi> have hitherto rejected, but are now wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to use them for Peace sake, since they learn from these
Men, that they signifie nothing, and that the Church ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to signifie any thing real by them. This is
what he tells us with great Triumph: <hi>Our</hi> English Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
<hi>claim in their Writings,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Page 56.</note> 
                  <hi>that they are the Discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
that the Feud between the Church and them was ill-grounded.
For that,</hi> in very deed, both (the <hi>Nominals,</hi>
whom he calls the Church, and the <hi>Socinians) say the same
thing: As they pretend to this Honour, so they are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
paid, in that themselves have the whole Benefit of it:
They may enjoy thereby that Peace and Tranquillity, that
Ease and Security from the Laws themselves, which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore


<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62123:43"/>
owed to the Indulgence, or Connivence of Princes and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This now is very plain dealing, and I hope will be a
fair warning to all serious Christians, how they suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
themselves to be cheated out of their Faith by the
loud, groundless Out-cries of <hi>Tritheism,</hi> or imposed on by
the old Catholick Names of Trinity, and Persons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that Catholick Sense in which the Church always used
those Words.</p>
               <p>And I think those Persons to whom this Author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixes
the Name of <hi>Nominals,</hi> if they be not <hi>Sabellians</hi>
and <hi>Socinians,</hi> (which God forbid) ought to vindicate
themselves from this heavy Imputation, and not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
the Charge, but so explain themselves, as to let us see,
wherein their Doctrine concerning the Trinity, differs from
the old condemned Heresies of <hi>Sabellius, Photinus,</hi> and
<hi>Socinus:</hi> And I doubt not but this will produce a much
happier Agreement, and put an end to this scandalous
Distinction between Real and Nominal <hi>Trinitarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>But our Author is much more troubled with the</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Objection:</hi> That the Predications, or (as others speak)
Attributions given in Holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Page 57.</note> and by the Catholick
Church to the Divine Persons, seem not well to consist, or to
be intelligible, on the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> or Explication of the
<hi>Nominals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Instance concerns</hi> the Son or second Person in the
Trinity, who is called God, and we say he was Incarnate,
and all things were made by him: In some places an Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presence,
in others Omnipotence and Omniscience are ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
to him. But how can we (with any tolerable Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety)
say, that a meer reflex Wisdom is God, created all
things, was incarnate, is omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent?
Or how can any of these things be affirmed of, or applied
to our Saviour, in regard of the Incarnate or inhabiting


<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62123:43"/>
                  <hi>Logos,</hi> or reflex Wisdom? the which also how it should be
incarnate, will be another unaccountable, unintelligible Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox.</p>
               <p>This is a very notable Objection; he has brought the
<hi>Nominals</hi> on, let him see how he can bring them off
again.</p>
               <p>Now, in the first place, he is not willing to own, that
any such things as these are said of Christ, and therefore
tells us, <hi>We should do well to consider the Interpretations
of the Texts, wherein these things are said, or seem to be
said.</hi> And here he is at his old Trade of admiring his <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Interpreters,</hi> whom he prefers much before Divines;
and of disparaging those Copies we have of the Scriptures:
the Mystery of which is, That some Criticks give up
some Texts of Scripture, out of Wantonness and Vanity,
which the Catholick Church always thought good Proofs
of the Divinity and Incarnation of our Saviour; and he
thinks it a better way to judge of the sense of Scripture,
by some new Critical Pointings, or the Mistakes of some
old Copies, which may furnish them with various Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
than by the whole Series of the Discourse, and the
Traditional Interpretations of the Catholick Church; but I
shall not dispute this Matter now.</p>
               <p>He is certainly so far in the right, that the safest way
of answering all this, is to deny it all; and this is what
he means,<note place="margin">Page 58.</note> when he says, <hi>It were easie to make such an
Application of this Reflection, as would (perhaps) offend
many; but would (for all that) be most true.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I would only ask the <hi>Nominalists,</hi> how they like
this way of answering these difficulties, by criticizing
away all the Proofs of the Divinity and Incarnation of
Christ? This their pretended, but treacherous Friend, says
is the best and truest way, and he is a Man of Skill in
these Matters, and seems to be ashamed of any other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer


<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62123:44"/>
but this, which will unavoidably entangle him <hi>in
unaccountable and unintelligible Paradoxes.</hi> I verily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade
my self, that many of those, whom this Author
calls <hi>Nominals,</hi> abhor the Thoughts of this, and therefore
ought freely and openly to declare themselves in this
Matter, and not to suffer this bantering <hi>Socinian</hi> to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon the World in their Names.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But if this Answer don't please, our Author has ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for them, as good to the full:</hi> Let us, <hi>says he,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
the two Natures in Christ,<note place="margin">Page 59.</note> his Divinity and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
and rightly understand the Doctrine of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>This looks very promisingly; for to acknowledge
two Natures in Christ, and rightly to understand the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Incarnation, will rectifie all other Mistakes:
Let us then hear what he has to say of this.</hi> As to the
Incarnation, every body knows, that the most Learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters,
do not limit the Incarnation to the Person of the
<hi>Logos</hi> or Son: But they say, the whole Divinity, or as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> speaks, the fulness of the God-head (was incarnate, or)
dwelt in Christ.</p>
               <p>Who these most learned Interpreters are, I can't tell, unless
he means the <hi>Patripassion</hi> Hereticks, for all Catholick
Christians believe only the Incarnation of the Person of the
Son, and that neither the Father, nor the Holy Spirit were
incarnate in the Incarnation of Christ.</p>
               <p>But can we deny, that the <hi>whole Divinity, the fulness
of the God-head was incarnate, or dwelt in Christ?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
This is meer Fallacy: for the <hi>whole Divinity</hi> may
signifie either <hi>Essentially</hi> or <hi>Personally:</hi> The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>,
the One whole Divinity is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
the same perfect Divinity, subsisting whole and indivisible
in each of them, that they are all Three but One Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
or One God; and thus the <hi>whole Divinity</hi> was not


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62123:44"/>
incarnate in Christ: But then, as Christ in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is true and perfect God, so the <hi>fulness of the God-head</hi>
was incarnate in him; which is all St. <hi>Paul</hi> means.</p>
               <p>But will this Author in good earnest allow, that God
was incarnate in Christ, and that Christ was in One Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
both God and Man? Hold there a little: <hi>They do not
mean,</hi> he says, <hi>that God was so incarnate, or so dwells in
the Humanity of Christ<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> that he is not also every where
else:</hi> and whoever said he was? But is he so incarnate, as
to be truly God-Man in One Person, as the Soul and
Body are One Man? No! no! <hi>but only thus, Christ is
perfect God in respect of God in him; because, or as God is
perfect God in whatsoever Place or Person he is: God is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
God in the least Point of Space, no less than in never
so large a Portion of Extension:</hi> And this is all the Mystery
of the Incarnation: and thus God, the fulness of the
God-head, is as much incarnate in every Man in the
World, as he was in Christ; for God is every where, and
is perfect God, where-ever he is.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to unmask this Author, to let
the World see, who they are that make their Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of these Disputes: His <hi>very Expedients for Peace</hi>
shew how unwilling he is to have this Controversie si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenced,
which should teach all the sincere Lovers of the
Catholick Faith, who heartily believe in Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, Three Persons and One God, not to lose the
Faith in a Contention about Words, nor give a handle to
our Enemies, to represent our Faith as uncertain, various,
or heretical, when under different Forms of Speech, we
may, and I hope do mean the very same thing.</p>
               <p>The Learned Bishop of <hi>Worcester,</hi> whose Discourse in
Vindication of the <hi>Trinity</hi> I have just now received, has
undertaken this Charitable Work, and I hope his Great


<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62123:45"/>
Judgment, Learning, and Authority, may tend very much,
if not to make all Men speak and think alike, yet at least
to prevent their charging each other with such Heresies,
as they all abhor, and which their Words fairly and candid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expounded, are by no means chargeable with, as that
excellent Person thinks, neither Side is, and I wish with all
my Heart, he may be in the right: And this would soon qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
our Differences; for did it once appear, that we
all mean the same thing, the Dispute about Words would
die of it self, and our common Adversaries could no
longer conceal themselves under a Disguise, but must
take their old Name of <hi>Socinians</hi> again.</p>
