            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HE which hath his health and would
so continue, I wish him either to
forbeare or little to vse those thinges
which greatly digresse from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
or mediocritie in which man
is created. Our Phisitians do cal eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
thing hot or cold, in the respect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
nature of man. For if it be somewhat
hotter the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his nature, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it digresseth,
and they tearme it hot in the second de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
and in like maner to the third and
fourth, which because it doeth so far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
his constitution, by daily proofe
is founde to be vnto him flat poyson,
the like consideration on the contrarie
side haue they of colde things, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
you may gather how like alwaies
desireth like, and abhoreth the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
The thinges which are like, and
best agree with the nature of man, are
good holsome vsual meates &amp; drinks, a
dry fresh &amp; sweet ayre, moderat sleepe
<pb facs="tcp:16450:7"/>
and trauell or labor, which although it
were alotted vnto vs as punnishment
by GOD. Yet mercifully withall he
hath made it a meane to preserue our
health, the thinges which greatly disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
are wines, spice, salt meats, and al
very hot thinges, which thou shalt
know by tast, for either they bite like
Peper, fret like salt, or els shewe some
great manifest heat in the mouth. Also
on the other, side, all rawe fruits and
cold herbes, with diuers things of like
nature, much vse of Sawses deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by belly gods, whom God hath
punished as much by want of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
hauing meate at wil: as the poore
by want of meat hauing good apetite,
to liue in a thicke foggy ayre, to liue
idlely and to exceede in eating &amp; drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
sleeping watching or venery. I
would not haue any man to thincke
that I doe vtterly condeme al very hot
and cold things, but seing they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the nature of medecine then nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment:
I wish them to be verie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly
&amp; moderatly vsed, for hot things
are to be vsed when a mans bodie is
<pb facs="tcp:16450:7"/>
very cold, and cold thinges when his
bodie is ouer hot, but to vse either the
bodie being not distempered, is mere
madnes. Now further for asmuch as
all men are subiect vnto death, and our
bodies as yelding therunto, from time
to time alwaies gather coruption, to
preserue our health as much as may
be, vntill wee haue run that race which
