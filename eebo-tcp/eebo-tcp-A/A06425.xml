         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Archbiſhop of Canterbury his Grace,
Primate and Metropolitane of all

moſt Honorable Priuie
Councell, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost reuerend Father, it pleaſed
your Graces right woorthy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor,
to vouchſafe my vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woorthy
letters ſent him in
my trauailes, a gracious accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
The greatest trouble they
put him to, was to peruſe them;
ſo were the proofes he gaue of
his vertue, and the ſignes of his
loue towards me, the onely end
and vſe I euer had or made of them. Your Grace hath had the
happines, with the merit, to ſucceed him in his dignities: his
vertues were already yours in proprietie. Of his loue I may
ſay, as of your Graces; that I then did, as I now doe, rather
deſire to deſerue it, then deſeruing it, deſire to make bold vſe
of it. Loue that deſcends on vs from men of vertue and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie,
is it ſelfe both hope and reward, hire and paiment.
That to-boote which we call doing good, or a benefit, as it is
<pb facs="tcp:8135:3"/>
an effect that true loue matched with ability, will euen ſtriue
to produce, ſo is it then moſt welcome when it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſooner
imparted then expected. With this freedome of minde, and
dutie of reſpect, I preſent to your Grace this new apparelled
diſcourſe: It hath alreadie put on the habit of three ſeuerall
languages, and if my iudgement erre not, our Engliſh faſhion
will not ill become it. I met with it in my wandrings, and
brought it along with me, with an intent, for my priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
of that tongue it first ſpake in, to tranſlate it: that performed,
my determination to recommend it to your Graces
patronage, fell to be at this late dangerous time, when the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
(arch-enemie of trueth) and his execrable miniſters held
their generall counſaile how they might make but one fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worke
of our whole estate: but the conſideration of your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
most iust imployments in ſo weightie a buſineſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
me with a reuerend feare of their diſturbance, till I
weighed that euen this ſubiects handling might perhaps doe
good to ſome bad that had a head, if not a hand (for ſo great a
clock could not ſtrike without many wheeles) in ſo damnable a
proiect: ſince if they will needs out-ſtrip former ages, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
wealths, they may by this diſcourſe be drawen to practiſe
them vpon the common enemie of Chriſtendome, and not
vpon vs that acknowledge with them one Ieſus, one Bible,
one Baptiſme. Your Grace ſeeth the reaſons and ſcope of theſe

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F all we admire in theſe times there
is nothing comparable to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of their greatneſſe; if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
their beginning and meanes,
for they are by nation <hi>Tartarians,</hi>
ſprung from the moſt baſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> in former times
as vnknowen as vnworthy: If we
conſider their conditions, they bewray no feeling of ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or curteſie: If we regard the parts of their minde, where
ſhall we ſee ought more rude, and rough hewen then the
ſpirit of that people? What haue beene the ſouldiours
they haue had through whoſe valor they haue aduantaged
themſelues by ſo many memorable victories? No better
then ſlaues haled in their infancy from the breaſts and laps
of their mothers, children of tribute tythed euery yeere
from amongſt the miſerable Chriſtians ouer whom they
command and domineere. Yet we ſee that with theſe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
meanes they haue, in leſſe then three hundred yeeres,
conquered <hi>Aſia</hi> as far as <hi>Tigris,</hi> and the Gulfe of <hi>Perſia,</hi>
poſſeſt themſelues of <hi>Aegypt, Numidia,</hi> and all the red ſea.
More, hauing atchieued theſe glorious co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>queſts they haue
beene ſeene to march, as they ſay, with colours flying tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Europe, to ouerrun large countries, ſeaze themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:8135:4"/>
of kingdomes and moſt puiſſant Eſtates, finally to become
Monarches of Greece, and to haue caried the Empire of
Conſtantinople; whoſe neighbours haue not bene exempt
from the hauocke of their forces, ſo many armies ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen,
ſo many Princes ruined, ſo many rich cities and
townes ſackt and raſed. Their power, ouerflowing in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
is at this day the ſcourge of the Eaſt and the terror
of the Weſt: In ſum, they are feareful to the whole world.
But the greater is the aſtoniſhment, when we conſider, that
naked and vnarmed, they haue marched victorious ouer
the bellies of the moſt warlicke nations vnder the heauens,
the beſt prouided of forces and all munition neceſſary for
the wars, that ſuch a people as they vnskilled in nauigation
ſhould become maſters almoſt of all the ſeas. Many haue
gone about to ſearch out the cauſe of this thriuing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and I amongſt others haue for my part with no ſmall
diligence peruſed ſuch authors as haue written their hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
but when I haue narrowly ſifted all they haue ſaid of
that matter, I finde not this my honeſt appetite and curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
as I would contented; rather as one ill ſatisfied with
the diuerſity and negligence of their Hiſtoriographers, all
of them nothing neere approching the courſe and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the firſt and eſſentiall cauſe of this their ſo raiſed
fortunes, I haue ſought to pleaſe my ſelfe with ſetting down
as I haue, the many acts and obſeruations I haue thereof
collected, and which well deſerue to be publiſhed: not
that I ſo far forget my ſelfe as to thinke my ſelfe able to flie
a higher pitch then others whom I much honour and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme;
but becauſe I haue taken cleane an other way; with
this hope neuertheleſſe, that huely repreſenting and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
by order as I doe, the eſtabliſhment of this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
(anſwerable to what may be vnderſtoode there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
the apparence and truth of my diſcourſe wil ſomwhat
inlighten this ſubiect &amp; affoord me an honeſt excuſe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the defects which may be diſcouered in my opinion.
The argument then of this book conſiſteth of three points,
<pb facs="tcp:8135:4"/>
whereunto the order of the whole diſcourſe hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
In the firſt place I ſummarily handle the meanes
they haue practiſed for their aduancement and greatneſſe;
ſecondly with what cunning and deceit they maintaine
what they haue gotten: and laſtly how we may be able to
aſſaile them, and turne the chance of their victories and
powers. This my trauaile (moſt mighty Prince) taketh
his flight ſtraight to your Highneſſe to range it ſelfe vnder
the ſhelter of your protection, armed with the allowable
opinion, that your Aighneſſe as a generous Prince cannot
but take eſpeciall pleaſure to heare, ſee, &amp; waigh ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations.
To ſay the truth, the ordinary diſcourſes of
your Highneſſe table are no other but ſundry queſtions,
which it pleaſeth your Highneſſe vſually to propound to
all thoſe noble ſpirits that attend you; but aboue all, when
any one awaketh matter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning either Eſtate affaires, or
the atchieuement of deedes of armes; then is the time your
Highneſſe lendeth an attentiue eare to ſuch as diſcourſe
thereof, and to all mens admiration reſolueth the moſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
points of the matter in handling, wherein you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
a iudgment ſo far beyonde the vulgar and ſurpaſſing
your age, as we cannot but confeſſe that the propoſitions
you make are ſo many proofes and reſolutions which you
deliuer, and pleaſe to draw from out the capacity of your
ſeruants. Which conſidering often with my ſelfe, I finde
forthwith allaied in me the heat of the intention I had to
dedicate this my booke to your Highneſſe, but at the ſame
inſtant finding repreſented before mine eies; the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of your iudgment, together with your noble and gentle
diſpoſition, which knoweth how to accommodate your
greatneſſe to the honeſt deſignes of your ſubiects, ſuch
eſpecially as reuerence you like me, feare immediatly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth
and my deſire gathereth ſtrength, with aſſurance
that you wil be ſo gratious, as, though I be the leaſt of your
ſeruants, you will not ſpare to entertaine and honour this
my little labour with your iudgment: practiſing vpon me
<pb facs="tcp:8135:5"/>
what the Sunne (common father of generation) doth on
the earth, beſtowing his beames indifferently as well vpon
the low plants as high trees. It may pleaſe your highneſſe
then to vouchſafe to receiue this treatiſe with the like cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
as you would ought elſe eſpecially labored, in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation
of the diuine Maieſty (only <hi>Idea</hi> of all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
which as well excepteth the offering of the poore
widow, as the preſents of great Princes. Againe, it may
pleaſe your highnes not to thinke amiſſe ſo farforth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
the whole diſcourſe, that it may, ſupported by your
authority, paſſe with that credit as I wiſh among men, and
remaine free from the many cenſures of ſuch as take no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
delight then in reprehending other mens inuentions.
This aſſurance will make me lift my head higher then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
I would, for two cauſes: The one for the honour
and particular contentment I ſhall receiue hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
ought pleaſing to your Highneſſe, the other
for the teſtimony I ſhall heereby haue of the
participation of your fauour beyond
my merit and expectation: for

of conſequence: well may the will or appetite for a time tranſport
vs, but reaſon as ſoueraigne muſt in the end controle and checke
vs. In the compaſſe of my obſeruations, I haue ſeene diſcourſes
and ſtiles, otherwiſe hollow and vnſound, ſway euen the beſt
iudgements, not alone to allowance, but imitation. Whether this
were the infection of ignorance, that ſeaſing the most might
ſpread to the beſt; or the tyrannie of faſhion, which muſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
monſtrous, (if our ſelues will not ſeeme monſtrous) be
followed, I know not: one thing I am ſure of; time hath diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their weakneſſe, and trueth his concealed daughter is come
to light, when ſuch light owles liue (or to ſay better) die con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined

to perpetuall obſcuritie. This worke ſeemes to haue paſſed
the pikes of ſuch dangers; it hath for a ſufficient time vndergone
the view and cenſure of the beſt diſcerning nations of Europe: it
hath beene taught to ſpeake both their and the old Roman lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
if England ſhould not now affoord it kind entertainment,
I ſhould thinke it in an error (not to ſay of iudgement) of cuſtom,
as being not yet cleere of the imputation it carries of harſhneſſe
towards euen woorthy ſtrangers; but ſince I finde (as doe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
that ſuffer) that this diſcourteous fault is laid vpon the
common ſort, and the contrary extolled in the gentrie &amp; perſons
of more eminent quality, <hi>Vilia miretur vulgus:</hi> We will appeale
from their ignorance, to the more generous and better bredde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.
And to awake theſe, let me tell them, they ſhall
finde it a diſcourſe not faint or languiſhing, but ſuch as like a wel
breathed runner, gathers more ſtrength towards the end of the
race, then was bewraied in the beginning. Now to others which
ſhal perhaps obiect, that the ſcope hereof lying out of our diſtance,
asketh as ſmall heede, as it ſmally concerneth vs; I anſwere, that
then the gout or gangrene is not to be regarded becauſe the great

them become tender, effeminate, and altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
for the vſe of armes; ſo as failing of courage they will
prooue more eaſily the pray of our fortunate conqueſt.</p>
               <p>2 When <hi>Charles</hi> the eight of France with ſo ſmal an army
made his way thorough Italy,<note place="margin">1494. Guicciard. li. 1.</note> and that without vnſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſword or couching his lance, he became maſter of
the kingdome of Naples, and of the greater part of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeany;
the French Nobilitie reaſoning among themſelues
whence ſuch a baſe cowardlineſſe, as they had founde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Italians, ſhould proceed, imputed the cauſe
thereof to the ſtudie of learning, as that which ſofteneth
the courage, and is not fit for ought but to make a man
fearefull, vnapt, and of a weake reſolution for the wars.</p>
               <p>3 Heeretofore and at this day, the Turkes haue and doe
eſteeme the Chriſtians of little valour in martiall affaires,
becauſ of the varietie of Arts whereunto they vſually ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
themſelues; and though a man be ſo ſmally durable
as he cannot attaine to perfection in diuers ſciences, nor ſo
inable himſelfe to the attention of ſundry matters as hee
may game the maſtery for which he ſtriueth; yet all men
will buſie themſelues about knowledge, and intermeddle
with all Arts and practiſes, not heeding that in ſtead of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
themſelues, they recoile from that perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
which is requiſite for them, and ſo remaine vnfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
or but weakely grounded in one onely profeſſion.</p>
               <p>4 On the contrarie, the Turkes faſhion their whole deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
to the war, and bend all their thoughts and ſtudies
to the exerciſe of armes, reiecting all other courſes, and
pleaſing themſelues onely in what may ſtand them in ſtead
for that profeſſion.</p>
               <p>5 There is nothing more true (and we finde it in hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries)
then that the Romanes were moſt excellent Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
but eſpecially before they opened their gates to Arts
and Sciences preſented them by the Greeks, and that they
gaue themſelues ouer to the pleaſures of the Eaſt. Then
were they at the beſt for true cariage of marſhall affaires
when their Conſuls ſcorned not to hold the plough; when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8135:9"/>
Phyſicians, Surgeons, &amp; men of ſuch like profeſſion were
in no credit amongſt them. And to ſay the truth, we finde
that if afterward they did atchieue any worthy enterpriſe, it
was not by meanes of any valour which was remaining with
them, but by the reputation &amp; ſtrength they had formerly
gotten. For proofe heereof we may plainly perceiue that
as ſoone as they had giuen entertainement to forraine ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
made tender by ſtudy, they receiued notable and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable
ouerthrowes, as well at the hands of <hi>Iugurtha,
Mithridates,</hi> the <hi>Cimbrians, Numantins, Spartans,</hi> the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi>
as of others.</p>
               <p>6 For confirmation whereof we obſerue in ancient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
that the moſt warlike people, &amp; withal ſuch as haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the memorableſt acts, haue beene the moſt groſſe,
rude and inured to paine and hardneſſe, far from all ciuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
free from ſuch delicacy and wantonneſſe as is corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſtept in amongſt vs; ſuch as had no learning or taſte of
any knowledge or action which might allay or neuer ſo litle
ſhake their couragious reſolutions and warlike deſſignes.
Of this compoſition were long ſince and are at this daie
the <hi>Scythians,</hi> who ſometimes made their worthy armes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
as far as the moſt remote parts of the Eaſt, as far as
the <hi>Danow</hi> and the bankes of <hi>Nilus.</hi> It is not long ſince
that they,<note place="margin">Zingis.</note> conducted by <hi>Quingus</hi> their King, ouerran all

all with miſery and deſolation. The memory of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

they giue (as a man may ſay) the law to the mightieſt
Princes that ſeeke their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>7 Now the Turks aboue all nations haue euer profeſt to
follow this courſe of life ſo barbarous and rude, and euen
at this day they contemne all knowledge and profeſſion of
whatſoeuer arte, be it neuer ſo noble or induſtrious; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt they abhor painting and ingrauing, neither
make they any account of architecture: and in very deede
we ſee that they haue euer held it an eſpeciall offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, to ingraue or paint him. As for learning they
recken it as meere foolery: In a word, there are none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them ſo ſlenderly eſteemed as men learned and
ſeene in any kinde of knowledge. In their garments they
affect not ſtuffes wrought, imbroidered or curiouſly cut
and faſhioned, but ſuch as are whole and laſting; laces,
fringes and other ornaments are by them reiected: beaten
and maſſie gold is only in requeſt amongſt them. In the
wars they ſeeke rather to appeere fearce and terrible, then
gallantly ſet forth and apparelled: their whole delight is ſet
vpon war and armes; inſomuch as it is hard to finde any one
of them who will not manifeſt by his faſhion of liuing that
he is rather borne for the wars then ought elſe: ſo as when
there is any leuying of Souldiours, ſuch as are left at home
hold themſelues highly iniured; ſo honorably doe they
eſteeme of the life of a ſouldier. Whence it proceedeth,
that they are ſo feared in all their attempts, either for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeging,
battering, or forcing of places of greateſt ſtrength;
for skirmiſhing on foote or on horſebacke, in ſet battailes
by ſea or by land, or for fortifying and defending.</p>
               <p>8 Whereof they gaue ſufficient proofe when hauing
gotten Ottranto they valiantly made it good againſt the
forces of all Italy;<note place="margin">1480.</note> euen till the death of their maſter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
the 2.<note place="margin">1482.</note> leauing behinde them, trenches, bulwarkes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:8135:10"/>
ramparts and all other ſorts of fortifications, ſo well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued
and diſpoſed, as they haue ſerued ſince for patterns

               <p>9 Such is their laborious vertue in the wars, as there is
no place ſo ſtrong, or enterpriſe ſo difficult which will not
prooue eaſie at the enforcing of their powers.</p>
               <p>10 Returning now to that I ſaid concerning knowledge:
I expect that ſome one ſhould ſay: And what I praie, is
learning a let to military vertue, or a meanes to hinder a
man from becomming a perfect ſouldier? ſurely no: I am
of a contrary opinion, and I ground it in part vpon the
experience of ſuch Captaines as I will heere reckon.
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great and <hi>Caeſar</hi> who were of the principall
moſt aduenturous, and politicke Maſters of the wars were
moſt excellently ſeene in all ſorts of knowledge; for my
owne part I hold it very difficult for any without the aide
of Hiſtorie or the Mathematiques, to deſerue the name of
a great Captaine and ſage conductor of armies:</p>
               <p>11 Since Hiſtorie by the variety of examples both of
good and bad ſucceſſe furniſheth a man with heedfulneſſe
and diſcretion, with reſolution and aduice in all occurrents,
and makes him more conſiderate in what he vndertaketh;
like as the Mathematikes refine his knowledge and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as well in engines of war as in fortifying.</p>
               <p>12 In concluſion, it is not to be denied but that learning
is moſt proper to mould and perfectly faſhion a heart and
courage borne and diſpoſed to armes: for this cauſe they
would in old time, that <hi>Pallas</hi> armed ſhould ſignifie vnto
vs the marrying of letters with armes. Now to come againe
to the Turkes rudeneſſe, we ſhall finde (examining ſome of
their Princes) that ſomewhat muſt be abated. Let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
what were <hi>Mahomet</hi> the 2. and <hi>Selim</hi> and <hi>Soliman</hi> his
ſonnes (the moſt valiant Princes of the race of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>)
and we ſhall ſee that they delighted in reading Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories,
and in ſtudying the Mathematikes: ſo as though
nature diſpoſe a man to hardineſſe and magnanimitie, it is
ſure that if he be wholy vnfurniſhed of artes and learning,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8135:11"/>
he will be of a diſpoſition doubtfull, vnaſſured, vnreſolued
and without any true ſtomacke or valour; parts eſpecially
required in a Souldier. This hath beene ſeene in thoſe of
the <hi>Ottomans</hi> which wanted the vertues of the three aboue
named; and amongſt others <hi>Baiazet</hi> the ſecond and <hi>Corcas</hi>
his ſonne can witneſſe it. Theſe indeed had in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the knowledge of good letters, but theſe performed
no valiant act, becauſe they had not hearts and courages
borne to the wars.</p>
               <p>13 Whence it followeth that the ſtudy of learning auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
much to the forming of a wiſe and diſcreet Captaine,
and to helpe him to attaine to the perfection worthy his
name; nature withall diſpoſing him to valour and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſitie.</p>
               <p>As for the priuat Souldier I hold that he needes not
know more then to obey it, not being neceſſary he ſhould
be inſtructed in ſo excellent an vnderſtanding of matters
as the Commander, conſidering that humaine Sciences and
the liberall arts in an vnſetled minde make it embrace ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
wantonneſſe and eaſe in ſtead of trauell; make vs loue
quietneſſe; feare death, flie hunger and thirſt, with other
paines and periles of the wars: In ſum, they imprint in a
man rather a deſire to husband his life then to lauiſh it for
the glory and good of his country, and for his particular
honour: which is more dangerous in a ſouldier then in a
man of any other profeſſion: for this reaſon ſuch an one
neede know no more then to obey, goe well armed, and
valiantly defend himſelfe againſt his enemy.</p>

               <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a doubt often diſputed, and not yet
reſolued, whether it be better to aſſaile
the enemy at his own home, or to attend
till he aſſaile vs: The Lord of <hi>Langei,
Machiauell,</hi> and others of our times
haue diſcourſed heereof to the full.</p>
               <p>2 For my part I am of opinion (as alſo the worthieſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
haue beene) that it is alwaies better to aſſaile, then
ſtay till we be aſſailed: <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Hannibal, Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio,
Caeſar,</hi> and many other <hi>Romans</hi> ſerue to approue it; and
all theſe would haue laughed at ſuch as ſhould haue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
counſelled them.</p>
               <p>3 Yet ſome there are in our times which haue endeuored
to proue the contrarie by demonſtrations ſubtill enough
(but vnſound) and to this very purpoſe of the Turke, to
wit, that it were better to attend him then to ſeeke him out
vpon his owne dunghill: Theſe are counſailes more curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then well grounded, whereof conſequently enſue few
effects of moment: we may couple ſuch men with thoſe
vaunting Ingenours or Artiſts, who diſcourſing vpon ſome
worke of their inuention promiſe of it wondrous effects,
and ſet foorth ſome ſimple module which ſerueth but for
demonſtration only; but when it commeth (as they ſay)
to the puſh, and that they muſt put their inſtrument to his
true triall and vſe, then is it that they are far to ſeeke, and
that they confeſſe the difference betweene an eſſentiall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8135:12"/>
and a ſuperficiall flouriſh, ſuch as their firſt module
afforded. Iuſt in this manner theſe contemplatiue ſtate-Philoſophers
will attend the Turke at their owne home,
whom they dare ſcarce looke in the face neither in nor out
of his country.</p>
               <p>4 It is moſt certaine that hee which aſſaileth hath alwaies
more reſolution and courage then he that attendeth. For
he hath already formed his determination and prouiſion
when the other goeth by heereſaie and likelihoods: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
in aſſailing, the war is vndertaken with more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and commodity then otherwiſe it would be; and he
which mindeth to force a country or prouince may make
his vſe of all ſuch aduantages and commodities as he fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
may ſerue his turne in the country he intendeth to
conquer. As among others, if he haue ſet on foote ſome
practiſe, or hatched ſome treaſon in the minds of two or
three, ſuch of the ſubiects of the prince he aſſaileth as he
knoweth offended or malecontent. Or if he haue plotted
ſome matter of purpoſe for an vniuerſall rebellion. All
which incountring with the deſſignes of the ſuppoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour,
he makes them ſerue his turne with more aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in going to ſeeke out the enemy; then he ſhould doe
in ſtaying for him at his owne home. By theſe meanes
<hi>Charles</hi> the eight King of <hi>France</hi> found the way open to the
conqueſt of <hi>Naples;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1494.</note> and <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. poſſeſt himſelfe of

               </p>
               <p>5 But of all this we may collect a more ſure proofe of my
propoſition then when the enemy is at our doores, and
that the aſtoniſhment ſurpriſeth vs, ouerthroweth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeth
all counſaile and courage; at ſuch a time vnex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
diſorders hem vs in on euery ſide; neceſſitie
preſſeth vs; all things become ſuſpected and difficult, ſo
as moſt commonly we know not to what Saint to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
vs; nor what courſe were beſt to be taken; for ſince
we muſt haue an eie, miſdoubt, make prouiſions in ſundry
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8135:12"/>
places, beſtowe garriſons where moſt need requireth; we
ſhall finde that applying remedies on the one ſide our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
will grow deſperate on the other. Moreouer by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing
garriſons in this ſort, it muſt needs follow that
we ſo much the more weaken the body of our armie, and
that through this conſtraint we quit the field to the more
ſtrong; which diſaduantage commonly drawes with it
the ruine of our whole eſtate.</p>
               <p>If contrariwiſe we will preſerue all our forces in one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
we leaue to the aſſailer many paſſages and places where
he may ſet downe and fortifie himſelfe there to hold vs
play and traine vs on at his pleaſure; but if it ſhould ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
that the aſſailer were encountred by him which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with equall force, with as braue a countenance, and
like courage, the retraict and defence reſt at his election,
ſo he be a Captaine wiſe, and aduiſed, ſuch as was <hi>Solyman</hi>
when he marched into Hungarie, and when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<hi>Charles</hi> the 5. went couragiouſly to meet him.</p>
               <p>6 And becauſe the <hi>Diſaſtrous</hi> chance of war may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
light vpon the aſſailer be he neuer ſo warie and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant;
it is to be preſuppoſed (that being granted) that he
will ſell his skin at ſo deare a rate, as the forces of the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſhall remaine thereby ſo diſordred, as he will not be
able to offend the vanquiſhed, or diſturbe his affaires,
notwithſtanding that his countrey be farre diſtant from
the countrey aſſailed: this may be ſeene by the example of
the ouerthrow the French receiued, and the taking of their
King priſoner before <hi>Pauye</hi> inſomuch as that loſſe (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that of their Prince) did not afford ought to the
victorious whereby he might aduantage himſelfe vpon
the kingdome of France.<note place="margin">1524.</note> Alſo it is much more eaſie to ſet
a foote againe an armie diſcomfited, abroad then at home;
becauſe if fortune haue ſhewed her ſelfe aduerſe and our foe
at our home, then is the time that ſuch as are malecontents
and mutinous lift vp their heades, and that our people
ſtand amazed and for the moſt part vntractable. Then
muſt we trauaile amaine to put our men in hart, then muſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8135:13"/>
we make much of thoſe few good men, the remaines of a
battell to beſtowe in our Townes and truſt them with the
gouernment thereof. On the other ſide if theſe loſſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide
vs far from our home and in another country, the feare
and the ſtoniſhment will be the leſſe amongſt our ſubiects,
and they more pliable and forward to ſuccour vs, were it
but to keepe the danger aloofe from themſelues.</p>
               <p>7 Me thinkes <hi>Machiauel</hi> much abuſeth himſelfe when he
ſo opiniatiuely mainteineth,<note place="margin">Mac. diſput. lib. 2. c. 12.</note> that if the Romans had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
out of Italy the blowes <hi>Hannibal</hi> gaue them by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow
of * three armies,<note place="margin">At the riuer of Trebia, where Sempronius was ſlaine, at the lake of Thraſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menus where Flaminius was ouercome, and at Cannas where Terentius Varro and L. Paulus loſt the field.</note> that they had neuer beene able
more to haue held vp their head or re-eſtabliſhed their
affaires as they did: <hi>Machiauel</hi> laieth this ground; That
they had neuer found meanes againe to ſet a foote ſo ſoone
as they did the reſidue of their forces, had it beene out of
<hi>Italy.</hi> Marke I praie how he erreth; for it is well knowen
that the ouerthrowes they had in their owne country made
them loſe, beſides their ſouldiours, many good townes,
and bred reuolt in their <hi>Colonies</hi> which followed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
of the victorious, with diuers other accidents that
ſhooke their eſtate; all, which had not ſucceeded with ſuch
diſaſter if the loſſe had befell them far from <hi>Italy:</hi> for in
this caſe both heart and meanes had ſerued them more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
then they did, to aſſemble new forces and as
great as they had loſt.<note place="margin">Maharbals ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, was, Vince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſeu Hanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal, ſed victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria vti neſcis. Liu. Dec. 3. l. 2.</note> It is alſo certaine that if <hi>Hannibal</hi>
had knowen how to make good vſe of his victory the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
had beene vtterly ouerthrowen. It muſt needes be,
that their meanes and power were very great, and that God
had an eſpeciall hand in their affaires, ſeeing that in ſuch
diſorder they ſhould recouer themſelues; &amp; that with ſuch
corage, as they refuſed to ſerue their turns with thoſe which
had by flight eſcaped from their ouerthrows, neither made
they any account of redeeming thoſe which were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
nay rather in ſtead of doing this they depriued ſome
of them of all honour and confined others into <hi>Sicily.</hi> It
ſeemeth to me that theſe reaſons may ſerue to confute thoſe
of <hi>Machiauel,</hi> and that it is high time we returne to that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8135:13"/>
principall point concerning the fortune of the Turke.</p>
               <p>8 We will ſay then that the faint-hearted ſlackneſſe of the
Chriſtians hath made way to the Turke for the inlarging
of his limits, ſo as they abut almoſt of all ſides vpon <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and hath beene a meanes that he can now not only at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the enemie (as <hi>Machiauel</hi> ſaith) but goe to rowſe
him at his owne home. It is the courſe he hath obſerued
and taken; to ruine his neighbours round about him, and
increaſe his power, which he hath ſo doone as he hath
cleane bereaued vs of all ſtomacke to aſſaile him, yea or
once to dare to attempt it. For though there be Princes
enow which hold it neceſſary for the good of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
to ſet vpon him at his home, yet to this day we ſee
none that will begin to ſtrike the firſt ſtroake, or ſet firſt
hand to the breaking of this ice.</p>
               <p>9 But if euer God gaue vs the courage vertuouſly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
this enterpriſe in reuenge of the oppreſſion and
wrongs Chriſtendome hath endured at his hands; we muſt
not thinke to vndertake it by other meanes then thoſe he
hath himſelfe put in practiſe againſt vs, &amp; that is to ſeeke
him out at his owne home and nobly to embrace the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes
himſelfe hath obſerued; which doing, and hauing
God to guide, we ſhall doubtleſſe obtaine thoſe victories
of him which he hath had of vs. Admit he haue beene for a
time our Schoole-maſter, and that we haue learned of him
to our coſt, it is now high time that wee ſhew how we
haue profited by his inſtructions, and that we know how
to put them in practiſe and pay the intereſts of our da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages.</p>
               <p>10 Now to make it appeere that it is not a matter of that
difficultie and danger that ſome imagine, let vs note theſe
examples which are in a maner familiar vnto vs. Had not
<hi>Andrew Dorea</hi> the courage with a ſmall number of ſhips to
enter into Greece where he got <hi>Patras</hi> and <hi>Coron?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1532.</note> 
                  <hi>Don
Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> did he not affoord a notable proofe hereof
in the yeare 1571. when being Generall of the league, he
ſought the enemie out in the inmoſt parts of the <hi>Leuant</hi>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:8135:14"/>
where he gaue him battaile with that courage, that though
he were inrferior to him in men &amp; galleies, yet failed he not
(aſsiſted by God) to ouerthrow the moſt puiſſant &amp; great
armie that the <hi>Ottomans</hi> euer ſet foorth by ſea againſt the
Chriſtians: There is nothing the Turke ſo much feareth,
as to be ſet vpon by the Chriſtians, both becauſe he knowes
they haue valor in them, as alſo for the iealouſie he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth
of the great number of them vnder his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
All which would without queſtion riſe in armes if
they might but once ſee the Chriſtians Coulours flying,
and ſo accompanied, as that they might to ſome purpoſe
make head againſt the <hi>Ottamans.</hi>

1 <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Rinces generally ſtriue by all meanes
to preſerue not onely their own eſtates,
but ſuch prouinces alſo as they haue
conquered; obſeruing what the time,
the humour of the people, and their
meanes will permit. But becauſe each
one takes a different courſe, and of this difference hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
both good and euill, I iudge it neceſſarie to ſay ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
thereof by way of diſcourſe: I will ſpare to meddle
with the forme each one keepeth in the politicke gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his dominions or principalities; and will draw my
ſelfe within compaſſe of handling, in three ſeuerall points,
all that may be ſaid or alleaged vpon this ſubiect. Firſt
then we will ſpeake of Colonies, next of Fortreſſes, and
laſt of Armies, entertained for the defence of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
               <p>2 Colonies haue beene one of the meanes which the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
haue moſt ordinarily obſerued; and at this day they
are practiſed to mainteine a ſubdued people vnder the
obedience of a new ſoueraigntie. Such then as allowed of
this manner of preſeruing Eſtates, by way of Colonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
the lands of thoſe they had conquered vpon their
naturall ſubiects, equally diſtributing them according to
their merits; ſuppoſing that in ſo doing, they ſhould ſowe
the countrey conquered with new men, which might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue
themſelues with a like deuotion and dutifull obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
towards them, as vaſſals performe toward their
Soueraigne.</p>
               <p>3 The Grecians vſed them firſt; and then the Romanes:
but this manner of aſſurance is not ſo commendable, as
many may ſuppoſe, inſomuch as it draweth after it theſe
two dangerous conſequents. The firſt is, that when a
Prince depriueth ſuch of their goods as are naturall ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
thereof, to beſtow them vpon his owne ſubiects, it
winneth him and his immortall hatred, accompanied with
an euerlaſting thirſt of reuenge, and of regaining their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:8135:15"/>
for though ſuch as are ſo deſpoiled of their goods
be but few in number in regard of the Colony, yet it is to
be imagined that they haue many kinsfolkes and friends
intereſſed in their miſeries, and that there need but three
or foure men of reſolution to draw all the reſt to a mutinie
and reuolt. If this be held a difficult matter, yet is it a thing
naturall to become wiſe by anothers miſhaps, and to feare
and be prouident leſt we fall into the like inconuenience
as our neighbours. The apprehenſion of which calamitie
makes vs ofttimes conceiue worſe of the euill then it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth,
eſpecially when the actions of the conquering
prince are grounded rather vpon force then reaſon, as or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
they are.</p>
               <p>4 Moſt commonly the rebellions and inſurrections of
people and cities, happen not ſo much for the outrage
done to a whole communaltie, as for the iniuries particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
receiued by ſome of thoſe which haue reuolted: but

of the fact entred ſo far into the harts of al the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of the country, as euery one took the wrong to be his,
and hauing thereupon taken armes to aide the father in
his reuenge, it grew to a worſe matter; for hereby they gaue
the Moores entrance into the Eſtate who put to death their
King: and were themſelues beholders of the ſpoile of
their country by perſecuting vengeance vpon ſo infamous
an act performed by the diſordinat luſt of him who ought
to haue reproued and chaſtiſed it in others.</p>
               <p>5 The other diſcommodity which they meete who will
ſettle the eſtabliſhment of their fortunes vpon the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Colonies is, that in ſucceſſion of time thoſe men ſo
remoued from their owne country into another newly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued,
faſhion themſelues vnto the climat, humors, and

And hauing thither tranſported their goods and begotten
children, they thenceforth make more reckoning of the
country whither they are come as <hi>Colonies,</hi> then of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
country whence they were diſplaced: like trees which
planted in an other ſoile change much both of their nature
and taſte. This the more eaſily happeneth to Colonies by
how much the more remote they are from their natiue
place of abode. For proofe, finde we not that euen the

               <p>6 The Portugals obſeruing theſe inconueniences haue
to aſſure the Indies, practiſed a manner of <hi>Colonies</hi> much
more ſure, tolerable, and leſſe enuied; which is thus:
They plant their <hi>Colonies</hi> not all at once, but few at a time
by <hi>Carauans</hi> or companies according as neede requireth,
to inhabite the countries by them newly diſcouered; yet
not throughly to people them, but after as they ſhall ſee
they thriue, and ſo accordingly they by little and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſh
the Colonie. <hi>Goa</hi> is the beſt prouided of all they
haue eſtabliſhed, and there they contract alliances with the
ancient inhabitants, and take and giue their daughters in
mariages: by this meanes (which is as I haue ſaid the more
plauſible) they liue free from violence, aſſured of the good
wils of the firſt inhabitants who inrich themſelues greatly
by their trafficke and commodities. In this manner they
multiply and are ſcarcely perceiued how, growing to ſuch
a multitude of people as they ſerue to inlarge and eſtabliſh
the name and gouernment of the Portugals. From yeare
to yeare they ad to this increaſe which ſerueth them inſtead
of a fortreſſe amongſt ſuch as they ſubdue, and in ſuch
prouinces as they will people and accuſtome to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions
and rule.</p>
               <p>7 Time and experience make it plainly appeare, that
theſe formes of Colonies are more tollerable and ſure then
any heeretofore practiſed, for in theſe the naturall inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
are ſo farre from being thruſt out of their houſes, as
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8135:16"/>
on the contrarie, they are therein maintained and more
confirmed in the peaceable inoying o<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their goods. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
the vnion and commixture of blood one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſoftning their naturall roughneſſe, retaineth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth
the affection as well of the auncient inhabitants,
as of thoſe of the Colony. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> do the like in the
Weſt Indies that which I finde moſt notable heerein, is,
that the one and the other reſt not ſatisfied onely with
eſtabliſhing Colonies, but further they conuert and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
the Indians in the Chriſtian faith, to Gods glorie
and theirs: It is that which the king of Spaine performeth
and continueth by meanes of ſuch religious orders as he
hath planted among them: for not being able to ſtore
ſo many and ſo large countries as thoſe are with naturall
Spaniards and Portugals, they by this conuerſion and
Baptiſme, make thoſe people become Portugals and
Spaniards.</p>
               <p>8 Hauing diſcourſed of the forme of Colonies, and how
the conquering Prince may profit himſelfe by them, it is
now time that we come to the ſecond thing which may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
aſſurance to an eſtate. The meanes are many, but the
Chriſtians moſt vſually make choiſe of fortifications, as
ſeeming to them moſt ſtrong bridles to raine in and curbe
both the auncient and newly ſubdued prouinces. There
they appoint their Magazins for munition and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion
for the wars; there they beſtow gariſons of ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for their defence; ſome places they fortifie vpon the
frontiers, where they conſtitute for Gouernors and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
creatures of their owne faſhioning, the better to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
all vnder the obedience of the victorious.</p>
               <p>9 Yet is it that which <hi>Machiauell</hi> reproueth and reiect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
as vnprofitable:<note place="margin">Diſ. l. 2. c. 24.</note> but becauſe they are reaſons or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
ſo weake as that like Spyders cobwebs, they are eaſily
broken, I will not ſpend time farther to confute them;
onely I will ſay thus much, that <hi>Alfonſo</hi> king of Naples, a
moſt iudicious prince, whoſe authoritie ſhould carrie cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
alwaies eſteemed this practiſe of fortification moſt
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:8135:16"/>
neceſſarie and profitable, eſpecially in a countrey newly
conquered, and not to leaue it open and conſequently
ſubiect to iniurie and reuolt. The proceedings in this
kinde, of <hi>Francis Sforce</hi> duke of Milan, of the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> the 5. and of ſo many other Princes and Captaines
which haue woone reputation and renowne amongſt men,
are ſuch as who well conſidereth them will laugh at the
opinion of <hi>Machiauel.</hi> Without ſeeking any further, haue
we not the French for example? who made no account
of erecting cittadels in the Ile of Sicily: but after they had
conquered it,<note place="margin">1281. 13. Ap.</note> they aſſoone loſt it not without a moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable
ſlaughter executed on them by the inhabitants;
but contrariwiſe deriuing their wiſdome from their owne
miſerie, after they once tooke in hand to make fortreſſes in
ſundry places of Italy, there was no meanes but by peace
to diſlodge them.<note place="margin">1516.</note> The Mamelucks who were in the ſame
error of not truſting to Fortreſſes, found themſelues in
leſſe then two daies depriued by <hi>Selim</hi> of the moſt part of
their liues, eſtate, and powers. The Spaniard imbracing
the indifferency of this opinion, and deſirous to gratifie
the Flemings whom they thought to appeaſe by this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
returned into their hands the ſtrong holdes of
their Prouinces: which they had no ſooner done, but they
were neere-hand expelled the Low-countries.</p>
               <p>10 And though all theſe examples are but too ſufficient
to confute the opinion of <hi>Machiauel,</hi> yet will I bring him
once more vpon the ſtage, and ſift him a little better: See
heere the ſubſtance of what he ſaith: Either thou art able
(ſaith he) to bring ſufficient ſtore of men into the field (in
which caſe fortreſſes are not any waies neceſſarie) or thou
haſt not meanes to leauie ſuch forces as are requiſite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
and warrant thy eſtate, and then they are vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Marke, I praie, the wrong courſe he taketh, walking
as he doth in extreames, without keeping the meane, moſt
neceſſarie in theſe propoſitions: to ſay the truth, he is
much miſtaken; ſince this matter as others, ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
by the portions and qualities thereof, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8135:17"/>
and more eaſily to vnderſtand it. In my opinion then
(which I deliuer not to exclude others) we muſt ſay thus:
Either a Prince hath meanes to leuie men out of hand by
an ordinarie continuance of armes, or elſe he muſt haue
time to doe it, be it either by leuying a ſufficient number
of his ſubiects trained vp to armes, and by the aſſiſtance of
friends and aſſociats, or of neighbours, which in regard of
their particular intereſt, will willingly ioyne with him,
that he may protect them from the ſame iniurie he may
himſelfe receiue. In theſe two firſt caſes, Fortreſſes would
prooue more profitable then neceſſarie: or elſe a Prince is
of that power as he is able at once to aſſemble ſo manie
men as he will keepe or winne the field from the enemie,
or will be able, at leaſt, commodiouſly to ſuccour the place
beſieged. In theſe two reſpects, Cittadels are neceſſarie
though not much profitable, becauſe they by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
defence, ſtoppe and intertaine the enemie, affoord
by ſuch temporiſing, meanes and leaſure to order matters;
for (as the Venetians ſay) <hi>Chi ha tempo, ha vita,</hi> who hath
time, hath life.</p>
               <p>11 The third meanes for a Prince to preſerue his eſtate,
is that which thoſe allow of, who not truſting to Fortreſſes,
and making no account of Colonies, doe ordinarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſtrong companies of horſe and foote, and in ſuch
numbers, as they may alwaies containe their ſubiects in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
obedience, hinder rebellions, and which moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth,
repell, and oppoſe the enemy, and as occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
viſit him at his owne home. In time paſſed the
<hi>Mamelucks</hi> practiſed this forme of gouernment;<note place="margin">Aemil. lib. 3. Tuicae.</note> and the
<hi>Turkes</hi> at this day obſerue it in all points. The <hi>Viſconti</hi>
ſometime Lords of <hi>Milan,</hi> vſed this forme of preſeruing
their eſtates, and amongſt others <hi>Azzo-Viſconti</hi> ordinarily
gaue intertainment (yea euen in time of peace) to 22000.
horſe, and they did him no ſmall ſeruice.</p>
               <p>12 A man may yet put one doubt more of this matter,
the reſolution whereof ſhall fit very well for the courſe and
concluding of the diſcourſe. That is, which is beſt either
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8135:17"/>
to erect <hi>Cittadels</hi> or alwaies to maintaine a great army.
Experience (our common <hi>Miſtres</hi>) teacheth vs that for
the conſeruation of great Princes eſtate ſortreſſes are the
beſt; becauſe they doe not ſo much incumber nor diſlike
the ſubiect as doth an army, whoſe troupes diſperſed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
parts of the country waſte and diſorder all: on the
other ſide ſouldiours ſhut vp in a fortreſſe are not ſo inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and licentious as thoſe commonly are which keepe
the field, yea and that oft-times with more hauocke then
if the enemy himſelfe had ranſaked and ouerrun it. The
liberty which armies diſperſed thorowout an eſtate chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and aſſume to themſelues, is ſuch as makes them
forget all policy and military diſcipline: the example of
the <hi>Milanois</hi> heerein will not be beſide the purpoſe. They
neuer complained of the <hi>Garriſon</hi> of the Caſtle,<note place="margin">1765.</note> but when it
came to that that <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. would haue lodged his
horſe within the towne they preſently reuolted; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
enſued the loſſe of the eſtate. What was it that wrought
the reuolt of the Flemings? was it not the obſtinate muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of only 1500. Spaniards, who crying after their paie
ouerran and made ſpoile of all the country? The ſelfe ſame
Spaniſh nation diſquieted the Eſtate of <hi>Milan</hi> vnder the
<hi>Marques</hi> of <hi>Guaſto</hi> and the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> vnder <hi>Ferdinand
Gonzaga.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1526. Paul. Iou. lib. 7. de Vita vir. ill.</note> The Sorians and the Egyptians no ſooner ſaw <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lims</hi>
ſtandards diſplaced but they rebelled againſt the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melucks,</hi>
whoſe armies had maruellouſly oppreſſed them,
they hauing beene conſtrained to maintaine them at their
owne charges.</p>
               <p>13 Whereto I know may be replied, that the <hi>Turke</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
peaceably holdeth his eſtate after the ſame
manner we ſpeake of, his forces being euermore on foote
and in a readineſſe: it is true, and ſo is it that to cleere
this, two principall reaſons may be alledged. The one
that he hath depriued ſuch his ſubiects as are Chriſtians
and of a different law, of all vſe of armes; and that he hath
brought them to this paſſe that they cannot vant to hold
any thing in propriety: which was not practiſed towards
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8135:18"/>
the aboue mentioned; moreouer all aſſemblies vpon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
cauſe are expreſly forbidden them: he keeps them
vnder and makes no more reckning of them then of ſheepe
pend vp in a fould vſing them like brute beaſts, not once
vouchſafing to imploy them in the wars. The other reaſon
is that they haue no power of themſelues to oppoſe the
<hi>Turkes</hi> ſo mighty forces; and (which is worſt of all) they
neuer haue had any forraine ſuccour to incourage them to
ſuch an enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>14 I will forbeare to diue any deeper into this ſubiect;
me thinkes we may ſee ſufficiently by this how much more
ſupportable are <hi>Cittadels,</hi> then armies ordinarily intertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
But if we ſpeake of conquering, I allow that armies
are more to be preferred before fortreſſes, conſidering that
we thereby inioy meanes to embrace all occaſions offered,
and at an inſtant to execute both the will and deſigne of a
Prince ſo prouided.</p>
               <p>15. To ſay the truth it is that which the <hi>Ottamans</hi> haue
practiſed, to aduance their Empire to ſuch greatneſſe as at
this day we ſee it; it is that which hath heaped on them
the honors of ſo many victories, and which hath endowed
them with authoritie, reputation and meanes. They haue
alwaies had (as they yet haue) their armies in a readineſſe,
and haue fought with their neighbours in a manner with
as much aduantage as a man armed againſt one that is
naked.</p>
               <p>16 Some I know will maruell how ſuch a number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſo armed, can containe themſelues from reuolting. I
am of opinion, that if they were not ordinarily imploied as
they are, in attempts of warre, that in the end their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
growen ranke with quiet, would eaſily be drawen to
rebellion or mutinies; which the ſouldiers of <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great can witneſſe, for whileſt the enemy kept them in
doings, who were then they more hardy and valerous? but
after their victories, who more inſolent and vnſufferable?
The Roman armies, how fortunate were they whileſt they
had continuall warre, atchieuing all their interpriſes in a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8135:18"/>
manner as they could wiſh? but after their conqueſt they
became ſo turbulent and vnquiet, as they aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
the authoritie of creating Emperors, and for the
moſt part ſo licentiouſly, as euery armie made his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
choiſe, ſo as there was no remedie but to trie by fight
who ſhould carie it; which occaſioned the ouerthrow of
the ſtate. The French, haue they not euermore faithfully
ſerued their king againſt ſtrangers? but ſo ſoone as they had
peace with the Engliſh, and after with the Spaniard, they
filled euery corner of their country with ſedition, ſackings,
cruelties, and ſlaughters; and that with ſuch obſtinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting,
as the contagion thereof hath not beene able for
25. yeeres ſpace to be remooued. But that which is moſt
to be lamented, is the ſcandall they haue brought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the church. This ſelfe thing may be appropriated to
the Flemings, and the cauſe may be imputed to idleneſſe,
and the exceeding plentie wherein they liued. The exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Bajazet</hi> the ſecond ſhall ſerue to cloſe vp this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
for he being giuen ouer to his eaſe; the ſoldiours,

of his two ſonnes, <hi>Selim</hi> and <hi>Acomath,</hi> as all the forces
of the Empire (which had eſtabliſhed the Turkiſh ſcepter)
were diuided into two, and it lacked not much of being
vtterly ouerthrowne, euery one for his part ſeconding the
rebellions of the ſonnes againſt the father.</p>

regard bee compared to him; and which is more, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
of his ſouldiers vpon his vertuous behauiour in armes
is capable of attaining to the moſt eminent charges and
dignities of his eſtate, and of inriching himſelfe with ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable
treaſure. To confirme this, the goods which
<hi>Meehmet Baſſa</hi> left behinde him, (who of a Chriſtian
<hi>Apoſtate</hi> aſpired to that greatneſſe) were valued at two <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi>
of Crownes. In a word they are ſure that rewarde wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
alwaies vpon valour. Moreouer the proweſſe of the
priuate ſouldiours cannot be ſmothered amongſt them, it
is rather immediatly diſcouered and notice taken thereof.
Of all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond was the
moſt bountifull, for he gaue beyond meaſure, ſo as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
he increaſed the ſouldiours pay a thouſand fould.
<hi>Selim</hi> the firſt did the like; and it is worth the noting, that
as thoſe two ſurpaſſed the reſidue in liberality, ſo did they
in honourable and triumphant victory.</p>

               <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He happy ſucceſſe of battailes by thoſe
of ancient times with ſuch wiſdome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiued,
makes it moſt apparent vnto vs
that moſt commonly the meane armies
haue ouercome the great. <hi>Alexander</hi>
the Great, diuers <hi>Grecian</hi> Captaines, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others <hi>Miltiades</hi> and <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> and among the
Romans <hi>Lucullus, Scylla, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar</hi> alwaies aſſailed
and vanquiſhed the barbarous people rather with vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
then equall numbers, if we reſpect the multitude;
but they went far beyond them if we conſider their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie
vertue. In theſe latter times the Commanders of
the <hi>Emperour Charles</hi> the 5. and of <hi>King Philip</hi> his ſonne
haue likewiſe gained the victory of many armies greater
then this.</p>
               <p>2 To ſuch as demaund the reaſon of it, I wil anſwere that
it was becauſe the principall ſtrength and ſinew of an army
conſiſteth, in affection, in military Diſcipline, and in a
well diſpoſed order in the day of battell: without which
parts an army is as fraile as glaſſe. A few may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
and orderly ranged then many. Vertue vnited is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8135:21"/>
more powerfull then ſeparated and diſiointed.
Hence is it that bodies of an indifferent ſtature are for the
moſt part more vigorous then ſuch as are ouer great and
huge, which the Poet (ſpeaking of <hi>Fidaeus</hi>) expreſly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
in theſe words. <hi>Maior in exiguo regnabat corpore
virtus.</hi> Great vertue in a little body raignd. And Virgil
alluding to the Bees ſaith, <hi>Ingentes animi anguſto in corpore
verſantur.</hi> In ſlender bodies they haue mighty mindes:
queſtionleſſe a meane army muſt needes be more ſtable
and vnited then a great, becauſe multitude is naturally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with confuſion, commonly waited vpon by
diſorder.</p>
               <p>3 Moreouer, it is a thing of high conſideration to be able
to take ſuch order that a campe be not incombred with
baggage: rather that it be free and manageable, ſo as it
may be euery where commodiouſly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted, ranged and
euer in a readineſſe to gaine and make good dangerous &amp;
difficult ſtraites and paſſages; that it be not tired and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
for the long marches it muſt often vndertake;
that it doe not faint for ſuch accidents as diuerſly chance,
nor for any exploits or executions which preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnexpected. All which a meane campe will be more
proper to performe then a great: for it ſhall not neede ſo
great a quantity of victuals, nor ſo great an incombrance
of baggage or cariage as the other.</p>
               <p>4 Moreouer ſeeing it is more profitable and neceſſary that
an army be conducted &amp; gouerned by one only Generall;
and that it depend of no other then him; It will be more
eaſily effected in a meane then a great army, eſpecially
compounded of diuers nations. And this dependance
ſhall be better ordered if the Generall can content himſelfe
with ſmall ſtore of luggage and that well truſſed vp. The
multitude of meane cauſes ſlacketh alwaies the courſe of
the efficient, and keepeth backe the fruite thereof. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
army hath not neede of ſo much luggage as a great.</p>
               <p>5 And it is much better that the Captaine himſelfe know
his ſouldiours and they him; then to rely vpon the credit
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8135:21"/>
and report of ſuch as are vnder his charge; for the ſouldiour
that ſhall heare himſelfe named by his Captaine aduanceth
himſelfe ſo much the more, and becommeth more deſirous
of honor. Whereas if he ſee himſelfe forgotten and vnteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of him which commandeth, he groweth diſtaſted
and out of heart, and almoſt careleſſe how matters haue
their procedings. Who doubteth that the preſence of the
Captaine or Generall of an army doth not ſerue as a motiue
to the ſouldiour to make him diligently preſerue his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and to ſhunne the reproch of cowardiſe? which he
will not ſo carefully performe, if he finde himſelfe out of
the preſence of his Commander, or that his Commander
make as if he did not ſee him.</p>
               <p>6 It is good alſo that the ſouldiers frequent brotherly
together, for that aſſureth them more, and maketh them
truſt to one anothers aſſiſtance in time of the moſt croſſe
fortunes. All theſe parts incounter and are intertained
more eaſily in a meane, then in a great armie.</p>
               <p>7 Which is often attended vpon by more inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
then the other, as by famine, plagues, contagious
mutinies and diſſentions. There is yet another dangerous
inconuenience which is moſt vſually the companion of a
multitude; that is, that they forme to themſelues a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of their owne forces greater then they ought: of
this confidence followeth a contempt of the aduerſe
power, of this contempt a preſumption, author of infinite
miſchiefes.</p>
               <p>8 But how happeneth it then (will ſome ſay) that the
Turkes haue euery where gained the victorie by multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?
Would you know how? Becauſe they haue betimes
trained vp and inſtructed their great armies, to keepe ſo
good an order, as well in execution, iudgement, military
diſcipline, readineſſe, as diſpoſition to armes, that they
are become as tractable, and eaſie to manage as ours
though meane and few in number.</p>
               <p>9 On the other ſide we haue ſuffered our armies to ſlide
into ſuch inſolencie and libertie, as we can hardly rule and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:8135:22"/>
conduct them without ſo many dangers, confuſions and
luggage, as it were enough to trouble Captaines of great
policie and experience; and to ſay the trueth, ſee wee
not that the Turke more eaſily furniſheth an hundred
thouſand men with vittailes, then we fiftie thouſand? for
beſides that his ſouldiers make not, as ours, any account of
the diuerſitie of vittailes, of delicacie or of toothſome
morſels, they drinke no Wine nor Beere, which importeth
the conſideration of almoſt the one halfe of our munition
and charge.</p>
               <p>10 What need I ſpeake of obedience, nurſe of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
obſerued amongſt them? ſince it was neuer ſeene that
the Turkes euer loſt battaile through diſorder, much leſſe
left off purſuing any attempt for their ſouldiers mutinies.</p>
               <p>11 Whereas almoſt all the battailes we haue bid them,
had not beene loſt, but by the meere diſorder and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience

loſſe of <hi>Nicapolie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1396.</note> but to the diſordinate raſhneſſe of

which ſeeing themſelues deſtitute of foote were ſtrooke
with ſuch a feare as they betooke themſelues to flight not
without the loſſe of many good ſouldiours and worthy

for the confidence of ſuch ſuccour he that attempteth
would prepare his forces proportionable to his proiect,
and not truſt to outward helpes either of friend or confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat.
Who doubteth, when we ſo repoſe our ſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

and disburſe of oure owne ſtore? But this is not all: the

and occaſion (which once eſcaped cannot be laid hold

if he be the ſtronger and more mighty, and finde
not himſelfe intereſſed in the ſucceſſe of the enterpriſe, for
which he tooke armes and became confederate.</p>
               <p>4 We may alſo adde another defect and imperfection;
&amp; that is, if the ſuccour we attend be to be aſſembled from
diuers places, or, that the windes (if it be by ſea) or ſome
vnlooked for accident (if by land) hinder by ſo many
meanes the preparations for the war and intended voiage,
as that the ſeaſon fit for execution eſcapeth him that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth;

the <hi>Rendeuous</hi> his opportunities of attempting or atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

vnderhand deliuer to his Commanders memorials and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
more ſtrict and limited, then the neceſſitie of
the vndertaken affaire would permit. Alſo the leaſt diſtaſte
either of the Prince which aſſiſteth, or of the Captaine
which conducteth ſuch ſuccours, ſerueth oft-times to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe
the promiſed forces, deceiue the others expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and bring all he vndertaketh to nothing: So as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
not onely more weake by this diſappointment,
but his owne forces alſo become vnprofitable, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
himſelfe expoſed to all wrong and ruine: for as if
one only wheele of a clocke be out of temper, it ſufficeth
to diſorder the whole motion; ſo where the vndertaker
faileth but of one part of his promiſed troupes, the effects,
which in part depend thereon, likewiſe faile, and the courſe
of his warlike deſignes remaine croſſed and peruerted. I
will not forget alſo to ſay that a campe conſiſting of ſuch
borrowed peeces, hath neceſſarily need of many heads to
command it, and an armie compounded of ſo manie
heads (becauſe of the diuerſity of opinions and affections)
will moſt commonly haue the woorſe when it commeth to
handie blowes.</p>
               <p>5 We may illuſtrate theſe diſcommodities with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
that touch vs neere, and are familiar vnto vs, and were
not long ſince practiſed; for this cauſe I will more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
then otherwiſe I would, heere produce them. In our
time we haue ſeene two moſt memorable leagues between
the Pope, the king of Spaine, and the Venetians, conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and vnited to vndertake one warre againſt the Turke:
the one was vnder Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third,<note place="margin">1537.</note> and the other in
the life time of <hi>Pius Quintus.</hi> The firſt was caried with an
exceſſiue charge, yet without any effect woorthy ſo great
an aſſembly: The cauſe in my opinion proceeded of the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8135:24"/>
difficulty that was found to ioyn in one body the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat
forces, and draw them together at the <hi>Rendeuous</hi> in due
ſeaſon: for they met not till the end of <hi>September.</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
an other inconuenience may be alledged to this
purpoſe, which ouerthrew, the good ſucceſſe of ſuch a holy
and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> attempt; yet it may appeere that to auoide the
ſhame and diſhonour that followed thereof, it had beene
eaſie to haue performed ſomewhat of more memorable
conſequence, then was the taking of <hi>Caſtle-nouo,</hi> if we had
knowen how to husband the times and occaſions fit for the
imployment of ſo combined a power. Concerning the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
which was (as I ſaid) in the time of <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1570.</note> the
army of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> very gallant and ſtrong, ſpent all the
ſommer in attending the <hi>Galleis</hi> of <hi>Spaine</hi> which were to
conuoy ſuccours into the <hi>Ile</hi> of <hi>Cypres</hi> then attempted by
the <hi>Turke;</hi> ſo as this ſlackneſſe of aſſembling the Galleyes
was a cauſe that the army became almoſt quite vnfurniſhed
of good ſouldiours drawen together to their great coſts by
reaſon of the plague which had made a moſt pitifull ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocke
amonge them. Notwithſtanding all this they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
not to make towards <hi>Cypres</hi> ſo late, as by the way they
receiued the newes of the lamentable taking of <hi>Nicoſia:</hi>
Which made them imagine that the <hi>Turkes</hi> had, vpon that
commodity, moſt ſtrongly manned their Galleys (as it was
likely enough) with land <hi>Souldiours,</hi> and that therefore
there was more appearance of danger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good ſucceſſe
in aſſailing them: vpon which conſideration they held it
beſt to turne their courſe homeward and refer that buſineſſe
to an other time; hauing then thus diſhonorably behaued
themſelues: returning they incountred ſo many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
as well weather beaten by reaſon of the Winter then
approching, they at length arriued at their home ſorely
bruſed and ſpoiled. The yeare following the army of the
conſederats met, notwithſtanding all this very late, yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke
they to incounter the enemy, of whome they got
that ſo renowned victory in the yeare 1571. if God had
permitted vs to reape thereby thoſe worthy fruits that we
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8135:24"/>
had reaſon to expect. Now for all this <hi>Cypres</hi> was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
but remained to the infidell as the reward and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of his valour. The third yeare of the league the king
of <hi>Spaine,</hi> in ſtead of purſuing his enterpriſe againſt the
<hi>Turke</hi> as he had determined, cauſed <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Auſtria</hi>
Admirall of his fleete to ſtay at <hi>Meſſina,</hi> becauſe he then
doubted that the French would aſſaile <hi>Flanders,</hi> with ſuch
forces as they had that yeare rather ſuffered to take breath
then wholy caſed and diſmiſſed: So as the whole ſeaſon
was ſpent vnprofitably without attempting ought worthy
ſuch preparation, as the confederates had in due time ſet
forth. This was an occaſion of exceſſiue charge, and that
the armies did not once ſtirre till it was too late, attending
what their neighbours would do, who, as I haue ſaid, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to threaten the <hi>King of Spaine</hi> with ſome attempt
vpon his country of <hi>Flanders.</hi> In the meane time the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi>
tired with the charge and trouble they were at to no
purpoſe, treated a peace with the <hi>Turke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>6 Who will make any queſtion now (thoſe things well
weighed and conſidered) that if the leagues (both the firſt
and ſecond) had beene well caried without theſe croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
iealouſies and ſuſpitions which accompanied them,
(though vainly and vpon no ground) but that they would
haue brought foorth ſome woorthie and honorable fruite,
to the glory and honour of God, the peace of his church,
the encreaſe and eſtabliſhment of the Chriſtian common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth?
This may be enough to prooue that forces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
of diuers nations, depending of many and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
heads, are in marching more ſlowe, and at a time of
need leſſe effectuall then others. It may appeere to ſome
that I heereby inferre, that leagues betweene Princes are
vnprofitable, and therefore not to be made: ſo farre is it
from me to maintaine that opinion, as I rather willingly
embrace the contrarie: but I reſerue a time to handle how
and in what manner it would be good to make ſuch a
league, (eſpecially againſt the Turke) when I ſhall arriue
at the place appointed for this purpoſe, to the end I may

of diſcourſe in handling.</p>
               <p>7 The <hi>Ottomans</hi> neuer made league, either offenſiue or
defenſiue with any: and neuer had helpe of ſtrangers: on
the contrarie, they haue alwaies had to doe with armies
compounded of different nations confederate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by ſundrie Commanders, all which (as ill vnited,
not vnderſtanding one another) they haue euermore van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.

in a great perſon, affirming that
he ought not to make reckoning to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
his treaties of peace or ought elſe
he vndertaketh, at the leaſt when his game is faire: and
that he may at ſuch a time without ſcruple of conſcience,
or other honeſt reſpect, violate his faith, breake the lawes
of nations, and his oath. A thing queſtionleſſe vnbefitting
a magnanimous ſpirit, and which ought neuer to haue
place among the actions of a Chriſtian Prince, to the end
he may not by ſo foule and diſhoneſt a ſtaine diſgrace the
reſidue of his vertuous operations. This makes me eſteem
this axiom ſo lewd and deteſtable, that we ſhould bluſh, ſo
much as to imagine it, much leſſe to propound it as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
for Princes; who are not to profeſſe other then Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and generoſitie. It is good for none but thoſe whoſe
caſe is deſperate, and who reſpect not that their poſteritie
condemne them for men of foule and cauterized ſoules.</p>
               <p>2 To ſay the trueth, no man can with reaſon gainſay, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowne
and a good reputation, as well at home as abroad,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8135:26"/>
to be the moſt firme foundation of all principalitie. And
what reputation can a Prince haue either among his owne

               <p>3 <hi>Machiauel</hi> to conceale the fault he not ignorantly
committeth, ſaith, that this is ſometimes moſt requiſite for
the good of Princes affaires, ſince occaſion once paſſed
is irrecouerable. What more meere folly could he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to his confuſion, then in thus concluding, that a Prince
is not to regard the bond of his faith, if the good of his
eſtate preſent an occaſion to violate it? Truely none at
all: neither were it neceſſarie according to Gods lawes, or
the carriage of humane affaires, that Chriſtian Princes were
of that minde; for it would prooue the direct courſe neuer
to ſee but fire and ſword amongſt vs.</p>
               <p>4 Such as are good deteſt theſe opinions,<note place="margin">1539</note> as did hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Frances</hi> the firſt; who profeſſing faith and honour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
ſuch counſaile when the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5.
about the eſtabliſhment of the affaires of Flanders, paſſed
thorow France, and vpon the Kings word, croſſing his
country came to Paris. That word this Noble Prince pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before the greateſt good that could betide his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
if he would haue retained the Emperour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
him to forgoe the places and eſtates he held in
Lombardy and Italy, whereto the King pretended a right,
which he often vnprofitably diſputed, as did alſo <hi>Henry</hi>
the ſecond.</p>
               <p>5 By the ſame reaſon a man may alſo ſay that ſometimes
it is well done to ranſacke Churches, robbe Altars, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
innocents, and ſuccour the wicked: for there is not
any vice ſo deteſtable, or crime ſo hainous that ſometime
carrieth not with it a ſhew and colour of good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
not profitable to him which in due ſeaſon performeth
it; were it for nought elſe but becauſe he attaineth the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of his corrupt will. If that were not, ſhould wee haue
ſo many murtherers, falſifiers, ſacrilegious perſons and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8135:26"/>
men giuen ouer to all reprochfull vices? if thereby they
did not reape ſome temporall commodity?</p>
               <p>6 I will yet adde further, and maintaine it to the end, that
for a man to keepe his promiſed faith, and be ſo accounted
of by the world, is a worke of God and without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
much better then to violate it and embrace ſuch a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
opinion as that of <hi>Machiauel,</hi> yea though the profit
were immediat and ſuch as might afford wherewithall to
ballance his breach of faith and promiſe: Not to keepe
touch with one is enough to incurre the ſuſpition and ill
conceit of all; neither is there any which will not thinke he
doth God good ſeruice in performing the like towards all
ſuch Princes as ſhall take ſuch courſes; which will yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
adminiſter matter for an other repentance, to ſee that
when they ſhall tell or meane truth no man will beleeue or
truſt them. I could illuſtrate this propoſition with infinite
examples but I will content my ſelfe with that one of <hi>Duke
Valentine</hi> ſonne of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the 6. cited by <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiauel,</hi>
as a perfect Captaine; who without reſpect of
truth, his oath, reuerence of religion, or honour, which
is ſo charily to be preſerued amongſt men ordinarily, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
himſelfe to all diſloialty, breach of faith, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
other wicked and traiterous courſes; ſo they caried
with them ſome ſhew of preſent commodity. This man
during the life of his father went thorow with certaine his
deſignes, borne out rather by the Popes authority then
any fortunate ſucceſſe of his miſchieuous attempts. After
the death of his father it was quickly ſeene how ſmally du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
are all ſuch eſtates as are founded vpon deceit.<note place="margin">Iou. lib 8. hiſt.</note> For
he found himſelfe immediatly forſaken of his friends and
purſued by his enimies; ſo as more liuely to expreſſe what
he came to, after he had moſt maliciouſly hatched &amp; atchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
ſo high enterpriſes, he ſerued (as they ſay) but for a
cipher, and was as one that had no being, leauing nought
behind him but only the footſteps and a curſed memory of
his wickedneſſe, which made his life and name infamous to
all poſterity.</p>

7 Some one will tell me that the <hi>Turkes</hi> haue done the
like, and haue vſed all ſortes of cunning, deceit and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
towards their neighbours, and that neuertheleſſe
they haue thriued by it. It is true, but the cauſes are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and yet we ſee that the moſt diſloiall amongſt them
were not the moſt aſſured in the forces of their trecheries.
<hi>Amurath</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Mahymeth</hi> the ſecond, <hi>Baiazeth</hi> the

Princes of their race; but we muſt grant that if thoſe their
wicked procedings thriued for a time, it was more through
the coldneſſe and diſſentions of the Chriſtians when they
ſhould haue reuenged and repelled their iniuries, then that
we ſhould therefore beleeue that it is well done to proue
periured and diſloiall. <hi>Amurath</hi> the ſecond made proofe of
it to his coſt, and hauing receiued an ouerthrow at the
handes of <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of Polonia,<note place="margin">At the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Hemus.</note> he ſpeedily made

the maintaining of this propoſition are ſo plaine to ſuch as
without being obſtinate or paſſionate, in behalfe of either

for is it not much more fit and eaſie that a good Captaine
make and faſhion a campe of rawe Souldiers, then that
good and experienced Souldiers prepare and faſhion their

               <p>3 Now we muſt come to ſuch examples as may inſtruct
and make cleere the truth of my propoſition. If we will as
we ought, examine how many times the Chriſtians haue
beene ouerthrowne by the Turkes, we ſhall vndoubtedly
finde, that it hath euermore hapned rather through want
of experience,<note place="margin">1396.</note> courage, ſufferance, concord, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in the Commanders; then for any other default. So at
the battailes of <hi>Nicepolis,</hi> for that ſuch like Captaines did
ſet light by the Turkes forces, and tooke not a ſufficient
ſuruey of them, they receiued a moſt ſhamefull ouerthrow,
a woorthy reward of their weake experience, in not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
how to fight with thoſe barbarous nations,<note place="margin">1526.</note> whom they
might well thinke wanted neither skill nor valour. Did
not <hi>Lewes</hi> king of Hungary by meanes of the Biſhop of
Tomerea (who brought him almoſt to the ſlaughter) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the like diſgrace, at the battaile of Mogoria, for want
of experience in matter of warre, and of iudgement ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
to diſcouer the enemies forces, and the paſſages of
the countrey where he was to buckle with him? In like ſort
was not the vnskilfulneſſe of the Italians cauſe of that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie
the Turkes gained at <hi>Grado,</hi> who had then for their
leader <hi>Homarbay,</hi> Generall of the Turkiſh armie? Alſo
the yeare 1537. at Exechium (<hi>Mahomet Iahiaoglis</hi> being
Gouernour vnder <hi>Soliman</hi> of Belgrad and the frontiers of
Hungarie in the time of king <hi>Iohn</hi>) the great <hi>Caziauer</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:8135:28"/>
loſing his courage, did he not abandone to ſpoile, death,
and ruine a faire and ſtrong armie, which he commanded
for the Princes of Germany and Italy, ſome one troupe
excepted, which diſhonorably togither with him ſaued
themſelues by flight? Alſo before this heauie loſſe, did not
<hi>Anthony Grimani</hi> Generall of the Venetian armie faile
of courage when with great aduantage he might haue
charged the Turkes,<note place="margin">Sabel En. 10. l. 9.</note> and put them to the woorſe?<note place="margin">1471.</note> The
very like want of experience and valour was ſeene in an
other Venetian Generall, who ſhamefully left the Ile of
Negropont to the ſpoile of the enemy. To conclude, haue
not the Chriſtians beene ſo many times put to the woorſe
neere about Buda, for want of valiant and experienced
Captaines, as it cannot without griefe be related? On the
contrarie, the <hi>Ottomans</hi> haue neuer ſuffered misfortune of
warre; at the leaſt for lacke of authoritie, command, or
wiſedome in managing their armies: for they themſelues
haue in perſon conducted them, and beene preſent at all
their high exploits and important enterpriſes by them at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieued.
They haue likewiſe euermore committed the
charge of their difficult actions and affaires of warre to the
moſt valiant and experienced Captaines amongſt them,
whom they had formerly well knowen, trained vp, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
to ſuch charges by infinite proofes of their courage
and wiſdome in moſt dangerous and difficult occaſions.
In ſumme, experience is that which perfecteth valor. The
Turkiſh Emperors haue alwaies giuen to their Captaines
ample power &amp; commiſſion freely to diſpoſe of their moſt
important affaires, wherin they haue bene thus happy that
we cannot finde that euer ſuch Captaines loſt battaile for
lacke of command or obedience; or that they euer for want
of courage or experience in the arte military, made ſtay or
queſtion of their proceedings. Of all the <hi>Baſhas</hi> that euer
had the managing of matters of importance, &amp; had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
hand in the affaires of their Maſters, <hi>Acomet</hi> was the
chiefe (who ſerued <hi>Mahomet</hi> the 2. and added much to his
greatnes by obteining many glorious victories) inſomuch
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:8135:29"/>
as he was no leſſe feared then his Soueraign. To him <hi>Sinam</hi>
may be ioyned who liued vnder <hi>Selim</hi> the firſt, and being
ſlaine at the battaile of <hi>Matarea</hi> (wherein he wan the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
for his Maſter) <hi>Selim</hi> ſaid of him that the death of ſo
worthy a man as he, was cauſe of ſuch great griefe vnto him
as it equalled the ioy he conceiued for ſo happy a victory:
ſuch alſo was <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> that famous pirat, who for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
warlike acts wan the renowne of a valiant Captaine, and
was moſt highly reputed of his Maſter <hi>Soliman,</hi> for whom
he performed many memorable enterpriſes as wel by ſea as
by land. Hence we may gather that vndoubtedly a great
Prince cannot doe worſe then commit the charges of his
wars, the dignities and conducts of his armies, to them
which inioy his fauour but vnworthily: he ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the deſerts of others, &amp; eſpecially of ſuch as with more
ſufficiencie would render an honorable account of ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

as we leaue an enimy behind vs, at one ſide of vs, or
otherwiſe, in ſuch ſort, as he may croſſe, cut off, beſeege,
or incloſe vs when we ſo inconſideratly skip or ſtride; we
may likewiſe ſaie that he truly skips who croſſeth from one
country to another ſo far diſtant, as by that time he hath
finiſhed his voiage, his ſtrength failes him and his troopes
proue ſo out of heart and tired, as they become vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.
We may alledge for example that which befell
the Emperours of <hi>Germany,</hi> the king of France and of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
in their voiages of the holy land, for the length of the
iourny, the far diſtance of the country, the diuerſity of
the Climate, the change of the aire, and many other ſuch
like inconueniences, ſo tired and diſcouraged them by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the trauailes and miſeries they had ſuffered vpon the
way, as they could not attempt any matter of importance,
or goe thorow with their enterpriſe according to their
proiect: not vnlike a ball which ſtirreth not from the
place where it is once ſetled, through want of that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
power which ſhould toſſe and raiſe it. So if theſe
Princes at the firſt arriuall did affoord any proofe of their
courage, valour, and likelihood of good fortune; the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
of the principall motiue ſuddenly made them
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8135:30"/>
loſe their aduantages, and reduced the whole to tearmes
vnwoorthy the merit of their holy intentions and trauels.</p>
               <p>4 We muſt then allow that it is requiſite for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
of eſtates, either that their prouinces touch and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
the one the other, or that their forces be of ability
to maintaine themſelues of themſelues: for this continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath of it ſelfe ſuch force and efficacie for the laſting
and preſeruation of eſtates, as we ſee that common-weales
and meane kingdomes haue thereby longer maintained
themſelues then great and rich monarchies. Wee may
alledge for example the common-weales of Sparta and of
Venice; of the kingdomes of Perſia and France, whoſe
rule hath much longer endured then that of the Sarazins,
of the Mamelucks, or of other more mighty Empires. The
cauſe proceedeth, as I haue ſaid, of the vnion of that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
and coniunction of prouinces, abutting the one
vpon the other, which is of ſuch vertue and efficacie to
giue ſtrength and continuance to a monarchie, as it almoſt
exceedeth conceit and imagination.</p>
               <p>5 The Romans which ſaw wel enough that the inlarging
of their Empires limits, trained after it a conſequence of a
neceſſary diſperſing of their forces, endeuored by al means
poſſible to reunite this body, augmented and made huge
by their aduantageous conqueſts; reducing to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and rule, all they got both by maintaining ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
forces vpon the frontiers of their Empire or garriſons
in places of importance, as alſo by eſtabliſhing Colonies,
and infranchiſing many ſtrong townes, with beſtowing on
them the like liberties as the people of Rome enioyed, by
them tearmed <hi>Municipia.</hi> In other places alſo they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
certaine fraternities and aſſemblies of people,
with prerogatiues of the Romanes priuiledges, which
they named <hi>Conuentus:</hi> Moreouer, they committed
eſtates and intire kingdoms to the gouernment of certaine
Princes held and eſteemed as friends of the people of
Rome. By theſe meanes ioyning them to their loue as well
by gratifying them with their liberty and bounty, as with
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8135:31"/>
other priuiledges, honours and dignities, whereof they
did partake in their towne as in right of Citizens: They
tearmed theſe townes and people their confederates, and
the Kings their friends. As for example in <hi>Africke</hi> they
had <hi>Maſſiniſſa,</hi> and <hi>Iuba;</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Eumenes, Pruſias</hi> and
the King of <hi>Egypt.</hi> In <hi>Europe</hi> thoſe of <hi>Marſeilles, Autum,
Auerg<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>, Rennes</hi> and others; making account more to
auaile themſelues by ſuch confederacies and amities then
by meanes more ſtrickt and ſeuere: ſo then power is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and continued either by our owne forces, or by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing
of the forces of our friends which ſerue vs as a
continued rampart and conducteth vs out of danger euen
into the country which we intend to inuade, and that with
ſo much the greater aduantage, when vpon ſome part it
confineth with the country of our confederates.</p>
               <p>6 But becauſe we are neuer able with good aſſurance (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
Princes amongſt whom this is a tickle point) to
maintaine ſo good intelligence, it is requiſite if we will
make this vſe of an other, to make him confident either
through the hope of participation in our conqueſts, or elſe
by intimating vnto him (if he be our inferiour) an euident
aſſurance in our proceedings, and ſuch a plainneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
in all our other actions, as euen that may rid him of
the diſtruſt he might conceiue of being one day praied vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and brought vnder by that inſolencie which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth
the proſperitie of fortune, and may ſerue to ſtretch
the conſcience of a conquering Prince. After we haue in
this manner framed an impreſſion of our integritie in the
heart of our neighbour, we may march in his countrey as
ſecurely as in our owne, and reſt aſſured that we ſhall by
him be furthered and aſſiſted.</p>
               <p>7 The French could neuer keepe any countrey by them
conquered abroad, vnleſſe it were Piemont and Sauoy:
for it one day they had gained a foote of land, they were
enforced to forgoe it the next, no ſooner winning it, but
they loſt it.</p>
               <p>8 We commonly ſay, that there is no leſſe vertue in him

is neede of more dexterity in keeping then in getting, for
an amazement of the people we inuade, a rebellion in
our behalfe, or any other ſuch like ſturre makes vs eaſily
maſters of that whereto we aſpire; but to preſerue what we
get, we muſt maintaine a continuall counſaile which muſt
haue all the parts thereto appertaining, as grauity of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ripe deliberation, nimbleneſſe to diſſemble, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
ioyned with a daily heedefulneſſe and patience to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
occaſions. The French (which are reputed the moſt
warlike nation vnder the ſunne,) are but too ſodaine, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
impatient and of too ſtirring a nature; for proofe
you ſhall obſerue that what they atchieue not when they
firſt attempt, they almoſt neuer compaſſe it: all their boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
heat is ſoone exhaled and ſpent by the ſodaine feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
of their courage, which moſt commonly tranſports
them beyond all moderation and aduice moſt requiſite in
what wee vndertake, without heeding the end for which
they bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. This negligence together with their impatience
hath made way to all the misfortunes which out of their
countrie they haue induced: The voyage of the Terſeras
and certaine other attempts vpon the Portugales haue not
long ſince confirmed this opinion, and made the wound
of their vnhappines bleede a freſh. Lews the eleuenth, a
prince of an approued wiſdome and cleare ſighted in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of eſtate, would neuer lend any eare to the perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſending an army into Italie or other remote parts;
reiecting all ſuch practiſes, as well for the reaſon formerly
alledged, as becauſe of the infidelitie which he thought to
be in the <hi>Italians,</hi> and particularly in them of <hi>Genoa.</hi> If
<hi>Charles</hi> the 8. his ſonne, <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, and
<hi>Henry</hi> his ſonne had inherited this their predeceſſors opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
they had not with ſuch exceſſiue charge, miſhap, and
miſery attempted <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>9 Heere ſome one will obiect that neuertheleſſe the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of the Portugals is of 90. yeares continuance or
thereabout in the Indies, ſo far diſtant from the firſt ſpring
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:8135:32"/>
and originall. The like appeareth in the gouernment of
Philip King of Spaine ſpread and diuided in ſo many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
aſwell in Europe as in India. Surely it is not poſſible
to imagine a greater diſtance then from <hi>Lisbon</hi> to <hi>Ormus,
Goa, Malaca,</hi> and <hi>Ternate,</hi> ſo as from Portugale to their
fartheſt Conqueſts, there are no leſſe then twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
miles; and although they endeuour to ioyne theſe
eſtates ſo ſeuered, by the neereneſſe of ſundry fortreſſes
heere and there beſtowed in the midway (as <hi>Zofala, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hambique,
Melinde,</hi> which belongeth to a certaine King
their Ally, beſides other like meanes) yet all theſe are but
weake ſinewes long to ſuſtaine the vnion of ſo far ſeparated
members. But it is Gods pleaſure that by how much the
foundations of this rule are more feeble and ſubiect to be
ſhaken, by ſo much the more we ſhould admire the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency
of his diuine Maieſty, whereby they are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
fortified, and protected. The dominion likewiſe
of the King of Spaine is ſpread into ſo many parts of
<hi>Aſia</hi> (eſpecially by meanes of annexing the crowne of
Portugale) of <hi>Afrike,</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the new found
world, as there appeareth in this preſeruation a greater mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
then counſail or humane prouidence, for in very deed
to rule ſo many and ſo ſeuered nations differing in religion,
manners and tongues without ſtirring from home, is it
not a worke of heauen rather then of humane policy or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe?
God therefore which hath of his goodneſſe made
him owner of ſo many and ſo goodly countries, hath not
denied him wiſedome and counſaile to know how to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and maintaine them, as he doth, vnder his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>10 The <hi>Ottomans</hi> haue ordinarily behaued themſelues
more iudiciouſly in this one part of conquering (without
inconſiderat skipping) then in any other of their actions.
For neither couetouſneſſe of inriching or inlarging their
eſtate, nor the eaſineſſe of attempting, nor the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of peoples inſurrections, nor the thirſt of reuenge
(which commonly makes Princes mighty in men and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:8135:32"/>
mony, forget themſelues when the maintenance of their
authority &amp; credit is called in queſtion, eſpecially percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the law in their hands to execute more readily then
can particular perſons) nor any ſuch like motiues haue
beene able, as I ſaid, to induce the Turkes indiſcreetly to
skip or to ingage themſelues in any enterpriſe far from
home. Rather on the contrary they haue marched faire
and ſoft from country to country, and deuoured (as they
continue ſtill to doe) all ſuch as confine and are neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
vnto them. Hence hath growen the conſequence
of ſo many happie victories, the benefite of ſo great and
rich conqueſts; the courſe of ſo eaſily preſeruing what
they haue gotten.</p>
               <p>11 I haue ſaid that for the moſt part they haue not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideratly
skipped or ſtrid in their enterpriſes, as the
Chriſtians doe and haue done: and as we ſee, when any
of them haue taken ſuch waies to greatneſſe, the fruits and
effects haue not prooued anſwerable to their proiect and
promiſed fortunes. This vnhappineſſe, common with the
error founded vpon the reaſons formerly alledged, ought
hencefoorth to ſerue as an inſtruction to make vs become
more wiſe and regardfull then we yet are, to the end that
after we haue by an holy and vniuerſall amendment ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed
the wrath of God, we may war againſt them with
the ſame policies and aduantages as they haue practiſed
in raiſing themſelues to our coſt and confuſion. Theſe
examples alſo ſhould admoniſh vs of what is to be feared,
to wit, leaſt failing to chaſtice &amp; humble our ſelues, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
Maieſty inflict vpon vs a more ſeuere puniſhment,
then that we haue hitherto indured, and for this cauſe open
a more large gate to thoſe infidels vtterly to ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
vs.</p>
               <p>12 Now leſt any one ſhould thinke I haue againſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
held that the Turkes haue not, as we, forgotten thus
inconſideratly to skip, I will recite certaine examples to
that purpoſe. The firſt then that did it, was <hi>Mahomet</hi> the
ſecond, which vnfortunatly attempted <hi>Italy, Soliman</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:8135:33"/>
the like againſt the ſame country, after the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of <hi>Diu</hi> in the Indies, which was vndertaken the yeare
1537. then that of the yeare 1542. that of <hi>Ormus</hi> 1552.
and finally vpon good grounds the attempting of <hi>Malta</hi>
which was ſo valiantly defended by the Knights of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
as (next the honour due vnto the diuine Maieſtie) all
thoſe braue Gentlemen, who with their grand Maſter
<hi>Pariſot,</hi> made it good againſt the Infidels, deſerue to be

vndoubtedly follow the firſt examples of greater moment,

               <p>2 We haue often ſeene, that a paltrie Sconce (either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the naturall ſtrength of the ſituation, thickneſſe of
the wall, goodneſſe of the matter, couragious obſtinacy of
the defenders, or ſome other accident not foreſeene or
dreampt of, hath ſtopt the proceeding of a royall armie,
and hath prooued it ſelfe as able to withſtand the force
thereof, as a citie greater, richer, and more peopled. And
though we become after maſters of ſuch blocke-houſes
and ſmall fortes, yet that is no furtherance to a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
conqueſt; or helpe to the enterpriſe begun. We
finde written that the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> becauſe he
to no purpoſe ſpent ſo much time about Aſola (which he
ſtriued to ſubdue by the way, for the reputation and credit
of the armie, he conducted to Milan) inconſiderately loſt
the occaſion offered him to become Lord of that Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
and performed not any thing after to the good of
his affaires. The French alſo, after they had paſſed the
Alpes in the time of <hi>Lewes</hi> the 12. thriued not in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
of the kingdome of Naples; hauing vpon an ill
ground vndertaken Rocca-Secea, where they engaged
both their honors and liues; for hauing beſieged it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
daies, and giuen the aſſault in vaine, they lent leaſure
and courage to the Spaniards, to bethinke themſelues:
made their powers leſſe valued for ſo badde a beginning,
and diſcouraged the people for euer attempting any thing
in their behalfe, as no doubt they had done if they might
haue ſeene a fortunate and better digeſted proceeding
then theirs was, the name of the Spaniard being then odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
amongſt them. This fault made the Spaniards ſo bold
as to ſay, that the reſt of the kingdome was reſerued for
them, and not for the other, who had ſo ill husbanded
their opportunities. In the yere 1556. holding on the ſaid
deſigne for the conqueſt of Naples, did they not vainely
ſpend time, money, their forces, and paines at Ciuitella,
to the ruine of that goodly armie which <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8135:34"/>
France ſent thither vnder the command of the Duke of
<hi>Guyſe:</hi> who was neuertheleſſe a valiant and diſcreet Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
and who had perhaps done better if his particular
intereſt, or the ouermuch truſt he repoſed in the Popes
Nephewes, had not blinded him: Other reaſons may be
alleaged for the ſmall good this armie did the king, who
had conceiued of it great and honorable hopes; but I will
referre them to ſuch as write that Hiſtorie. The Spaniards
alſo haue thrice attempted the Ile of Gerbes,<note place="margin">1560.</note> and euerie
time loſt a goodly and floriſhing armie, able to haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
a farre greater matter then they could hope for
by getting the henrouſt (if I may ſo tearme it.) The yeare
after the battell of Lepanto the armie of the confederates,<note place="margin">1572.</note>
which was then in the Leuant, hauing their forces aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the arriuall of <hi>Don Iohn,</hi> made <hi>Ochiallo</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the Turkiſh armie, retire to Modon, as fearing thoſe
of whom he had made triall the yeere before. If they had
put him to it as they ſhould haue done, no doubt but they
had found him diſmaide, and hardly beſtead how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
as well the fortreſſes as his armie by ſea: for he had
not left aboue 60. gallies, to garde the hauen, and had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
the reſt of his forces one yeare. But when he ſawe
they went to beſiege Nauaria neere Modon, and that they
had no ſaying to him at his landing, as he feared they
would, he tooke heart at graſſe, and after made a ieſt of
the deſignes of the Chriſtians armie, which he in ſuch ſort
held plaie and entertained, as it performed nothing woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
ſuch a power aſſembled immediately vpon the good
ſucceſſe of a former victory.</p>
               <p>3 The Turkes in what concerneth the ordering, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie,
and aſſurance, in their enterpriſes, ſurpaſſe (to ſay
the very trueth) all other nations for well managing of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affaires: for they neuer attempted place that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
thereof was not farre more woorth then the paine
they emploied about it; or that the enterpriſe did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
the like or more expence: carying themſelues thus,
they are by the effect of their enterpriſes growne mightie,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8135:34"/>
for force and meanes, and haue opened the way to the
encreaſe of their greatneſſe and ſucceſſe of their affaires:
which in ſuch ſort aſſuring (wherein they haue aimed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
at profit) they haue more and more weakened our
forces, not without an euident conſequence of extreame
danger: when they tooke in hand the conqueſt of <hi>Cypres,</hi>
they were wiſe enough not to beſtow time in taking <hi>Cery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi>
a fortres almoſt impregnable. They foreſaw that it
was of ſmall moment, at the leaſt not to import much in
that they intended to compaſſe, but they rather directed
their courſe and indeuours againſt <hi>Nicoſia,</hi> as againſt the
principall place of all the Iland, whereabouts they ſo well
imploied their paines as they caried it. By which conqueſt
it was found that <hi>Cerynes</hi> ſoone followed, (as of a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conſequence) the diſaſter of their capitall towne.</p>
               <p>4 In all the executions of their hardy deſſignes they
haue alwaies at the very firſt beene Maſters of the field,
which hath ſo furthered them as thereby the ſtrongeſt
holds of the country, which they could not otherwiſe
haue gotten but by force of armes, haue beene ſurrendred
vp vnto them. Such fortreſſes being vnable long to hold
out when all hope of ſuccour is caſt off by the oppoſition
of ſo ſtrong and mighty armies as theirs are.</p>
               <p>5 At the war of <hi>Malta</hi> it ſeemeth God did dull them,<note place="margin">1560.</note>
ouerthrowing the policies and practiſes which are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
with them. For the <hi>Baſſa</hi> (who would needes begin
with <hi>S. Hermes</hi> becauſe it ſeemed commodious to ſtop vp
the hauen and after to get the ſuburbs where the knights
made their aboade) conſumed much time about it, and
loſt the better part of his beſt ſouldiours. In the meane
ſpace the ſeaſon of the yeare ſpent ſo faſt, and the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and valour of them in the towne prooued ſuch, as in
the end he grew confounded, perceiuing too late how
flenderly he had preuailed, and that he muſt neceſſarilie
begin a new with the principall place, which he ſhould
haue at the firſt attempted, if God (as I ſaid) for the good
of Chriſtendome, had not blinded him in his enterpriſe.

2 And to ſay the truth, in all a mans actions. There is
nothing more commendable then to be able to make the
beſt vſe of occaſion and eſpecially in mater of war. In as
much as he that knoweth his aduantage, how to take it and
to carry the time before him is furniſhed with the principall
adorning vertue of a Captaine, occaſion being no other
thing, then an opportunity that the time more by accident

of what we haue in hand, and for the abſtaining and well
comming off from a deſſine vnſeſonably attempted, as the
euent of the aboue mentioned interpriſe may ſufficiently

times as God hath made them his inſtruments to afflict
and chaſtice vs, and this is that we ought to doe againſt
them, for the glorifying of Gods diuine Maieſty, not yet
for ought I ſee pleaſed with vs. In a word all ſuch as haue
inlarged their eſtates haue either inioyed or hammered
out ſome notable occaſion which they wiſely laid hold
on, and haue conſequently reaped the fruites of an vnuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
aduancement. The Grecian and Romane hiſtories can
teach vs this, but I omit them as too far from vs, to betake
my ſelfe to ſuch as are more familiar and neere vnto vs.

               <p>This miſchief grew greater at ſuch time as ſome Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates

land at Nice and in Corſica, leading captiue at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
an infinite multitude of poore Chriſtians, (without
reſpect of amitie, age, or ſexe, which they ſnatched vp in
thoſe places and along the Adriatick coaſts.</p>
               <p>The ſixt occaſion obſerued and embraced by the
Turkes,<note place="margin">6. occaſ. the plurality of the Chriſtian Princes.</note> may be ſaid in my opinion to proceed from the
conſideration they haue had of the pluralitie of Chriſtian
Princes, ſuppoſing (as it is true) that it could not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that iealouſie and ſuſpicion which ech man particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceiueth of his owne eſtate, ranke, and dignitie, and
and ſo the whole being deuided into diuers gouernments,
it muſt follow the parts ſhould be more feeble and ſcanted
of meanes to vndertake againſt him: ſince (as we haue
ſaide) vertue vnited in one entire body, is alwaies more
ſtrong then ſeparated into many parcels. That which is
woorſe, is, that in this diuiſion of Monarchies, the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
thirſt of greatneſſe, hath taken dangerous footing
amongſt Princes, and hath bred (as by a neceſſarie conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence)
diſcord, ſeparation of willes, diuerſitie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes,
and varietie of pretences, of all which partialities,
hath ſprung ſuſpition, the common plague amongſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
This ſuſpicion like a canker hath contaminated the
vnion and rid the meanes how to knit and eſtabliſh a holy
league and confidence amongſt them for a defenſiue or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue
war.</p>
               <p>4 Now to make a defenſiue league againſt the Turke is
in theſe daies a hard matter in ſo much as the princes of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:8135:37"/>
Chriſtendome are ſo far from one another, and ſome eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
from the enemy, as like men out of danger they
weigh it not eſteeming themſelues moſt aſſured: And to
vndertake to eſtabliſh an offenſiue league is no leſſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
ſeeing the profit of their conqueſt cannot be drawne
to a proportionable equality, it may be alſo euery man
feares the greatneſſe of his companion (although neuer ſo
much his partner for aide and common aſſociation) but
aboue all he that hath the moſt commodious hauens or his
Prouinces moſt proper for the mannaging of the war. Or
elſe he who can better maintaine his conqueſts would
proue the moſt ſuſpected and maligned. Theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hinder them from vniting and aſſembling themſelues
as they ought for the common good.</p>
               <p>5 Moreouer euery one flattereth himſelfe that time and
the worlds ordinarie change will breede ruine and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the eſtate of the <hi>Ottomans,</hi> and ſettle their affaires
without being conſtrained to expoſe themſelues to dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
trauell, and charge.</p>
               <p>6 Another reaſon and inconuenience may yet be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
that each of theſe princes being weake in reſpect of the
other they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſo couragiouſly reſolue to vndertake what
were profitable and neceſſary for them; whence it groweth
that the feebleneſſe of their ſtrength is yet made more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by this irreſolution; ſo as a mighty power charging
them they ſhal remain ſubiect to the diſcretion of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcreet
enemy: by theſe means the lords of the ſeueral parts
of Lombardy became the pray of the <hi>Venetians</hi> who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
them with as much facility as reſolution; But had
the repulſe when they attempted the ſtate of <hi>Milan,</hi> vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
limit of their power, dominion, and conqueſts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſame ſort alſo the French in time paſt brought vnder
all the Prouinces of <hi>Gaull,</hi> but when they would enter the
confines of Spain, the oppoſition of that neighbour-great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
ſtopped their courſe and was a rampart to defend
them from further proceedings. In the very like manner
the Turkes hauing deuoured all the Princes of Greece,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:8135:38"/>
                  <hi>Macedonia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1408.</note> 
                  <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> and <hi>Seruia</hi> attempting the inuaſion of
Hungaria,<note place="margin">1412.</note> they had their hands full, ſince the valour of
theſe Kings and people (ſo faſhioned,<note place="margin">1438.</note> hardned and enured,
of a long time to the wars, as they were the better able to
make head againſt them) diſcouered it ſelfe to be greater
then the conſideration of their indifferent eſtate could well
beare, as witneſſe the exploits of <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> and <hi>Mathias
Coruin,</hi> who found the Turkes play to their coſt. But ſo
ſoone as thoſe Kings and people did forgoe this firſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
and ſuffered the exerciſe of armes to degenerat,<note place="margin">1521.</note> 
                  <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
ouercame them both at <hi>Belgrade</hi> and at <hi>Mogacia.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1526.</note> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Turks had gone thus far, they met with that bar of
the houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> ſeconded by the German forces, and
ſupported by the power of the king of Spaine; who ſhewed
himſelfe alwaies feareleſſe of the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> forces: As for the
<hi>Venetians</hi> they haue euermore (backt with the Popes and
the Spaniards power) behaued themſelues moſt honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly:
one happineſſe there is that thoſe places of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which border neereſt vpon the Turke were neuer in
more mighty hands, nor had euer ſo few Princes to rule
them, as at this day: whence groweth an infallible conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
that they are more eaſily defended and maintained,
eſpecially hauing that particular coniunction of the power
of Spaine, which is ſuch as the Turke cannot ſtur without
incurring an apparant danger; It being manifeſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that the king of Spaine is of ability without feare to
reſiſt him, he can alſo with his owne forces curbe him and
bring him to reaſon. So as the Turke awed by ſo mighty a
king, will not, as he was wont, ſo ſo one bend his forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Chriſtians his neighbours. The Muſcouit on
the one ſide, and the kings of Polonia and Perſia on the
other, are of ſuch power and courage, as they will alwaies
make the fame of their particular forces, to be both reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
and feared.</p>

               <p>But for the ninth,<note place="margin">9 Occaſion: the Turkes peace with ſome Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, to warre with others.</note> let vs conſider what ſubtilties they
haue practized, and whereon that hath beene principally
grounded. I am of opinion, that the better to order their
affaires, and ſeize vpon the Chriſtians with more ſecurity,
their leagues, treaties of peace, and ſuſpenſions of armes,
paſſed betweene them and our Princes, haue beene their
greateſt furtherances: for the Turkes neuer warred with
anie Chriſtian Prince or Infidel either to defend their
owne eſtate, or with hoſtilitie to aſſaile an others,
but they firſt of all made their countrey ſure againſt
the power of their neighbours, but aboue all, ſuch as (ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them elſewhere buſied) had meanes to diſquiet their
affaires, inuade their territories, and aſſaile them at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.
The peace they haue ſo long maintained, with the
Polonians can teſtifie as much: Againe the quiet they
haue ſuffered the <hi>Venetians</hi> to inioy for theſe many yeares
ſufficiently bewraieth with what care they handle this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe.
The continued peace they keepe with the French
teacheth vs likewiſe with what prouidence and wiſdome
their matters are caried; to the end not to receiue any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combrance
or interruption by meanes of ſtrange enmities,
at ſuch time as they proceed in their enterpriſes; They take
truce with the Emperour alwaies to their aduantage; and
lately intending to war vpon Perſia they dealt for a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of armes with the King of Spaine, ſo as making all ſure
on one ſide they in a trice aſſaile the other, heereby ſo
well playing their parts, as hauing the law in their hands
they remaine as arbitrators of peace and war, purſuing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:8135:39"/>
the courſe of their deſſines with an aduantage too
great vnworthy and preiudicious to the Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome;
whoſe greater part is ſo awed by their forces,
as they haue often choſen to enter into conditions of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt
peace or truce though neuer ſo vnaſſured, rather
then to expoſe themſelues to the danger of their mighty
armies: not heeding that thereby they haue loſt many faire
occaſions of doing good vpon them: whereof we neede
not ſeeke farther for examples then now that the King of
<hi>Perſia</hi> keepeth them in continuall war (at leaſt if ſuch newes
as comes thence be true) and that he hath lately giuen them
an ouerthrow neere <hi>Taurijs</hi> of aboue foure ſcore thouſand
men. Which if it be ſo, what better occaſion can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
(ô ye Princes of <hi>Chriſtendome</hi>) to ſet vpon them and
reuenge the diſhonour of our paſſed iniuries? Can it be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
but that in their former incounters and in this laſt
they muſt haue loſt the flower of their captaines and choice
ſouldiours, and is it poſſible that the ſwelling pride of their
command and greatneſſe ſhould not ſhortly vndergoe
ſome change and decreaſe if you will intertain the occaſion
which God offereth you? ô but you ſleepe and are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
vnprouided to aſſaile them. They are our ſins that
hinder vs and haue bred the diſorders of ciuill wars which
diſquiet France and the Low countries, with ſuch obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and cruelty as theſe Princes haue worke enough to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their owne affaires: their neighbours in the meane time
hauing their eares filled with the noice thereof, looking
what will become of ſuch ſturs and fearing leſt the fire
which ſo cruelly burneth their neighbours houſe, ſhould
faſten vpon theirs, which makes them ſtand vpon their
guard to keepe out ſuch broiles &amp; diſorders. In the mean
time the Turke wanteth no time to recouer his loſſes; and
to laugh at oure inconſiderate follies; follies indeede for
vs, but wiſdome for him. It is a maruelous matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with what ſucces and aduice he hath quieted his
neighbours, in ſuch ſort as he hath beene neuer knowen to
haue had two quarrels in hand at one time. Imitating

heerein the wiſdome of the Romans who had an eſpeciall
care not to haue two enemies to deale with at once, but if
they aſſailed one, they tooke order by deuice and friendly

trauailes. <hi>Selim</hi> the firſt, which warred with the Perſians,

and what fearefull ruine to the <hi>Turke,</hi> if by ſome holy

ſhould haue beene no memory of them, whereas they are
now moſt mighty, and moſt dreadfull. If we will deſcend to
particulars, was there euer Prince that had better meanes to
conquer the <hi>Turke</hi> then <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth? For beſides his
valour, inuincible courage, and other notable parts which
ſhined in him, he had ſufficient force to execute his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes:
he was followed by Captaines of incomparable
vertue, his ſouldiers were moſt reſolute, his people and
Prouinces were all moſt deſirous of ſo holy a war, he had
hauens and roades fit wherein to harbour his ſhips, and in
a word he had whatſoeuer was neceſſary, but how? He
was alwaies conſtrained to haue an eie behinde him, to
ſtand vpon his gard, becauſe of his neighbours who ſpared
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:8135:40"/>
not to moleſt him as ſoone as he did but once aime at ſo
holy an interpriſe. King Philip his ſonne hath met with the
like incombrances: ſo as we may well ſay our ſinnes haue
miniſtred occaſions enowe to the Turkes to aſſaile vs with
ſuch aduantage, as it hath beene an increaſe and eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
to his eſtate, we alwaies ſhrinking at the cruell ſhocke

1 <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe this Chapter, in regard of the
continuance of the matter in handling,
is but as one dependencie and coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with the former, we will ſtill make
vſe of this word Occaſion, heeretofore
diſcourſed vpon, as of a table wherein
is repreſented all whatſoeuer our forefathers haue concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of it; and what we ought to admit thereof: following
this path we are to remember that who in time laieth not
hold on occaſion, ſhall neuer more inioy a like time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
it with the like commoditie of wel doing as he once
had, if he had knowne how to entertaine it as hee ought.
To diſcouer then the opportunitie of affaires, is not al that
is required:<note place="margin">Veg. lib. 3. c. 26.</note> That which moſt importeth, is to ſerue our
turnes with it at an inſtant, when it preſenteth it ſelfe, to
guide our intentions to that perfection we aime at.</p>
               <p>2 Celeritie is an eſpeciall matter in all affaires of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
but aboue all in the warres, wherein it is more neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie
then in any our actions. Becauſe (as ſaide <hi>Selim</hi> the
firſt) the leaſt delay we therin vſe, turneth to a groſſe error,
eſpecially ſince it bereaues vs of the commoditie and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
offered to put in execution, what we had wiſely
and with ſtudie determined: <hi>Hannibal</hi> a woorthy and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
captaine, was noted of ſlowneſſe, not in reſoluing
but in embracing his occaſions of victory which might
haue aſſuredly eſtabliſhed his affaires. That great <hi>Pompey</hi>
was likewiſe ſubiect to the ſame imperfection, which did
vtterly vndoe him. In a word, no motion wanting ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
can be of much force, or produce woorthy effects:
Violent agitations looſe alike their force with their ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
but ſuch as are naturall attaine it, and fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
in it.</p>
               <p>3 This is that the Turkes know well enough how to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
faſhioning themſelues to quickneſſe, nimbleneſſe,
habilitie, and to a certaine ſtore of whatſoeuer may ſeeme
neceſſarie to that purpoſe, ſo as their promptneſſe and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8135:41"/>
forecaſt hath neuer omitted the occaſions preſented vnto
them without reaping the fruites and glory thereof.</p>
               <p>4 But ſome one will ſay, that it is requiſite for the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainneſſe
of occaſion that many things relie in the power
of him that will follow this courſe. I grant it, for they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
who will fitly make vſe of ſuch aduantage, muſt be
alwaies in armes, and heerein alſo the Turke ſurpaſſeth vs,
for he continually entertaineth ſo many ſouldiers, as it were
hard to take him vnprouided, or to finde him (when need
requireth) without a mightie army, which ſerueth to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him, and to awake his courage: but aboue all, he hath
ſo great a number of horſe ordinarily in a readineſſe, as that
is but too ſufficient to make him proudly humour his
owne will; ſo as thought and execution are in a manner
one with him. This is yet farther accompanied with a
powerfull commoditie which addeth facillititie to his
promptneſſe; and this is, that his horſe and foot are light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed, and without incombrance of luggage, ſo as by
this meanes he more eaſily aſſembleth his troups, ordreth
them, and conducteth them whereſoeuer he pleaſeth,
without diſtinction of time. Againe, ſobrietie and ſparing
(familiar among his ſouldiers) make much to the aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his enterpriſes, contenting themſelues, as they do
to drinke water and eat rice and ſalted fleſh, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into powder, ſo as euery one carrieth with him his
prouiſion almoſt for a moneth, and when that faileth, they
liue by the bloud of their horſes, which they ſalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
like as doe the Muſcouites and Tartars.</p>
               <p>5 On the other ſide, when our ſouldiers march, they
muſt haue ſuch ſtore of munition follow them, to their ſo
ſtrange confuſion and hinderance, as they are neuer able
to goe thorow ſpeedily with any notable attempt. This
bringeth a twofold let to their enterpriſes. The firſt in their
prouiſion, which in the vnmeaſurableneſſe thereof is neuer
made in due time. The ſecond, in the conuoy thereof, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſo well ordered as it ought, whereof the euent of the
enterpriſe of <hi>Exechium,</hi> is but too true a teſtimonie, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:8135:41"/>
ſouldiers then ſuffering more in regard of the famine and
difficultie of conueying victuals vnto them,<note place="margin">1538.</note> then of-the
enemies forces.<note place="margin">Qui frumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umque com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meatum non praeparat vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur ſine ferro. Liu. l. 3. c. 26.</note> Whoſe attempt had beene vnprofitable if
the campe had not beene diſordered by this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
whereby the ſouldiers became halfe dead for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and grew ſo feeble, as the courage to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vtterly failed them. Which the General of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh
armie foreſeeing, waited till ſuch time, as the famine
had brought them low, and made them ſtrengthleſſe, that
he might vpon their enforced retrait aſſaile them behinde,
and ſo wearie them with continuall skirmiſhing as they
ſhould at length chace and ouerthrow themſelues, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it came to paſſe. I remember I haue heard one wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
to be credited,<note place="margin">1557.</note> ſay to this purpoſe; that when <hi>Emanuel
Philibert</hi> Duke of Sauoy, deceaſſed, was Generall of the
armie in Flanders, he found no difficultie in the wars more
important then the diſcommoditie of proportioning and
carriage of neceſſarie prouiſion as he had oftentimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued.
On the contrarie, it may be ſaid to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ſhame and confuſion, that neuer any of the Turkiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
were knowen, through ſuch default, to ſuffer extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
or to be diſordered.</p>
               <p>6 Let vs now come to the point of ſodaine execution,
and to the inſtruments thereof, and let vs dwell ſomewhat
thereupon. I finde the moſt neceſſarie and profitable is to
haue alwaies ſtore of money in our coffers: and that is a
hard matter, eſpecially for ſuch as are not prouident, and
that in all things ſo pamper themſelues as the Chriſtians
doe; but not for the Turke, for he hath (when and what
he will) in ſtore to ſerue his need for the warres, and for
whatſoeuer belongeth thereto. This is the ſinew of warre,
and the onely meanes to haſten forward occaſion, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
(as he doth) to a happie end of his enterpriſes, but at
his returne home, he obſerueth a barbarous and inſolent
courſe of rembourſing his charge: After he hath perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
what he vndertooke, he repaieth himſelfe by new im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
whereto he enforceth his ſubiects to contribute:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8135:42"/>
This to him is eaſie: but to vs the moſt difficult materiall
point is the procuring of money: for the greater part of
Chriſtian Princes are ſo bad husbands and of ſo ſmall fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſte,
that they haue ſcarce one croſſe in ſtore: and are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
at the borrowing hand, or enforced to pawne their
lands and demaines. And though the Chriſtians be not
ſo couetous as the Turkes, yet they are of ſo good a
hold faſt, as no ſmall time will ſerue to draw money from
them, ſo as while that is doing, occaſion hath alreadie
turned her backe and left vs nought, but the ſhame and
ſorrow of our enterpriſes ill ſucceſſe and effect. And if it
chance that we hold on our courſes, it is with ſuch head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
raſhneſſe and ill aduice in all we doe, but particularly
in prouiding of armes, horſe, munition, and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,
as all being performed out of ſeaſon, there is neither
the forwardneſſe, the array, the election, the aboundance,
the reſolution, nor the well diſpoſing of matters which
would otherwiſe haue beene, and which we ſee to be in our
aduerſaries.</p>
               <p>7 There is another thing which addeth much aſſurance
to the Turkes deſignes, and makes them more eaſily to
execute: and this is the incredible obedience of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
towards their Generall, and of the ſouldiours to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their Captaines and ſuch is the loue amongſt them
as there is no danger or difficulty (be it neuer ſo great)
which they will not eaſily ouercome, ſo willingly they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
what is inioyned them. It was neuer heard that any
reuolt or mutiny ſtopt or ſlacked the courſe of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p>8 They haue yet another moſt conſiderable aduantage
and that is the ſtrong conſtitution of their men, ſpirit and
ſpeed of their horſe. Where on the contrary our forces
dare ſcarce bouge vnleſſe they be backed and ſtrengthned
by forrain ſuccors either <hi>Almines</hi> or <hi>Switzers,</hi> people faint
and of little courage vpon a ſodaine and vnexpected acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as being framed of a dull and ſlow mettall ſeruing for
nought but to make good the intire body of a battaile, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8135:42"/>
be vnto it as a ſolide and vnmoueable rampart.<note place="margin">1542.</note> The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters
they haue had with the Turke at <hi>Buda</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
haue taught vs how vnprofitable they are &amp; of how
ſlender effect for the ſpeedy and happy aduancement of
the affaires of Chriſtendome in thoſe parts: Moreouer the
Turkes horſe are of more ſpeede and ſtrength then ours:
the ſpaniſh Genet is indeede nimble and full of Spirit, but
wanteth ſtrength and breath: Contrariwiſe the horſe of
Germany is able and ſtrong but tender withall and not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
vpon the hand, ſo as he is more proper to make a ſtand
and defend then to aſſaile, skirmiſh, or giue the chace.
The <hi>Napolitane</hi> is good and ſtrong but of ſuch a nimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
as is not held for perfect ſpeede, on the other ſide
the enemy hath the <hi>Hungarian</hi> good for ſeruice, the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary</hi>
horſe of incredible ſwiftneſſe, the <hi>Valachian,</hi> the <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh,</hi>
and the <hi>Moore</hi> almoſt hard for induring of trauaile and
well breathed, ſo as we may conclude that he inioyeth
whatſoeuer is neceſſary for the war, better, more redy, and
in greater aboundance then we, and that this is it which
makes him ſpeedily and with aduantage, to ſerue his turne
with all occaſions which preſent themſelues.</p>
               <p>9 There are ſo many examples of this aduantageous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity
in their actions as they are almoſt innumerable; but
I will only note two or three which may ſeeme in a manner
prodigious ſo admirable hath beene their ſucceſſe. <hi>Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath</hi>
the ſecond hauing intelligence of the great forces lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied
by <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> (with whom he had
formerly concluded a peace) with an intent to ouerrunne
him,<note place="margin">1444.</note> being then buſie in the wars of <hi>Caramania;</hi> he ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly
quitted that interpriſe, and with ſuch maruelous
ſpeed croſſed all the <hi>Heleſpont</hi> as in ſeuen daies he ariued at
<hi>Varna</hi> with fower ſcore thouſand men, In like manner <hi>Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Baſſa</hi> imploied by <hi>Baiazet</hi> the ſecond to diuert the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the <hi>Venetians</hi> vpon <hi>Milan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1498.</note> came with ſuch extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
ſpeed as he appeered in the territory of <hi>Treuiſo</hi>
before they could haue newes ſo much as of his departure,
leſſe of his arriuall in thoſe parts.<note place="margin">1516.</note> 
                  <hi>Selim</hi> the firſt marched ſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:8135:43"/>
ſpeedily from <hi>Ceſaria</hi> to <hi>Aleppo,</hi> croſſing the mountaine
Aman with his army and artillery, as he came vpon the
<hi>Souldan</hi> before he dreampt of him ſuppoſing him to be as
then rather vpon his way to encounter the Perſian then to
attempt him.</p>
               <p>10 This particular dilligence of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> is not to be
limited all only with their land wars: they haue performed
as much by ſea, ſo vigilant and wary haue they ſhewed
themſelues in exalting the honour of their names, and of
their great eſtate, by them maintained euen vnto this day:
And ſince they are ſo incredibly nimble and aduiſed in
maritine exploits, I hold it not from the purpoſe to touch
briefly the order they obſerue in aſſembling their forces.
They reiect the veſſels and ſhips of great burden as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heauy
and vnwealdy if the wind faile them, rather hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
then furthering him that conducteth them. Their
Gallies and Galliots are ſpeedy, well manned and well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>11 Wee on the contrary drag with vs a great number of
ſhips and Gallions as our beſt ſtrength and choice prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but they are in proofe the cauſe of ſuch incombrance
to the ſeruice in hand, as we for the moſt part waſte the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
vnprofitably and ſpend our opertunities in rigging
and attending them; being alſo oft times enforced to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
our Gallies, to the end theſe great cartes may keepe
with vs. Hence groweth yet another diſcommodity, and
that is, that hauing placed a kinde of hope in our ſhips, we
in forgoing them, finde our ſelues too weake and failing of
courage to aſſaile the enemy; who is not to be forced to
fight but when he pleaſe,<note place="margin">Antiently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Nicoplu a city of Epirus.</note> hauing too open a field to flie
and eſpy his occaſion, as it hapned at <hi>Preueza</hi> the yeare
1537. and at the battaile of <hi>Lepanto</hi> which was the yeare
1571. for then the ſhips of the league remained behind
with a good number of ſouldiours vnprofitable for that
action, in regard they could not ariue there time enough.
The yeare after they encountred the like diſcommodity:
ſince for the very ſame cauſe the army of the league, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8135:43"/>
and mighty fought not at all, neither performed ought
worthy ſo great a preparation. And when the Gallies of
the Pope and <hi>Venetians</hi> met, and that they attended <hi>Don
Iohn</hi> (who aboade ſtill at <hi>Miſſina,</hi> becauſe of the then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
troubles of <hi>Flanders</hi>) the army of the <hi>Turk</hi> being
then commanded by <hi>Oechially,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1572.</note> he once preſented battaile,
but becauſe of the aduantage of the winde which without
other helpes draue our ſhips, and fearing the incounter of
our round veſſels, he made his eſcape by meanes of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
ſtratagem, which for the ſtrangeneſſe thereof put the
counſailes and iudgments of our army to a plunge. In
verie deede it is worthy the noting: for ſeeing the whole
ſtrength of our ſhips vnited with ſuch confederat Gallies
as were then there, make towards him, he gaue comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
that in euery one of his Gallies they ſhould put fire
to a barrell of powder and row backewards (not making
for al this any ſhew of flight, the prowes of their gallies ſtill
appeering towards them) and as ſoone as the ſmoake had
couered his fleete he halled on a maine, and in an inſtant
hoiſſing vp al his ſailes ſhaped his courſe to <hi>Napolis</hi> in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mania,</hi>
our ſhips not daring to follow him.</p>
               <p>In regarde he had gotten the aduantage of them they
bearing but their mizen ſailes, and knowing how dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
it was for them being ignorant of his deſignes, to
breake company: eight daies after we comming neere to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
there followed ſome light skirmiſhes, but ſo ſoone
as they perceiued vs to faint, as being depriued of our
ſhips, they charged vs with the whole army, in like ſort as
when we had them for ſuccour they retired. So as it was
then found by experience that the great ſhips ſerued but to
keepe vs from buckling with the enemy.</p>
               <p>I haue made mention of this incountre in my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
of the notable occurrants of theſe times written in
Latine, and ſomewhat more at large then I heere deliuer,
for I was preſent in the army during all that voiage, vnder

as they muſt of force, as it were, make their valour appeare,
eſpecially when they ioine battell where the Maieſtie and
life of the Prince, yea and their owne too is in hazard.
Then is it that the honeſt deſire of preſeruing their maſters

how much it is farre more pretious then the life of a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

more then any other moueth them more freely to hazard

buſhels, yet <hi>Odet de Lautrey</hi> his lieutenant generall, loſt the
Duchy of Millan for lacke of three hundred thouſand
crownes that were aſſigned him for his charges, but were
neuer deliuered him. Whereupon the Switzers failing of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8135:45"/>
their entertainment (whom he had till then fed with hopes
of pay) he was conſtrained to fight with ſuch diſaduantage
as hee miſcaried,<note place="margin">1522. Guic. lib. 14.</note> and his whole army was put to flight;
which had not happened if the King had beene there in
perſon, for either money had not failed, or elſe the credit
and authority that accompanieth the Princes preſence
had wrought them to patience and contained them in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
deuotion.</p>
               <p>4 Moreouer the great train of Nobility and men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
that the Prince bringeth with him is a ſtrengthening to
his army, and addeth to it life and beauty, euery man ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
to appeare more gallant then other; which they would
not vouchſafe to doe nor to ſubiect themſelues, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
but by an ordinary Generall; for there are alwaies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the King, by election or neceſſity, many great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages
equall in power and dignity, and ſome differing too
in rancke and charge, either as being Princes of the bloud,
or for honor and authority woon by deſert, al which would
perhaps doe little for the Generall, but would moſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
obey and expoſe all for their King and maſter to
whom they owe a duty both of nature and benefit. Theſe
great mens followers ſerue alſo to increaſe the army.</p>
               <p>5 Beſide theſe conſiderations the King bringeth euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
with him a reſolution of his enterpriſes, wherein a
Generall moſt commonly proceedeth with a reſtraint and
aduiſe, as fearing in his too forward attempting, to exceed
his commiſſion. In the meane while, time paſſeth, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
eſcapeth, moſt often to the Princes hinderance and
blot to his reputation.</p>
               <p>6 In this regard if the wiſedome and loyalty of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
be approued, Princes ought not too ſtrictly to limit
their charges: but if they doubt of them, it is indiſcretion
to put them into their hands, as we may ſee by theſe exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
<hi>Don Emanuel</hi> King of Portugal hauing ſent the Duke
of Braganza General into Africke, he fortunately wan and
made ſure for his Prince the towne of Aza Azamor: but
that performed hee would not take Marocco (as at that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8135:45"/>
time he might haue eaſily done) though he were counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
thereto by the wiſeſt and greateſt of his army, becauſe
that (ſaid he) it went beyond his Commiſſion: Lopez
Zoares Generall for the ſame King loſt in like manner the
opportunity to take the city of Aden, of eſpeciall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for the affaires of his maſter (for it ſtandeth iuſt in the
mouth of the Red ſea) though the inhabitants would haue
deliuered him the keies. Inſomuch as hee ſhould haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
vpon him (as he ſaid) more then his commiſſion allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him. The thing was of that conſequence as hee might
well haue forborne the obſeruation of his faſt, to ſwallow
ſuch a morſell. Neither had the ſeruice beene one of the
leaſt, he could haue performed for his maſter.</p>
               <p>7 In concluſion we are to grant that the preſence of the
king bringeth with it a certaine greatneſſe, and more aweth
the enimy then his Lieutenant; as it was ſeene at the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of Tuniſe; for <hi>Barbaroſſa</hi> ſharply tooke vp and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
thoſe who ſaid that the Emperour Charles the fift was
himſelfe in perſon in the Chriſtian army, inferring heereby
that he ſhould then haue his hands fuller then he made
account, and that nothing could be lacking in the enemies
campe, when their Prince was there preſent. This is that
may be ſaide of the good redoundeth from the preſence of
the king in his army. Let vs now ſee what may be alledged
on the contrary.</p>
               <p>8 Firſt it may be ſaid that the King which goeth to the
wars in perſon miniſtreth greater occaſion then he would
to his enemy to prouide himſelfe of forces, meanes and
friendes: and affordeth him matter alſo of pretending a
more glorious victory, with the hopes whereof and of rich
ſpoiles, he putteth courage in his men, diſpoſing them to
attempt valiantly all things be they neuer ſo hazardous, ſo
hartning them to fight.</p>
               <p>9 It may be ſaid likewiſe that the preſence of the King
maketh his Captaines leſſe heedefull and diligent at all
occurrants and aduantages, becauſe they in part relie vpon
the vigilant eye of the Prince, who is to carry away the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8135:46"/>
whole honour of the enterpriſe, their valour remaining as
dimmed and eclipſed. This hapned at the battaile of
Pauie.<note place="margin">1523.</note> For the Commanders relying vpon the kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
and diſcreet carriage of matters, had no regard but of
their pleaſures in ſtead of diligently bethinking themſelues
of the duty of their ſeuerall charges, which in the ende
turned to the ruine and diſhonor both of their maſters and
themſelues.</p>
               <p>10 Againe an army where the King is in perſon, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
repleniſhed with Princes and great perſonages, all
which promiſing themſelues great matters, ſeeke not but
to excel one another in place and command, whence grow
among them iealoſies, enuies, and ſundry differences bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
infinite diſorders, to the ouerthrow or hinderance of
their Maſters affaires. Who is not without his part of
feare to diſcontent ſome in contenting others? This plague
of ambition, is ſuch as it will ſometimes ſo wreſt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
and honours of theſe great men, as they will not
ſticke to hinder the ſeruice of their Maſters only to oppoſe
the fortune and woorth of ſuch a one, as they ſee out-ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
them in preferment; yea oft times their ambition
groweth ſo extreame, as for deſpitethey wil vtterly forſake
their Princes ſeruice: Their vertue and valour being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
in the meane time not of the meaneſt, and ſuch as if
it were well imploied would gaine honour and victory to
the army.</p>
               <p>11 There is yet another diſcommodity, and that is, that
the king carying with him the party, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his abſence he
intendeth to conſtitute his Lieutenant, he in the mean time
repineth at his Maſters worthy exploites, conſidering how
the honour ſhould haue beene his, if alone he had the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
of the army; againe, knowing that all ſuch misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
or diſcomfitures, as may befall, it ſhall be attributed
to the inſufficiencie of the Prince, and not to him, he the
leſſe regardeth it. In a word, the glory we pretend, and
the iealouſie we haue of our particular honors, are two
eſpeciall powers, to ſhake and curbe generous ſpirits. The
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8135:46"/>
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, had ſufficient triall of it: for
ſome of his Captaines and Lieutenants could oft times
with ſmall ſtore of money, and few men, gaine triumphant
victories, as well at Milan and Naples as elſe where, which
perhaps in preſence of the Emperour, would not haue
beene ſo fortunately atchieued.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding all that hath beene ſaid, the queſtion
is not yet fully determined, rather it remaineth diuerſly
ballancing to and fro, as appeareth by theſe and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
examples.</p>
               <p>12 <hi>Charles</hi> of France,<note place="margin">About 1364.</note> ſurnamed the Sage, neuer ſet foot
out of his ſtudie to command his armies, yet knew he ſo
well how to make the beſt vſe of his Captaines valour, and
manage his affaires ſutable to the time, that he finally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
his whole kingdome, and expelled thence the
Engliſh, who poſſeſſed the greater part thereof. On the
contrarie, the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> who warred by his
Captaines, himſelfe not ſtirring out of Vienna, receiued
great and dangerous ouerthrowes. <hi>Charles</hi> the fift, on the
other ſide, wan more honour and victories by the valour
of his Captaines, then euer he did in thoſe warres and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
himſelfe vndertooke in perſon.<note place="margin">1524.</note> If the attempt
vpon Marſeilles had taken effect, it might haue beene tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſaid that his Captaines had beene in all places victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
witneſſe Pauie, the Bicock, Landrino, Naples, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
Genoua, Rome, and Africk; but where he went in
perſon, as in Saxony, at Tunis, Dura, and Vienna, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
prooued indifferent betweene good and bad. But at
Argiers, in Piemont, and at Metz, he encountred on all
ſides ſuch misfortune, as it deemed (as a man may ſay) the
luſter of his renowne and victories formerly gained.</p>
               <p>13 Marke the effects of ſucceſſe and fortune ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
as it were a hard matter to paſſe a ſound and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
iudgement vpon this propoſition: ſo as the more I
imagine by the contrarietie of theſe examples to inlighten
it, the more obſcure me thinkes I make it; the finall deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
thereof, may be framed thus. The King which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaketh
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8135:47"/>
the conduct of an armie, is either a diſcreet and
aduiſed Captaine, or elſe he is altogither vnskilled in the
myſterie of warre. In this laſt caſe I ſhould thinke that it
were moſt for his good, to relie vpon an others relation
and execution, eſpecially if priuie to his owne imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
he want a dexteritie to make the beſt vſe of another
mans valour, wiſedome and counſaile. But if ſo be he be
capable of the gouernment, and conduct of an armie, and
that he haue courage to execute, in mine opinion he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe better then to vndertake the warre and attempt
himſelfe in perſon: for if in all militarie vertues he equall
the moſt valiant of his armie, he will ſurpaſſe them in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
credit, and authoritie, and in all the other good parts
aboue mentioned. Kings compounded of theſe excellent
parts, alwaies crowne their eminency with honourable tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes.
<hi>Theodoſius</hi> the Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great,
and ſundrie others can witneſſe this ſufficiently; <hi>Lewes</hi>
the 12. of France, hauing beene alwaies conquerour, and
neuer conquered in whatſoeuer he vndertooke himſelfe in
perſon, was put beſides the kingdome of Naples, by means
of a battaile which his captaines loſt neere the riuer of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillion,<note place="margin">1503. Guicc. lib. 6.</note>
for lacke of reſolution and aduice; which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
was by that good prince ſo lamented, as he made
a vow, thence forward to command perſonally in his wars;
And to ſay the truth, if the Captaine be not diſcreet, vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
and of long approoued experience, it is ſtrange if he
euer performe woorthy act: in ſuch caſes the preſence of
one only <hi>Turnus</hi> is more auaileable then of a thouſand
ſuch Captaines.</p>
               <p>14 The Turkiſh Emperours who goe themſelues to the
wars, haue taſted the ſweetneſſe thereof by ſo many and ſo
notable victories, as we are at this day their admirers.
<hi>Selim</hi> the firſt was wont to ſay that battailes gained in the
Princes abſence were not to be tearmed accompliſhed vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories,
and we ſee that they haue ſcarce euer enterpriſed
ought which hath not taken effect in the ende. Yea it hath
beene obſerued that when their Captaines haue beene
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8135:47"/>
ouerthrowne, if they themſelues went afterward in perſon,
they alwaies returned victorious. <hi>Amurath</hi> the ſecond
went himſelfe after <hi>Carambeius</hi> generall of his army (who
was ouerthrowen by <hi>Ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Polonia</hi>) to war vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that Prince,<note place="margin">1444.</note> whom he ouercame and cut his whol army
in peeces:<note place="margin">1481. 1522.</note> 
                  <hi>Mezat Baſſa</hi> was imploied by <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
in the enterpriſe of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> which he ſhamefully aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned;
but <hi>Soliman</hi> going himſelfe in perſon, caried it by
plaine force, and chaſed thence the Knights of Saint Iohn
of Ieruſalem, who diſquieted his eſtate by their ordinary
excurſions in the Leuant.<note place="margin">1469. &amp; 1407. 1474. 1583.</note> 
                  <hi>Amurath</hi> Captaine of the ſaid
<hi>Mahomet</hi> receiued a notable ouerthrow at the hands of
<hi>Vſumcaſſan</hi> King of Perſia: but <hi>Mahomet</hi> going after him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in perſon vanquiſhed the enemy already victorious,
and put him to a deſperat plunge. The <hi>Mamelucks</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw
<hi>Querſeolus</hi> and <hi>Calubeius, Baiazet</hi> the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders:
<hi>Selim</hi> the firſt after perſonally vndertaking them,
ouercame them, and wholy rooted out both them and their
Empire. <hi>Amurath</hi> the third now raigning hath been ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times beaten by <hi>Cudabenda</hi> King of Perſia in perſon, and
through the vnskilfulneſſe of his Commanders, that a man
may well ſay that neuer any of the race of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
ſo notable ouerthrowes as this hath: Whereto
may be added,<note place="margin">1585.</note> that he met with laſt of all before <hi>Taures;</hi>
where he loſt about 80000. men together with the <hi>Baſſa</hi>
Generall of his army; a great blot to the glory of his ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
yet the loſſe being ſo far off from his eſtate, he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
not ſo great a ſhake as if it had beene neere him or in

               <p>15 But who will take hold of ſuch aduantages to doe
good vpon him, ſeeing the greateſt Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
are turmoiled in ciuill wars and troubles of their
owne eſtates? ſurely none: Nay rather he is like to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſtrength more then euer, which he would not ſo eaſily
doe, if he were to incounter the Chriſtians well appointed,
reſolute and in a readineſſe ioyntly, and with one conſent to

any one thing of what ſoeuer may perfect his deſigne,
which he ought to conceale and keepe to himſelfe all he
may. We haue one notable example hereof yet freſh in
memory, and that is of the Prince of Parma <hi>Alexander
Farneſe,</hi> who for a time had the managing of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
and wars in <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he almoſt neuer attempted
any thing which according to his intent, he did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme:
In very truth his actes were ſuch as he deſerueth to
be reckoned as one of the moſt iudicious, wiſe, and adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Princes of our age, particularly in this point of making
prouiſion of things neceſſary in due ſeaſon. And to ſay
the truth, who ſoeuer diſpoſeth his affaires, is euermore at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
on rather by ſhame, reproch, and repentance, then
honour, glory, and contentment: That Prince which once
loſeth his reputation by this default, hardly recouereth it,

he reſteth vnaſſured, doubtfull, confounded
in all his determinations, and is vncapable of conſtant and
reſolued counſaile, carying alwaies the repentance of his
former fault with a ſorow which tormenteth his verie ſoule,
ſo much the more ſtrangely, by how much ſuch a Prince is
the greater, or is well conceited of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>2 This is an aduertiſment which ſhould open the eies of

and with ſuch order and forecaſt, as there be rather
abundance then neceſſity: for when the prouiſion is ſmall
and that it neuer ſo little miſcary, it depriueth the Prince,
not of courage but of confidence and aduice, of whoſe
lacke inſueth the want of wherwithall to warrant and ſhelter
his reputation, vnleſſe it be that he will ſay, I had not
thought, words moſt dangerous in the wars where he can
erre but once, and vnwoorthy euer to proceede out of
the mouth of one wiſe and aduiſed, vnleſſe he meane that
the miſſe of theſe two vertuous partes be to be borne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</p>
               <p>3 <hi>Proſpero Colonna</hi> a great Captaine proued this to his

ſhame and diſpleaſure, vnable to performe ought of what
he too vnaduiſedly attempted. <hi>Fredericke</hi> of <hi>Boſſola</hi> met
with the like at the ſame place for want of counſaile, mony,

               <p>And though the Captaine be wiſe, yet if the armie

Turke can challenge no part in that action, yet can he make
vſe of the Chriſtian loſſes to his aduantage. Now if tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts

at Algiers and Metz, they did not leſſe at ſuch time as he
attempted the voiage of Tripoli in Barbary: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety

3 The Turke neuer fought, eſpecially by ſea, but when
the ſeaſon and opportunity would permit him.</p>
               <p>4 Some one that may perhaps long to ouerthrow this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
will alledge that the Princes of Chriſtendome haue
neuertheleſſe in the winter attempted voiages by ſea. It
may be, but I ſhould thinke it was either in regard of the
hope they had, not to incounter the Turke as they might,
in the ſommer, then for any aſſurance they had or might
haue in the well-ſpeeding of a voiage inconſiderately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temted.</p>
               <p>5 In breefe, if we muſt aduenture beyond reaſon, it were
better we did it fighting againſt the Turkes, then againſt
the windes, with the Moores then with ſtormes and ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrackes.
To ſay the very truth, our Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haue their forces and eſtates ſo far ſeparated one
from the other, that before we can reduce them to one
conſent and body; time and opportunities are fled. But
the Turke hath his powers ſo limited and ranged, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
but of one only head, as he is alwaies in a readines
to repell all aſſaults almoſt before the threatning of them
can be with him. In concluſion, if all theſe reaſons ſuffice

the leaſt to proue wiſe, reſolute &amp; aduiſed hence forward
not to enterpriſe ought ſo out of ſeaſon, as that we ſhould
be driuen to fight with time rather then men; they ſhould
teach vs to gaine rather then to loſe occaſions; to abound
rather then want; to ſeeke to be honoured and to thriue
rather then to receiue diſhonour and loſſe: but the maine

                  </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this diſcourſe, it is eaſily ſeene how hard it is for a
prince to prouide ſufficiently at one time for ſundry enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:8135:51"/>
at the leaſt vpon a ſound foundation thereby to reape
honorable fruites: ſince all diuiſion of forces bringeth
with it a debility, and becommeth rather a ſubiect of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie
then to be able to iniure others, to be beaten then to
beat, to be others pray rather then to pray vpon others: for
as a body diuided by parcells is not of that weight taking
it ſeuerally, as when it is reduced to the firſt vnitie: In like
ſort the forces of a prince, when they are diuided and
diſunited haue not that vertue and ſubſiſtance as they
would haue in their vnitie and well-ordered conſunction:
for proofe, who conſidereth that <hi>Mahomet</hi> had three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thouſand men, will ſay that the vnitie of ſuch force
was inuincible; but diuided it proued not ſo (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
each of theſe powers by it ſelf (at the leaſt in regard of
the Chriſtians) was a moſt mightie army, had it had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
ſquared to what it would attempt) and if this maſſe
of 300000. ſouldiours had marched in one intire body it
had beene eaſie for them to haue attained their purpoſe,
one ſeconding another as he might haue done with that of
Rhodes, Patros, and Ottranto, which he had in this caſe
vndoubtedly conquered.</p>
               <p>3 An other reaſon may be yet alledged, and that is, that it
is hard to finde ſuch Captaines as are fit for the conduct of
armies; that in theſe great aſſemblies of forces there are
few reſolute ſouldiours; and that they which are ſuch being
once by their diuiſion (as a man may ſay) diminiſhed, it is
a kinde of gelding the army of thoſe which may ſerue by
their example to aſſure and incourage the other confuſed
multitude.</p>
               <p>4 Moreouer when we vndertake three enterpriſes at once
(as <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who ſerueth to this purpoſe did) if it happen
but one of them to faile, the newes of their miſaduenture,
maketh the reſt (vndoubtedly depending the one vpon
the other) to faile of reſolution.</p>
               <p>5 Again, as we haue before deliuered, it is neceſſary that
the war be vndertaken in groſſe, and that aſſay be made of
our forces as ſoone as may be, that we may not be driuen

long to entertaine a great army (which for delay of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

ſelfe with it ſelfe, but eſpecially with anſwerable prouiſions
the better to inioy great happineſſe with ſmal charge; which
will neuer befall him that diuideth his forces and at once
attempteth in diuers places. We will then conclude that
the <hi>Ottomans</hi> for the moſt part haue not had but one enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
in hand at once, and that to atchieue it they haue ſo
well prouided for it, as the victory hath remained on their

ſuch people as they haue not been able at the firſt to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due,
they haue left in peace, yet haue not forborn in the
meane time to turne their armes elſewhere. I haue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned
to my ſelfe two eſpeciall cauſes of this diſcreet
courſe.</p>
               <p>2 The firſt is the feare they haue euer had leſt they
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8135:52"/>
might make good ſouldiours of thoſe againſt whom they
ſhould wilfully maintaine a lingering war. A thing ill pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
by the Spaniards in Flanders and the low-countries;
for continuing war many yeres together againſt them, they
haue acquainted that people (before ſoft and effeminate)
with the fearfull claſhe of their armes, they haue ſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and imboldened them, as at this day there are few
nations more induſtrious about their fortifications, or
more reſolute in the field.</p>
               <p>3 The other occaſion which hath withheld the Turke
from making war long time together vpon one people, is,
in mine opinion the feare he hath to incite their neighbour
Princes to take armes againſt him. For if the compaſſion &amp;
fire which burneth our neighbours houſe doc not mooue
vs, the feare of the like to light on vs will make vs beſtirre
our ſelues.</p>
               <p>4 The Turke then following theſe ſteps one while aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Venetians, deſpoiling them now of a Prouince,
then of a good towne or place of ſtrength. And hauing
there made vp his mouth he praieth next vpon the Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,
doubting leſt he might pull vpon his necke a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
league of the other of Italy. He euermore pretendeth
in ſhew that hee will attempt no further: rather that hee
meaneth to plant the vtmoſt of his limits at the place by
him laſt conquered: In the meane time he forgetteth not
to be watchfull where he may ſeaſe himſelfe of ſome other
place of more importance, more eaſily to incroch vpon vs.
After he hath gotten from the Hungarians ſome peece of
their country, he retireth himſelfe before their neighbours
be aſſembled, or that they haue meanes couragiouſly to
reuenge themſelues of their iniuries. In concluſion he ſo
well behaueth himſelfe as he hath neuer ſuffered vs to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
vpon him whatſoeuer wars he hath made vpon vs, and
he hath alwaies ſo timely made his retraite, as he hath not
enforced the neighbours of the country aſſailed to ioyne
and be in league together; he in the meane time reſting vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his aduantages of hauing a great number of ſouldiours

well trained and entertained in continuall wars whereby

the manner how he

               </p>
               <p>2 But to the purpoſe, we muſt auow that as there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
more true, ſo is there none more fauorable to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
then the Chriſtian, for the quiet and preſeruation of
their eſtate and minde. In ſomuch as this by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
ſubiecteth to the king &amp; all other ſuperiours (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
peruerſe and vitious) the heart, the perſon, &amp; goods
of the ſubiect; what greater reaſon or inſtrument of ſtate
can we meete with then that which bringeth the people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a full and perfect obedience? If our Sauiour Chriſt
ſubmitted himſelfe to the law of the Emperour and paid
taxe and cuſtom for himſelfe and Saint Peter, who will
doubt that his diſciples are not to doe the like as true obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of his precepts? I remember a diſcourſe written by the
Ieſuites of a certaine Prince of a country newly dſcouered
in India, who as one very politicke and wiſe perceiming the
ſimplicity and purity of the Chriſtian doctrine, though
himſelfe were an Idolater, permitted that his ſubiects
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:8135:53"/>
ſhould be baptized, cathechized and inſtructed in our faith;
and was preſent at their baptiſme; furthering to his power
all the actions of the Ieſuites; becauſe (ſaid he) I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
if theſe men obſerue their law as they are bound, they
will faile neither of loialty nor obedience, and will pay
me my tributes and reuenues without fraude or contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>3 Let vs now enter into the principall matter of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
which we haue vndertaken to handle. The law of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi>
is full fraught with fables and groſſe abſurdities, and
ſo far from reaſon to maintaine them, as it would be an
eaſie matter by way of ſome holy manifeſtation of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
to alter the eſtate &amp; gouernment of the Turkiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
What more ſtrange impertinency can there be then
that of their <hi>Alcaron?</hi> It is impoſſible to deuiſe more abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,
dreames and couſenings, then thoſe their law giuer
<hi>Mahomet</hi> hath introduced: but he perceiuing well enough
that the foundation of his falfe doctrine was ſuch as it
would be eaſie to ouerthrow it; knew cunningly how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
ways to remedie it. Firſt he framed all the precepts of
his law according to naturall ſenſe, and made them ſutable
to the courſe of things baſe and earthly, therby to make
their obſeruation ſo much the more pleaſing and eaſie to
be admitted and maintained, as being founded vpon the
pleaſures of the fleſh and the world; he could neuer better
charm the reaſon and lull aſleepe the ſpirite of that dull and
wholly illiterate nation, then to tie them to the performance
of a law altogether ſenſuall.</p>
               <p>4 The other meanes he held to make his law laſting, was
the expreſſe forbidding to enter into diſputation about any
one point of it, vnleſſe it were with the edge of the ſword:
In regard whereof he tearmed it, the law of the ſword.
Thus the Prince of the Turke who hath in his hand the
ſword &amp; force, is alſo conſequently the Arbitrator &amp; Iudge
of the doubts and controuerſies which ariſe in his law, and
determineth them as he ſeeth good, ſo as he is wiſe enough
to ſuffer any newe opinion to take footing. For as ſoone
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8135:54"/>
as that hapneth he turneth his ſword againſt the authours
thereof, and that with ſuch rigour and cruelty as he vtterly
rooteth them out not leauing ſo much as a ſeed or any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
of them. The troubles and diſſentions which hereſies
haue brought in amongſt the Chriſtians ſerue him for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
he ſeeth ſuch hiſtories daily verified; he is very
well informed of them, and turneth them to the beſt vſe
beyond the experience his predeceſſors haue had of ſuch
fruites as ſpring from a new interpretation of their law.
<hi>Harduclles</hi> in a very ſmall ſpace wan ſuch credit amongſt
that barbarous people, that by means of a certaine new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the points of their ſect, he buſied all Aſia,
where he ſowed ſo many troubles, as he well neere indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
the whole eſtate of <hi>Baiazet</hi> the ſecond.</p>
               <p>5 But that which maketh the law of this curſed race more
durable is, that the Emperour himſelfe obſerueth it with
that deuotion, honoreth it with that reuerence, embraceth
it with that religion, and preſerueth it in that credit and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;
as it is hard to imagine a man more deuout and
affected towards it.</p>
               <p>6 Againe, the miſery and vexations that the Turks (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of all other light but that their mother ſenſe affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them) beholde other nations diſperſed thorow their
dominions and of a contrary beleefe to indure, wholy
weddeth their dull ſoules to this falſe doctrine: neither is
there that miſery which that vile <hi>Mahometane</hi> race make
not all thoſe to ſuffer who embrace not their religion, but
aboue all the Chriſtians.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:8135:55"/>
dwelleth, and to whom belongeth the land he tilleth, he
makes no other anſweare, but that they are the great Turks
his Maſter; moreouer they all tearme themſelues ſlaues of
their Prince: whence followeth that they can not any waie
maintaine the quiet poſſeſſion of their goods, nor account
of any thing as of their owne but by his eſpeciall fauour.
Much more if they aime at raiſing themſelues to any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
place of honour they are to beg it of the magnificence
and pleaſure of their Prince; meanes which ſerue to curbe
thoſe barbarous people, yet to be reiected of Chriſtians
and abhorred of lawfull Princes, who receiue and hold
their monarchies of the hand of God. There are more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt

                  </gap> dependency fortifieth it ſelfe &amp; increaſeth by the
obedience and gouernment of great perſonages, imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Turke in his ſeruice, and faſhioned by himſelfe to
this end, who are from their infancy brought vp at the
Princes charge, and inſtructed euery one according as hee
is naturally inclined either in the excerciſes of armes or any
other laborious trade, ſo as ſuch not knowing other father
or benefactor then their ſoueraigne (from whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:8135:55"/>

to the only goood of their maſters affaires, whoſe
creatures they acknowledge themſelues to be, to whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
degree of honour they be preferred: neither is it in
their power to amaſſe other wealth then that which is
rawght them by the hands of the great Turke. To make it
more plaine to the Reader who theſe are; they are the
Spachi, Spachioglani and Ianizzars; in theſe conſiſteth
the ſtrength and guard of the Turkiſh Empire. I hold it
not amiſſe to diſcouer in a word (as by the way) what is the
forme and condition of theſe bandes and companies:
ſo to deliuer a more cleare vnderſtanding of their manner
and power. The Spachi and Spachioglani are horſe men,
whereof there are a thouſand in number, which march
at the right hand of their Lord. The Selactari or Solupta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
are other thouſand horſe, which accompany the great
Turke on the left hand, when he marcheth, as the Spaihio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glani
on the right; of theſe two companies are choſen the
Gouernours of Prouinces, and vpon theſe according to
their merit, the Turke beſtoweth his daughters in mariage.
The Vlufezgi are other thouſand which march after the
aboue named, who in part are called out of the bands of
Ianizzars, as men noted for their eſpeciall valour: or they
are ſuch as haue beene ſlaues, and for their notable ſeruice
performed toward their maſters, or for hauing ſaued the
life of ſome Baſſa or Beglerbee in the wars, attaine to this
degree of being one of the Turkes garde. The Charipies
are of like number as the Vlufezgi, and march after them.
The Ianizzars follow after, who are foote, and appointed
for the guard of the Turke: Theſe at their firſt inſtitution
were few in number, but now they amount to 4000: In
theſe two ſorts of foote and horſe, conſiſteth the ſtrength
of the Turke, being as the ſeminarie of the Sangiaks, Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſas,
and Liſirs. This great number we ſpeake of, giue no
armes or any other marke of hereditary gentry, being in
ſuch ſort ordained as they cannot attribute to themſelues
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:8135:56"/>
any thing in particular, nor attaine to any preheminence,
but ſuch as by their vertue they may inuite their Prince to
beſtow vpon them. It is the onely meanes whereby the
Turke gaineth all the obedience and loialtie he can wiſh;
obedience in regard they are (as I haue ſaid) trained vp
vnto it from their infancie, which in them turneth to a
naturall habite, placing the fruit of their labours in the
aſſurance of ſuch a ſeruitude: Loyaltie, in as much as
they expect from him their whole aduancement, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
to receiue more benefits of him then of any
other Prince; neither hath it beene knowne that they euer
committed treaſon of importance, vnleſſe it were the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt
of <hi>Gazeles</hi> at Damaſco,<note place="margin">1520.</note> and of <hi>Acomat Baſſa</hi> at Cairo,<note place="margin">Iou. l. 13.</note>
in the time of <hi>Soliman.</hi> Which was but (as a man may ſay)
a fire of ſtubble extinguiſhed at the very firſt appearance
and purſute of their Maſter. Now the Ianizars, and the
other mentioned, who are the ſinewes and principall foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of the <hi>Ottomans</hi> greatneſſe, and who receiue ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

whereunto their owne fortune is linked.</p>
               <p>6 To ſhew by what meanes the Turke maintaineth this

               <p>2 The Turke then which would attaine to this poinct,

without a point; Moreouer, he alloweth not any Iewe or

the manner of the Romanes, who obſerued both the one

for amongſt ſuch as they admitted, the chiefe of the

ſuch an abatement, could not be of any great courage or

               <p>3 The Turke without troubling himſelfe with the care
how to traine after him an vnprofitable multitude of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtages,
in an inſtant riddeth his ſubiects hands of their
beſt forces, and ſtrangely armeth and fortifieth himſelfe
with themſelues, againſt themſelues; and heerein he thus
proceedeth. He maintaineth in pay about two hundred
Commiſſaries, who as Superintendents trauell vp and
downe all the countries of his obedience, to ſee and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee
all that is ſaide and done by the Chriſtians. Theſe men

the change of gouernment introduced vpon thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
people, forced to ſubiect themſelues to a new
kinde of ſeruitude. In very deede that people is not weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
armed which hath a heart, a good ſpirite, and a nimble
hand.</p>
               <p>2 This is the cauſe why the Turke to preuent theſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
commotions, hath depriued the people of all ſorts
of armes, to the end they may forget both the vſe and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
to handle them, and that they may not by them take
occaſion to mutiny. Now to prouide that ſo barbarous a
yoake driue them not to deſpaire, he maintaineth a general
peace and tranquillity throughout his eſtate: he hath a
care that iuſtice be equally diſtributed: that they haue
plenty of victuals, and all other vſuall commodities, the
better to lull aſleepe their fury.</p>
               <p>3 By theſe meanes euery one maketh the beſt of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and liueth quietly at home, embracing that naturall
deſire of holding his owne, which to performe euery man
emploieth whatſoeuer may proceed out of himſelf: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer
this quiet and eaſe of minde doth ſo ſoften men, as
they reſt free from the thought of plotting or vndertaking
ſturs and rebellions: Iuſtice, quiet, and plenty, are three
things which haue for their oppoſites, the violence of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
in time of war, the corruption of Iudges in time of
peace, and ſcartſiy and famine in both. The iniuſtice, the
abuſe, and auarice of officers and magiſtrates, are thoſe
which procure the ſubuerſion and vnauoidable ruine of a
country. I could adde to this diſcourſe many examples &amp;
domeſticall proofes, but not to enter into too deepe a ſea
I will ſpare them, and will content my ſelfe to ſay only
that all thoſe of ancient times, and ſuch as haue had any
touch of a good minde (either Chriſtians or infidels) haue
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8135:58"/>
euermore confeſſed that the ſincere execution of iuſtice is
the ſtrongeſt piller of all well ordered eſtates, as on the
contrary iniuſtice is the ouerthrow, not alone of men and
countries, but of beaſts alſo.</p>
               <p>To returne to our matter, it is ſure that when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſubiect hath wherewith to nouriſh, cloath, and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely
accommodate himſelfe and family; when in the
middeſt of armes he is ſafe in his owne home; when he
ſtandeth not in feare of forged crimes, or bribery of
Iudges; then is it that he falleth aſleepe in ſecuritie, and
careth not but to entertaine that tranquillitie, reiecting all
thought of rebellions. This is it which the Turke (who
warreth continually with his neighbours) putteth in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
to maintaine peace throughout his dominions, and
to be beloued and faithfully ſerued of his ſubiects, whom
he tieth to him with thoſe ſtrong bands, which are to ſay
the truth (beſides Iuſtice and tranquillitie) moſt proper
for preſeruation. A great helpe heereunto is his continuall
imploying his Captaines and Souldiers in the wars, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
out of his owne countrey, and to the ſpoile of his
enemies.</p>
               <p>5 Peace is the horne and true mother of abundance:
Then is it that euery man tilleth his land without diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,
and quietly inioyeth and encreaſeth his owne ſtore,
ſince as the Poet ſaith, <hi>Pax arua colit:</hi> Iuſtice Queene of
vertues, is that which ſerueth as the baſe and moſt ſure
foundation to peace, which could not otherwiſe ſubſiſt,
nor the lawes likewiſe; then is it that they gaine ſtrength
and vigour.</p>
               <p>5 And though the forme of the Turkiſh Iuſtice be not
without much vanitie and oppreſſion, and though all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
be determined amongſt them by way of witneſſes,
who are alike bought and ſold; and that iudgements paſſe
as gold and ſiluer is ſtirring: yet the quicke diſpatch they
receiue, maketh them forget this inconuenience; and
though the ſentence of ſuch Iudges be often pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
againſt all order of Iuſtice; yet is there thus much good
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8135:59"/>
gotten by it; that men conſume not themſelues bodie and
goods in pleading and trotting after Lawyers and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnies,
which haue their conſciences as large as the other,
who are bought more deerely: beſides the delay, vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and vncertainety of the iudgement. And though the
ſentence of ſuch men be much diſpleaſing, yet the people
haue this to comfort them, that they many times ſee them
endure moſt notable and exemplary puniſhment: for the
Turke ſometimes vpon the leaſt complaint brought againſt
them, putteth them to death, be they neuer ſo great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages,
as well to inrich himſelfe with their ſpoiles, as to
manifeſt himſelfe to be a Prince moſt reſpectiue of iuſtice
and equity, and to giue alſo a manner of ſatisfaction to his

               </p>
               <p>6 Hence Chriſtian Princes are to fetch an aduertiſment

               <p>3 In other places of his Empire he beſtowes other great
numbers of the Ianizzars to be aſſiſtant to the Gouernors
and Baſſas, beſides the ſuccours they are to haue of ſuch
horſe and foote as thoſe are bound to furniſh on whom
the Turke hath at other times beſtowed ſuch arable lands
as haue beene conquered by armes, whence he draweth
one man or more as the neceſſity of his affaires requireth,
and according as is the value of what they poſſeſſe. Theſe
are called Mozzellini. Such as are tied to this contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may be compared to the Feudataries of our Prince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
whoſe ſeruice they are to finde a light horſe or muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
and ſome of them two, more or leſſe according to the

or <hi>Aconizij,</hi> as a man would ſay Aduenturers, which haue

of <hi>Grecia</hi> or Europ (which is as much to ſay as Prince

of <hi>Seruia.</hi> That of Aſia abideth at <hi>Culhea</hi> a towne of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latia.
Each of theſe hath vnder his obedience many <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giacks</hi>
(as much as to ſay ſherifes or bailifs) the very chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8135:60"/>
of the great Turke which gouerne in the Prouinces
where they command are bound to obey them. This
great multitude of horſemen are ſo well mounted and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
as none can chuſe or wiſh a more fit or direct meanes
then their ordinary ſtrength to hinder all popular reuolts
or rebellions, be they neuer ſo great. That which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

moue Syria to rebell; but he was preuented by that migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power which <hi>Soliman</hi> found euen then in a readineſſe,
wherewith he ouerthrew him. Theſe ordinary prouiſions
of war are the more terrible and effectual, in regard that all
the people of his obedience are intirely diſarmed of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
offenſiue weapons.</p>
               <p>4 The Romans obſerued this cuſtome, to diſtribute di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of their legions about the frontiers of Germany a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt
the Rhene and Danowb, to the ſame end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
as the Turke entertaineth his horſe. But it ſeemeth
that he proceedeth therein more diſcreetly then did the
Romans, for they kept all their forces together in one
place, and vnder one Generall, of whom depended the
abſolute command of the armies: whence it fell out that
to accommodate themſelues, they ouerthrew the houſes
of particular men, ruined, and famiſhed the countrey, as
well by the hauocke they made (which alwaies attendeth
ſo great a multitude) as by their large prouiſions moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
for an armie: The other prouinces farre diſtant
were exempt from this oppreſſion, yet not from contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but thoſe which ſuſtained the armie, were ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burdened,
as their miſerie incited them to rebell, and ſhake
off their obedience. But contrariwiſe, the Turke which
diſperſeth his horſe and foote into diuers Prouinces, vnder
the command of ſixtie and ſix Sangiacks, draweth not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him ſuch diſorder or ill ſatisfaction as did the Romans.
Their great aſſemblie in one place was cauſe of ſeditions,
debates, mutinies and other miſchiefes, moſt difficult to
be preuented. They did not perceiue how this manner of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:8135:61"/>
proceeding was a means that the Souldiers grew too much
to affect their Captaines, and that the Captaines found
themſelues by them enabled to attempt (as they often did)
many things to the preiudice of the Empire. And in very
deed it oftentimes hapned that their armies made choice
of their General for Emperour, in deſpite of the Senatours
authoritie; either in regard of the valour they knew to be
in them, or of ſome pecuniarie corrupting their affections,
which the Senate could not remedy: And in trueth it was
a very eaſie matter for the Generall, ſo farre from home,
and holding his forces vnited in one body, to practiſe the
Colonels, and the Colonels to bargaine and buie the harts
and affections of the Souldiers, by them to poſſeſſe the
Empire, ſo as ſometime the armie of Spaine choſe their
Generall Emperour, and at the ſame time that of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
theirs: whereof we haue many examples, as alſo of the
calamities and miſeries which did thence accrew to the
Eſtate and ſubiects.</p>
               <p>5 It is an inconuenience whereto the Turke cannot be
ſubiect; for keeping his troups and armies ſo ſpread abroad
and diſperſt, they haue not the meanes to mutinie (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
being in no place ouer ſtrong) nor yet grow to affect
their Beglerbyes or Gouernours, whom they ſeldome ſee
or repaire to: much leſſe can the Beglerbee in his owne
behalfe eaſily winne or entice the hearts of the Sangiacks,
or affections of the Souldiers, as he might well doe if the
troupes were alwais together in time of peace, and abroad
in one and the ſame prouince.</p>

whereof wee haue hitherto entreated be
without alteration maintained, it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
that the Prince haue a care, that there be
none in his countrey who for their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
may incourage the people, and embolden them to
attempt ought, backt by their authoritie, countenance and
conduct.</p>
               <p>2 This greatneſſe may grow from three principall cauſes:
either in regard they are Princes of the bloud, or for that
they are noted to be nobly deſcended and rich, or elſe for
the reputation they haue gotten, and a long while preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
either by cunning, or by their owne valour, and merit:
things that winne credit and name amongſt the common
people. Concerning the firſt cauſe, the children, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and kinſmen of the Turke, are great by conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.
The Barons of the country obtaine the ſecond ranke,
whereto the nobleneſſe of their family calleth them: for
the third, ſuch miniſters and officers as beare a ſtroake and
ſwaie in matters of the higheſt conſequence, are accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
great.</p>
               <p>3 The Ottaman Princes, of nature barbarous and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
ordinarily ſhelter themſelues from theſe inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
with courſes far from all humanity, in as much as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all reſpect of Law, religion, or other ciuill conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they vpon the leaſt ſcruple that may be, ridde their
hands by execrable murthers, of their neereſt kinsfolkes
and friends, yea euen of their fathers and brethren, alone
to inioy and by their death to aſſure to themſelues the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
poſſeſſion of their kingdome. <hi>Selim</hi> the firſt murthered
two of his brethren, procured the death of all his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8135:62"/>
yea and of his father alſo. He would often ſay
that there was nothing more ſweet then to raigne out of
the ſuſpition and ſhadow of his kindred; and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued
pardon for what he had committed, ſince it was the
ſame play and vſage he ſhould haue receiued, if any other
but himſelfe had attained to the crowne. <hi>Amurath</hi> the
third which now raigneth, made his entry by the death of
his brother, and ſearched the eſtabliſhing of his Empire,
euen in the belly of his mother, then great with childe,
making for this end, one end of her &amp; what ſhe went with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
theſe cruelties are monſtrous in the ſight of God and
man, and full of horror and infamie: yet hath it not beene
knowen for all this, that euer any citie, any people, or armie,
did reuolt or mutine. This inhumanitie is amongſt them
growne to that lawfull and ordinarie conſequence, as they
vſually put it in practiſe, without feare of blame or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch.
The examples thereof are as infinite as their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,
ſtinking and abhominable. In a word, this but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chering
is amongſt them an hereditary ſucceſſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending
from one to another, which God would reuenge
with our hands if we would amend our liues.</p>
               <p>4 As for the Barons and Lords of the countrey, <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met</hi>
the firſt, deſtroied their ſeed, expelling them out of
his eſtate, as he did all the originarie Turkiſh Princes his
allies; and if by chance there remaine any of the <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
race, he is ſo kept downe, as he traileth (as they ſay)
his belly vpon the ground, liuing moſt poorely without all
charge, and manage of affaires: ſo as neither valour nor
riches can make him appeere or ſhine in the worlds eie;
rather he remaineth eclipſed amongſt the vulgar ſort,
without honour, credit, or eſtimation.</p>
               <p>As for the Princes and mightie men of the countrey by
them ſubdued, they know well enough how to ridde their
hands of them, in ſort as we haue before declared: ſo as
neuer Empire was raiſed, or maintained with more execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
murthers, then this hath beene in theſe daies; they
neither ſparing Princes of their bloud, nor the chiefe Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8135:62"/>
of their prouinces; for they blinde them, if not
kill them.</p>
               <p>5 Now concerning the miniſters and officers, who by
long managing of waightie affaires, haue attained to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
places, authority and reputation; there is not one,
be hee neuer ſo great, which at the leaſt winke, wrath,
and pleaſure of his Lord, loſeth not his life immediatly.
<hi>Baiazet</hi> cauſed <hi>Acomat Baſſa</hi> to be put to death, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
man of armes and a woorthy Captaine, ſaying the
too much reputation of the ſeruant was a cauſe of the too
great ielouſie of the maſter. <hi>Selim</hi> likewiſe put many to
death, and amongſt others <hi>Muſtafa Baſſa,</hi> whom he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to be ſtrangled at <hi>Pruſa,</hi> and after to be caſt out to the
dogs. This was his recompence for fauoring him in the
vſurpation of the Empire againſt <hi>Baiazet</hi> his father then
liuing, and for making riddance of his two brethren <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat</hi>
and <hi>Corcut.</hi> He ſuſpected it was he that had reuealed
his ſecret (as indeed he had) to <hi>Aladin</hi> and <hi>Amarath</hi>
children of his brother <hi>Acomat,</hi> becauſe contrary to his
expectation he ſought their death. It is in a manner
an ordinary courſe with Princes that one light offence
obſcureth and maketh them forget a thouſand good
ſeruices performed for the good of their affaires. For my
part I am of opinion that this rage, and inhumane cruelty
familiar with the houſe of the Ottomans, is but a true
and iuſt iudgment of God, who will by their parricid
handes chaſtice the Apoſtaſies and wickedneſſe of one
by another, conſidering the greater part of them are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
who haue denied their faith, and by that miſerable
act climed vp to the height of thoſe eminent charges and
dignities they poſſeſſe. As not long ſince his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie
permitted a poore ſimple ſouldiour to kill <hi>Mahomet
Baſſa,</hi> a man moſt mighty in credit and authority; but
more rich of power and meanes; yet ſuch a one as had
beene a Chriſtian and had taken vpon him the orders of
Prieſthood.</p>

doth plainly enough
teach vs that whatſoeuer
is borne paſſeth and haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
towards death; and
that all things which haue
a beginning neceſſarilie
and interchangably roule
towards their end. This
proceedeth either of an
ordinarie and naturall courſe, or of the violence and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of compound bodies. Hence we drawe this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
that eſtates change, monarchies faile, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of one ſerueth as the raiſing to the other.</p>
               <p>2 Againe, as of humaine bodies ſome are more ſtrong,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8135:64"/>
vigorous, and of a better compoſition then others, and ſo
are of longer continuance; ſo we ſee the ſame difference
in kingdomes and eſtates: in as much as ſome preſerue
themſelues longer, either becauſe by their nature they are
more ſurely founded (as for example the Signory of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
is more laſting then the popular eſtate, and a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal
eſtate more then a common-weale, becauſe a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
keepeth the cauſes of corruption more aloofe from
her; or is policed with better lawes) or becauſe of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
which is naturally more ſtrong then the other, as we
ſee at this day in the Signorie of Venice.</p>
               <p>3 But becauſe this aſſertion is ſubiect to diuers obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
we will diuide it only into two propoſitions. Firſt then of
principalities, ſome are ſmall, ſome great, ſome indifferent,
either in regard of their ſubſiſtance or firſt eſſence, or of the
compariſon which may be made betweene them and their
neighbours: Secondly, the efficient cauſes of the vtter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of eſtates are either inward, or outward, or mixt: The
inward are to be fetched and conceiued in reſpect of the
negligence, ignorance, and riot of Princes which giue
themſelues ouer to all voluptuouſneſſe; whereto may be
added the factions, ſecret practiſes, ambitions, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
humors of ſubiects, with ſundrie other occaſions, all
fit to bring eſtates to their vtter ruine. The outwad cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
are the ſtratagemes, armes, and force of the enemie.
The mixt are ſuch as participate of both, as are the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of the people, treaſons of particular men, put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
by forraine ayd and force. Since then it is ſo that all
principalities are ſubiect to ruine by one of theſe three cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
we are now to vnfold what maladies may infect, as
well great and indifferent, as ſmall eſtates; and draw all
within the compaſſe of inward, outward, and mixt cauſes.</p>
               <p>Now like as in naturall things naturall corruption is
more tolerable then violent, ſo muſt we conſider whether
the alteration and impairing of eſtates and common weales
chance by reaſon of age, or by the violence of ſome not
forſeene cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:8135:65"/>
4 Returning then to our former diuiſion and well exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
it, wee ſhall finde that ſmall Eſtates come to their
ends rather by meanes of outward cauſes (brought in by
force and violence) then otherwiſe: In as much as their
power being inſufficient to withſtand their mighty neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
ambitious attempts, they are at the firſt incounter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſet
with the ſtorm of his conqueſts; in this maner the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueral
Signories of Lombardy fel in ſubiection either of the
Duke of <hi>Milan,</hi> or of the Venetia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; the free cities of Thoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cany
became a pray to the Duke of Florence: The Princes
of Africke to the King of <hi>Fez-Marocco,</hi> and <hi>Algiers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 On the contrarie, great Empires are vſually ſubuerted
by meanes of inward cauſes; either by eaſe &amp; plenty, which
cuſtomarily makes Princes to ſwell with inſupportable
pride; by voluptuous riot (whereto people amidſt their
abundance are moſt prone) or elſe by inſolency and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
ſeazing the great ones of the country when they
ſee themſelues much followed and reuerenced, all fit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticements

the extreams, for they are not ſo vnfurniſhed of ſtrength, as
that it would be eaſie for euery one to inuade and oppreſſe

afforde matter to particular men to grow mighty, or elſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon

Eſtate much more indammageth a great then a ſmall or
meane Empire. For a monarke is not able to turne his eie
vpon euery corner of his Kingdome; and ſturring ſpirits
are fortified in their attempts either with the hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity
(the nourſe of vices in all Eſtates and gouernments)
or with the opinion they haue conceiued of not being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered
till ſuch time as their proiects meete with ſome
good ſucceſſe. Theſe things happen ſooner, when the
Prince is far off then at hand. Spaine can witneſſe it, which

                  <note place="margin">Anno 714.</note> as it thereby fell

the former chapter, nor diue into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
efficient cauſes of the ruine of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates:
for ſhould I handle what might be
farther ſaid of this matter, I ſhould wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
too far fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the propounded ſubiect,
and perhaps racke the argument beyond his due pitch. I
will then tie my ſelfe only to the coniectures of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
or fall of eſtates, omitting other cauſes, as alſo
all that may be referred to the iudgement of the heauens,
the influence of the ſtars, and to their vertue; ſithence
this knowledge is fraught with ſo many obſcurities and
contrarieties in what is written thereof, as I will ſpare to
ſearch too far into it: Though otherwiſe we are to imagine
that nothing is made in vaine, and that thoſe celeſtiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
moue not by chance, but rather by diuine order and
diſpoſition. Againe, the errors of their Ephimerides and
the different ſupputation of the firſt maſters of their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
make the knowledge to be vncertaine and their ſo
ſurely grounded maximes to afford contrarie reſolutions.
Let vs not meddle then with the aſpects of the ſtars, or the
natiuities of eſtates, but regard and conſider the effects of
what is at our owne home without taking ſo high a flight.
We ſay then that eſtates ſuffer either by the vnremouea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ordinance of God, or by the naturall courſe of time,
wherewith in time they grow feeble, and change: or elſe
by the wils of men, ſo vnſtable and light, as they ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
breede an vniuerſall alteration thorow out a whole eſtate
and common-weale. We will only drawe our coniectures
from naturall cauſes (not to meddle with the iudgement of
the diuine Maieſty or mans inconſtancy) nakedly and
ſimply to ſpeake of them as neere and familiar, to the end
we may not enter into the chaos of cauſes heauenly and
moſt remote.</p>
               <p>2 So then we are to thinke that the continuance of eſtates
is proportioned to their beginning. It is with them as with
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8135:66"/>
ſenſible creatures, which the more they haſten to arriue at
the perfection of their being, the ſooner alſo they faile and
die: the contrarie is ſeene in thoſe which with a ſlow and
meaſured paſe attaine to a more faire maturity and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
as for example, among beaſtes the horſe, amongſt
trees the willow are of no long indurance: but thoſe that
(as the Hart and Oliue) make by degrees and ſlowly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their ripenes, are likewiſe more laſting. We may ſay
the like of Empires and Eſtates: for as we ſee them ſlow or
ſwift in their increaſe, ſo are they more ſwift or ſlow in their
ruine. Haue not the French more then once conquered
the duchy of <hi>Milan</hi> and the kingdome of Naples, and that
as a man may ſay almoſt in a moment? ſo haue they many
times loſt it and all in a moment: ſuch conqueſts reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Torrents tumbling downe the mountaines, which in
leſſe then an hour, by reaſon of the great ſhoutes of waters
they bring with them, become fearefull and dangerous;
when ſoone after in an inſtant, we ſee them fallen and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
ſo as a childe may wade thorow them without trouble
or danger. Now not to leaue this conqueſt of <hi>Milan</hi> and
<hi>Naples,</hi> we muſt to this purpoſe by examples contrary to
the former make good the ground of our propoſition:
which to performe, I will ſet before you the manner how
the Spaniards conquered and held theſe prouinces.</p>
               <p>I finde it hath been by a long courſe of time, and
infinite trauaile accompanied with all the paines and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
which thoſe who ſet vp their reſt vpon a conqueſt and
reſolue to abide out the wars, ordinarily indure. Hence
their labour hath taken ſuch roote, as nothing ſince hath
been able to eſcape their hands, howſoeuer they haue been
oft times galled and put to their plunges. It is requiſite
then that Empires haue their rootes to ſuſtaine them,
which muſt be deepe and ſound, otherwiſe it is impoſſible
they ſhould long continue. Now that they may be ſuch,
there is an eſpeciall wiſedome and many yeeres requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>3 The true rootes of an eſtate are the loue of the people
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8135:67"/>
towards their Prince, the ſincere and holy diſtribution of
Iuſtice amongſt the ſubiects; military diſcipline well po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liced
and obſerued by the ſouldiours; honours, rewards,
and benefits beſtowed according to vertue and merit: that
great men be not ſlightly ſet by, abaſed or contemned: that
the common ſort of people be intertained with all honeſt
ſatisfaction: neceſſary prouiſions for the maintenance
of places of ſtrength; well husbanding of the treaſure;
friendly intelligence with neighbour Princes; vncorrupt
election of officers; modeſty in their proceedings: theſe
are the very true rootes able to fortifie and make monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies
to flouriſh and raiſe them to eternity: which rootes
can neuer proue ſetled ſpring, or ſend foorth worthy fruit,
vnleſſe they be planted in the ſoile of wiſdome, aduice and
induſtrie, and husbanded by the continuance of time.</p>
               <p>4 It is often ſeene that great Conqueſts and victories at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
without loſſe or labour, ſo blinde the Conquerour,
as they make him become like one of thoſe long reeds or
canes which carry outwardly a good apparance, but are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
hollow and of fraile ſubſtance. They cauſe him to
contemne his companions, and thoſe who aſſiſted him in
obtaining his victories, but more the ſubdued people,
whence ordinarily followeth, that the higher is his fortune,
the neerer is his fall. Wee haue ſtraied ſufficiently. It is
now high time to returne to our principall diſcourſe: and
as we haue heretofore made it appeare that there are three
ſorts of eſtates; ſo wee are now to vnfold in what ranck of
the three the Turke is to be beſtowed.</p>

vs in the former chapter, this is to take
his foundation, and by theſe cauſes wee
are to make choice of that of the three
which is the ſureſt; by what accidents
or infirmities both the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
may vndergoe a change, either outwardly or inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and in which rank of the three wee are to lodge the
Turke. Some one perhaps will iudge this queſtion ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous
and vnprofitable, ſeeing his renowne, his conqueſts,
and his long rule doe but too much teach vs what he is:
notwithſtanding all this I ſhould not thinke it beſides the
purpoſe a little to particularize the cauſes of his greatneſſe.</p>
               <p>2 The eſtate of the Turke is held without queſtion to bee
one of the greateſt and mightieſt, as well in regard of the
large circuit it containeth, as of his power: he is great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of ſo many Prouinces reduced to his obedience; and
though he haue not ſo great a ſhare in Europe as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
ſometimes had, he hath to counteruaile this, more
aduantaged himſelfe in Aſia and Africke: for when the
fortune of the Romaines was at the greateſt, and that they
had their armes moſt at libertie, yet went they not beyond
Euphrates: It is very true, that <hi>Traian</hi> went farther, but all
the Prouinces he ſubdued were ſoone abandoned by <hi>Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
his ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>The Turke hath not done ſo, for he hath extended his
dominion as far as Tigris; he poſſeſſeth all Meſopotamia,
or as they terme it <hi>Diarbecke.</hi> From thence he reacheth as
far as Balſera or the Gulfe of Perſia, which the Romans
neuer ſaw, and the Gulfe of Arabia. And to ſay better, all
is his from the red ſea to the Cittie <hi>Aden,</hi> which is in the
maine continent beyond the mouth of this ſea, more then
an hundred and fiftie miles: he hath alſo inlarged his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8135:68"/>
toward the South far beyond Aegypt. In Africk
all is his, except three places of ſtrength which the king of
Spaine holdeth, <hi>Pegnon de Veles, Oran,</hi> and <hi>Melila: Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania</hi>
alſo is his, only three fortreſſes excepted, which
are <hi>Tanger, Arſilla,</hi> and <hi>Mazagan,</hi> conquered by the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall:</hi>
when I name Africk, I intend that country com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
termed Barbary, and not Ethiopia.</p>
               <p>3 Hauing now ſeene the largenes of his dominions, we
are next to diſcourſe of his meanes and power. I finde
that he hath better eſtabliſhed the one and the other, then
the Romans euer did whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were at their intireſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
becauſe in ſuch a moſt large compaſſe of his country,
there is no king or common weale beareth ſway to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
his dominions: which was otherwiſe with the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,
who had many ſuch wedged in, within the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of their Empire.</p>
               <p>There is not any one of his ſubiects that dareth to ſay
that the houſe wherein he dwelleth, or the land he tilleth, is
his owne. They acknowledge to hold all they haue of him:
he ordinarily intertaineth diuers great and mighty armies
both by ſea and by land. So as it muſt needes be granted
that he is greater in his eſtates, meanes and power, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
were the Romans, for he ſo peaceably maintaineth
what he hath conquered, as he can no waies vndergoe the
troubles and wars which the Romans endured at the hands
of <hi>Mithridate,</hi> the <hi>Parthians, Farnaces</hi> and others. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer,
next Europe the Gaules are not his enemies. The
Cymbrians are his aſſociats; ſo as he foſtereth ſuch a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
and obedience on all ſides, as he amaſſeth ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
treaſure.</p>
               <p>4 And more, (a thing worth the noting) in three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
yeeres ſpace ſince he began firſt to reigne, he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
but foure notable ouerthrowes (that excepted
which he receiued the yeere paſt neere Tauris) But the
Romaines in leſſe time receiued more and greater at the
only hands of the Carthaginians. In ſum, there is not that
nation in the world which can vaunt of ſo many victories
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:8135:68"/>
in ſo ſhort a ſpace, or to haue triumphed of the captiuity
or death of ſo many kings and great Princes, as the great
Turke; or that haue with ſuch happie ſucceſſe and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
ſo ſoone raiſed ſo mightie an Empire as his is at this
day. Is it not a fearfull matter to heare it related that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet
the ſecond (an infidel) hath had ſuch fauour of the

raigne, to ſubdue two Empires, vſurpe twelue kingdomes,
and take by force two hundred cities? That which affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the greateſt cauſe of wonder, is, that all this hath ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in the very time when the art of military engines &amp;

cauſes, and vpon what coniectures a
man might gather them. It is now time that we ſee and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
in like ſort whether the empire of the Turke be nere
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:8135:69"/>
his end, and abatement of his greatneſſe, according as a
man may draw from coniectures it leaneth towards his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining;
and though the foundation heereof be built vpon
reaſons ſo cleere and euident as they are not to be contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet will I alledge one that carrieth more apparence
then all the other; and that is, that the greatneſſe of his
empire is at the higheſt that it may be by the ruine of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
by him expelled, vanquiſhed and made away one after
an other, whileſt he hath in the meane time triumphed of
their eſtates and rich ſpoiles; but now that he hath none to
oppoſe him with hopes of ſo fauourable iſſue as had the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
his ambition, heart, and courage will grow idle and
languiſh; whence in time will ſpring the ruine of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;
Is he not already come to that paſſe? The Princes
that confine vpon him, though more weake then he to bid
him battaile, aſſaile, or defend, haue neuertheleſſe ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
their affaires and meanes, as they are able at this day
to ſheeld themſelues ſufficiently from his attempts.</p>
               <p>2 Amongſt others the King of Perſia, doth he not ſo
ballance his power as he hath giuen him many great ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes,
and one lately (as I haue ſaid) neere <hi>Tauris?</hi>
The Tartarians alſo hold him plaie and more prouoke
him then he them; and of late they got from him Caffa a
ſtrong and wealthy towne; moreouer whileſt he was buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about the wars of Perſia the Georgians took and ſacked
<hi>Xiſtis;</hi> but they were not able to hold it; ſo as the Turke
hath repoſſeſſed himſelf of it. The Muſcouit doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defend himſelfe from the incurſions of the Turks, but
he oft times alſo skirmiſheth with them, commanding as
he doth aboue an hundred and fifty thouſand horſe. The
King of Polonia likewiſe more mighty then the Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit,
is ſo ſtrong as he will not take wrong; but is able ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at all times to repell the violence of his enemy. The
houſe of Auſtria together with the aid of the Princes of
Germanie, hath wherewithall to make their party good
and to oppoſe him: the Venetians, vnited with Italy and
Spaine (which in ſuch a caſe will not abandon them) are
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8135:69"/>
likewiſe able enough to defend themſelues and hold their
owne. As for the king of Spain, he is ſo mighty by ſea and
by land, both of men and mony, as he dareth vndertake
himſelfe to incounter the Turke in battaile, much more to
defend himſelfe if aſſaulted. The King of Fez is not anie
way awed by him, and is more ſtrong then he, at the leaſt
in Africke; which he approued to the common hurt of
Chriſtendome by that ouerthrow and death of the King
Don <hi>Sebaſtian</hi> of Portugall, where ſo many Chriſtians mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably
ended their daies. The laſt of thoſe which abut
vpon the Turke is <hi>Preſter Iohn,</hi> who hath hitherto beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
himſelfe ſo honorably againſt him, as he hath neuer
ſhewed any token of fearing his forces. So as being now
vnable by reaſon of the concord &amp; ſtout oppoſition of his
neighbours, to gaine farther ground; he muſt of neceſſity
(vnleſſe God in regard of our ſinnes be otherwiſe pleaſed)
begin to recoile; and that greatneſſe which he hath built
vpon others ruines muſt decay and leſſen; ſince the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
which gaue the increaſe is on his part wanting.</p>
               <p>3 There is yet an other point which fortifieth this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and that is: that all ſuch Princes as confine vpon the
Turke, are by others example made more wiſe, aduiſed
and conſiderat, then they were before the ruine of ſuch as
ſerued for a pray to the <hi>Ottomans;</hi> whereby they will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
looke to themſelues how they courageouſly haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
their perſons or eſtates at one battaile: they will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be content to ſtand vpon their defence, attending
while time beget ſome apparent occaſion, roundly and to
the purpoſe to ſet vpon him.</p>
               <p>4 Againe, there are at this day ſo many fortreſſes, ſo
ſtrong and ſo well appointed, as they are in a manner im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable,
ſo as the Turke is not like to finde the way ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
as heereto fore he did to carry them: but if he ſhould
put himſelfe vpon that hazardous enterpriſe of forcing
them one by one, it were as much as to become the author
of his owne ruine.</p>
               <p>5 Neither ought any man in oppoſing this,<note place="margin">1570.</note> alledge the

loſſe of Cypres, ſince it hapned not ſo much through the
Turkes power, as becauſe of the diſtance of Venice, which
was to ſupply them with men and munition. A man may
by a contrary argument ſay as much of the ſauing of Malta
(ſpeaking according to humaine cauſes) for it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
either by the forces within it ſelfe,<note place="margin">1565.</note> or by the ſuccor

was ſo far diſtant from Conſtantinople as the army could
not in due time and ſeaſon receiue their prouiſions and bee

ſent thither. If it would pleaſe God that the Turke might
often make ſuch voiages, he would prepare vs faire occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

proue a hard matter to ruine him by forraine force, whoſe
ſtrength and meanes it is requiſit we examine to inlighten
this opinion.</p>
               <p>Firſt, thoſe that confine vpon the Turke next Africke,
are the King of Fez, of Marocco, and Preſter Iohn: next
Aſia, the Sophi and the Tartarians: in Europe the Duke
of Muſcouy, the King of Polonia, the Emperour, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians,
and the King of Spaine.</p>
               <p>As for the King of Fez he hath men enow, but ſmall
ſtore of mony, ſo as he hath not the meanes or ability to
maintaine a laſting war: Againe, though I ſhould ſuppoſe
he were able to be at the charge, yet I finde him naked of
other things neceſſarie to aduantage himſelfe vpon the
Turke, ſuch as are places of ſtrength to forward his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
and aſſure his retrait: ſo as he is like enough to
come ſhort of his aime: and if he ſhould performe ſome
worthy exploit in Africk, doubtles the King of Spaine his
neighbour would ſoone be iealous of his good fortune.
And in very deede this is not the point, for it is all one
with Chriſtendome whether the King of Fez be too ſtrong
for the Turke, or the Turke for the King of Fez, ſince
both are the Chriſtians enemies. As for Preſter Iohn, all
the world knoweth he hath enough to doe to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
againſt the Turkes forces; neither is it long ſince he
wan from him all the hauens he had vpon the red ſea, and
amongſt others that of <hi>Archiech</hi> and <hi>Mazzua:</hi> now for
the Sophi, if we ſearch their hiſtories we ſhall finde that the
kings of Perſia haue alwaies had the worſe of the Turks, &amp;
among all other <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond ouercame <hi>Vſumcaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1474.</note>
after him <hi>Selim</hi> the firſt did as much to <hi>Iſmael</hi> whom
he forced into the remoteſt parts of his country. <hi>Tarmas</hi>
alſo met with the like meaſure at <hi>Solimans</hi> hands: and on
the contrary we ſee that <hi>Cudabenda</hi> hath had ſuch a hand
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:8135:71"/>
of <hi>Amurath</hi> the third now raigning, as he hath often van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
his armies, and now of late at Tauris: and though
he haue atchieued moſt worthy victories, yet hath he no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
aduantaged himſelfe. In the Turkes country, he
hath not wan one fortreſſe of importance, or ought elſe
that might counteruaile the charge of his wars: This hath
ſucceeded in regard the Soph<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>is ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of horſe, but vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
of foote, which ſhould be the principal force of ſuch
as beſiege or defend. Moreouer, to force places of ſtrength
there is required great ſtore of cannon &amp; other munition,
all wanting to the Sophi, who may well meete the enemy
in the feeld and bid him battaile, but not purſue and aſſaile
him if he retire into his fortres; becauſe of the aboue ſaid
defects of foot &amp; artillery; &amp; though he were prouided of
them, yet wants he the skill how to vſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like others. The
example of Tauris approueth this ſufficiently, for after
he had this laſt yeere vanquiſhed the armie of the Turks,
and ſlaine an hundred thouſand men, he could neuer take
the Cittadell wherein the Turks had drawne all their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
of war, and left aboue eight thouſand men; neither
is there any newes hitherto that he hath taken it &amp; expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them thence. The Tartarians are as ill ſtored with
foote and artillery as the Perſians, and except that they
laſt got of the Turke, it may be truly ſaid that they neuer
did him harme. As for the Moſcouit which abutteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him (as doe alſo the Polonians) they haue in regarde
of the Turke ſmall ſtore of men, horſe and mony; ſo as
the moſt they can doe is to hold their owne. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Germans, they haue loſt much of their ancient
reputation by the ouerthrow they receiued of the Turke
at Exechium, Buda, and ſundry other places; ſo as they
are glad to keepe home without daring to aſſaile him. The
Venetians haue beene ſo vnfortunate, as they haue neuer
moued war againſt the Turke but it hath ſucceeded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their hopes: and which is the worſt of all, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
conſented to anie treatie of peace, but they did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
ſome important member of their eſtate. And to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:8135:71"/>
ſay the truth <hi>Mahomet</hi> the ſecond got Negropont, Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari,
and Groya; <hi>Baiazet</hi> tooke from them Lepanto and
Modon, and after in a treaty of peace they made with him
they parted with S. Moore; in an other treaty they left to
<hi>Soliman</hi> Napoles of Maluaſia: <hi>Selim</hi> the ſecond wan by
force the Ile of Cypres, Duleme, and Antiuari: And
though theſe be heauy loſſes, yet in regard they were far
diſtant from their eſtates they are more ſupportable then if
they had beene neere hand, ſo ought they now more then
euer aduiſe how to ſtrengthen themſelues againſt the
Turke by their braue reſolution and prouiſion, which they
may better doe now then euer, in regard their forces are
more liuely, and the members of their common-weale
more vnited and compact then heeretofore. Now we are
to come to the king of Spaine. Let vs ſay that he hath ſtore
of mony and all prouiſion neceſſary to be imploied in the
wars; that he is not without ſufficient numbers of foot
and horſe alwaie in pay; that hee hath the commodity
extraordinarily to leuy ſo many men as may make the
Turke ſtand in feare of him; that his forces by ſea are good
and ſtrong, and that he can increaſe them at his pleaſure;
that he hath ſtore of victuals, commodity of hauens, for
conuenient landing in his countries; and in a word that he
is ſo mighty, as that neither he ſtandeth in awe of the Turk,
neither dareth the Turke aſſaile him: yet this power and
hability could neuer hitherto be imploied to the purpoſe
againſt the common enemy of Chriſtendome. Not for
want of will or inclination thereto, but becauſe he is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
by the reuolt of Flanders. The ſuſpition alſo and
feare of his neighbours armes, would neuer permit him to
diſplay an vnited and firme power againſt the Turke: he
hath rather beene enforced to waſt his time and meanes
vpon the particular preſeruation of his eſtates ſomewhat
diſtant one from an other, in ſtead of courageouſly exploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them againſt the Turkes to the good and conſolation
of Chriſtendome. But our ſinnes are they eſpecially which
haue depriued vs of the glorious fruits and aduantages we
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:8135:72"/>
might haue gained by ſo worthy a power. In concluſion,
we muſt grant that ſince the Empire of the Turke cannot
receiue any damage or alteration by outward cauſes (which
are wont to ruine eſtates) it is neceſſary that inward cauſes
either ſeparate or mixt effect it; yet before we diſcourſe of
theſe two meanes I hold it not amiſſe a little to examine,
whether his eſtate may be by maine and open force ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.</p>

thoſe that performed this noble execution, were ſcarce one

<hi>Soliman</hi> left the ſiege of Vienna with loſſe of 60000.<note place="margin">1529.</note> men
which were there ſlaine, hauing giuen twenty generall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults

               <p>3 Such as haue beene curious in the ſearch of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh

God for our offences did not buſie the forces of Chriſtian

hath not his head ſo hard as it may not be broken, or

of power ſufficient apart and of themſelues to take him to

               </list>
               <p>1 <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are many reſpects and cauſes,
which cuſtomarily make the leagues of
Chriſtian Princes altogether vneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
which may appeere to ſome a matter
of hard diſgeſtion, and for this cauſe I
hold it requiſite particularly to cleere it.
It is a receiued maxime that all the actions of Princes are
vndertaken for two principal cauſes, honor and profit: that
the conſideration of honor often maſqueth vnder the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or good of their affaires: we will then only meddle
with profit which we may tearme intereſt.</p>
               <p>2 Now this intereſt (a common maske for all faces) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be a like equall betweene Chriſtian Princes with one
conſent vndertaking the war againſt the Turke: for they
diuerſly confine vpon the common enemy, and this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
breedeth a difference alſo betweene their reſolutions
and intereſts; and though this be an inconuenience not in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:8135:74"/>
the caſe in handling to be contemned, yet the principall
difficulty dependeth not heerein: It rather conſiſteth
wholly in the concord of the treaty of the league, and this
concorde is hard to be wrought for theſe following rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>3 All theſe Princes are not neighbours of the Turke in
the ſame equallity: ſome are more ſtrong then other: this
difference of ſtrength affordeth to ſome a commodity to
defend themſelues or offend him with their owne forces:
others are weake, and conſequently expoſed to the incurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſpoiles of the Turke. It is an infallible maxime,
that the farther Princes are from the danger, the leſſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
are they to ſtir, prepare for the war, or contribute to
the charge or meanes requiſite for the vndertaking thereof
with the like feruency and affection as they would if they
ſaw themſelues ſo neere to the miſchiefe, and that there
were apparant danger.</p>
               <p>4 Againe, that Prince which ſeeth no great profit or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in ſuch an enterpriſe doth leſſe regard it then he who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
neceſſity inforceth to ſtand vpon his garde, and feare that
tyrants inuaſion. Moreouer, if the Princes vnited to this
league and combination ſhall once know that they ſhall get
little or ſmally aduantage their eſtate, it is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
(when they enter into it) that they will bring with
them that courage, reſolution, affection, and forwardneſſe
as the buſineſſe would require. See then how the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the intereſt makes the beginning difficult, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and iſſue vncertaine, by reaſon of the diuers alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and varieties which accompany euery aſſociated
Prince, ſutable to his paſſion or affection; Whereupon
would vndoubtedly follow an impoſſibilitie of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this league, and vnion vpon ſo ſure foundations, as that
the beginning may be good, the middle and end better:
ſince the effect without vnion amongſt many agents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
euermore as nothing or nothing woorth.</p>
               <p>5 We fall then farre ſhort of our reckoning, vnleſſe wee
can miniſter ſome remedy to the diuerſities of this intereſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:8135:74"/>
and profit. This inconuenience is attended on, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpeized
by an other of as great or greater conſideration:
And this is the intereſt and particular conſequence of the
neighbourhood that euery one indifferently hath with
the Turke; by the which indifferency, each one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as his feare is, will deſire the warre may be vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to his aduantage. As for example, Spaine feareth the
neighbourhood of Algiers; Venice of Albania: hence will
grow that the league taking effect, the Venetians will
ſtriue that the forces of the league may be imployed in
the Leuant, the Spaniards toward the South: ſo as it will
not be poſſible to manage the enterpriſe to both their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions.</p>
               <p>6 There is yet another inconuenience that our Princes wil
not be able by an equall portion to enter into the league,
inaſmuch as one wanteth meanes to contribute thereto in
money more then a ſixt part, another a fift part; others that
haue no money, will contribute men or ſhips; others more
mightie in both, will vndertake halfe or a ſecond. Theſe
are all the portions by whoſe aſſemblie a league may be
formed. Of their indifferencie groweth yet another diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
or inconuenience (as we liſt to tearme it) and that
is, that whoſoeuer contributeth the halfe, would likewiſe
haue in his handes (as the greateſt and mightieſt) all the
power and ſwaie. In which it will follow, that the other
ſhall not vndertake or performe ought but by his aduice,
direction, and aſſiſtance: If he will make a ſtand, they are
not to go forward; if he liſt to march elſewhere, then their
deſires carrie them, they muſt follow him: If his affaires
preſſe him to alter his reſolution and minde, and that hee
will retyre to his home, they are conſtrained to doe the
like, ſo as all their charge, paines, and holy intentions, are
vtterly ouerthrowne, and they oftentimes reſt expoſed to
the iniurie and reuenge of their dangerous neighbour, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
whom they iointly roſe in armes.</p>
               <p>7 Theſe are, to ſay the trueth, conſiderations and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences
of that value and conſequence (meaſuring them
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:8135:75"/>
by their parts, and not by the whole) as we muſt conclude
that none but God is able to tune this league to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
harmony, which we are moſt humbly to craue at his
Almightie hands with a ſtrong faith, a true amendment of
life, and a more perfect charitie then this age affoordeth.</p>

Generall of the Emperours army, <hi>Vincentio Capelli</hi> of the

the forces of the league either in Greece or Dalmatia
ſhould be left to the Venetians as in recompence of their
ſo great expence and loſſe that they ſhould ſuffer by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

a few daies in a readineſſe and went for Candy, where they
made ſome hauocke, but of no great moment. After theſe

to fight he ſpeedily retired to the gulfe of Larta, ſo as our
army was reſolued for <hi>Dirachium,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Drazo</hi>
or <hi>la Velona,</hi> but that being a dangerous harbour for the
gallies, they turned their force vpon Caſtell Nouo which
they carried by aſſault: an exploit (to ſay the truth) of that
ſmall importance (reſpecting their charge and prouiſion)
as it wan them as much diſhonor as profit, the towne being
won the Spaniards ſeazed themſelues of it. The Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
diſputed it as a thing appertaining to them according
to the articles of the league; but it was to ſmall purpoſe,
wherefore quieting themſelues ſince it was not to be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
they tooke an occaſion thereupon to ſhift themſelues
of the league. The yeere following <hi>Soliman</hi> recouered
Caſtle Nouo with the loſſe of thoſe Spaniards which kept
it, who were all put to the ſword, thoſe which eſcaped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during
a moſt miſerable ſeruitude: and though the peace
treated by the Venetian was ſomewhat diſaduantageous,
yet they indured that more willingly, then to be otherwiſe
dealt with then was agreed vpon: other cauſes might be
alleaged, as the ceaſing of trafficke and many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodities,
beſides the impoueriſhing of their Eſtate,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8135:76"/>
all which neceſſarily attende the intertainement of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
               <p>2 The laſt league of the yeere 1571.<note place="margin">1570.</note> yeelded not much
better fruits, for after a great charge, and the gaining of ſo
famous a victorie, no other good redounded thence to
the Chriſtians, but that the Turke made an aſſay of their
valour; and by little and little the confederate forces diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themſelues: the Venetians departing vpon occaſion
of almoſt the ſame iealouſies, as in the former league.</p>
               <p>3 It will be now time to deliuer how all theſe inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
may be ſtopped, and the league become firme and
durable, without conſideration of any particular intereſt,
to the end that euery one may voluntarily in deuotion
conſent thereto to the glory of God with a free heart, and
an vndaunted magnanimitie: In which caſe, the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
being rather free then forced on either ſide, we may
reape thereby fruits woorthy and honorable: Theſe two
leagues heeretofore mentioned, hapned in a time ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for the Venetians, as it was more then neceſſarie
that the Chriſtian Princes (though not intereſſed) ſhould
vnite their forces to aſſiſt and protect the other. So the
one ſtanding in the water vp to the throat, and incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with danger, and the other on the contrary, free from
feare of perill, they entred into the couenants and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the league, not ſuch as they ought to haue beene
to make them laſting; but ſuch as were preſented to men
ſtanding in neede of them, who inforced by neceſſitie,
might not refuſe them, to the end to cleere themſelues
of a neere threatning miſchiefe. Leagues wil then be dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
when they ſhall be ſtabliſhed at a time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men are free
and exempt from all conſtraint; and not to attend as they
do, till the Turke affright one of the confederates, and that
he be alreadie come into the field ſo ſtrong both by ſea
and land, as the Venetians or ſome other of the confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
are already by him aſſailed. At ſuch a time to ſeeke a
remedy by their haſtie aſſembling, is the way to imprint a
certaine feare in their people; and make them flocke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8135:76"/>
in the fold as ſheepe in preſence of the woolfe. It
is requiſite then that the league be contracted at leiſure,
in a time of peace, and in a ſeaſon when the aſſociates may
be inuited, not by any vrgent danger, but voluntarily, and
with ſuch an alacritie of heart, as they may vnite their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
their meanes, their powers, and their courages all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

fruits of a holie league &amp; aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation,
we are to remooue the defects
and inconueniences which haue made
the former leagues prooue abortiue:
And the better to effect it, it is neceſſary
that their treaties be voluntarie: that Princes voluntarily
ioyne their powers &amp; meanes to one end, though by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
courſes: ſo as growing to capitulations, the one doe
not aduantage himſelfe vpon the ſtraightning of the others
affaires. This is it which equalling the conditions, will cauſe
euery one to partake in the enterpriſe, without all ſuſpect
or particular iealouſie: It is not enough that the defects
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:8135:77"/>
of theſe leagues be diſcouered, if they make vs not more
wiſe in the framing of other to come: to the end we may
with all deuotion and ſinceritie builde them on a ſtrong
and vnmooueable foundation; and thus in my opinion
may be the manner of our proceeding.</p>
               <p>2 It is not required that to eſtabliſh this league and make
it fructifie, the confederate forces ſhould aſſemble in one
place, but at one time: my meaning is, that our Princes
muſt bee readie to aſſaile the enemie at once in diuers
places, and that euery one bende his forces towards parts
which are neereſt to him, ſo to begin the warre to ſome
purpoſe: As for example, the Spaniards ſhould inuade
the parts of Algiers: the Venetians and the Pope, of Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia:
the gallies of Sauoy, Malta, and Florence, ſhould
continue their ordinarie courſes againſt the Turke; vnleſſe
they would ioyne with the Venetians or the king of Spain:
the Polonians ſhould ſet vpon Walachia: the Emperour
and Princes of Germany vpon Hungary.</p>
               <p>3 Queſtionleſſe if each of theſe did in this manner aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile
him, their courage and force would be the greater, as
would likewiſe be their deſire to perſiſt in their enterpriſe,
without any reſpect of paines or expence, hoping all
would redound to their honour, profit, and particular ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie:
which they cannot expect from the other leagues,
and this is that which hath in part made them defectiue.
The enemie that ſhould be ſo many waies ſet vpon, would
be conſtrained to diuide his forces, which conſequently
would become leſſe able to protect him, on all ſides wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
he ſhould be aſſailed. Firſt, the gallies of Malta
aſſiſted with ſome other, and ſcouring (as they might) the
Leuant ſeas, would keepe in ſuch awe thoſe that guarde
Alexandria and Rhodes, as they would not dare to peepe
out: Againe, if Spaine would inuade Barbarie, the gallies
of Algiers would be ſure to keepe home: ſo as the ſtrength
of Venice ioyned with that of the Church, would doe
what they liſt, and would meete with no encounter by ſea
which they ſhould not eaſily ouermatch: eſpecially if at
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:8135:77"/>
the ſame time the Emperour and the King of Polonia,
would warre likewiſe vpon the Turke. We haue an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the times which verifieth our poſition. When <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
vndertooke the warre of Hungary,<note place="margin">1532.</note> againſt <hi>Charles</hi>
the 5. <hi>Andrew Doria</hi> Generall of his galleies, with a very
ſmall armie troubled all the Leuant, tooke by maine force
Coron and Patras, and harrowed all thoſe ſeas without
controule or encounter of the enemies: whence followeth,
that if the Chriſtians would as I haue ſaide, at one inſtant
ſet vpon the Turke, they would force him no doubt into a
narrow ſtraight.</p>
               <p>4 There is one point that would make the enterpriſe ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
more forcible and laſting, but it would hardly be diſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted,
and that is to draw all Chriſtian Princes which confine
not with the Turke, to contribute vnto it. All theſe ſuppoſe
themſelues free from danger and make no reckning of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
ſufferings, in whoſe behalfe they thinke they ſhould
not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tribute, as thoſe that were like to haue but the charge
and the other the profit. In a word, all catholike Princes
are ſo wedded to this particular intereſt, which is euer
more differing and vnequall among them (as hath beene
before alledged) as the league would neuer be thorowly
concluded or of long continuance, this muſt of neceſſity
be forgotten, and the only deſire of the exaltation of the
Church of God muſt be that which muſt range them to
the neceſſarie point, whereof they need not trauell to ſeeke
examples out of their owne houſes, which if they would
but imitate all would ſucceed wel, to inuite them to it I wil
alledge one.</p>
               <p>The principall aime of the league ſet on foote by <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frye</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Alcut 1088.</note> and of ſo many Princes and Nobles ſome
greater then himſelfe which accompanied him, was not
placed but vpon the particular honour of the Maieſty of
God, whereabout euery man emploied himſelfe with ſuch
zeale and deuotion, as without attending the ſuccours or
furtherance of any great King or Emperour, they drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
an army of an hundred thouſand horſe and three
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:8135:78"/>
hundred thouſand foote, wherewith they ſubdued almoſt
all the eaſt.</p>
               <p>5 Leauing apart all theſe conſiderations let vs come to
the opinion that ſome haue of their being far from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and we ſhall finde peraduenture that they are neerer
thereto then they are aware.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Amurath</hi> came firſt out of Aſia into Europe was
not Hungary (which is now ſubiect to the Turke) farther
off from the confines of the Ottomans Empire then are
now the countries of Saxony or of Bauiers,<note place="margin">1363.</note> then they of
Franconia, the Swichzers and the French? yet we ſee it now
moſt in his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>6 Shall we then ſay becauſe we haue a mountaine before
vs, or a riuer betweene vs, or ſome eſtate that ſeemeth to
ſhelter vs, that therefore we ſhould hold our ſelues happy
and in ſecurity, and not be touched with others danger and
miſery? No ſurely. For if we be Chriſtians we ought not
only to haue compaſſion of others calamities, but afforde
them alſo our good and charitable aſſiſtance: moreouer
he that meaſureth future things but by the conſequence of
things preſent, findeth himſelfe oft times beguiled; we are
to haue ſuch prouident care of what is preſent, &amp; to come,
that we may leaue to ours the ſame aſſurance we wiſh to
our ſelues, to the end to preſerue them by this prouidence
from ſuch danger as they might incur after vs. And though
we ſhould not carry that regard of our children and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and that the conſequence of our eſtate did not ſpur vs
on to ſuch an enterpriſe, ſhall there remaine in vs ſo little
courage and charity, loue and deuotion to the glory of
God, from whom we haue our being and of whom wee
hold our powers, as that we ſhould all forget to husband
his vineyard, and expell thence ſuch as intrude themſelues
into it and pollute it? wherefore ſerue all thoſe heapes of
treaſure which the Princes of Lombardy amaſſe, one in
enuy of an other? whereupon will thoſe ſo mighty Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Germany and the Imperiall townes ſpend their reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
and incomparable riches? what occaſion can all of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8135:78"/>
them finde more goodly then this to attaine to an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
glory? It is then for the inlarging the kingdome of
Chriſt that we muſt imploy all we haue, and for the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of thoſe ſacred places ouer which thoſe barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels
tyrannize, to redeeme ſo many thouſand of poore
Chriſtian ſlaues which ſuffer and grone vnder the yoake of
that inraged dogge, to giue life to an infinite number of
Chriſtians, to reuenge their wrongs, to puniſh the iniurires
&amp; blaſphemies which that tyrant and his helhounds haue
breathed out againſt the glory of God, his holy name and
church. And if humaine appetite muſt needs be an actor in
this theater, it would be an eaſie matter for great Princes
that ſend their forces, to vrge this conſideration in the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations,
that they ſhould haue in fauour of their contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions
part of the ſpoiles and conqueſts that they might
happily obtaine. Againe, if the loue of the ſeruice of God
had a working in them, they might vndertake in perſon the
Generall conduct of the army, or command part of the
confederat troupes. <hi>Godfrey</hi> a poore Prince, in compariſon
of thoſe that now ſway Chriſtendome, alienated the Duchy
of Bouillion for ſo godly a voyage. <hi>Stephen Count</hi> of
<hi>Chartres</hi> did the like with his eſtate, as did alſo many great
men, who had no other motiue thereunto then the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
of the holy land. <hi>Charles</hi> the ſeuenth King of France,
did he not ſuccor the Emperour of Conſtantinople with a
great number of horſe which he ſent him vnder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the greateſt perſonages of his kingdome? And
muſt we ſit idle with croſſed armes whileſt the cruell flames
of this infidels tyranny burne and conſume the houſes of
our neighbours?</p>

his chiefe ſtrength to the band of

and amongſt other reaſons wherewith
they ſtriue to fortify their oppinion, this
is one. It hath hapned many times that the army of the

hath been in a manner loſt, yet haue they gathered ſtrength
and kept themſelues on foote, yea they haue gotten the
victory, and all through the vertue and valour of theſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionaries.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>Machiauel</hi> diſcourſeth vpon this point,<note place="margin">Machiauels opinion for foote.</note> and as one
much paſſionate holdeth himſelfe to this argument, that
foote are more neceſſary then horſe in all exploites of war,
and he laieth his principall foundation vpon the example
of certaine Romaine Captaines, which (ſaith he) to breake
into, and force the enemy on foote haue cauſed their men
at armes to alight from their horſes and fight on foote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them: It is a poore argument and of ſmall impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſince that for once that they made their horſemen
alight, an hundred occaſions were offered to make them
mount on horſe backe if they had the commodity of horſe;
he which is on horſebacke may when he pleaſe alight, but a
footeman cannot get vp on horſebacke when hee will.
This mony ſhall ſerue to pay <hi>Machiauel</hi> whom I leaue to
proceed forward. I affirme, that in a ranged battaile, and
in the plaine field the forces of the Turke conſiſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
rely on the horſe. The proofes are cleere and at
hand, as the proceſſe of this diſcourſe ſhall diſcouer.</p>
               <p>3 Firſt no man is ignorant of the great victories the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8135:79"/>
Turk got long time before the inſtitution of the Ianizzars.
<hi>Amurath</hi> the ſecond the yeere 1420. was he that firſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained

                  <hi>Amurath</hi> the firſt had paſſed
Aſia into Europe, with his forces tooke Gallipoli, Filipoli,
and Andrinople; and we may thinke that he did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
thoſe victories without dangerous and bloudy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters:
he conquered alſo diuers other cities and wan
many other victories of the Princes of Seruia and Bulgaria,
whom he compelled to ſtoope vnder the yoake of his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.<note place="margin">1396.</note>
                  <hi>Baiazet</hi> the firſt ouercame <hi>Sigiſmonde</hi> King of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemia,
and put all thoſe French to the ſword which Charles

ſalue his loſſes went to meete him at Salumbezza, and ſo
valiantly incountred him, as his whole army was cut in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
ſo as it cannot be ſaid that the victories the Turke hath
obtained ſince the inſtitution of Ianizzars haue beene ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
greater or more memorable then the former, rather
they were the ſteps to theſe other happy atchieuements.
The beginning of things containe in them the efficient
vertue of the whole. This diſputation might proue great
and might ballance on either ſide, if I did not ad waight
to one of the opinions.</p>
               <p>I will then ſay, that before the inſtitution and ſeminary
of Ianizzars,<note place="margin">1397.</note> the Turks receiued but one memorable ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
at mount Stella at the hands of <hi>Tamburlan</hi> the moſt
ſtrong enemy that euer they aſſaied, and that after their
inſtitution they receiued more and greater, as were thoſe
of <hi>Vſumcaſſan,</hi> of <hi>Iohn Huniades,</hi> of <hi>Mathew Coruin,</hi> of the
<hi>Mamelucks,</hi> of the great <hi>Scanderbag,</hi> of <hi>Don Iohn</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria,</hi>
of the Kings of Perſia and others.</p>
               <p>4 The ſecond proofe which I will produce to fortifie the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8135:80"/>
truth of my propoſition, is, that all ſuch as haue had the
better hand of the Turkes, euer had it by the meanes of
their horſe, wherein they did exceed the enemy in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and ſtrength, as we haue ſo often ſaide of the Perſians
and of the Mamelucks. The great <hi>Sophi <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>mael,</hi> had he
not vanquiſhed <hi>Selim</hi> the ſecond with the ſtrength of his
horſe, if when he did ſet vpon the rier-ward, where the
Turke was in perſon, the thunder of his Cannon had not ſo
affrighted the horſe, as they ran away with their maſters, to
the diſordering of the whole armie? The onely thing
that ouerthrew the fortune which the Perſian had almoſt
alreadie in his poſſeſſion. <hi>Cudabeuda</hi> King of Perſia, hath
many times ouercome the Turkiſh forces, by the onely
ſtrength of his horſe, whereof he hath more and is better
armed then the other. The Hungarians in like ſort haue
many times put the Turkes to the woorſe by their fight on
horſebacke.</p>
               <p>5 The third and ſtrongeſt proofe of my aſſertion, is, that
all the harmes we haue receiued of the Turke, haue come
by his horſe, as at Nicapolis, at Salembezza, at Varna,
at the riuer of Moraua, at Exechium, at Buda and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>
               <p>6 And if it euer hapned that the Ianizzars recouered the
battaile halle loſt, it is to be imputed to this, that they were
reſerued for the rierward; ſo as it was eaſie for freſh men
to repell thoſe which were already weakned and tyred. But
I thinke no man but will grant, that if inſtead of the Ianiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars
they had beene as many horſe, they had performed as
much. As on the contrarie, if the other had kept in ſtore
ſome freſh troupes of horſe, as the Turkes, they had dealt
otherwiſe with them, and kept them well enough from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reauing
them of the victorie. In concluſion, the horſe are
they that defeat the enemie, and become maſters of the
field, that prepare the way for the foote to the beſeeging
of townes, and giue them time and leiſure to force and
take them.</p>

haue beene euermore victorious, as at Metelin, at Cafalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,
at Preueſa, at Scorſolari. If any one oppoſing me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
the ouerthrow of our armie at Gerbes,<note place="margin">1580.</note> which hapned
about the ſame time, let him read the diſcourſe of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorie,
(as is requiſite) and he ſhall finde that that chanced
not through the force and valour of the enemy, but rather
through our owne fault; inſomuch as our armie could not
take their opportunitie to diſlodge in due time; but ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
themſelues to be beſieged by the hardneſſe of the
ſeaſon, and by tempeſts; which ſo diſordred them as it was
eaſie for the enemie to force them. <hi>Grimani</hi> Generall of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:8135:81"/>
the Venetians, let ſlippe the occaſion of a woorthy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
when he knew not how to take his time to charge the
enemie, as he might well haue done at Sapienza. But on
the contrarie,<note place="margin">Vid. 181.</note> as often as the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fift ſet
foorth an armie to ſome purpoſe, the Turke durſt neuer
looke abroad; as when he vndertooke the voyage of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
and of Algiers, where neuertheleſſe he encountred
many diſaſters, he brought before Tunis ſeauen hundred
ſaile, and before Algiers fiue hundred onely. Thus much
for experience.</p>
               <p>2 Now we muſt ſee what reaſons we haue in ſtore to
prooue that we may more eaſily aſſaile the Turke by ſea
then by land. Among others this may paſſe, that our ſeas
are more frequented, and our ports more rich and ſafe
then thoſe of the Leuant. For firſt (ſet aſide Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple)
there is not thoroughout their obedience, any one
Porte that may be equalled to thoſe of Venice, Lisbone,
Siuill, Antwerp, London, Amſterdam, Lubec, or Danske,
&amp;c. and very few alſo that may be compared with thoſe
of Naples, Genoua, Villa-Franca, Neſſina, Palermo,
Raguſa, Marſſeilles, Tolon, Bourdeaux, New-Hauen,
Rochelle, and Rouane, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 It is cleere then that we ſurmount the Turke not only
in numbers of Portes and good harbers for the retraict
and ſhelter of our armies, but alſo in Mariners and men
accuſtomed and experienced in both the ſeas. Moreouer,
there is not perhaps in the world a coaſt that affoordeth
greater plentie of men then that of Genoua, Dalmatia,
Sclauonia, Venice, Candye. Againe, there is not a nation
to be found of more reſolution or better proofe for ſea af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires,
then are thoſe of Marſeilles. I omit to ſpeake of the
Catalonian, the Portugal, the Biskayan, the Engliſh, the
Norman, the Hollander, and Zelander, all people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous
skilfull in Nauigation.</p>
               <p>4 I would willingly demaund, what it auaileth the Turke
to poſſeſſe a large and ſpacious ſea bordering country, if it
remaine vnhabited; neither were it enough if it were: for
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:8135:81"/>
the exploits of maritime warre, it is requiſite they be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,
reſolute, and ſuch as can endure trauell and paine.
Alongſt all the coaſt of Africke, the Turke hath not one
Hauen of account beſides Algies. In all Egypt hee hath
only Alexandria, and Dalmatia, at the leaſt which are held
in any conſideration. In Soria, take away Saffo and Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philia,
thoſe neere Tirus, Epheſus, Cicize, and the reſt ſo
celebrated in ancient times, remaine at this day nameleſſe,
and buried in their owne ruines. They haue Gallipoli
which is of no great traffike: they haue that of Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,
whereof they ſteade and vaunt themſelues moſt of
all: Moreouer, all theſe Ports are not ſo good or ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
as ours, either if we conſider the forme, or the
commoditie of ſituation, nor ſo well ſtored with artillerie
as ours are.</p>
               <p>5 Againe, fighting by ſea, wee ſhall not need to feare
their horſe, whoſe encounter in regard of their multitude
cannot be but a terror vnto vs; relying as they doe vpon
them, as the principall nerue of their forces; but as for
foote, we excell them in number and valour:</p>
               <p>6 For concluſion, it is moſt certaine, if we could once
depriue the Turke of the vſe of the ſea, he would be ſoone
ouerthrowne by land with a ſufficient number of gallies,
which might be maintained in the Archipelago: we ſhould
cut him off from all trafficke with Egypt and Soria, as alſo
keeping certaine gallies in the Straight and chanell, we
ſhould hinder the commerce of Aſia and Conſtantinople,
which he could not be long without, ſo that by continuing
this manner of warring vpon him without intermiſſion, we
ſhould by little and little heaue him out of the whole
Empire of Greece, where there would be
enough to ſatiate the greedie am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>

whereby he may be inwardly weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,

Miniſters, others are deriued from among the people. I
will then produce ſome few examples noting the errors of
ſuch as ſway a Soueraigne authority, and ſo orderly come
to the other, to collect thence what may ſerue to procure
the Turkes ruine.</p>
               <p>2 That which would fall moſt to our purpoſe would be if
the great Turke ſhould die without heires of the true line
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:8135:82"/>
and race of <hi>Ottoman.</hi> For in ſuch a caſe it is likely the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerbyes,
Vizirs, Baſſas, Sangiacks,</hi> and the greateſt perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the Turkiſh nation, would each one for himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour
to poſſeſſe himſelfe of whatſoeuer he could moſt
eaſily compaſſe.</p>
               <p>3 The ſecond cauſe would be, if in regard of his cruelty,
or negligence, the Prince ſhould giue his ſubiects occaſion
to hate and contemne him: but the miſchiefe would proue
yet greater if it did ariſe from the cowardlineſſe or ſloath of
the Prince. For his ſtrength conſiſting wholly in the great
numbers of his ſouldiours ordinarily intertained, how
could he poſſibly containe ſuch mighty armies in deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and quietneſſe; if he did not daily buſie them in the
exerciſe of war? And leſſe how could ſo many nations be
held within compaſſe of feare and obedience without the
feare of ordinary armes? It is not to be doubted then if
they had a Prince who were giuen ouer to idleneſſe and a
looſe life, or that they diſcried him to be a coward &amp; ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
but they would be forward to draw their ſwords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, and thence worke their owne deſtruction. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iazet</hi>
the ſecond had proofe of this, for abandoning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to all pleaſures and reſoluing vpon a priuat and retired
courſe of life,<note place="margin">1511.</note> to ſpend his time in reading good authors;
his ſonne ſought his deſtruction, and in the end fauored by
the Ianizzars depriued him of his life and kingdome. For
though <hi>Baiazet</hi> repreſſed the firſt violence of his ſonnes
ambition, yet he was at the laſt forced by the Ianizzars not
only to pardon his rebellion, but alſo to ſend him with an
army againſt his other ſonne <hi>Accomat,</hi> who ſuppoſing his
father ment to prefer <hi>Selim</hi> before himſelfe, who was the
elder, cauſed the noſes and eares of his fathers meſſengers
moſt ſhamefully to be cut off; the enormity of this fact ill
digeſted, and worſe interpreted was that which cancelled
the greater faults of <hi>Selim,</hi> to take vengeance of this laſt &amp;
leſſe outrage; whence it came to paſſe in the end that theſe
ſame Ianizzars poſſeſt <hi>Selim</hi> of the empire, who ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
put to death his vnhappy father. <hi>Amurath</hi> the third
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:8135:83"/>
now raigning hauing withdrawne himſelfe from the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of war to liue in eaſe and quiet hath loſt much of his
ſouldiours and ſeruants ancient obedience, zeale, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance,
ſuch as they were wont to carry towards their
Soueraignes greatneſſe. The Baſſa of Cairo who had the
gouernment of Aegypt, named <hi>Raguſei,</hi> being ſummoned
(according to their Emperious cuſtome) to make his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
at the port, flatly refuſed to come thither and
made his eſcape with a world of treaſure which he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſed
by extorſions and pilling of the people, during the
time of his adminiſtration. The Ianizzars which were at
thoſe times appointed for the wars of Perſia, would not
once moue a foote to march thitherward: but as halfe in a
mutiny ſaid plainly they would not any more go vpon any
enterpriſe vnleſſe the great Turke their Lord would vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber
himſelfe from among his concubines, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
the voyage himſelfe in perſon, ſo as he was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by vertue of giftes and increaſe of pay to win them to
the war. Moreouer of late after the ouerthrow of Tauris,
the Turke hauing appointed a new generall for the ſucco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of his vanquiſhed army, and reenforcing of ſuch as
remained within the cittadell; all the commandements he
could lay vpon him, could not preuaile ſo much with him
as to get him to march forward, rather he grew to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
with him, and that finiſhed, he made the moſt adoe
in the world to muſter vp twenty thouſand men, who refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
likewiſe to goe to that war, otherwiſe then vpon all the
aduantages they could deuiſe to demand: not like ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
and ſlaues, but as if they had beene neighbours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
and confederates. Theſe breaches already made in
the obedience they were wont to render thir lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
may perſwade vs that they will eaſily rebell, vpon
the firſt occaſion that ſhall preſent it ſelfe without reſpect
of their Princes greatneſſe, or obſeruation of their ancient
military policy.</p>
               <p>4 The third occaſion might befall, if there were many
brethren to debate the Empire after the death of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:8135:83"/>
as it hapned between <hi>Zizimus,</hi> and <hi>Baiazet,</hi> ſonnes

This <hi>Baiazet</hi> was fauoured of the Ianizzars againſt

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt</hi> by forraine
Princes: they incountred and fought cruel battailes, whoſe
victories brought the whole Eſtate in danger: <hi>Baiazet</hi>
and <hi>Selim</hi> remained conquerours, each one his party by
meanes of the great numbers of men that accompanied
them,<note place="margin">1513.</note> and of the valour of the ſouldiours of the old bandes
which ſerued vnder them. Notwithſtanding all theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
which God ſo to the purpoſe prepared, not
one Chriſtian Prince once ſtirred, or ſo much as made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to arme in fauour of the weaker of thoſe which conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
which would no doubt haue entangled both of them
in a long and dangerous ſtrife, enough finally to haue rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
or much decaied the houſe of the Ottomans, when
they ſhould haue called ſuch an one to their ſuccour as
would haue rather blowen then quenched their fires. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the Princes of Chriſtendome there was none
but the great maſter of Rhodes, which ſent ſome ſupplies
of artillery to <hi>Zizimus,</hi> and which after receiued and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
him from the hands of <hi>Baiazet,</hi> when he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to retire himſelfe to his protection.</p>
               <p>5 Theſe domeſtique quarrels cannot now become ſo
ſtrong (eſpecially ſuch as might happen betweene bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren)
as then they might, conſidering that the <hi>Mame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucks,</hi>
who as neighbours might haue fomented and giuen
intertainment to ſuch differences, are now extinct and
their name no more mentioned. They were in their time
the only emulators of the Turkes glory: <hi>Rhodes</hi> hath made
an exchange of her fortune, and is now in the power of
this tyrant. Cypres beareth the like yoake. Theſe two
Ilands affoorded an eſpecial commodity to ſow diſſentions
among the Turks, to fauour and ſuccour one of the parties.</p>
               <p>6 The fourth cauſe would eaſily ariſe from the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:8135:84"/>
and head-ſtrong raſhneſſe of the Ianizzars, likely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to attempt and execute as much as ſometime did
the Pretorian bands of the Romans, who made ſlender ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
to fill the Empire with ſlaughters and maſſacres,
wherein many Emperours ended their daies: they electing
others at their pleaſures againſt the authority of the Senat,
and the loue and reuerence they ought to haue borne to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
their country. The like may we hope or expect from
the Ianizzars, that they will one day aſſume to themſelues
the ſame power and learne to performe the like, whereof
they gaue an aſſaie at ſuch time as they compelled <hi>Baiazet</hi>
the ſecond to reſigne the Empire to <hi>Selim</hi> his ſonne. They
did almoſt the like when <hi>Soliman</hi> cauſed his ſonne <hi>Muſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi>
to be murthered; for they beſieged him and inuironed
his tent for certaine daies ſpace, crying out they would
know the cauſe of that yong Princes death. In the end by
the deuiſe of the <hi>Baſſa</hi> and with ſtoore of coyne, he wan to
him foure thouſand of them, who diſengaged him of the
feare and danger wherein he was plunged.</p>
               <p>7 The fift cauſe may be fetched from the ambition or
diſcontent of the great ones of the countrie, or of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
ſwaying the ſupreame authority &amp; credit in places of
gouernment. <hi>Gazeles</hi> gouernour of Soria made way for
a reuolt of the like quality, as did alſo <hi>Acomat</hi> Generall of
Aegypt: <hi>Gazeles,</hi> aſſiſted by the <hi>Mamelucks, Arabians</hi> and
thoſe of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> endeuoured to ſet himſelfe vp againſt the
great Turke: but he was diſcouered by <hi>Cayembeius</hi> whom
he had acquainted with the conſpiracy. This man either
for feare (as looking into the danger of the enterpriſe) or
for enuy of his companions greatneſſe, reuealed all to his
Maſter <hi>Soliman,</hi> who preſently diſpatched againſt him <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratha
Baſſa,</hi> by whom he was vanquiſhed in battaile. <hi>Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat</hi>
had not the leaſure to proceed far in his attempt, for as
he did inconſideratly precipitate himſelfe into the triall
thereof, ſo was he as ſpeedily diſcouered, and in an inſtant
ſuppreſſed and ſlaine, without hauing thriued ought in his

commonly the beginnings of innouations and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſo extraordinary, are feeble, and that that wiſdome
ſheweth it ſelfe like it ſelfe which can ſo diligently ſuckle
and nouriſh them as they may attaine to a happy growth.
I am of opinion, that when we incounter with inſtruments
that are not without ambition, courage, and a thirſt of
reuenge; after we haue felt and ſounded them once, twiſe,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:8135:86"/>
or thriſe, we ſhall in the end make a breach in their loyalty
and obedience; eſpecially if we ſet before them (be it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a true or falſe title) the certaintie of ſome mightie ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
whereof they may ſee the preparatiues; for ſo they
will the more couragiouſly attempt againſt the life and
eſtate of their Prince.</p>
               <p>4 Moreouer it is not to be forgotten, that when ſuch
practiſes ſhall be diſcouered by the Turke, and that he ſhal
ſee the Chriſtians more diligent then hitherto they haue
beene, to ſound the affections of his ſeruants and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects:
he will thereupon enter into ſuch a diſtruſt of them,
as euen that will make him offer them ſome hard meaſure.
This diſtruſt will be enough to beget a thouſand ſuſpitions
and hard conceits in his ſeruants, and ſubiects, either for
the managing of affaires, or for the danger that the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of loyaltie incurreth, when it hath to deale with ſuch
a diſtruſtfull and ſuſpitious Prince, as this would prooue:
ſo as by little and little it would worke vs out ſome occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fitting our purpoſe, eſpecially, if whileſt this practiſe
were hatching, and on foote, the children of the Turke
ſhould take armes one againſt the other, or that during
their fathers life, they ſhould diſpute the poſſeſſion of the
Empire: for the ice being already broken, there would be
a more eaſie paſſage and better ſucceſſe, then if it had not
beene taken in hand at all.</p>
               <p>5 But becauſe an eſpeciall iudgement, patience, and
much wiſedome are requiſite in ſuch buſineſſes, we muſt
make choice of men furniſhed with all theſe parts, to the
end they may wiſely know when to take their opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and times, to ſow theſe diſſentions, and that there
be not want of mony to diſtribute amongſt this
people, which are farther in loue
therewith, then any other
nation the world
affoordeth.</p>

ſubiect to his Empire; one followeth
the ſect of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> the other the
truth of the Goſpel of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> The
Mahometanes are quiet, as thoſe which
being of one and the ſame law, haue no
cauſe to make any tumult. The Chriſtians cannot ſtirre, as
being ouer topped and awed by a greater power then their
owne, which curbeth them ſo, as there is no better way to
moue them to rebel, then to make them handle (as it were)
and ſee the aſſurance of an approching ſuccour, to prouide
them of armes and all other furniture for the wars: for
otherwiſe it is impoſſible they ſhould dare to make the
leaſt ſhew once to mooue, whileſt they haue the enemie
ouer them alwaies in a readineſſe and armed, who would
in a moment confound them, eſpecially being as they are
naked and vnprouided of armes, offenſiue or defenſiue.
<hi>Selim</hi> the ſecond doubting the woorſt, by the counſaile of
<hi>Occhially,</hi> cauſed al the Chriſtians inhabiting the ſea coaſts,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:8135:87"/>
to retire themſelues farre vp into the maine land, to the
end the preſence of the Chriſtian forces ſhould not incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
them againſt him, as it hapned at ſuch time as <hi>Andrew
Dorea</hi> atchieued the enterpriſe of <hi>Patras</hi> and <hi>Coron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 If the Chriſtians ſhould euer vndertake the like diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
they ought to take eſpeciall heede how they vnſhip
their ſuccours in thoſe parts of the continent where the
horſe are at hand, ſince they were likely enough by their
ſtrength to choake at the firſt the reuolt of the Chriſtians,
for ſo mighty are they in horſe, and of ſuch ſpeed and dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
as they would in an inſtant beare downe before them
whatſoeuer ſhould oppoſe them. Wherefore it would be
better to enter by Albania and by places mountanous and
of difficult acceſſe, where the horſe are not able to ſerue,
as in the plaine. This is as much as we ment to ſay of ſuch
Chriſtians as are vnder the Turkes dominions, all which I
will imagine want not will to rebell, if the Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome
would furniſh them of meanes.</p>
               <p>3 Now let vs ſee what way were beſt to be taken to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke
the Mahometans to reuolt, and to fill their countries
with troubles, and ciuill diſſentions. If we will but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how their religion is fraught with vntruthes, their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran
abounding in follies, we ſhall finde it eaſie to picke
matter enough out of it to ſet them together by the eares,
eſpecially if wee doe but diſperſe among them certaine
bookes fit to conuert them, or make them doubt of the
fooliſh ſuperſtitions they obſerue, compoſing them for
Europe in the Sclauonian tongue, and for Aſia in the
Arabian.</p>
               <p>4 But becauſe it would be hard to conuey theſe bookes
into the countries of the Turkes obedience but that they
would ſoone perceiue the deuice and ſpeedily remedy it:
It were beſt beginning far off, in the Indies and in the parts
of Aſia and Africke held by the Portugales: for becauſe
of the trafficke which is great in thoſe parts many Turkiſh
Marchants and others ariue there from all quarters. They
come to <hi>Mozambique</hi> in Africke, to Zophala and Quiloe
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:8135:87"/>
in Aſia. They deſcend alſo as low as the Moluccas, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chien,
Goa, Dia, Ormus, and ſundrie other parts apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the crowne of Portugale. Theſe bookes alſo
might be diſperſed abroad in the countrie of the Gentiles,
which are friends and confederates of the Chriſtians, as
in Calicut, Zailan, Cambeia, and others; and the like at
Oran, Arzilla, and in other parts of Arabia ſubiect to the
crowne of Spaine and Portugall, and in all other parts of
Europe which border vpon the Turkes.</p>
               <p>5 There muſt be a care had that the title of the booke be
ſo coloured, as it doe not at the firſt diſcouer the intent of
the author, but rather that it intice them to peruſe it with a
certaine curioſity and ſhew of pleaſantneſſe and delight.
It is requiſite alſo that the diſcourſe be not fraught with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
diſputations or ſubtill point againſt the Articles of their
beleefe, but that contrariwiſe it be full of tales and matter
fit to moue laughter; yet with ſome well conueied paſſage
which may by the way diſcouer or make them doubt of
the fables of their Alcoran.</p>
               <p>6 The Turkiſh Marchants or others, into whoſe hands
this booke ſhould light, would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fidently reade it in thoſe
parts where the Turke is not obeied. And though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
they durſt not aduenture to carry it with them, yet the
impreſſion and ſubſtance of what they had read would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
fixt in their mindes, ſo as they would after relate it
as newes to their friends and families, in ſuch ſort as it
would grow by little and little to be diuulged thereabout,
whence would ſpring a longing in others which ſhould
come and goe into thoſe countries to buy &amp; reade them:
In this manner the Alcoran in proceſſe of time would grow
out of credit amongſt them, and thoſe things which with
ſcruple and obſeruation they collect thence, would turne
to a ieſt and ſubiect of laughter, whence there could not
but inſue ſome ſchiſme and diuiſion amongſt them, for the
moſt religious men of their ſect and the moſt intereſted
would oppoſe themſelues wilfully to maintaine it. Neither
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:8135:88"/>
would it make for the purpoſe to make mention in any ſort
of our Sauiour Chriſt, much leſſe to let it be knowen that
the author thereof were a Chriſtian: for the immortall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
they beare to that name would make it odious, and
would bring it at the very firſt to be reiected. It ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be ſo contriued as if it came from ſome other of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſect, wherein a man might borrow the hand of the
inhabitants of Cambaia, of India, of Arabia, or of Perſia. In
this manner it would be better welcome and would carrie
with it more eſtimation and authority.</p>
               <p>7 It were well alſo if there were framed and publiſhed a
remonſtrance to the Ianizzars in the Sclauoman tongue,
whereby might be ſignified vnto them their originall, and
howe in their infancy they were cruelly halled from the
boſomes of their Chriſtian fathers and mothers, conueyed
into Turky, and there nuſled vp in the ſect of <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
not hauing iudgement as then to diſtinguiſh of good and
euill; that they are the pillers to vphold this Tyrant which
hath ſet his foote vpon the throat of their fathers liberty,
and which keepeth them as ſlaues vnder the yoake of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable
and barbarous ſeruitude. This would auaile
much, eſpecially if there were thereto annexed an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to take better knowledge of themſelues, and hence,
forward like good children to imbrace and free their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
parents, which daily lament them; and aboue all to
perſwade them to returne to the deare boſome of the
church wherin they were firſt, regeuerate and which atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
with ſpread armes to receiue them, entertaine them,
and ſaue them.</p>
               <p>8 Theſe things well caried would in the end make the
Turke ſo ſuſpitious, and vntractable, as he would offer oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
enow to his people hencefoorth to rouſe vp
themſelues, and better aduiſe how to ſhake off that cruell
and vnſupportable yoake which ſo mightily oppreſſeth
them, and to faſhion themſelues to a more happy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
life for the quiet of their conſciences and ſaluation of
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:8135:88"/>
their ſoules. This is that whereof the Chriſtians ought di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently
to bethinke themſelues; and not to worke one an
others ruine and deſtruction, as they ſpare not to
doe againſt the expreſſe commandement of
God, which ſo often recommendeth
vnto vs loue and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
towards our
neighbours.</p>
