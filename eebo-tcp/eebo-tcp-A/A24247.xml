         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COlonel <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Dragoons, with ſome Horſe and Foot, having
paſſed the <hi>Shannon,</hi> over a Bridge of Boats, about a Mile and a
half above the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Town, on the 16th, about Five in the
Morning, notwithſtanding the Oppoſitions made by the Enemy's Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons,
as you have already heard. Their Main Body, that lay higher
up, immediately decamped, marching away in great Confuſion towards
the Mountains: So that not being yet got into a Poſture of Purſuing
them, we contented our ſelves with Taking in a Caſtle in the River,
wherein were 60 of the Enemy, who were all made Priſoners of War;
and ſecuring our Bridge by a Fort we flung up on the County of <hi>Clare</hi>
ſide. In this great Action we kill'd about 80 of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and had none
kill'd, and only 20 wounded on our Side. This Night a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Officer, and a very ſenſible Gentleman, Deſerted the Town, and
came over to us, and informs us, that our Bombs and Cannon have kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
great Numbers of the Garriſon, and left few Houſes ſtanding in the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Town, and that they have Bread but ſor a very few Days. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
our being buſied in Paſſing the <hi>Shannon,</hi> we Fired plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
laſt Night into the Town, and continue to do ſo this Day.</p>
            <p>17th. All this Day we continued to ply the Town with Red-hot Balls,
Carcaſſes and Bombs, with great Execution; and truly, the Noiſe of
the falling of the Houſes, the tearing and ſplitting of the Timber, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Shrieks and Out-cries of the Inhabitants, was indeed very
terrible. Laſt Night the General gave Order that moſt of the Regiments
of Horſe and Dragoons, with divers of Foot, ſhould prepare to march
over the new Float. On <hi>Tueſday</hi> in the Evening our Cannon were thrice
Diſcharged, and our Army made ſeveral Vollies, in demonſtration of
their Joy for the great Defeat given the <hi>Turks,</hi> by the Emperor's Forces,
commanded by Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden.</hi> About 60 Wagons of good Wool,
taken from the Enemy hereabouts, were lately put on board our Ships.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:47827:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>18th. All laſt Night and this Day we continued Firing furiouſly into the
Town from ſeveral Batteries, on which are Mounted 60 Pieces of Large
Cannon, the leaſt of which is a 12-Pounder. Our Lines in ſome places
are run ſo near the Enemy, that we can annoy one another with Piſtol-Shot.
This Night Orders were given to the Men of War to deſtroy all
Corn, Forage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> near the Water-ſide, in the County of <hi>Clare.</hi> Juſt
now ſome of our Militia brought in 3 notorious Rebels, who 'tis ſaid
will be hang'd: They took them 12 Miles from the Camp.</p>
            <p>19. This Morning before Day we drew off all our biggeſt Guns from
one of our Batteries, and carried them down to the Ships. On <hi>Thurſday</hi>
laſt 11 of the Enemy's Troopers came over to us, with their Horſes, Arms
and Accouterments, 5 of whom were Yeſterday Entertained by Captain
<hi>Tooke,</hi> in the Lord of <hi>Oxford</hi>'s Regiment; the reſt in others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>20th.</hi> We continue Night and Day firing into the Town, and this
Morning the Enemy are not ſparing of their Cannon Ball, at our Men, as
they paſs by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>21ſt.</hi> We continue to play into the Town from our Batteries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>22d.</hi> This Morning early the General, Lord <hi>Scravemore,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> &amp;c. with all our Horſe and Dragoons (except Collonel
<hi>Coye</hi>'s Regiment of Horſe, and 50 Dragoons out of each Regiment) with
10 Regiments of Foot, marched over our Bridge of Boats, with 14 Guns,
<hi>viz.</hi> 10 Three Pounders. and 4 Twelve Pounders, each Man taking with
him 7 Days Proviſions into the County of <hi>Clare:</hi> The Major Generals
<hi>Maccay</hi> and <hi>Talmaſh,</hi> ſtay to ſecure our Works on this ſide. We conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
Night and Day firing into the Town to this Morning the <hi>23d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Slego</hi> having Surrendred to us, according as you have already heard,
the <hi>Dublin</hi> Militia are on their March homeward; and the <hi>Northern</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia
are gone to take in <hi>Ballahy, Newtown,</hi> and <hi>Caſtlebourk,</hi> which will
totally reduce that part of <hi>Connaught,</hi> and prevent the Robberies, and
Barbarous Murders, ſo frequently committed by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> in thoſe parts;
one whereof lately happened thus: Upon the <hi>6th.</hi> Inſtant, Doctor <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Brooks</hi> returning home from Viſiting Mr. <hi>Edward Lewis</hi> of <hi>Dunmore</hi>
in the County of <hi>Gallaway,</hi> with two of Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> in Company, were ſet upon within a Mile of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter's
Houſe by a Party of Rapparees, who ſtripped one of the Men and
ſtabbed him in ſeveral places; notwithſtanding which, he out-run and eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them Naked, but the Rebels, after having ſtripp'd, and given the
Doctor, and Mr. <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Servants 12 or 13 ſtabs apiece, concluded this
Diſmal, and Barbarous Murder, by cutting their Throats.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mac-Cabe,</hi> the Grand Rapparee of the <hi>Bog of Allen,</hi> and four others
of his Crew, were lately Hang'd at <hi>Naas,</hi> and are ordered to be hung in
Chains, as a Terrour to the reſt of their Crew, who are yet out. Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
