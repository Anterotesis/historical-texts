            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>ANobleman who had an Affection for
a young Scholar of excellent Parts,
presented him with a large Gold Cup,
wrought with curius Workmanship, and
and advised him to use it rightly, with
Moderation and Sobriety. To whom the
Scholar returned this Answer. <hi>My Lord,
In the Gift you have expressed your
Liberality; and in the Counsel, your
Friendship to me: By the former, you
have enriched my House; but by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
my Heart.</hi> So'twas my Aim, that
this TALE should also be accompanied
with such good Advice, as might make it
of Profit, as well as Pleasure, to Young
Gentlemen design'd to Travel, for whose
Benefit it was chiefly Writ: And by
shewing them where the sculking Rocks lie
hid on which other Vessels have been
Ship-wrack'd, I would teach them to
steer a more secure Course, and preserve
themselves from the like Misfortune.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44587:3"/>'Tis then fit they should know, that the
Curtizans of Italy are notorious for their
Subtilties, by which they often allure Men
of eminent Quality and Parts, as well as
Others, into their Snares, and so ruine many
Noble Families. They take 'em up into
the <hi>Fools Paradise,</hi> caress and entertain
'em with Banquets, Musick, Dancing, and
all Delights they can invent to gratify the
Senses; but having obtain'd their Ends;
those whom before they flatter'd, they after
pack off in Scorn and Derision, with heavy
Hearts, but with light light Purses: Which
Truth, some of our Young Gallants, sent to
make Observations on Foreign Countries and
People, have been able to testify by a
dear bought Experience.</p>
            <p>But scarce any Nation under the Sun,
is so abounding in this sort of Ill Women
as <hi>Spain.</hi> There, in Cities and great
Towns, when it begins to grow dark, they
appear in Shoals, distinguish'd by their
White Veils or Mantles, and have their
Places of general Rendezvous: Those of
<hi>Toledo</hi> in the <hi>Zocodover,</hi> and those of
<hi>Madrid</hi> in the <hi>Puerta del Sol;</hi> where
discovering their Faces, they shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:44587:3"/>
as in a Market, and ply for the
Ruine and Destruction of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And as these <hi>Lindas Margaritas</hi> are
known to be the most witty, quick, and
entertaining of the World in Conversation;
so are they above all others the most impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and most nicely skill'd, in all points
of their accursed Mystery; and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
very dextrous in managing their Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
to all Advantages; for they seldom
part with any one out of their Power, so
long as they find he has Money, Goods, or
Credit left. And then tho' several of
these <hi>Enamorados</hi> have been discarded
by their Misses, in a naked and starving
Condition, with all their sparks of Love
extinct; yet have they soon felt their
Bodies so enflamed, by an unnatural Fire
kindled there, that they have scarce
been able to bring them to a good
Temper again, so long as they liv'd.</p>
            <p>'Twas therefore my Drift in the Principal
Novel, to expose this sort of Vice, and by
Painting it in its proper Colours, to show
its deformity; which I have endeavour'd in
the Character of a Young Man, who, whilst
indulging himself in Lewdness with his
<pb facs="tcp:44587:4"/>
Mistress, fancy'd he was raised up to the
highest Region of Felicity, his Heart could
wish to arrive at; which made him deas
to all good Admonition, and insensible of
Danger, 'till he had run blindly on to the
very Brink of Perdition.</p>
            <p>The Morality to be gathered from hence,
is, That such Young Gentlemen, as in
their Travels abroad, or here at home, are
inclined to the like Vicious Courses, be
perswaded to quit them in time, before
they plunge themselves into inevitable Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in:
And it may shew the Parents or Friends
of such, the danger of committing them to
the wide World, without some vigilant
Eye, and strict hade over them, to keep
'em in bounds of safety. For when once
they hearken to the Charms of those <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
and lift themselves to fight under <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid</hi>'s
Banners, they throw off all thoughts
of Danger, as they do of Virtue: Books are
then laid aside; all healthful Exercises
dis-used, and ingenious Recreations slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Their time is chiefly taken up in a
fond Contemplation of the admired Fair
One, the Object of their Love, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
of their Lust. Their Manners also and
<pb facs="tcp:44587:4"/>
Ways of Living are quite changed, and
all their Actions run counter to those of
other Men in their Senses. For tho'
the bright Morn display it self, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Husbandman into the Fields
to his Labour; the Schollar to his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
the Traveller to his Iourney; and
and all Industrious Persons to their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
honest Employments; yet is this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Light of small Benefit to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing
Gallant 'till about Noon, when he
opens his Eyes, rises, and spends the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder
of the Day, in Dressing, Eating,
and Contriving new Methods of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
for his Mistress; and when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are going in due season, to their
Natural Rest, he then sets out to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
his unlawful Amours.</p>
            <p>This is the common Practice of many
in those hot Countries, who by such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies,
bring themselves to Misery,
and to untimely Ends. And tho' our
Adventurer's Intrigue proved not so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
as some have done; and was not acted
with a common Strumpet; yet was it attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with as many Dangers as most of that
kind, and his Life by himself as boldly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed;
<pb facs="tcp:44587:5"/>
whilst he might well have called
to mind, the Misfortune which he knew
had befallen a Young Gentleman, the
Son of a Rich Merchant in <hi>Spain;</hi> who
being engaged in an Amrous Design
with a Lady, and finding himself like to
be surprized in her Chamber, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to escape over the Tops of
Houses; but from thence was shot down
dead by the wronged Husband.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And lest what I have hinted, should
fall short, I shall add what</hi> Aeneas Sylvius
<hi>says emphatically on this Subject.</hi> Quid

            <head>THE
Revengeful Mistress,
OR AN
Amorous Adventure.</head>
            <p>THough <hi>Madrid</hi> have not the
Title of a City, yet in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of its large Extent, its
great Riches, and the Kings
of <hi>Spain</hi> for many years honouring
it with their Residence, it has by
much got the preeminence of the
Ancient City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
stiled <hi>La Villa Real de Madrid,</hi>
the Royal Town of <hi>Madrid.</hi> Nor
has it this Title without just reason,
since it is adorned with three of his
Catholick Majesty's Royal Palaces.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44587:6"/>
The first is that which for Eminence
is called <hi>The Palace,</hi> much admired
for its Beauty, standing within the
Town, on the banks of the River
<hi>Mansanarez,</hi> and was built by the
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth; having
on the top of its Curious Stone Front
an old Brick Tower, appearing as a
blemish, but reserved on purpose
there by that Monarch, for a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
of his having kept his Rival in
Glory, the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Francis</hi> the
First, a Prisoner in it. The second
Palace is the <hi>Buen Retiro,</hi> on the
North side of the Town, but seated on
ground something higher than it,
within a most delightful Enclosure,
resembling St. <hi>Iames</hi>'s-<hi>Park;</hi> this
glories in its fine Gardens, shady
Groves, its long Walks of Trees,
and a Canal filled from a vast square
Pond, called by them a Sea, but is
it self supply'd with water brought
thither by an Aquaeduct, for about
the space of two Leagues. The
third Palace is called <hi>La Casa del
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44587:6"/>
Campo,</hi> or the Country House, on
the other side of the River; chiefly
intended for a place of pleasure, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned,
as all the other Royal Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are, with Excellent Paintings;
and has in the middle of its Chief
Garden an admirable Statue of Brass,
of King <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth, Father of
the present King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second,
upon a Pedestal on Horseback, made
by a great <hi>Italian</hi> Master, being a
Present to his said Catholick Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
by the then Great Duke of
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> and is esteemed to excel
that which stands in the Principal
Court of the <hi>Buen Retiro.</hi> 'Tis also
of no small advantage to this Town
of <hi>Madrid,</hi> to have the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of three others of his Catholick
Majesty's Palaces not very remote.
The first is <hi>El Pardo,</hi> at about two
Leagues distance, in a large Forest,
to which the King often goes for his
Recreation, to divert himself, and
his Court, with Hunting the Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Boar,
and other Game, which are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44587:7"/>
commonly first taken in Toyls, and
then in a great Court before the
Palace are hunted to death.</p>
            <p>The Second is called <hi>Aranjuez,</hi> or
to our pronunciation <hi>Arangwhess,</hi>
about five or six Leagues from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid,</hi>
fam'd for its delightful Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it were in a Peninsula; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on that Languet of Land where
the two great Rivers <hi>Tagus</hi> and
<hi>Harama</hi> have their Confluence, and
the latter is lost in the former. This
Royal Seat is not so much remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the House it self, as for its
pleasant Gardens, Statues, Fountains,
and its spacious Walks; one of which
is a compleat League in length, sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all the way with a double row
of tall English Oaks on each side of
it, planted there by King <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second, the Husband of our Queen
<hi>Mary</hi> the First, near an hundred
and fifty years ago. And from those
two Rivers, which wash the two
outsides of this spacious Garden, are
brought thither, through Pipes, such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44587:7"/>
vast quantities of water, as supply
the Fountains, and make such a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
variety of Water-works, as is
very amazing to the Beholders. And
there at Mid-day in Summer time,
when the Sun shines, they can make
an artificial Rainbow, by playing
several Pipes of Water from the tops
of some of the Oaks, a-cross the
said broad Walk.</p>
            <p>The other Palace is seven Leagues
from <hi>Madrid,</hi> which is about twenty
English Miles, and is that Celebrated
House, the <hi>Escurial,</hi> built by King
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second, at the foot of the
great Mountain which they call <hi>La
Sierra de Guadarama,</hi> and by him it
was Dedicated to S<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Laurence</hi> the
Martyr, who had been broil'd to
death on a Gridiron. The <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
term this Magnificent Pile the
Eighth Wonder of the World: And
well they may; for 'tis of so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
a bulk, that it seems capacious
enough to lodge the Inhabitants of
a small City; and yet 'tis so very regular
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44587:8"/>
and uniform in all its parts,
that there is not a Tower, Pinacle,
nor Window on one side, which has
not the same to answer it on the
other.</p>
            <p>There is in the Spanish Tongue a
whole Book in Folio, writ of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription;
but I shall content my
self to say 'tis a most Beautiful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick,
all of a gray sort of Marble,
drawn down from the Quarries of
that Mountain, and for the most
part of the <hi>Doric</hi> order built, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing
a Noble Solidity, as well as
an exact Symetry. In the Front,
which is eight hundred paces broad,
are three stately Doors or Gates, of
which that in the Center is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
and opens into the first Court,
where, before you, you have a view
of the Grand <hi>Portico</hi> of the Church,
over which in Niches stand the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the five good Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi>
and <hi>Israel,</hi> made much bigger than
the Life, of Brass, and guilt in the
Fire. Into this <hi>Portico</hi> you advance
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44587:8"/>
by large steps, and are led into the
Church it self, which for bigness may
compare with many Cathedrals, but
will surpass them in beauty; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
the great Hemisphereor
<hi>Dome,</hi> you may descend into the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Oratory</hi> or <hi>Chappel,</hi> called the
<hi>Pantheon,</hi> which, tho' under ground,
is an imitation of that admired
piece of Building in <hi>Rome,</hi> so called
by the old <hi>Romans,</hi> but now, <hi>Santa
Maria della Rotunda.</hi> Here round
the sides are placed, as it were in
Niches, one above another, many
Brazen Urns; in some of which are
preserved the Bodies of the Emperor
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and of the several
Kings and Queens of <hi>Spain</hi> since that
time.</p>
            <p>To make short, the whole Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
was designed to resemble a square
Gridiron, to which the Church
must serve for a handle; and on each
side of the Grand <hi>Portico,</hi> and of the
first Court, are seven other Courts,
making fifteen in all, wherein are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44587:9"/>
besides the King's Palace,
which takes not up above one fourth
part of the whole, a Royal Convent
of <hi>Monks,</hi> of the Order of St. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom,</hi>
and two Large Colledges, the
one of Regular, and the other of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Students: Also a vast Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
over the Principal Gate, made
for a Noble Library of Books, reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
to be little inferiour to that of
the <hi>Vatican</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> or the <hi>Bodleian</hi>
Library in <hi>Oxford.</hi> And here the
<hi>Monks,</hi> after you think you have
seen the whole, lead you into one
Room fill'd only with Excellent
Greek Manuscripts, of which they
are more proud to talk, than skilful
to use; and into another full of
Books written in the Oriental
Tongues, which had been a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
made by that Learned Prince
<hi>Muley Sidan</hi> Emperor of <hi>Marocco,</hi> and
accidentally seized at Sea by <hi>Don
Iuan</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> in his return from
the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> by whom they
were presented to King <hi>Philip</hi> the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44587:9"/>
Second, to adorn this his New Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.</p>
            <p>But I should swell this little Piece
into a large Volume, should I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to give but a slight Description
of the outward Beauties, and most
Remarkable things of this place, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
of the Church, the several
Cloysters, Apartments, Halls, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries,
Chappels, Sacristies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Stately Rooms, as well private
as publick; or of the admirable Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
belonging to them; as the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Paintings of the greatest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
in that Art, the World for these
two or three last Centuries has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
Or speak of the immense
Riches in Plate and Jewels there
shewn in several places; or the
Robes of the Churchmen, Relicks of
Saints, Pieces of Antiquity, and
other Curiosities. I shall therefore
only add this seeming incredible
thing of this vast Fabrick, that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> affirm it to be no less than
thirty three Leagues, which is near
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44587:10"/>
a hundred Miles (as say they, it has
been computed) for a Man to go,
that would walk about into every
one of the Rooms of it. But I dare
not undertake to vouch for this, tho'
I spent three days in viewing what
was most worthy of Note there.</p>
            <p>But now to return to <hi>Madrid,</hi>
which the <hi>Romans</hi> called <hi>Mantua Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentana,</hi>
or <hi>Carpentanorum;</hi> I say, there
is not any thing of Beauty of Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur,
for which a Town is Famous,
but this Place may challenge for it
a competition with the proudest
City in all <hi>Spain,</hi> a good River ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and a large Cathedral; but as
for other Churches, Convents, and
Hospitals here, they excel in Curiosity
and Riches; so do the spacious
Streets and <hi>Plaças,</hi> or Piazzas, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the <hi>Placa Mayor,</hi> wherein the
Noble Sport of the Bulls, called the
<hi>Fiesta,</hi> or the <hi>Iuego de Toros</hi> is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon some Eminent Occasions;
but annually on the three Festiaval
Days of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44587:10"/>
and St. <hi>Isidro,</hi> or <hi>Isidore,</hi> to
whom they ascribe the Honour of
Patron of the Town.</p>
            <p>Hither the Court having drawn a
great confluence of the Nobility and
Gentry, as well as Merchants of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Nations; there are, of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
many stately Palaces and
Houses of Grandees, and other No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen,
who live here in great
Splendor; as do also many Eminent
Persons of inferiour Rank and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
The Chiefest of the Houses
are, first, that of the Marquess <hi>de
Leche,</hi> built by his Father <hi>Don Luis
de Haro,</hi> Grand Minister of State,
and <hi>Privado</hi> or Favourite of King
<hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth; then the Palace
of the Dukes of <hi>Lerma,</hi> those of the
Dukes of <hi>Infantado,</hi> of <hi>Montalto,</hi>
with innumerable others. There
were likewise two very stately Bridges
over the small River; but the newest
and finest of them, almost as soon as
built, was carried away, by force of
a sudden and violent Flood. And
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44587:11"/>
tho' the Town stand dry, on an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence
much above the River, yet
is it so well supplied by Water-works,
and Fountains, that there is seldom
any scarcity of Water in it.</p>
            <p>The several Foreign Ministers also,
who are sent from the Courts of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes and States, to make their
Residence here, do not a little add to
the Ornament and Grandeur of the
Place. Amongst whom our Kings
Ambassadours did lay their Claim to
the third Seat in the Chappel Royal,
and it was ever, without dispute, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
allowed them, after the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio
of the Pope, and of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's
Ambassador, who only had Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence
of them: Tho' of late Years
the <hi>French</hi> have contested for it and
since that, to avoid the Mischiefs which
happened by the Retinues of the two
Ambassadors fighting always when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they met, it has been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated.
From this orderly placing
in the King's Chappel, of the several
Ambassadors coming from Crown'd
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44587:11"/>
Heads, amongst whom are also
reckoned those from the Republick
of <hi>Venice,</hi> and States of <hi>Holland,</hi> they
are called there, <hi>Emvaxadores de
la Capilla,</hi> Ambassadors of the
Chappel.</p>
            <p>'Twas during the Negotiation of
a Person of great Honour and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
bearing this Character from our
King, and residing in this Court,
that there happened a certain Affair
of consequence, which was to be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
in the City of <hi>Toledo;</hi> for dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
whereof, his Excellency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
two of his Retinue to go
and attend there, till it should be
finished: The one of these was a
brisk young Gentleman, of about
Two or Three and Twenty Years of
Age, who had made himself a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Master of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue;
this was to be the chief Speaker:
And the other a Graver Person of
above Thirty, but of much less skill
in the Language, and he was for the
sober Conduct of this Matter. They
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44587:12"/>
solicited daily, with all the diligence
they could, but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being
slow, and dilatory in all manner of
Business, that which was supposed,
would have been brought to an end
in a fortnight or three weeks time,
proved the work of a whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
These two <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen,
whom I shall call, for particular
Reasons, by <hi>Spanish</hi> Names, the
Elder <hi>Don Enrique,</hi> and the other
<hi>Don Feliz,</hi> setled themselves in a
<hi>Casa de Posadas,</hi> or House of Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
adjoining to a great House,
which stood at the entry into the
<hi>Plaçuela de la vega;</hi> the back part
whereof overlooking the City wall,
often afforded them a most refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Air, in that soultry place, and
always a very delightful Prospect to
the Eye for some Miles, over the
Fields and Meadows, running along
the River side. But before I proceed
further, it may not be unpleasant,
nor unprofitable to the Reader, if I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44587:12"/>
also observe something of the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Building of this Town.</p>
            <p>The City of <hi>Toledo,</hi> called in <hi>Latin
Toletum,</hi> stands on a high large Hill,
of which near three parts are sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
with the River <hi>Tagus,</hi> in
the form, as I may properly enough
say, of a Horse-shooe. It was much
beautified with fine Building, and
fortified with a strong wall; but not
totally built, as some erroneously
conjecture, by one of the Kings of the
<hi>Goths</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> flourishing about the
Year of Christ, 680. after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from appeasing a Rebellion of
some of his Subjects; his Name
was <hi>Wamba,</hi> as this Inscription over
one of the Gates does express.</p>
            <l>Erexit, fautore Deo, Rex inclitus
Vrbem</l>
            <l>Wamba, suae celebrem portendens
Gentis honorem.</l>
            <p>And, according to the vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
the same <hi>Gothish</hi> King caused
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44587:13"/>
the following Distich, to be Inscribed
over another Gate of the City.</p>
            <l>Vos Domini Sancti quorum heic proe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentia
fulget,</l>
            <l>Hanc Vrbem, &amp; Plebem, solito ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
favore.</l>
            <p>Addressed, as I conceive, to the
<hi>Popish</hi> Saints or Martyrs, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
lived or suffered Death for the
Christian Religion there, and whose
Shrines were then remaining.</p>
            <p>After the Conquest of <hi>Spain</hi> by
the <hi>Arabian Moors,</hi> who divided it
into many petty Kingdoms, this City
of <hi>Toledo,</hi> wherein the <hi>Gothish</hi> Kings
were wont to have their Residence,
was made the Metropolis of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the same Name, and Seat
of one of those Kings of the <hi>Moors.</hi>
It is now reckoned an opulent City,
standing in the very Heart or Center
of the Kingdom, full of Merchants,
of Traders, and of Manufactories;
from whence divers sorts of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44587:13"/>
and Commodities are sent to all
parts of <hi>Spain,</hi> which bring back a
Return of Mony, and of all things
necessary, in a great plenty. It is
divided into three and twenty Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or Wards, which have their
particular Magistrates, and over them
all is the Corrigidor. 'Tis adorned
with many Stately Palaces, but that
called the <hi>Alcazer,</hi> or Palace-Royal,
built by the <hi>Moors,</hi> is of no small
Ornament to the Town; the Fine
Churches, the Rich Convents, the
Town-House, and other Publick
Buildings, are very much boasted of;
so are the <hi>Plaças,</hi> and <hi>Plaçuelas,</hi> which
in all are seventeen; and the two
spacious Hospitals deserve a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Remark.</p>
            <p>But the greatest Glory of this
City is, that it is an Archepiscopal
See, and honoured with a Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Cathedral; which, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
excels in Beauty, most of the
Churches of <hi>Spain,</hi> except that of
<hi>Burgos,</hi> the Chief City of Old <hi>Castile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:44587:14"/>
Built, as they tell us, by <hi>Englishmen;</hi>
of which, for its admirable Curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Wormanship, they use to say,
<hi>La yglesia de Burgos es la Ioya, y a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quella
de Toledo, no es mas que la
Cascara.</hi> The Church of <hi>Burgos</hi> is
the Pearl, and that of <hi>Toledo,</hi> but
the Shell or Casquet to hold it. But
this may compare for largeness of
Structure, with any Cathedral in
that whole Kingdom, except one in
<hi>Cordoua,</hi> which the Moors widened
on the sides, making it from its
form of a Cross, to be an exact square
<hi>Mosque</hi> for their own Devotions.</p>
            <p>This is very remarkable for its
great number of fine Windows, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
with curious Figures painted in
the Glass, with variety of Colours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
which are counted 750 other
clear Lights or Windows without
Painting. The Chappels about it are
many, and enricht with Altars of curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Architecture, which are Adorned
with excellent Crucifixes and o'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Images, and Pictures of Saints.
And 'tis very admirable to observe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44587:14"/>
every day, but especially on Holy
days, the Priests Officiating in this
Church, in their princely Vestments,
sometimes shining in Robes of Gold,
sometimes in Silver, in variety of
Silks, in Tissue, in Purple, and in
delicate Embroideries, and sparkling
with Jewels of inestimable value:
So are the Images of the Saints
dress'd up, particularly that of the
Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> for whom they have
one Petticoat pouder'd with Flowers
of Pearls, intermix'd with large Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds,
Rubies, Emralds, Saphirs, and
divers sorts of Precious Gems: They
have likewise other rich Garments
and Dresses for her, with two Crowns
of Gold, a greater and a less, both
set with Stones of a considerable
price, which they put on her upon
great Festivals, and when they carry
her abroad in Procession.</p>
            <p>It would be a large Work
to give a full description of this
Church, of its several Chappels, of
the Vestry, and of the Chapter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>House,
an eligant piece of Building,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44587:15"/>
the Roof or Cieling of which is
finely gilt with Gold, and about it
are represented the Portraits of all
the Arch-Bishops that have ever
been of this See. The Relicks also that
the Priests shew, are abundance; of
which they'l tell you as many Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in one Hour, as you will be
puzled to believe in Seven Years.
The two Pulpits likewise in this
Church, being curious Work, are both
of them well worthy our Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And to enter into this huge
Fabrick, are six great Doors or
Gates; Three on the <hi>North</hi> side;
Two on the <hi>South;</hi> And one in the
<hi>West</hi> end, where is the Portico and
principal Entry; all of which Doors,
are large, fair, and adorned with
vast Plates of Brass, whereon are
finely Carved, many Figures of
Saints and Martyrs, with other Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
pieces of History.</p>
            <p>The Archbishop, who is always
a Cardinal, is Metropolitan of all
<hi>Spain,</hi> and for the most part is also
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44587:15"/>
Inquisitor General, or President of
the Inquisition; He is in Rank the
next Person to the King; not only in
Dignity and Authority, but also in
Subjects, Revenues, and Power;
and is esteemed to be the Richest
Prelate, next to the Pope, in all
the Christian World: For there are
under his Jurisdiction and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
besides divers little Villages,
no sewer than seventeen considerable
Towns, from which the Rents of
this Church are raised, and do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount
to above Two Hundred Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Ducats <hi>per annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis the River <hi>Tagus</hi> with its
golden Sands, that brings in the
Wealth and necessary Conveniencies
to this City; that furnishes the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
with variety of excellent
Fish; makes their pleasant Gardens
flourish, and supplies their Houses
too for all Occasions with Water,
raised up by an incomparable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine
to the top of the Hill; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
as I was told there, of a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44587:16"/>
               <hi>Moor;</hi> thô others will have it of an
<hi>Italian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is this River, I say, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys
much of their Manufactures
into other parts of the Country;
that makes their Territory fertile in
rich Wines, and all sorts of delicate
Fruits, excellent Corn, and Pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.
I have Theme enough to
lengthen out the description of this
Town much further, but shall only
add, that in it, is an University for
the Study of the Civil and Cannon
Laws, by which all the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Subjects are Governed: And
that the City is Famous, for having
had Eighteen National Councils
held in it, in the time of the <hi>Gothes</hi>
Inhabiting there, in order to the
Extirpating the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie,
with which those <hi>Gothes</hi> were long
infected.</p>
            <p>But to return to our two Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
whom I have too long left at
their Lodgings: They, at their first
coming to this place, finding no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44587:16"/>
manner of Acquaintance, for Coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Houses
at that time were scarce
known in <hi>Spain:</hi> and the Grave
Temper of these People, which
will not easily admit of any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Conversation with Foreigners,
would have made them pass very
unpleasantly there their vacant
time, that lay, as we say, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
on their hands, by the many
Obstacles and tedious Delays they
met with in their Business, had they
not both been Studious and Lovers
of Books, especially <hi>Don Feliz,</hi>
who was something of a Scholar,
having a Genius also to Musick,
wherein he was on some Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
no mean Performer, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
on the Viol, and on the Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geolet,
an Instrument rarely then
heard in that Country; nor was his
Voice very unpleasant in Singing.</p>
            <p>With Reading therefore, or with
Musick, did they for the most part
entertain themselves, and often with
Fencing, when either they had no
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44587:17"/>
Business abroad, or by reason of the
excessive heat of that Clime, they
were constrained to keep within
doors. But their usual Recreation in
the Evenings, was to take the fresh
Air in the Fields, and amongst the
Vineyards, or to see the curious
Gardens; the pleasant Walks shaded
with Trees, bearing a variety of the
choicest Fruits, and deck'd with most
delightful Greens; and to view the
<hi>Norias</hi> or admirable Water-works,
with which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striously
water their Gardens, supply
their Fountains, and keep their
Grottoes cool. They often went to
admire the fine Houses of Noblemen,
and other Persons of Quality, as
well without as within the Walls;
or to view the most remarkable
Churches and Convents; where, by
reason of the many Eyes to observe
the Actions of Strangers, an <hi>English</hi>
Gentleman, who is there always
look'd on as a Heretick, had need
behave himself with great Prudence
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44587:17"/>
and Circumspection, lest by some
rash Word or indecent Gesture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
their Priests, he run him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
some ill Predicament, from
whence he will not find it an easie
matter to extricate himself. In all
which places (the Churches not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted)
it is none of the least Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements
for Young Men to admire
the delicate Shape, Mien, and Air
of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ladies; and to Court
them; but being veiled, we rarely
get a sight of their Faces.</p>
            <p>It was in Contemplating of some
of these attracting Objects, that our
youngest Traveller was taken up, as
he was walking by himself one Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Streets, when he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costed
by an ancient, but brisk Man,
whose Reverend Aspect, with long
Beard and big Mustachoes, would
have given him a greater respect than
he merited, by the Errand he was
sent on. For after a formal Salute, he
ask'd the young Gentleman, if his
Name were not <hi>Don Feliz?</hi> Of which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44587:18"/>
when satisfied. Then, <hi>Señor,</hi> said
he, in a low voice, I am sent to
discourse a matter of secresie with
you, from a Lady of Quality. The
young Spark, thô not altogether a
Novice at these kind of Intrigues in
this Country, being in some surprize
at first, and not well understanding
his meaning, Sir, answered he, I
presume you be mistaken in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
you intend, for I am a Stranger,
and not yet so happy to be known
to any Lady in this place. I fear I
am mistaken indeed, reply'd the
<hi>Spaniard,</hi> smiling, since you are so
backward to apprehend a Message
sent you from a fair Lady, who by
me Invites you to her Lodging.</p>
            <p>Our Gallant, to retrieve his Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
after such a reproof; Sir, said
he, I confess my dulness, and shall
readily wait on the Lady who has
done me this Honour, if you please
to lead the way, and as we walk to
inform me of her Name, Quality,
and Lodging. Why, now, answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44587:18"/>
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> almost laughing
out-right, you are as much too
quick for me on the other hand; let
it suffice you to know, that she is
such a one as makes no small figure in
this Town: And as for her Name
and Lodging, you may perchance
be satisfied of them e'er long. In
the mean time, I can only acquaint
you, that she lives towards the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest
part of this City from hence;
whither if you have the Courage to
suffer your self to be carried in a
close Chair to Night, and will meet
me at the place I shall direct, I'll not
fail to wait on you to her, and I am
confident you will not afterwards
repent you of the Visit.</p>
            <p>After some small deliberation,
whether or no he should engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in so hazardous an Enterprize,
our Gallant resolutely told him, that
he would certainly meet, when and
where the <hi>Spaniard</hi> should think fit.
They presently then agreed on the
hour to be ten that same night, at
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44587:19"/>
the upper end of a Street, called <hi>La
Calle de las Carettes,</hi> just by the
great Conduit or Marble Fountain
there; which was at least half a
Mile from the place, where at that
time they were discoursing. After
this assignation made, and many kind
Expressions which passed betwixt
them, they parted; but with the
greatest Cautions imaginable of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this thing secret on both sides.</p>
            <p>When our English <hi>Don</hi> had further
considered of this Enterprise, and of
the dangers he would be exposed to,
in suffering himself to be thus carried
he knew not whither, and by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom he was altogether a
stranger, he began to blame his own
Rashness, in so easily consenting to
such an unreasonable thing, and was
just staggering in his Resolution; but
remembring that he was obliged in
Honour to make good his word; and
hugging himself with the hopes of
enjoying the Conversation of so fair
a Lady, as he fancied her already to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44587:19"/>
be; he briskly went to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
place, where he found the Old
Gentleman staying for him, with a
Chair, and two <hi>Turkish</hi> Slaves, or
other Chairmen disguised like such,
attending on him. 'Twas now no
time to expostulate with himself, or
them; the Chair was held open for
him; he went in, and was carried
very far, but knew not which way;
'till at last he was set down within a
Portal, and was quickly led, but
with great silence, to a small back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stair-case;
where mounting two sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
he was signed by his Guide,
the Old Gentleman, to enter, and
was there left. He then pushing
open the door, went into a spacious
Room, hung with Rich Tapestry-Hangings,
having a Stately Crimson
Damask Bed in it, and Furnished
with fine <hi>Napolitan</hi> Cabinets, two
Noble Looking-Glasses; In-laid Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of Marble, of that manner which
the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>impezzati;</hi> with a
pair of large Silver Candlesticks of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44587:20"/>
               <hi>Indian</hi> work, that had two great
Wax Lights burning in them; also
Chairs, and all other Furniture suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in it.</p>
            <p>While he was taken up in viewing
the State and Grandeur of this Bed-Chamber,
he heard a Door opening
behind him, and turning about, saw
coming towards him a handsom
Lady, seeming to be about the Age
of three or four and twenty, of a very
graceful Presence and Mien, and if not
to be extol'd for an extraordinary
Beauty (that Country rarely afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
such) yet might she justly claim
there to be admitted into the first
Rank of Lovely Women. She had a
Complexion clear enough, a lively
quick Eye, and little Mouth, with
an admirable sett of white Teeth;
her Face was Oval, her Hair of a
shining Black, which hanging back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
in fine Puffs and Curls, was
braided together with a cross Braid
just below her Neck, upon her bare
Shoulders, after their Mode, and was
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44587:20"/>
curiously trimmed with Knots of
coloured Ribon. She had an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
white Skin, and delicate hand;
her stature was middle-sized; she
had a well-proportion'd Body, but
rather enclining to be sat, and all
her habit, as well as graceful deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shewed her to be a Person of
no mean Quality.</p>
            <p>At her first appearing in the Room,
our young Spark was somewhat sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
but his astonishment was
very much encreased, seeing the
Lady make a pause, and stop a
while to view him; for as yet he
knew not whether this were the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that had sent for him, or some
other, who by chance was come in
thither; but he was presently deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from his uneasie apprehensions,
when he perceived her to approach
nearer, and with a smiling look bid
him welcom, and thank'd him for
the favour of that Visit. Then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the suffered him to return an
Answer, she took him by the hand,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44587:21"/>
which she prest in hers, and made
him sit down in a Chair by her. <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> having had time to recover his
amazed Spirits, and no longer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but that this was the Lady who
had given him the Invitation; made
her, with great respect, a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the Honour she had done
him, in thinking him, who was a
Stranger, and unknown to her, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of receiving her Commands. The
Lady, whom we shall call <hi>Doña Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina,</hi>
fixing, in a most Amorous
manner, her Eyes stedfastly on his
Face, told him, she could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
less of him, than that he was
a Gentleman, and a Man of Honour;
in confidence of which, she having
several times admired him, as she
observed him in the Town, had
taken the boldness to give him that
trouble, that she might be satisfied,
whether or no his Parts and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
were correspondent to his
Person, and to the Idea which she
had formed of him within her self.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44587:21"/>
He assured her, that he would be
very industrious, to make good the
best Character she could conceive of
him; and that he was proud to have
any thing in him worthy the Notice
of so fine a Lady.</p>
            <p>As they were thus entring upon
their Complements to one another,
they were interrupted by two Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Matrons, there called <hi>Dueñas,</hi>
who are commonly Widdows, or
wearing the Habit of such, by whom
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ladies are constantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended;
some having two, others
four, or six of them, acording to
their Quality. These are intended
by the Husbands for watchful Inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
into the Actions of their
Wives, but commonly prove to be
their Ladies trustiest Confidents in
all their private Amours. The first
of these two brought into the
Room a large gilt Salver, handsome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fill'd and heaped up with thin
Biskets, March-panes, and variety of
dried Sweetmeats. The second had
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44587:22"/>
such another Salver, furnished with
Cups of rich Chocolatte, as well
hot, as of that cool'd with Snow, also
with Glasses of <hi>Hyppocras,</hi> and of the
choisest Wines; which having set
down, they withdrew, leaving our
Gallant and his Mistress to Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
themselves with their Junket.
Though she often pressed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
himself, as their Phrase is,
yet she had not the patience to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
interrupting him, and asking a
Thousand Questions of <hi>England,</hi> and
of <hi>London,</hi> from whence he had
informed her, he came; She desired
to know the difference which he
thought was betwixt his Country and
that of <hi>Spain;</hi> also in what Station
he was with the Ambassador; his
Business in <hi>Toledo,</hi> and time of his stay
there. He satisfied as many of her
Demands as he could; but when he
had acquainted her with the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of her last Particular, she seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
be troubled at it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:44587:22"/>After some further Talk, she told
him she had heard say, that the
<hi>English</hi> were the Handsomest and
most Beautiful Women of the World:
Which Report, she protested she
was apt to credit, if the Women
there had an equal proportion of
delicate Features with some Men of
that Nation, whom she had seen.
I confess, Madam, said he, that as
they have the advantage of a more
Temperate Climate to live in, so are
their Complexions generally clearer,
than those who partake of a greater
share of the Sun's Influence; but it
follows not, Madam, that these hotter
Countries must be wholly exempt
from pure Complexion, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
is at the most but one Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to the Composing of Beauty;
for it must also have a sweet Symetry
of proper Features, a sparkling Eye,
and a lively Air added to it. But
there can be no plainer demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of this Truth, than in your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyship's
Face; which, without Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44587:23"/>
may compare with the most
Celebrated Beauties of the <hi>English</hi>
Court. For all the World must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
there is a sprightly Briskness and
Charming Air peculiar to the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Ladies, which is rarely to be found
in those of other Nations, and does
not a little recompence any other
Defect which can be objected to
them. We are all of us, <hi>Señor Don
Feliz,</hi> highly obliged to you, replied
the Lady, for this Compliment. But
I'm affraid, proceeded she, rising
from her Chair, and gently pulling
him by the Hand towards the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
since you have been accustomed
to the Caresses of those Admirable
Beauties of your own Country, a
<hi>Spanish</hi> Lady must be able to make
but a very small Impression in your
Heart.</p>
            <p>As he was big with a fine Speech
to have answer'd her, she interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him, to make him sit down by
her on the Bed, where changing
the Subject, the Conversation was
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44587:23"/>
continued, with all the kind Endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which on both sides they
were able to express; whilst the
unkind Night, posting on after its
accustomed rate, having no regard
to the uncertain Joys, nor considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the few such happy Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
that Lovers meet with, they
were surprized to hear the Clock
strike Four, when they had thought
it had scarce been past Midnight. She
then told him, she was sorry she
must put him in mind of returning
home; but before his departure, it
would be very necessary to take these
Cautions along with him.</p>
            <p>That in case he valued the Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
thus begun betwixt them,
and found not so ill an Entertainment
with her, as to discourage his future
coming thither; He must be sure
never to discover this Intrigue, but
keep it secret, with all the Care
and Fidelity imaginable; and on no
Pretence whatever, disclose the least
Circumstance, no, nor hint of it, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44587:24"/>
any Person in the world; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering,
that both her Honour and
her Life too depended thereon. He
owned, that he had reason enough
to be careful of it, since no Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that had happen'd to him in all
his Life-time before, was ever so
grateful as this; and prayed
her to rest assured, that he was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
sensible of the high Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
ot keeping this Matter secret,
which had not only hers, but his
own Life and Happiness also wrapt
up in it; and this last Consideration
alone was sufficient to seal up his
Lips, but much more any Concern
of hers; the least of which, he
should hereafter reckon a thousand
times dearer to him than his own
Life. And he further added, she
might be confident, that no Torture
should ever have power to extort
any part of this Amour from him;
for as he had more Honour than to
boast of it; he had not so little
Sense to blab it out at una wares;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44587:24"/>
nor so much Vanity to make a Jest
of it.</p>
            <p>She likewise strictly charged him,
not to be inquisitive who she was?
Or where she dwelt? And that if
he should by chance ever see her
alone, or with Company, in any
Window, Balcone, Coach, or Chair,
he should immediately turn away
his Eyes, and make haste from thence,
without any asking, or prying after
her; which would but give occasion
of Suspicion and Jealousie, to the
endangering of both their Lives.</p>
            <p>When he had solemnly protested
to her, to be punctual in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of every Article hereof, she
took occasion to tell him, that he
being a Traveller, might no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
have the convenience of
Returns of Mony, such as his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
required; and entreated him to
accept of a small Recruit for his
Pocket Expences; thrusting into his
Hand, a Paper with Ten <hi>Doblones,</hi>
or <hi>Spanish</hi> Pistols of Gold, wrapt up
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44587:25"/>
in it; which he, making an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
would at first have refused, but,
<hi>Quis nisi mentis inops,</hi> &amp;c. being pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to keep it, he put it up. Then
they took leave of each other, yet
not without many Sighs, Embraces,
and tender Expressions of mutual
Love, and of a prudent care and
wariness to preserve it; with an
Appointment agreed on for him to
return two or three days after, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Notice he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from the Old Man, who was
quickly sent in by the Lady, to
conduct our Traveller down stairs,
and into the Chair; in which he was
conveyed back to the same Station
where he had been taken up, and
was there left to walk Home by
himself.</p>
            <p>This lucky Adventure made our
happy Lover not a little proud
when he considered, how at his first
settling in that City, where he was
altogether unknown, he had so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly
fallen into the Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44587:25"/>
of a Lady, qualified with all
those admirable advantages of Beauty,
Wit, and Fortune, which he reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
he had met with in her; and
his mind was so much taken up with
it, that there was scarce room for
any other Thought: And now he
esteemed his felicity above his utmost
wishes, were it not for one bitter
Ingredient thrown into all this sweet;
which was to think how he was
forc'd with all the Art and Subtilty
he was Master of, to dissemble the
thing from his Brother, for so his
Comrade and he were wont to call
one another.</p>
            <p>The interval of time betwixt his
first and second Visit, which was
the third Night after, seemed an
Age to our impatient Lover; during
which, he was so transported with
thoughts of the pleasure and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
he expected, that he could
take but little rest at home or abroad;
and every Person he saw coming into
the Piazza, where he was appointed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44587:26"/>
to walk alone that Evening, he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied
to be his old Friend: But at
last, as it grew dark, he, to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
comfort, espy'd the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Conductor appear, and made
haste to meet him. Never was Man
more transported with joy than <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> was, to receive this new Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
from his Mistress; and <hi>Señor
Fadrique</hi> (for so was the Ancient
Gentleman called) when he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
the Message, and taken our
Adventurer's Answer, that he would
joyfully obey the Directions, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to fail waiting on him with
the Chair at ten a Clock that Night,
at the same station as the first time.
Both Parties were very punctual in
meeting at the hour, and <hi>Don Feliz</hi>
was carried as before, to the Ladies
Chamber.</p>
            <p>'Tis impossible to relate the great
transport and happiness of our two
Lovers at this second interview.
One while they passed their time in
making high Expressions of their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44587:26"/>
Love and of their Constancy to
each other, and the cautious se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cresie
to be observed therein: By
and by would she be asking him
Questions of the Mistresses he had had
in <hi>England,</hi> shewing as it were a kind
of jealousie of them, even at that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Then would they tell plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
stories, with which, and other
delightful pastime contrived by
them, did they divert themselves
'till it was time to part; and that
was not till about three or four in
the Morning, when <hi>Señor Fadrique</hi>
scratched gently at the door, as he
had Orders from her, to put them
in mind of it; which unwelcom Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
much against their wills, they
were forced to obey.</p>
            <p>Many other Nights did our happy
pair of Lovers meet on this manner,
to enjoy themselves; and once as
they were chatting together of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Matters, she pressed him to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
her truly of a thing which she was
very desirous to know; and that was,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44587:27"/>
if he had not another Mistress, either
in <hi>Toledo,</hi> or in <hi>Madrid?</hi> Upon his
faint denial, she positively affirmed,
that she was confident he had; and
further told him, she was informed
he Courted her under the counterfeit
Name of <hi>Leshia.</hi> He then blushing,
confess'd he had formerly made Love
to such a one in <hi>Madrid,</hi> but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
he had quitted her a good
while before his coming from thence.
'Twas time, said the Lady, when
you found your Mistress of so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passionate
and open hearted a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
that she could not give denial
to any of her Gallants, for fear of
breaking their hearts, but gave
free Entertainment to as many as
came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi> was not only ashamed
to be thus reproached, but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
amazed at her knowledge of
this Intrigue; which she easily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving,
told him laughing, she
would on slight terms release him
from the trouble she perceived he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44587:27"/>
suffered in his mind, by letting him
know, that she came by her Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
from a Song which an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
of hers, by listning one
day under his Window in the Street,
had heard him sing to his Viol.</p>
            <p>With this fair acknowledgment,
he had all his uneasie apprehensions
reduced into their quiet order again;
but she urged him to repeat the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
to her, it not being fit to sing
them in that place, where many times
they were under such strict confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to silence, that they durst only
whisper all their discourse, and were
affrighted at every little noise they
heard, 'till one of their Female Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels
came to satisfie them what it
was. He gave her a Copy of the
Song, and she seem'd not a little plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with it, when she understood
that both the words and Musick
were of his own Composition; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting
his great proficiency in the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Language in so short a time.
The same Verses turned into <hi>English,</hi>
run thus.</p>
            <lg>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:44587:28"/>
               <l>To me, what Favour do the Meadows show,</l>
               <l>If thus for all, their Flowers in common grow?</l>
               <l>Or what if Springs to quench my Thirst descend,</l>
               <l>If so those Springs, to all, their Waters lend?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For Light, and Heat, what do I owe the Sun,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>O <hi>Lesbia,</hi> both in Form and Wit divine!</l>

               <l>The Meads to Rival thee display their Pride;</l>
               <l>On thee to gaze, the Brooks do cease to glide.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Thou hast, than <hi>Sol,</hi> more Beauties in thy Face;</l>
               <l>And thou in changing, dost the Moon surpass.</l>
               <l>If cheaply not expos'd, how should I prize,</l>
               <l>That Angels Shape, that Mien, those sparkling Eyes?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But Common made, each Grace I can refuse;</l>
               <l>Which solely to possess, before a Crown, I'de chuse.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Methinks, said <hi>Doña Faustina</hi>
smiling, you have in this Song ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd
a greater Passion than the
Subject required; but I am well
enough pleas'd, to think, that thô
she be thus contemptible, she has
given me the opportunity of making
this discovery of your skill in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44587:28"/>
Poetry: But I should have been
much better satisfied, had it been
possible for me to have heard this
performed by your Voice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
together, which I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
do accord with admirable
Sweetness. <hi>Don Feliz</hi> told her, he
was happy to have gained the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of a good Artist in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
with one who was so nice a
Judge in all Ingenious Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as her Ladyship was, and
that too, without his having ever
been put to the Tryal.</p>
            <p>From this Passage of <hi>Don Feliz</hi>'s
kind-hearted Mistress in <hi>Madrid,</hi>
the Lady took occasion to warn him
of the dangers of medling with
those Common Women, and gave
him many sad Instances of fine
Youths ruin'd by the cunning Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements
of those bewitching <hi>Circes;</hi>
not only in their Purses, but in
their Persons too. Particularly one
in that City, who was so Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
Brisk, and Gay, and so En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44587:29"/>
with all the Qualifications of
a compleat Gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that as he
was reckoned the Darling of the
Ladies, attracting their Eyes at all
times to admire him, whenever he
appeared amongst them; so was he
no less respected of the Best and
Gravest Men, for his Excellent Parts
and Ingenuity; and was an only
Son, the Heir of an Honourable
Family, and sole Branch of it that
was then remaining. He was no
sooner loosed from the strict Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of a Prudent Father, lately
dead; but falling into an Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and League with some of those
Lewd Women, he in a short time
squandred away a Noble Estate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, and then with crippled
Limbs, and a disfigured Face, he
was forced to appear for a while
the Scorn and Contempt of all that
beheld him, till at last he ended his
Life miserably in an Hospital.</p>
            <p>Many such Examples of Terrour
did <hi>Doña Faustina</hi> relate, to deter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:44587:29"/>
her Gallant from running himself
into the Snares of such Common
Women. Those hot Countries of
<hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> being
very fruitful in producing such Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
Adventures daily: And I heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
wish, I could be able to say,
that our colder Clime of <hi>England,</hi>
did seldom yield any of the like
Nature.</p>
            <p>Whilst <hi>Don Feliz,</hi> thus pleasantly
enjoy'd his happy Opportunities
with his Mistress, which were most
commonly every third or fourth
Night, 'tis easie to be imagined that
as his Brother <hi>Don Enrique</hi> must
needs be very impatient to know
the Reason of his being abroad, and
walking the Streets at such unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Hours; so he would omit no
Industry to pump out the Secret
from him, and this not only to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
his own Curiosity, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his Friend from those Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs,
into which it might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be foreseen he would involve
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44587:30"/>
himself, if not forewarn'd of them
in time.</p>
            <p>And one day betwixt Twelve and
One of the Clock after Dinner, (for
in the heat of Summer they usually
dine there at Eleven) as the two
Friends were going up to their Bed-Chamber,
which was over their
Dining-room, to take their <hi>Siesta,</hi>
or Mid-days Nap, according to the
lazy Custom of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who,
not knowing how to employ that
time better, do commonly sleep till
Three; they fell again upon the old
Topic, <hi>Don Enrique</hi> gravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
him, for using the Term of
<hi>Hermano,</hi> or Brother (for their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
was commonly in <hi>Spanish</hi>)
when, said he, you treat me more
like a Stranger, of whom you had
cause to be jealous, than a Brother,
whose Advice, it might be highly
necessary to take in cases of danger.
For you carry on, proceeded he,
your private Intrigues, which I can
well enough foresee, with half an
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44587:30"/>
Eye, must end, at least in the ruin
of your self, if not of us both, if
you continue in these pernicious
Courses; whilst I, though I have
had a little more Experience in the
Affairs of the World, than you can
pretend to, am not worthy to be
consulted about them, nor fit to be
entrusted with any part of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
no, not so much as to know
how to disengage my self, in case I
should, by your means, be brought
into ill Circumstances, nor be able
to assist you, in any Exigency. I
shall therefore henceforward, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
that Title of Brother, and that
of Friend too, as having no pretence
to either.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi> finding himself thus
closely attacked again, would have
defended himself with his accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Excuses, protesting he exposed
himself to no manner of hazard,
much less his Friend; but that there
being a necessity of keeping this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
secret, he entreated him, if he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44587:31"/>
had any Respect or Kindness for him,
he would forbear his further scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
into the matter. Were there
no other apparent signs of a threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
danger to your own Person,
replyed <hi>Don Enrique,</hi> than the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable,
and scandalous Hours,
in which you almost Nightly fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
the Streets, when even the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, and those of
the Meanest Rank too, are scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
to do it; it were a sufficient
Cause to alarm any one, who had
the least concern for you, to put you
in mind of your own Security in
time, and to prevent the Ruin into
which you are evidently falling. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
continued he, since you have
found out these Night-walks, your
In-come is much improved; you are
much more flush in the Pocket than
formerly; but whence it arises, I
am altogether ignorant; though I
supposed, I had known the strength
of your Rents and Revenues, while
in this Country, as well as your
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:44587:31"/>
self: And this your fear of a disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
creates a suspicion in me,
that your new Current of Wealth,
flows from some ill Source.</p>
            <p>This rough Language nettling the
young Spark; you press me, said
he, more like a Magistrate that
was resolved, to draw a Confession
from a Criminal, by any means
whatsoever, than like one who was
concerned for his Friend's safety:
And in express Terms you charge
me, as if I came by these Advantages
of Mony, by some indirect and base
way. I had thought the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
you have had of my Birth,
Education, and Manners, would
have gained me a better Opinion
with you, than that you should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such mean suspicions of me; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
too, considering that you your
self have shared with me no small
part of the Benefit, and yet without
any scruple of Conscience. But to clear
your Imagination of these Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
Conjectures; let it suffice to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44587:32"/>
tell you, that I have an Intrigue of
Love with a Lady of this Town,
which I have engaged never to
disclose, and must therefore conjure
you to urge me no further in it;
for only by satisfying your inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Humour herein, I should render
my self the most false and perfidious
Man living.</p>
            <p>You tell me, said his Brother, but
what I before suspected; and as you
have given me this hint, so should
you also discover the whole to me,
who am, as you know, your Friend,
and concerned more for your Good
than for my Curiosity; it is but
still, as it were lock'd up in your
own Breast, because you can never
suffer Injury by it. Therefore I
cannot forbear enquiring further,
who, and what she is; that in case I
should not so effectually make you
sensible of the danger, which you,
who are a Foreigner, do incur, in
Courting a <hi>Spanish</hi> Lady, be she Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
or Single; yet you may at least,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44587:32"/>
take my Advice, how to proceed with
Caution in your Amour for the time
to come. But hereof be confident,
that tho' you still conceal the thing
from me, you cannot alwaies convey
your self so cunningly to your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
and home again, but you will
at one time or other be discovered.
There will be prying <hi>Linxes</hi> to find
you out, and reveal your crafty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue,
to the Jealous Husband, the
Brothers, or other near Relations,
who will revenge this Affront done
to their Honour and Family, with
your Death: Or in case she be a
Common Woman, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I can scarcely think, by the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Mony you so constantly
meet with, yet even such a one will
have her Gallant, that will short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
find his opportunity to cut your
Throat.</p>
            <p>By this Discourse, our firm Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver's
Constancy, was a little shocked,
and beginning to reflect on the
dangers his Friend had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:44587:33"/>
he confessed to him he
knew not who the Lady was, but
believed her to be of Quality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that she lived very far off, but could
not tell the place where; and then
related, the manner of his being
carried to her Lodging and back.
<hi>Don Enriquez,</hi> being fully informed
of the thing, used all the pressing
Arguments he could invent, to make
him sensible of the dismal Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that must needs attend that
rash and unwarrantable course of his.</p>
            <p>And they continued their Talk on
this Subject for some time longer,
as they lay on their Bed, till Sleep
put an end to it, which kept them
fast, almost three Hours, that it was
past Three of the Clock; and then
as <hi>Don Feliz</hi> betwixt Sleep and
Wake, was beginning to rub his
Eyes in order to get up, he was start<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at the ratling of a Stone in the
Room, which somebody had thrown
in at the Window; for the Windows
there are made with cross Barrs of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44587:33"/>
Iron only, having woodden Shutters
on the inside, but seldom have any
Glass before them. He got up and
looked out to see who had flung it,
but observed not any body beneath,
except Passengers walking by; then
searching for the Stone, found also a
Note bound neatly to it, with a piece
of Crimson Silk, and on it this Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription.
<hi>A don Feliz el Estrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro:

Which he opening, Read as follows.</p>

                  <p>WEre you not the most perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Man living, you would
not so easily have betrayed the Trust
I reposed in you. All your Pretences,
that no Torture should ever draw from
you the least Article of our Intrigue,
are very quickly forgot: And the whole
Discovery made, without any damage
to your own Person; while mine is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for a Sacrifice to your Indiscreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Is this the effect of your fair
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44587:34"/>
Words, your repeated Oaths and
boasted Fidelity? Could your great
Courage and firm Constancy, make no
better Opposition to so slight an Attack?
But I may upbraid my self, for so rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hazarding, both Life and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Hands of a Stranger; and
yet I have learnt by this timely Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution,
not to expose my self any
more to the mercy of his Tongue, who
has so mean a Spirit, as can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to proclaim a Lady's Favours
to him. No Excuse can palliate your
Crime, 'tis beyond all Reparation. But
seeing I have escaped the Mischief, of
so base a Treachery, I can pass by the
Affront, and attribute it to your Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the ill Manners you brought
from your own Country. And having
now thrown you out of my Heart, I
have also excluded you my Doors. Be

'Tis not possible to express the
astonishment and confusion, that
<hi>Don Feliz</hi> was in at his Reading
this Letter. Vext he was at the
Soul, to see the scorn with which she
treated him, and yet grieved, to
think he should have been prevailed
with to tell the whole Adventure,
by which he had now lost the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of his Mistress; and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
was he, to consider who had
been her private Intelligencer, so
soon to carry her the News of it;
resolving to watch the Eaves-drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for the future, that if possible he
might surprize such a one, he would
be sure to quit scores with him for
the good Office done him. Then
was he enraged to reflect on his own
Folly, that for Improvement of his
Comrade, must needs hold such a
Discourse with him in the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Tongue, which if in <hi>English,</hi> might
have been a Secret still.</p>
            <p>He thus revolving a thousand wild
Fancies in his Head, went down
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44587:35"/>
Stairs, leaving <hi>Don Enrique</hi> a-sleep
on the Bed, as he had all this while
continued; then walking about from
Place to Place, and muttering to
himself, he seemed as one distracted,
but could find no ease any where.
When it grew near Ten a Clock at
Night, it coming into his Mind,
that at this time was the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for his waiting on <hi>Doña Fausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na;</hi>
he posted to the accustomed Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
where he used to meet the
Chair, hoping that this might only
prove a Dream or Trick of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Person, and that the Lady all
this while might not know of it:
But at the Marble Conduit, he found
neither the Chair, nor his Friend
<hi>Señor Fadrique</hi> that should attend it,
thô he staid till it struck Eleven.
After this disappointment he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
home, and to bed, without giving
<hi>Don Enrique</hi> any Account of the
reason of his Disorder, thô often urged
to it, with great importunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:44587:35"/>In this Melancholy Humour, he
passed his time for three or four days,
during which, no Musical sound was
heard in their Lodgings; the Songs
were now forgot; the Viol hung up
untouch'd and untun'd, and all their
Harmony was spoiled; for their
wonted Mirth, and chearful Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
was turned either to a sullen
Silence, or jarring Discord, <hi>Don Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz</hi>
hardly affording his Brother, or
indeed any other Person a civil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
to any thing that was said to
him, and looked upon <hi>Don Enrique</hi>
now, as the sole cause of all his Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune.</p>
            <p>The fourth Evening after his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus discarded, as it was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dark, and he was walking dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented
by himself in the <hi>Plaçuela,</hi>
he espyed at a distance <hi>Señor Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drique,</hi>
crossing the further end of
it; whom, as fast as his <hi>Spanish</hi> Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
would permit he hasted to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cost.
The <hi>Escudero,</hi> or Gentleman-Usher
(for that was his Office to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44587:36"/>
               <hi>Doña Faustina</hi>) seem'd as if he were
surprized at the sight of <hi>Don Feliz,</hi>
and though he pretended Business
and haste, yet was he content to be
stopt for a moment.</p>
            <p>After a short Complement, <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> began to enquire of the Lady's
Health, and seeming to wonder why
he had not been attended by him,
with the Chair at the old Station,
the Night that had been agreed on.
You know the Reason, <hi>Señor,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
answered the Old Gentleman,
better than I, who am totally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the matter, further, than
that I find my Lady to have a great
Quarrel against you, and conjecture
that some body has been doing you
an unkind Office with her; for she
has told me in great fury, she has an
Aversion to you, and is resolved never
more to see your Face; and she has
charged me, that for the time to
come, I do not presume so much as
to name your Name to her. I was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44587:36"/>
attempting to plead for you; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that she might be mistaken in
her Suspicions of you, or have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
some envious Information
to your prejudice, which you might
clear, if admitted to make your own
Defence; and that she was too rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
thus to condemn an absent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
meerly by Hear-say; without
allowing him to speak for himself,
by which she might be satisfied of the
Truth of the Fact, whereof he stood
Accused. But she would listen to no
Arguments in your Favour, and
commanded me to be silent; adding
that what she had been told con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
you, came from such Hands,
that there could be no ground, in the
least to scruple the Truth of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi>'s Trouble was encreased,
at the hearing this sorrowful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the ill posture of his Affairs,
with his Mistress, and yet, he long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
earnestly for a Reconciliation with
her; for the obtaining whereof, he
was content to pass by all the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44587:37"/>
Indignities she had put upon him,
by the scornful Expressions of her
Letter, and her Words to her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.
He therefore judged it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
to retain <hi>Fadrique</hi> for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate,
who had often tasted his
Liberality before, and would conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
he thought, be the readier to
serve him now. He then stepping
closer to <hi>Fadrique,</hi> thrust into his
Hand a couple of <hi>Doblones</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi>
Pistols, which the <hi>Escudero</hi> did not
much scruple the putting up; and at
the same time <hi>Don Feliz</hi> told him,
he was sensible that he had highly
offended his Lady, but entreated <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drique</hi>'s
kind Intercession in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
since he utterly refused to stay
the writing any Note or Letter to
her; and <hi>Don Feliz</hi> desired him to
press, that he might be once more
permitted, at least to throw himself
at her Feet, to beg her Pardon;
since that way of proceeding with
him was too severe, to punish him
in the highest degree that was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:44587:37"/>
possible, without hearing what he
could say for the palliating his
Crime, which, he said, he doubted
not but had been sufficiently aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
by his Accuser.</p>
            <p>The Gold seem'd to have wrought
the usual effect which it does upon
Persons of <hi>Señor Fadrique</hi>'s, Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for before they parted, he
shewed himself much more complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
than at their first meeting; and
now he protested, he would hazard
the loss of his Ladies Favour, for
the Service of so worthy a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
who, he said, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
had been wronged by some
ill-natur'd Pick-thank. And in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
of his good Success, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<hi>Don Feliz,</hi> at the usual Hour
of Ten that same Night, to meet at
the Conduit, where was their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Rendevouz; to which <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drique</hi>
engag'd to come, either with,
or without the Chair.</p>
            <p>Thus after a grave Complement,
and the <hi>Spaniard</hi>'s begging to be
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44587:38"/>
excused for not staying till <hi>Don Feliz</hi>
had writ, he went away, leaving our
mortified Lover, in great hopes of
having Matters accommodated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his Mistress and himself; but
very impatient till the two Hours
should be expired, it being now
not above Eight a Clock at the
most.</p>
            <p>As he walked about from one
place to another, with great uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to pass the time away; still
guessing doubtfully what would be
the Issue of this Message; and in
case it should be listened to, and
should come to a Treaty, with
the Lady, he was considering
what he had to plead in his own
Defence. On this Subject, such
variety of Arguments came flowing
into his Head, that it made him fear,
lest when brought before her, he
should be in danger to perplex his
Cause by over-doing, rather than ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
it. Presently he was tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sported
with Joy, to think, how
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44587:38"/>
fair he stood, for the regaining that
happy State and Condition he had
lost by his Imprudence, and his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable
breach of Faith, with a
Woman, from whom he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
such kind Treatment: But
then he considered, that all the hopes
he could muster, in his own Favour,
were only collected from the sordid
compliance, and cringing of her
Servant, who for the Reward sake,
would promise beyond his power of
performance: By and by, he was
ready to fancy, that this had not
been an accidental Rancounter, but
a thing designed by <hi>Doña Faustina,</hi>
and <hi>Fadrique,</hi> to retrieve her lost
Lover. Which Conceit for some
time, extreamly pleased him; but
he afterwards fell upon another more
disagreeable Thought, of what the
Consequence would be, if it should
not prove so, and began to consider
how hard a matter it was, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
the Rage of a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Man or Woman, that had

once been incensed against another,
but much more against one that had
affronted a Lady, who Loved him,
and had entrusted her Honour in his
Hands.</p>
            <p>This last Thought brought into
his Memory, a Tragical Story,
which he himself knew had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but just before his coming from
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and was thus.</p>

            <p>THE Publick Houses in which

These have seldom more than one

Guests, where every one calling for
his <hi>Quartillo</hi> of Wine, being about
half a Pint, he mixes it with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
drinks it off standing, and goes
his way: But when Acquaintance
meet, they will fall into Discourse,
for half an Hour or longer, of News,
or some other Subject; not much
unlike the Conversation in our Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Houses.
It was in one of these
<hi>Bodegones,</hi> near the King's Palace in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:44587:40"/>
               <hi>Madrid,</hi> that certain Persons were
accidentally met together, at about
Eight or Nine a Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to take up their little Cup of
Wine, and to chat a while, round a
<hi>Brasero</hi> of Charcoal; for it was a sharp
Morning at the beginning of <hi>March.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst these, a Gentleman
happening to commend a Lovely
Young Woman, but unknown to
him, whom he chanced to have seen
in the Street, at his coming in
thither: The Company fell into
Discourse of Handsom Women,
naming several, as well of the
the Town, as the Court, that were
celebrated for Admirable Beauties.
Now there being present in the
Room, one of the King's Yeomen
of the Guard, of that they call the
Band of <hi>Flemings;</hi> he told the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
that there was not one of all
those Ladies they had extoll'd, but
must in Reason subscribe to a fine
Woman he had the Honour to know,
which was the Incomparable <hi>Señore
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44587:40"/>
Iacynta de Quiñones;</hi> and described
her with more Eagerness and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
than was fit to be used, by any
one in that Country, but much less
a Stranger as he was. And before
he made an end, gave his Tongue
the liberty of boasting, as if he had
received Favours from her. This
Extravagance of his, did not a little
amaze those that heard him, but
principally a Merchant, who was a
near Neighbour and Friend of that
Woman's Husband; and he being
desirous of a clearer Satisfaction con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Matter: Sir, said he,
you are a most happy Man, to have
the Enjoyment of so fair a Creature;
but, with your permission, may I
ask if this be not the Wife of <hi>Señor
Alouso de Quiñones,</hi> the Rich Mercer
of Silks, who lives by the Church
of the Incarnation? I must not des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend
to such plain Particulars (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
the vain-glorious <hi>Dutchman</hi>)
after giving this Account of her,
and yet I shall venture to say, she
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44587:41"/>
lives not very remote from that
Church you named.</p>
            <p>His Folly and Impertinence would
have transported him further, had
not the Company been nauseated
with it; and left him. But the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
in his walk home, called on
his Acquaintance the Mercer, and
after a Preamble of the Trouble he
had suffered, to hear his Friend so
publickly dishonoured by a Stranger,
he gave him the whole Account of
what passed; and protested it was
the least Mark of his Friendship he
could possibly express to so worthy
a Person as <hi>Señor Alonso,</hi> to have cut
that hoasting Villain's Throat, had
he not been surrounded by divers
others of the King's Servants: And
added<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he had nevertheless
hewn his way through the midst
of them, to do it, did he not in
Conscience believe the Lady to be
Innocent, having only had the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
to suffer that Blemish in her
Honour, by the unbounded current
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44587:41"/>
of a scandalous Tongue; and that he
fear'd by such an Action, to give
a greater Authority to the Report.</p>
            <p>The Mercer dissembling his Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
seem'd to hearken to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
Relation, with some slight, as
not crediting the <hi>Fleming</hi>'s boast;
but so soon as his Friend was gone,
though he loved his Wife dearly as
his own Heart, and had never had
the least cause of Suspicion of her
before, yet was he now transported
with Jealousie to the highest degree;
and going up Stairs, in a great Rage,
into her Bed-Chamber, he found
her there sitting at her Table, before
her Looking-Glass, and dressing her
Head. The violent Fury he was in,
gave him not leave at first, to utter
one word, but walking to her, he

her curious braided Hair, whilst with
his right, he drew out his Dagge<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
which the Trades-Men there, as
well as others, have alwaies hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at their Girdles, and was pulling
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44587:42"/>
her back in her Chair, intending to
have sheathed it in her Breast; But
upon a loud shriek which the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted
Gentlewoman gave, and
her crying out to know the Cause,
of this his barbarous Treatment,
who was about to Murder her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
acquainting her why he did it;
he stopt his Hand, and told her, that
thô the Crime she was guilty of,
was of so black a Nature, that she
Merited not to have the least Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Respit allowed her, from the
just and favourable Punishment he
was about to infliction her for it; yet
for her Souls <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake, he would be so
kind, to let her first ask God For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness
of the foul Sin she had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against Him, and against so
loving a Husband. And he charged
her not to trifle away the little time
she had to Live, but dispatch her
Devotion quickly, since the Revenge
due for so great an Injury, was no
longer to be deferred. And as to
her demanding a Reason for this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44587:42"/>
rigorous procedure; she needed but
appeal to her own Conscience, which
could furnish her with Reason e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
to justifie what he was about
to do. She then falling on her
knees, with the Tears showring
from her Eyes, told him, that, she
perceived, some Malicious Person,
envious of the Happiness she had
enjoyed with him, had been insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
false Inventions into his Mind,
for her destruction; and therefore
conjured him, as he would answer
the contrary, before the great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
at the last and dreadful day,
that he would explain himself, and
not thus cruelly butcher an Innocent
Person, who had never yet in any
degree broke her Marriage Vows
made to him, with which he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tax her, nor in any other respect
had ever wronged him.</p>
            <p>The Edge of the Husband's Rage
being a little taken off, by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to expostulate, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to tell her, that thô she had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44587:43"/>
managed her Amorous Designs with
that admirable Conduct, so as to
keep them all this while concealed
from him, yet that her Galant had
the Confidence to proclaim them to
all the World. She still on her
knees, putting a stop to the current
of her Tears, pray'd him to tell
what Villain had the Impudence to
utter so great a Falshood? Do you ask,
demanded he, which of your Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
has made this Confession? It
was <hi>Hendrick</hi> the <hi>Flemming,</hi> to day,
did it publickly in a <hi>Bodegon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot deny (answered his Wife,
expressing the height of Indignation
in her Looks) but I have seen that
base Fellow, yet no otherwise than in
your Company; and I must own,
that you have reason enough to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the Revenge you are about to
Execute on her, who would prefer
so contemptible a Wretch, to such a
Husband as you had I really done
so. But since you are possessed with
what has been maliciously suggested
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44587:43"/>
against me, 'twill be a difficult Task
to convince you of my Innocence,
by any Apology I can make; yet I
heartily beg, that before you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to take away my Life, you will
give me leave for one. Hours time,
to go abroad by my self, and if I
bring not back most evident Proofs
of my being wronged, and that
your Honour, as also that of both
our Families is secure from Scandal,
I will without murmuring submit to
the Death, which you threaten, and
I shall justly deserve. And before you
refuse me this Favour, Pray, call to
your Remembrance the tender Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
you have so often expressed
to me; also what Opportunities of
dishonouring you, I have ever al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
my self, during the two Years
that I have been your Wife, and
the little colour of Truth there is in
this scandalous Accusation of abusing
you.</p>
            <p>These Motives, together with the
real Love he had alwaies had for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44587:44"/>
her; the humble posture she was
then in, and sweetness of her Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
which discovered not the
least mark of Guilt in it, and withal,
her never having had any blot or
least stain in her Reputation before,
had by this time quite disarmed her
Husband's Rage.</p>
            <p>You see, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ora,</hi> said he, very
calmly stepping back, and sheathing
his Dagger, you see what Influence
you have over me; how easily I can
comply with your Requests, and
how scrupulous I am, lest I should
happen, through an Error, to be
Unjust to you, in not affording you
a means, as I hope you may, of
clearing your self. All which would
but more aggravate your Crime,
should you still prove guilty; and
would raise my Resentment to so
high a pitch, as would make me
search, till I found you out in your
closest Sanctuaries, and thence drag
you, that I might Execute on you
by a severer Method, that Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44587:44"/>
Justice, which I have now but
threatned.</p>
            <p>After he had concluded this Parly
with her, he went down Stairs, and
left her to her self. She quickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
so soon as she was dressed,
and had prepared her self for her
purpose; And when she had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
her Looks, that she might not
appear to have been Crying, she
walk'd out, going directly to the
King's Palace, and up the great
Stairs, which divide the two princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Courts, and lead into the Guard
Chamber. There she enquiring for
<hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>or Hendrick</hi> the <hi>Fleming,</hi> was
told he was below in the Court,
talking with some Merchants of
his Country: And one of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
of the Guard, was so officious
to serve the Fair Lady, as to go out to
the Ballusters of the upper Cloyster,
which is near the Queen's Apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and from thence to shew
where he stood beneath, in the
Court; which was then, and is daily,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:44587:45"/>
crouded with Merchants and others,
at betwixt Eleven and Twelve of
the Clock (for it was now about
that Hour) so as the Royal Exchange
in <hi>London,</hi> is, at Exchange-time;
For there is the great resort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of all Conditions, as well for
their dispatch of Business together, as
for hearing of News.</p>
            <p>The Lady having fixed her Eye
on him, went down, and pressing
forward till she came where he was,
pulled him by the Cloak; He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and seeing at this Elbow a
fine Woman, close veiled, left his
Company, and began to imagine
her some kind Creature, who fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in Love with his Person (of
which he himself was not the least
Admirer,) was come to give him an
Invitation to some Amorous Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment;
He therefore looking
sweetly on her, was about to accost
her with wanton Phrases, suitable to
such Occasions. But it was not long
before she shewed, that her Business
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:44587:45"/>
was of a more serious Nature. For
asking him first, if his Name were
not <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>or Hendrick?</hi> And he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
her, it was so. She open'd
her Veil, discovered her Face, and
demanded if he knew her? He, as
one transported with Joy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in his first Thoughts of her,
answered briskly, yes, Madam, I
have often seen and admired you.
But did you never speak to me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?
Proceeded the Lady, raising
her Voice, and yet calmly. No
Madam, reply'd the <hi>Dutchman,</hi> I
have never had that Honour, till
this happy Minute. Then base Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,
pursued the, let this be the
Reward of thy Lying, Scandalous
Tongue: At which words, she drew
out a small Pistol, which she had held
ready cock'd under her Veil, and
clapping it to his Breast, fired it,
and shot him through the Body.</p>
            <p>The report and smoake of the Pistol,
fill'd the whole Court with Astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
none being able to guess at
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:44587:46"/>
the Occasion of it, but those who
had been present, and heard the
Words which passed between them;
and those very Persons were so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
that thô they beheld the
thing done, and the Man fall, yet
had not the power to lay hands on
the Actress; as scarce believing it
could have been that fine young
Lady, who had done so bloody a
Deed; she lifting up her Eyes, which
till then had been fixed on the dead
Man, boldly told the Spectators; It was
she that had thus revenged her self
on that Infamous Wretch, who had
without Cause defamed her, and done
her so great Injury, that the Law
it self was not capable enough to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
it. And further added, that
she had been careful to observe,
whether or no the Work had been
as well performed, as it was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for in case it had fallen short,
she was prepared (shewing another
Pocket-Pistol) to have done it more
effectually. But that since she had
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44587:46"/>
thus Executed on him, the Justice
due to her wronged Innocence, she
was ready to suffer with Pleasure,
the most rigorous Punishment that
could be inflicted on her.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Alguazils</hi> or Serjeants belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Court, who are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Officers to seize and carry Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
away to Prison, had, by this
time, laid hands on her, and were
about to drag her to the <hi>Carcel de
Corte,</hi> which is the chief Prison of
<hi>Madrid,</hi> (a Building, for its outward
Beauty, more resembling a Stately
Palace, than a Goal) but that the
Queen, (for it was during the
Regency of the present Queen
Mother of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Minority of
her Son, this King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, that our Story happened)
having heard the Pistol, and been
told, that one of her Servants had
been kill'd by a Lady, was curious to
have a full Relation of the Matter:
And because that none was able to
give her Majesty any Satisfaction in
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44587:47"/>
it; She commanded the Woman to
be brought up into her Presence, to
have it particularly from her own
Mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ora Iacynta,</hi> with the Tears all
the while trickling down her Cheeks,
gave the Queen a large Account of
what had passed that Morning, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to her and the <hi>Fleming;</hi> and
thô she shewed to have an undaunted
Courage as to the loss of her Life,
for which she expected no Favour;
and made appear the Satisfaction she
had in her Revenge; yet did she
Modestly express her self in such
proper Terms, and with so becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Grace, under all that Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that not only the Queen, but
every one there present, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
affected with a real Sorrow
and Compassion for her. Insomuch,
that her Majesty gave Order, that
instead of being sent to Prison, she
should only be detained in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
till the next Morning, and then
appointed the whole Matter to be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:44587:47"/>
heard, by an <hi>Alcalde de Corte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
who is a Judge or Magistrate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom such like Processes do
properly come.</p>
            <p>On the Morrow, when the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was brought into the Court;
and he with the several Witnesses
who had been Summoned, were all
fully heard; it appearing that <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
the <hi>Fleming,</hi> was a Person No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
for boasting a pretended
Familiarity with divers Women of
Eminent Virtue; and some also of
considerable Quality: And that by
his last Words, he had owned in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of so many Men of good Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
that he had never till then
spoke to the Lady, she was there,
by the Court declared Innocent of
the Scandal that had been thrown
upon her; And this Sentence was
therefore pronounced in her Favour.</p>
            <p>That notwithstanding, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ora Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynta
de Quin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ones,</hi> had been found
Guilty of killing a Man; and with
a Pocket Pistol, a Weapon (in that
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44587:48"/>
Country) so unlawful, that whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Persons are taken, carrying such
about them, they are condemned to
serve in the Galleys for the space of
four Years; and thô this Act had
been committed within the Verge
of the Court, and even in the Royal
Palace it self, where the striking but
a Blow in a Quarrel, is a forfeiture of
the Striker's Right Hand: Yet it
was the Queen's Pleasure, the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
should be pardoned, in regard
the <hi>Fleming</hi> had but justly suffered
for the Mischief, which by his Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
boasting, he had like to have
brought on an Innocent Person.</p>
            <p>And the Queen was further pleased
to prosecute her Kindness to the
Woman, in causing the Merchant
her Husband to be made fully sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
that since his Wive's Vertue and
Innocence, were so conspicuous to
all the World, he should hereafter
esteem it so; and a kind Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
being proposed betwixt them,
was readily entertained by both, so
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44587:48"/>
that they were sent home very
Loving Friends, with an Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
never more to upbraid one the
other, with what had happened on
this Occasion.</p>
            <p>This Story of the Woman's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge
on the <hi>Fleming</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi>
coming thus fresh into <hi>Don Feliz</hi> his
Memory, staggered his eager Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of meeting his Friend, <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>or
Fadrique,</hi> at the <hi>Calle de Carettees,</hi> at
Ten a Clock, as had been agreed on,
and it extreamly perplex'd him to
think, that he was so unhappy as
not to have any Confident whom
he could entrust, or consult with, of
what was best to be done in this
Exigency. At length he reflected,
how poor and dishonourable a thing
it would be for him, out of a meer
Faintheartedness, to decline the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Mistress, and the fair hopes he
had of regaining her Favour; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
when he had some cause to
imagine, that his finding <hi>Fadrique</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:44587:49"/>
in the <hi>Plaçuela,</hi> looked rather like a
thing designed than accidental; since
in all this walks up and down the
Streets of the City, he had never
seen <hi>Fadrique,</hi> but at such times as
he was to bring him notice of
going the same Night to <hi>Don<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stina.</hi>
And withal, he conceived
that so violent a Love as she had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
expressed to him, could not
so quickly be converted into mortal
hate, seeing his Crime was not to be
compared with the <hi>Fleming</hi>'s; which
was a publick Boast in a Tavern,
voluntarily made, and of Favours too,
which, as it appeared, he had never
received: Whereas this of his was
only a discovery extorted from him,
by an intimate Friend, who was no less
concerned for his safety than his
own, and consequently would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reveal the Secret, neither indeed
could he, since he knew it but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly.
Thus he ran on making
a parallel of the Circumstances on
both sides, and concluding the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44587:49"/>
whole matter in his own Favour:
that the Lady could have no ground
for taking away his Life, as <hi>Sen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ora
Iacynta</hi> had done the boasting
<hi>Flemming's.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he was entertaining himself
with these Thoughts, he plucking
out his Watch, saw it wanted not
much of Ten a Clock; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
without allowing himself any
further time of Debate, went in
haste away to his old Station, where
he walked almost three Quarters of
an Hour, before he could see any
appearance of his Conductors, which
began to discourage him and make
him despair of Success for that Night.
But as he was giving his last Turn
towards the Streets end by which
they used to come, he met <hi>Fadrique</hi>
almost out of breath for haste, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with a pleased Countenance,
and demanding <hi>Albricias,</hi> as their
Phrase is, meaning a Present or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for the good Tidings he
brought; and then acquainted him,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44587:50"/>
that the Lady being at last over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by the pressing Importunity
he had made on <hi>Don Feliz</hi> his behalf,
was contented to admit him to make
the best Defence he could for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Scarce had <hi>Don Feliz</hi> the patience
either to answer, or to ask any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
of him, so overjoyed was he
at the News; but getting nimbly
into the Chair, which by this was
come up, he was carried away with
great speed to her House; and going
up into the Room, saw her by and
by enter, but in so furious a Passion,
that he soon began to repent his
coming thither. She upbraided him
with the breach of all his Promises
and Oaths, and with the poor weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his Temper, that could so
easily be wrought upon to reveal a
Secret of that Importance, to a
Person whom he should rather have
called to account for his rude Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence,
than have endeavoured on
that tame manner, to satisfie him in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44587:50"/>
every particular, and heedlesly to
discourse it all the while with him in
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue, so loud, as to
give Listners an opportunity of
bringing her a Relation of it. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little Circumstance of the whole
Matter she aggravated too, to the
highest pitch, that a Woman's Anger
and Malice could possibly suggest.
And in thus venting her Passion,
she her self, raised her Voice so loud,
that one of her <hi>Duen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as</hi> was obliged
to look in at the door three or four
times, and by signs to put her in
mind of being more hush'd.</p>
            <p>He thought it not convenient to
heighten the Lady's Rage, by a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
Justification of himself, thô
sufficiently provok'd to it, and yet
attempted mildly several times to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
his Fault, by the studied Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had brought along with
him; which was all in vain, for she
gave him not the hearing of them,
neither regarded the Patience and
Respect with which he bore all the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44587:51"/>
Indignities she put upon him. Which
course usage was beginning to have
kindled as great a flame of Passion
in his Breast, as was raging in hers,
had he not better considered the ill
consequence of such a piece of Rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and bethought himself of a
more secure way to stop the current
of her indefatigable Tongue. He
raised up his Body from the humble
posture in which he stood to sustain
all the shock of her furious Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
then stepping forwards, he
seized her in his closest Embraces,
and gave her such a shower of Kisses,
as almost stifled her, with which he
quickly silenc'd the Rattle of her
shrill Voice. After this, he pushing
her gently backwards to the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side,
ceased not to prosecute his
Amorous Victory, till he had quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
her of all her conceived
Anger; for he urged so many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his Love to her, and pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
them home with so much ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency,
as they were on the Bed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44587:51"/>
that she afterwards confess'd
his Rhetoric was so powerful, and
so very charming, she could no longer
forbear giving him a general Act of
Indemnity.</p>
            <p>After this fair Adjustment of all
differences betwixt them, our two
Lovers thought fit to remove from
the Bed to the Table, and the Lady
giving her accustomed sign at the
Door, to her <hi>Duen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as,</hi> they brought
in their Salvers of Biscuits, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats,
and variety of delicate Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,
with which <hi>Don Feliz</hi> and his
Mistress having refreshed themselves,
they were for a while contending in
Words, which of them should utter
the greatest Expressions of their
Love and true Affection one to the
other, wherein they did not scruple
to protest solemnly, that they were
ready to lay down their Lives, each
for the other's safety, in case of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.
And yet after all these En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments,
and Promise of a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rual
Amnesty of all Faults on both
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:44587:52"/>
sides, <hi>Don<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a Faustina</hi> could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
hinting upon the old Topic a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
by way of Advice to him, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
him to beware of running into
the same Error again, and to avoid
all other Occasions, that could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
the least cause of suspicion, and
particularly in case he should chance
to see her in any Place whatsoever,
that he should at the instant, turn
away his Eyes, and post quickly
from thence, lest his very Looks
should betray the Thoughts of his
Heart, and some curious Observer
make from thence a discovery of
their Loves.</p>
            <p>She then discoursed to him, how
remarkable the <hi>English</hi> Merchants,
and the <hi>Flemencos,</hi> or <hi>Flemings,</hi>
were in that Country, for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreet
gazing on any Lady they
liked, whether it were in Coach,
Window, or elsewhere, and that
they had shewn such seeming Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and Delight, in staring in their
Faces, as if they had some crafty In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44587:52"/>
with them, which Folly of
theirs, had created so violent a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
in the Husband or other Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as has proved of very fatal
Consequence, and many times, to
the Persons themselves, who gave
the occasion for it.</p>
            <p>This Night their Conversation
was interrupted sooner than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
by one of the <hi>Duen<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>as</hi> who came
from the Post where she stood Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel
(for those two Women took
that Duty nightly by turns) to
observe what passed in the House, and
to bring speedy Notice thereof, for
preventing any surprize that might
happen to them, so she packed him
away in haste. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all their Kindness, she seemed to
retain some little displeasure still in
her Heart, for she either omitted on
purpose, or forgat his Fee of two or
three <hi>Doblones,</hi> at parting, which she
seldom failed to put into his Hand,
on pretence of satisfying the Charge
he was at, in gratifying her Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44587:53"/>
that waited on him, and his
Landlord for sitting up to let him in
at his return home, with other inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Expences on her account.</p>
            <p>From that time forward, the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
of these Lovers, was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on with all the Success and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Satisfaction, they could possibly
desire, they still continuing their
Nightly Meetings, at their proper
and appointed Seasons. And after
the Transports of their Love were
over, it was their Custom for pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
away the time, as they sat over
their silver <hi>Brasero</hi> of Coals, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
one the other with the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santest
Discourses or Stories, they
could think of. She also took great
delight in hearing how different the
several Modes of his Country were
from hers, and in making Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons
of one with the other: The
Beauty of their Women would some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
happen to be their Theme, and
then the Constancy and prudent
wariness of their Lovers; The
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44587:53"/>
Honour of the first of these, she, by a
general Report, allowed to those of his
Country; but the Credit of the latter
she affirmed was to be attributed to the
<hi>Spaniards;</hi> for she could not believe the
<hi>English</hi> to have Contrivance enough for
managing an Intrigue of Love, with
that discreet Resolution as it ought to
be, but she said, she was confident they
would be apt to spoil all, by being too
timerous on the one Hand, or too rash
on the other. And added, that Lovers
in <hi>England</hi> (as she had been told)
were not put to such hard shifts for
finding out Ways to court their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses,
as in <hi>Spain</hi> they were always
forced to, and often proved to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
of their Lives; since the <hi>English,</hi>
she said, had all the Opportunities they
could desire, of talking freely with Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whether married or unmarried,
and even in the Presence of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
Husbands, or nearest Relations,
without Jealousie, or the least Scruple
whatsoever, which made them so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
of their Behaviour abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi> told her, he was not willing
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44587:54"/>
to enter into Argument with her for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
the slight Opinion she had of
those of his Country, as to their Skill
in the managing of Intrigues; or to
justifie the innocent Freedom there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to Men and Women in their
common Conversation: But if she
pleased, for the avoiding such Disputes
he would rather strive to divert her
with an <hi>English</hi> Love-Story, of a very
Modern Date; which contain'd some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Intrigue in it, and therefore
he hoped would the better relish with
her. And he assured her that the chief
Persons therein mentioned were of his
Acquaintance. The Lady gladly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
his offer, and he thus began.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="novel">
            <head>The Generous Impostor.</head>
            <p>'TWas on a fine Summers-day, at
about Eight a Clock in the
Morning, that three Citizens, who
had been Merry-making with some
Friends in the Country, were gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:44587:54"/>
from <hi>Ware</hi> towards <hi>London,</hi> and
happened to see a Lovely Young Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in no mean Habit, sitting under
the shadow of a spreading Tree, that
grew on the Road-side, betwixt <hi>Enfield</hi>
and <hi>Edmunton.</hi> The melancholy Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
in which she was, incited the
Curiosity of the hinmost of the three
to stop his Career, that he might learn
of the Lady, why she made choice of
so dusty a place to Repose herself in;
and yet this sight had not Influence
enough on his two Companions, to make
them halt, or to concern themselves for
her; but calling, away, away, they spurr'd
on and left him. He coming nearer,
perceived her to be weeping, thô she
strove as much as she could, to conceal
it; which obliged him to change, the
Merry Complement he had design'd to
accost her with, into a more serious
Address; desiring, with great earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
to know if she had suffered any
Misfortune, or that any one had
offered her an Injury; protesting he
would very zealously endeavour to
serve her to the utmost of his power.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:44587:55"/>
The Lady returning him Thanks for
his Civility, assured him, that nothing
of that had happened to her, in her
Journey; and added, that no Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
attending her, could be of so
great moment as to make him lose his
Company, for an Enquiry after it.
Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> (for by that Name I shall
call this Gentleman,) thinking to divert
her, told her cheerfully, that he was a
professed Knight Errant, and never
thought himself so well imployed, as
in the Service of distressed Ladies, and
thô he was not willing to be too offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
and impertinent, yet could he
not forbear pressing to know the Cause
of her Trouble. The Gentlewoman
who was yet hardly able to restrain
the Current of her Tears, endeavoured
to perswade him not to be so inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
after that which would give him
very little Pleasure to know; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
she could not put him off with
any Excuses, and that she was still
urged, thô with great Civility by him,
to satisfie his Curiosity, she confessed
that it was chiefly her weariness, had
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:44587:55"/>
put her into that disorder, having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discreetly
undertaken a tedious Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
which she doubted, she was not
able to perform.</p>
            <p>By this time, Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> had alight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his Horse, and sitting down
by her, began to shew a Concern for
her Trouble, with a Zeal to be assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her; and desired to know the
Places Name to which she was going.
She satisfied him, and that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
four or five Miles off <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
This, he said, was but a small Journey,
and needed not so much to discourage
her; since she might very easily be set
down there by Night; and asked where
her Horses, or Coach staid for her?
She renewing her Tears, owned that
she was on foot, and had so come
from <hi>London</hi> that Morning.</p>
            <p>He could not comprehend the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of what he heard and saw; for
after a careful survey of the Lady, he
was amazed to think, why so fine a
Young Woman, of such a genteel Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
and in that Condition she
seem'd to be, which was big with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:44587:56"/>
Child, should venture so far on Foot.
But guessing that his Service to help
her on her Journey, might be more
acceptable, than to detain her longer
in that Place with frivolous Questions;
he put her in mind of the danger of
sitting there on the cold Ground, and
advised her to be walking forwards,
offering her his Hand to conduct her as
far as <hi>Enfield.</hi> This Kindness she would
have refused, begging him to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
his Company gone the other way;
But Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> persisted to wait on her,
leading her along the Road; and as
thus they walk'd, could not but admire
her discreet Answers to the several Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he made her, and the graceful
Passion with which she expressed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which raised in him a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to understand more of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>When they came to an Inn in the
Town, Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> left her a while to
repose herself, and after discoursing the
Master of it, ordered a handsome Pillion
to be fix'd on his own Horse, which was
a stout Gelding, and an easie Pacer;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:44587:56"/>
Then stepping in to his distressed
Lady; after they had taken a small
Bait, he acquainted her with the sorry
shift he had thought on, to convey
her two or three Miles on her way,
there being no better Convenience to
be had for her in that place, which he
entreated her to accept. Fain would the
Gentlewoman have dissuaded him from
giving so great trouble to himself, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
a thousand Reasons against it,
and concluded with the danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so found by any of her Husband's
Acquaintance, in a Stranger's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany:
He assured her, that thô he was
unknown to her, yet his Intentions
were very Honourable, for all his end
was but to do her this small Service,
which he hoped could bring no manner
of blemish to her Reputation; and as
for his own part, he had no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
of danger that could attend
himself. And with such like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
the Fair Lady was at last pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with, to be lifted up behind him;
so on they Rode for <hi>Waltham Cross.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gentleman, who was a Rich
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:44587:57"/>
Merchant, of admirable Parts, not
long since returned out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
was somewhat under Thirty Years of
Age; having this Opportunity of
Talking to the Lady, strove by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Entertainment of Ingenious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to divert her Melancholy; and
she also her self, endeavoured with her
utmost Skill to dissemble it. But the
many Sighs which at unawares escaped
from her, did too plainly discover, it
was no small Trouble, that was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
within her Breast; which how
industrious soever she was to conceal,
our Generous Merchant was no less
impatient to draw an Account of it
from her; but yet by all the most plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ways he could invent.</p>
            <p>They quickly got to <hi>Hodsdon,</hi> and
she renewing her Entreaty to be set
down there, he spurred on the faster,
protesting he would not for the World
be guilty of so much Barbarity, to leave
a Lady in her Condition, till he had
brought her to her Father's House,
whither she had acquainted him she
was going. His great Civility in this
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:44587:57"/>
respect, and all the rest of his Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to her was so obliging, that after
some further pressing; she was content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>infandum renovare dolorem,</hi> to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to him, the whole Story of her
Misfortunes, which she related on this
manner.</p>
            <p>I do not doubt, kind Sir, but you
will heartily repent the Charity you
have bestowed on me, when you shall
find that your Generous Temper, and
your pressing Curiosity, had extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from me a Secret that will render
me the most odious, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Creature of all my Sex. And
thô, to me, it be of the most dangerous
Consequence imaginable, to give you
this Account, yet since you have thus
solemnly engaged never to divulge it,
I shall believe you to be a Man of so
much Honour, as faithfully to keep
your Word with me.</p>
            <p>Be pleased then to know, Sir, that
I am an unfortunate Daughter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<hi>N.</hi> a Reverend Divine, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of that Parish, to which I am
now going, who having not many
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:44587:58"/>
Children, gave us, as we grew up and
were capable of it, such Education as
his narrow Fortune of about Three
Hundred Pounds a Year would allow,
being careful to instil into us the best
Rules of Vertue and Piety. I was
sent to a Boarding School, to be
instructed in the <hi>French</hi> Tongue, and
those other Accomplishments of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
Dancing, and Fine Works, which
Young Gentlewomen are Taught at
such places. Which Breeding as I was
then told, was to serve me for a Portion;
my Father being able to add little more
to my Fortune, when I should happen
to Marry: or else, that it was to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
me for the Service of some Lady,
in case any such Opportunity were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to me.</p>
            <p>It was into the latter of these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
when I ventured into the
World, that my ill Fortune guided me:
For by the Recommendation of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of Quality related to my Mother,
I was entertained by a Baron's Lady to
be her Woman. The Good Lady
Treated me, being Young, with much
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:44587:58"/>
more Tenderness and Affection than I
deserved at her Hand, as by the sequel
of my Story you will find, causing me
in those Accomplishments, which I
had but rudely essayed to Learn at
School, now to be improved, by the
same Masters who Taught her own
Daughter. Which Goodness of hers,
I requited with the basest Ingratitude
imaginable. For having the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
to be by some esteemed Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
or at least appearing so in the
Eyes of my Lord, whose Vicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
to Debauchery with Women,
placed him much beneath the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter,
commonly given of him in the
World, which cryed him up for his
great Wisdom, Sobriety, and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
By this reputed Saint, I say, was
I often solicited to Lewdness, which I
resisted, for several Months, with great
Resolution.</p>
            <p>At her coming to this Passage of her
Story, the Young Woman's Tears
brake out afresh, that she was not able,
for some time, to proceed in it, till ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
that Transport of her Passion,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:44587:59"/>
and drying her Eyes, she thus went on.</p>
            <p>My Lord's base Lust, seemed rather
more inflamed, than any way abated,
by my resolute Denials. For seeing I
was not to be won by fair means, he
strove by subtilty to obtain his Ends;
watching many Opportunities to catch
me alone, and in Places convenient for
his Lewd Purpose; all which Strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems
I still evaded by my nimble slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
from him, and running into
Company, where I believed he durst
not pursue me. Thus I endeavoured
to keep my Vertue unblemished, till
one unhappy Afternoon, when I knew
my Lady was gone out to make her
Visits, and thinking he had also been
abroad, because I saw but few of his
Servants within doors, who indeed, as
I afterwards discovered, had been sent
out by him on purpose; I was coming
into my Lord's Dressing Room, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
to entertain my self with some
of the Books which usually lay there:
But he, who was watching for such an
Opportunity, suddainly rushing out of
his Study, caught hold on me, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:44587:59"/>
thô I long resisted, crying, and strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
yet at last, he with Threats
and Violence, mixt with fair Words
and large Promises, of what generous
Provision he would make for me, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
his Will, leaving me for ever,
with the base Brand of a Strumpet.</p>
            <p>Here was the current of her Discourse
again interrupted, by another shower
of Tears, accompanied with a storm
of sighs and sobs, which had such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on our compassionate Merchant,
that he was extreamly touched with
a Sense of her Condition. And that
he might divert her Grief, he put her
in mind of her Story, of which he was
impatient to hear the Conclusion.</p>
            <p>When afterwards, (continued she,
striving to suppress her Sorrow,) I had
well considered the black Deed that I
had committed, and how ill I had stuck
to those Excellent Methods of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
my self, which had been given me
by my good Father, I was almost di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
and had it several times in
my Mind, to have made a way my self,
could I have contrived an effectual
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:44587:60"/>
Means of doing it, especially too, when
I found my Lord still pursuing the
course of his Lusts; but I was deterred
from such Thoughts, by reflecting, that
to destroy my self, had been still to
encrease my Crime, by my adding
Self-Murther to it. And, my Lord,
observing my constant Averseness to
all his Offers, and that I was not by
any Trick he could use, to be brought
to a second Compliance with him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
from any further Attempt.</p>
            <p>It was not long before my Affliction,
was infinitely encreased, for I was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of that which I dreaded more
than Death it self, and finding my
Shame begin to be visible to the World,
I could not think what would become
of me. I acquainted my Lord with it,
who to prevent the Scandal that was
like to fall upon himself, got me pack'd
out of doors, pretending to Marry me
to a Citizen. And seeing I absolutely
refused to be kept for his Miss, gave me
Two Hundred broad Pieces of Gold,
with which he hoped, I might either
get me a Husband, or at least be
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:44587:60"/>
encouraged not to lay violent Hands
on my self.</p>
            <p>I took a private Lodging in the City
to be brought to Bed in, but with so
blind a Pretence, that they might easily
(as I could perceive) guess at the Truth
of the Matter: And out of doors I durst
scarcely stir by Day-light, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
met by any of my Acquaintance.
Here I staid till such time as my own
stock of Mony, which I had been able
to lay up, was beginning to sink very
low; and being continually tormented
with the sting of a guilty Conscience,
for the Wickedness I had committed; I
was possessed with a strong belief, that
to punish it, God would suffer me to
be Murthered in that obscure Place, for
the sake of my Gold; some of which I
had been obliged to boast of, for the
gaining me a Credit amongst those
People, to whom I was a Stranger, for
which reason they had been unwilling
at first to receive me in amongst them.</p>
            <p>And having now neither Friend nor
Confident to trust with the Secret of
my Misfortune; I, thô my first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:44587:61"/>
had been to lay my great
Belly in that House, durst not stick to
that Resolution, lest dying in Travel,
my Child might be deprived of the
Two Hundred Pieces of Gold, which
I had-been careful to preserve intire.</p>
            <p>After I had revolved a Thousand Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
Thoughts in my Mind, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
which way I should dispose of
my self, without hazarding my own
Life and my Childs, or publishing my
Ignominy; I, at last concluded to go
into <hi>Cambridg-shire,</hi> to my Father and
Mother; who, I hoped would not be
so Uncharitable to let me perish in that
Condition, though they should refuse
to entertain me in their House, having
brought upon them so great a Scandal.
For I could think on no better Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
than to make a plain Confession
to them of my Misfortune, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
submit my self to their Discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to dispose of me as they should
think fit.</p>
            <p>Now because I foresaw the Misery
into which I was plunging my self, I
contrived to manage my Affairs with
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44587:61"/>
the greatest Frugality I could, and to
that end sending down my Trunks by
the Carrier, I resolved for the saving
of Charges, to walk it after them on
foot. So by break of day this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I set out, and was able to reach no
further on my Journey, than the Place
where you found me; and must have
staid at <hi>Enfield</hi> for some Convenience
of Coach or Waggon to have carried
me Home, had not your Charity been
thus ill employed on such an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
Wretch, which indeed is more
Favour than I can expect from my own
Parents: For I am in dread, they will
have so great Abhorrence of my Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
that they will scarce admit me
into their Doors, or own me for their
Child, in this reproachful Condition.</p>
            <p>Here she made an end of her Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
Relation, but gave beginning
to another stood of Tears, which very
much excited Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s Compassion
towards her, and a desire of assisting
her in this distress. He used the best
Rhetorick he was Master of, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing
her Grief, and for convincing
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:44587:62"/>
her that it was now too late to remedy
what was past, by an excess of Sorrow:
but that without doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she might better
expiate her Crime, by her future Good
and Vertuous Course of Life. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
advised her, that since the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of the Thing were not yet
known, she shou'd strive to keep them
under disguise, from the knowledge of
any Person whatsoever: And begged
her that being so near Home, she would
not seem to have been Crying, but
appear to her Friends, with the most
composed and cheerful Look, she could
possibly frame.</p>
            <p>After this, and a little further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation
how to put some fair Varnish
on the Matter, they ended the Day
and their Journey together, at her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Door. Here they alighted, and
were joyfully received by the good
Doctor and by her Mother, who won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
at their unlook'd-for Visit, and
blamed Mrs. <hi>Katharine,</hi> (which was
her Name) for sending them no Notice
of her coming; but they were more
surprized, seeing Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> on his
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44587:62"/>
Knee, and asking their Blessing. What's
this, Daughter, demanded the Doctor,
have you also brought with you a Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
without our Knowledge of it
before-hand? Ay, by my Truth! said
her Mother, and a Great Belly too,
or I am much mistaken. Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi>
(for so Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> had now thought
fit to call himself) made a most Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
Apology and Excuse, for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his Courtship so secretly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
taking their Approbation, and for
concealing their Marriage for so long
a time, alledging such plausible Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
for that, and for the quitting her
Lady's Service, as very well satisfied
both Father and Mother; who besides
a kind Reception, often bestowed on
them their hearty Blessing.</p>
            <p>The rest of the Evening after Supper
till Bed-time, was spent in much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santer
Discourse, and more agreeable
Conversation, than the day before it
had been. But it growing late, and
the Mother reminding them of their
weariness after so long a Journey,
hastned away her Daughter to Bed,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44587:63"/>
whilst Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> would needs stay
below, till his Father should have
Smoaked out his Pipe.</p>
            <p>The Doctor was proud to find his
Son-in-Law, so Ingenious and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
a Man, guessing him from thence,
to be of Excellent Skill in his Prosessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which he told him was a Surgeon:
And he commended him for his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious
Travelling into Foreign Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
as he informed him he had done,
for Improvement of his Skill in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>urgery.
But it being high time to
part, and for Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> to go up to
his Chamber, he did so. And now was
the critical Part to be acted, on which
depended the Credit of the whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue:
For Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> to clear the
Young Gentlewoman of the Infamy
that must have fallen upon her, was
necessitated, as you have heard, to own
her for his Wife, thô under the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
Name of <hi>Fisher,</hi> and now he
must Lye with her too, that is to say,
in her Room, or else it might create a
Suspicion hereafter, that this had been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44587:63"/>
but a Trick; and so this Generous Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture
might be detected.</p>
            <p>She would fain have thought on
some other Expedient, and have waved
this; but he judged it most requisite,
for keeping up the Reputation they had
now gained; and protested a thousand
times not to offer her the least Incivili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
for that he would only roul him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in his Cloak, as many a time he
had been forced to do in his Travels;
would throw himself on the Chairs,
and it being a warm Summers Night,
he doubted not but to Sleep very sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
The Lady told him, that He who
out of the Generosity of his Mind,
could condescend to act so mean a Part
as he had done that day, purely for the
Charitable assisting of an Unhappy,
Young Woman, in distress; could not
possibly, she was confident, be guilty
of breaking his Word with her, or of
any thing else that was dishonourable;
and that therefore she should only lye
in pain to think, he must have so uneasie
a Nights Lodging for her sake.</p>
            <p>On this manner did Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> lay
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44587:64"/>
himself down, where the tiresomness
of his days Journey, together with his
sitting up late, gave him no Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
either to find fault with the
hardness of his Bed, or to seek about
the Room for an easier: For falling fast
asleep, he awak'd not till Five a Clock
the next Morning, thô he thought it
to be much later; and fearing to be
surprized as he thus lay rough, he got
up and walked out into the Fields,
where he met his Father with a Book
in his Hand. The Doctor admired to
see him stirring so early; and after va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Discourses of News, and of the
Parts abroad beyond the Seas which
his Son <hi>Fisher</hi> had seen, the Doctor
began to reckon up the several ways,
which he had contrived for their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement,
and what Visits they should
make during their stay in the Country,
particularly to a Widow Lady of a
considerable Estate, who was his Wives
Sister, and Godmother to his Daughter;
also to some of their Relations in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi>
and other Places.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> told him, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44587:64"/>
sorry to let him know, that his
Affairs would not permit him to enjoy
those Favours designed him; for he
was obliged to be back at <hi>London,</hi> by
to Morrow Night. The Father at first
supposed him in Jest; but finding him
serious, was troubled to think he should
so soon part with his Son and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and hearing him after Dinner fall
upon the same Subject again, both
Father and Mother were persuading
him to put off his Journey, if possible,
for some little time longer, and pressed
to know the Necessity of such a hasty
Return.</p>
            <p>Sir, said he, I last Night acquainted
you with some Circumstances of my
present Condition, but not all, and must
now add, that I had lately an advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
Proposal made me by an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Courtier, and my Honoured
Friend, of going to Sea, as chief Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon
to one of his Majesty's Frigats,
called the <hi>Dreadnaught,</hi> ordered to
Convoy a Fleet of Merchant Ships to
the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> where for some time
she is appointed to Cruise, for clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44587:65"/>
the Coasts of our several Islands,
and other Plantations there, of the
<hi>Buccaniers,</hi> with whom they are very
much infested. So that besides the
benefit of a handsome Sallary, such
considerable Advantages may be made
by an industrious Traffick with the
People of those Countries, as have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
me to accept the Offer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For
should I have refused it, not a few Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates
of the most Eminent of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
in the City, stood ready to
have put in for the Employment. On
this Occasion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, I have brought
down my Wife, and doubt not of my
Mothers and your Care of her in my
absence, and at my Return, I hope to
be in a Condition of making a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Acknowledgment to you both, for
the Favour you will do us.</p>
            <p>At their hearing this, the Doctor and
his Lady looked one upon another with
great Concern, perceiving such a
Charge as their Daughters Lying in
to be thus unexpectedly coming upon
them; together with the Maintenance
of her, and her Child; and no future
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44587:65"/>
Provision for them, more than the
uncertain hopes of her Husband's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
Voyage, to satisfie for all. The
Consideration of which, did so much
perplex them, they knew not what
Answer to make him.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> (for so I must still call
him) noting their Silence, and expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no less, at his starting the thing
to them, took occasion to tell them,
that he guessed at the Reason of their
surprize; which was, that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
he would leave his Wise and
Child destitute of a Subsistence, and
throw the burthen wholly on them,
which he said was the least of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.
Then pulling out of his
Pocket, a Purse with the Two Hundred
Broad Pieces in it, he threw it into his
Father's Lap, adding, that though as
yet, he had entred into no Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
her Portion, which he should
at present wave; he would not go from
thence without a Husband's Care of
her; and acquainted them with the
Summ contained in it, which they found
to be so.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:44587:66"/>The glorious Brightness of the Gold
soon dispell'd all Clouds of Doubt and
Suspicion out of the Faces and Minds
of the good Doctor, and of his Wife,
and loosed the Organs of their Speech,
making him now able to tell his Son,
that since the necessity of his Affairs
would not permit them to be so happy
to keep him at present amongst them,
they must be contented, to be deprived
of him, till his Good Fortune should
bring him safe back, which they hoped
would not be very long. And they
expressed great Fear of the many Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
which they were sensible he must
be exposed to, in the performance of
such a Voyage. But the Doctor assured
him of his daily Prayers for his Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
his Health, and good Success
in his Affairs; and further, made him
not only a Soleman Promise of his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
Care for his Wife and Child, but
of Mustering up what Summ he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
could for her Portion, against his
Son's Return from Sea.</p>
            <p>The next Morning, after many kind
Endearments expressed on all sides.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:44587:66"/>
Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> bad farewell to all his Friends,
and spurred away for <hi>London,</hi> because
his Ship on which he was to go aboard,
was ready to set Sail with the first fair
Wind, as he said; but he lest his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Wife in great Affliction, at
her parting with so Generous a Friend;
and her Father and Mother were in
little less Trouble, to think of the long
and dangerous Voyage he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
            <p>It was but a few Weeks after her
Husband's departure, that Mrs. <hi>Fisher</hi>
was brought to Bed of a Fine Boy, to
the great Rejoycing of all her Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and now nothing was so much
wished for, ás to hear good News of the
Child's absent Father, who promised to
write by the first Opportunity he
should meet with. But instead of what
they so earnestly expected, there came
a Letter about three Months after, from
Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi> giving an Account of his
dangerous Sickness, which Letter was
inclosed in another, from the Surgeon's
Mate of the Man of War, bringing the
sorrowful Tidings of Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi>'s Death,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:44587:67"/>
who sell Sick on Shipboard of a violent
Fever and a Flux, which in few days
had carried him into another World,
but not that which he was Travelling
to have seen.</p>
            <p>Our Young Widow's Grief for the
pretended Death of her Husband, was
so admirably well counterfeited, that
none could doubt the Truth of it; nor
was it possible for any one to imagine,
that this Contrivance had been laid
before-hand, to be after this manner
carried on, as it was. Her Father
also and Mother, who had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Fondness for both Son and
Daughter, were real shearers of her
feigned Sorrow, althô their Son's
stay with them had been so short, and
their knowledge of him so little. And
that which added something to their
Trouble, was to consider the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of recovering any part of his
Effects left on Shipboard: But they
comforted their Daughter the best they
could, entreating her, that for her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Son's sake, the would not lay this
Affliction too much to Heart, left her
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:44587:67"/>
Parents should have Cause to lament
two Deaths instead of one; and
they made her large Promises of their
future Kindness to her, in her Fortunes.</p>
            <p>She formally put her self into deep
Mourning; and most of her Relations
and Friends, came to condole with her
upon the Death of her Husband; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
whom was the Rich Aunt, her
Godmother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had great Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on her Niece, by reason of this early
Misfortune, being as yet but in the
Nineteenth Year of her Age. 'Twas this
Consideration, that induced the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Lady, to take home to her House
our Melancholy Widow, for some
small time, till the violence of her
Grief should be a little abated, which
did not endure very long. And there
her pleasant and discreet Conversation,
was so charming to her Old Aunt, that
she could not think of parting with
her, but kept her for her Companion,
above Two Years.</p>
            <p>At this time, some extraordinary
Occasions drew this Good Lady from
her Country Retirement, where she
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:44587:68"/>
intended to have ended her days, and
had continued during her Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
which was about Four or Five
Years, and brought her to <hi>London</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
Amongst her Friends in the
City, she took Handsome Lodgings,
for her Self and her Fair Niece; who
for her Beauty and rare Perfections
was admired by all that saw her. And
thô she appeared not often abroad, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
at the Church, which she under her
Aunt's Wing diligently frequented, yet
had she soon acquired the Title of the
Charming Widow; for that Dress
which she still wore, did most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
become her.</p>
            <p>One Evening, her Aunt and She
being Invited out by some Ladies of
their Acquaintance, to an Eminent
Ball, she there drew on her the Eyes of
the young brisk Citizens, who were
extreamly taken with her delicate
Shape and Mien, as well as with the
sweet Air of her Modest Countenance.
And some of them would gladly have
been making Courtship to her, had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:44587:68"/>
they not been awed by the severe
Regard of her Prudent Aunt.</p>
            <p>Amongst the Croud of her Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,
was a Merchant of considerable
Note, who from the first Moment of
his coming into that Room, had fixt his
Eyes on her, and from so fair on Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
was not able to remove them, but
continued in his Corner, as if Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into a Statue. Yet was it not
Love only, that had reduced him to
this strange Condition, but withal a
kind of Amazement, and Trouble,
which he had within himself, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of a strong Imagination, he was
possessed with, of having seen that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
Person somewhere before,
and an Endeavour to recollect to his
Memory where it was; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
for all his Conjectures served but
to puzzle him still the more.</p>
            <p>In this perplexity he remained till
towards the conclusion of the Ball;
when his Impatience would not suffer
him longer to rest, without endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to be satisfied, who she was:
But as he stood up, and was about to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:44587:69"/>
inform himself by some of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of her Name; the Lady casting her
Eyes that way, happened to espy him.
The first glimps she had of his Face,
and the Curiosity which detained her
Looks upon it, struck her into so great
an astonishment, as is not to be
expressed, and seem'd to have serch'd
all the Blood of her Body into her
Cheeks. For thô she, at the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
that she beheld him, knew him
to be her Generous Friend Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi>
yet the Report of his Death, for which,
she had as much lamented as if really
true, under the Title of her Husbánd,
and the pretended Name of Mr. <hi>Fisher,</hi>
having been so generally spread abroad,
and their Project been so formally carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on in all points, for almost the space of
three Years. without her hearing any
News of him, in all that time, it had so
confounded her Reason, that for a while,
she could hardly perswade herself, but
that she saw his Ghost. And so great
an Influence had this Fancy over her,
that it quickly made the blushing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
retire from her Cheeks, leaving
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44587:69"/>
so chil a paleness in its stead, that she
immediately fainted, and dropt from
her Chair on the Floor.</p>
            <p>This sudden Accident put a stop to
the Harmony of Musick and Dancing
for the present, and gave some distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
to most of the Company that
had taken notice of her, as being
concerned for her Illness, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
to her Aunt, who after she had a
little recover'd her from that Fit, had
her carried down to her Coach.</p>
            <p>Thô Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> could not in all this time
call her to his Remembrance, yet was
he as much troubled for her as if he
had known her, and was very officious
to help her down the stairs: Nor was he
at ease, 'till he had heard her tell her
Aunt, that this was only a fainting Fit,
occasion'd by the closeness of the Room,
and her want of Air in the midst of
so great a Crowd. By that time she
got home, she was perfectly recover'd
of her Indisposition, and walked from
the Coach into her Lodgings; whither
her Gallant had been careful to follow
her undiscover'd; And there making
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:44587:70"/>
Enquiry concerning her, he learn'd of one
of the Servants, that she was a <hi>Cambridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi>
Gentlewoman, Neece to the Lady
<hi>D.</hi> who had lately brought her to Town,
and her Name Mrs. <hi>Fisher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then immediately knew her to
be his once pretended Wife, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Widow; which increased his
surprize, and raised in him more than
an ordinary Curiosity, to find out
some means of speaking to her. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he was fearful lest his being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
by any of their Family,
might be of prejudice to her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
(for he knew not as yet, how things
stood with her) he was contriving some
safe way to be first informed from her
own mouth how he must behave himself,
in case she thought fit to allow him the
liberty of Visiting her, for the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Acquaintance, so as to be out
of danger of committing any Mistake
in that respect. He knew 'twas in
vain to think of effecting his purpose at
that unseasonable time; and yet the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
Longing he had to see her, would
not suffer him to afford his Eyes the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:44587:70"/>
least wink of Sleep all the following
Night: For now she seemed infinitly
more Beautiful and more Charming
than at first, when he found her sitting
tired on the Road side near <hi>Enfield,</hi> weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and great with Child.</p>
            <p>His thus reflecting on things past,
made him begin to Censure her for
that ignominious Act, which to him
she had owned her self guilty of, and
must have rendred her Contemptible
to all the World, had not her Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
been salved up by his Industry, and
Favour to her. And yet whilst he was
thus blaming her, he could not forbear
admiring her, as the most lovely Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
he had ever in all his Life time
beheld: Which Admiration of her Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
begat in him, at the same time, a
more favourable Opinion of her Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage;
for he considered that Errour
to have been committed when she was
but very young; that her Innocence
had been betray'd by the subtilty and
Violence of a lustful Man, who in strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Justice more deserved to have
been Arraigned for a Ravisher, than
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:44587:71"/>
she to have born the Infamy of the
thing. And he was willing to believe,
that the deep sense she had expressed
of that sin, and her Detestation of the
Fact, had made so full an Attonement
for it, that in case she had lived with
that Modesty and Reservedness which
he hoped she had, he could not think
but she must now be reckoned a most
Vertuous Woman.</p>
            <p>The next Morning he got up betimes,
and as he was beating his Brains for a
Contrivance how he might come to talk
with her, he remembred that his Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Shop was very near the Ladies
Lodgings; to which he went, and by
the Industry of the Millener's Wife,
found means to have a Billet converyed
thither, and delivered into Mrs. <hi>Fisher's</hi>
Hand.</p>
            <p>The Charming Widdow, who had not
only a great sense of Her Obligations
to Mr. <hi>Cooper,</hi> but had likewise a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
defire of acknowledging them to
himself, was as much pleased at the
Proposal of this Meeting, as he could
possibly be that made it. But because
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:44587:71"/>
her Aunt had taken so great a liking to
her for her plèasant Company, and her
prudent Behaviour on all occasions,
that she began to call her Daughter,
and had often declared, that if the young
Woman made choice of a second Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
with her Friends Approbation, she
would add considerably to her Fortune;
Therefore was Mrs. <hi>Fisher</hi> cautious of
giving her any Offence, or raising a
suspition in her, that she entertained a
Correspondence with any Person, of
whom she gave her not a fair Account
beforehand. So she was glad to make
a Pretence of going out to buy Gloves,
Ribbons, or some such knacks at the
Milleners, by which she got an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to see her Friend, who staid wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for her alone in the Parlour.</p>
            <p>Altho' this Assignation had been thus
fairly made by Consent of both Parties,
yet was their Meeting the most surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
imaginable, for neither one nor
the other had at first any power to
speak; He for the Joy he had to see her,
tho' he could hardly perswade himself
that she was the same Person, being so
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44587:72"/>
much alter'd to her greater Advantage;
and She for the shame she had to think
of the disgraceful Condition wherein
he first found her, and from which he
had so sucessfully relieved her. And this
Thought made such an Impression in
her Mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as had like to have cost her
a second fainting Fit. But she striving
to recollect her Spirits, was beginning
to make an Apology for her Ingratitude,
in neglecting to return her due thanks
for all his Favours; calling him the
most generous of Men, and her good
Angel. But Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> quickly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
her, to tell her how much he
was rejoiced to see her again, whom he
had not, by her own positive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
the liberty to Write to, much
less to have endeavoured to visit, left
any Discovery should have been made
of their Entrigue, to her Prejudice.</p>
            <p>When their first Trasports of Joy
were over, with some Enquiries made
of each others Condition, since the time
of his leaving her in <hi>Cambridge shire;</hi>
he was glad to find her Credit had
been so well supported by his Industry;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44587:72"/>
and to hear she had remained unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
ever since the Report of her sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Husband's pretended Death. He
also let her know, that he still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Batchelour; but did not acquaint
her, that he, not long before had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
an unkind Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k from a fine
young Woman, whom he had Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
above two Years; and that when
they were just at the point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summating
their Happiness together
by Marriage; she had most unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discarded him, for the sake of being
a Lady; and the hopes of bearing Rule
over her Husband; for she expected to
be linked in Matrimony with a Rich,
but very foolish knight, who it seems
recanting his Bargain, threw her off
at the very Church Door, and served
her (if possibly it could be) a more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful
Trick, than she had done her
Merchant.</p>
            <p>It had been a hard matter for Mr.
<hi>Cooper</hi> to master the violent Anger
he had conceved against all Woman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
so as ever to have a favourable
Opinion of them, after such ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44587:73"/>
ment from that Mistress; had it not
been purely out of spight and Revenge
to her, who was now striving again
with all the Arts and subtil Delusions
she could possibly invent, to retrieve
the lost Affections of her slighted Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
It was, I say, the resentment of
this gross Affront, had carried him on
purpose to that Ball, to try if there he
could espy out amongst those Ladies, a
more worthy Object for his Love;
and by admitting a New Flame into
his Breast, extinguish the old.</p>
            <p>Our admired Widow chanced to be
the happy she on whom he fixed his
Eyes and Affections. 'Twas her Charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Face and modest Look, that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to him a thousand more Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and taking Graces, than he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
ever to have seen in his Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and Faithless Mistress: And so
great a Conquest had this made of his
Heart, almost before he could call her
to his Remembrance, that now it was
not in his Power, if he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
it, to shake off her Yoak,
and to regain his Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:44587:73"/>He had had, 'tis true, some Conflict
in his Breast, that very Morning, when
he was remembring, how Reproachful
a thing it would be for him, who was a
Gentleman of a good Family, and a
Merchant; should he Marry one, who
had acknowledged her self a Strumpet,
and whose Beauty and Education, was
all the Portion she was like to have:
But on the other hand, he considered,
that her Dishonour was scarcely known,
but to himself; that her lovely Person
and singular Qualifications, if she had
kept up to those Vertuous Resolutions,
which she had solemnly made, were a
sufficient Dower for such a one as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who by his Industry had already
acquired an Estate sufficient to make
him live very happily in the World.</p>
            <p>On this manner was he able, or at
least willing, to solve all the Arguments
that his more serious Fancy, or his
Doubts could any way raise against her;
that now there only remained this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
which was, how to obtain her
for his own; and how to be satisfied
in the first place of the Fears and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:44587:74"/>
he had, lest she should be
pre-engaged to some other Person, and
so all his Hopes of winning her, by any
Interest or Merit, which he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to for his former Services, be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated.
Such Thoughts as these did so
far embolden our Lover, that after
some little further Scrutiny, into the
Widows Affairs, of which he received
an Account to his full Liking; he could
no longer forbear declaring his Love to
her, which he did with so much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency
and Passion, that the Lady could
not doubt but that it was real.</p>
            <p>She had already sufficient Experience
of his Ingenuity and his Uparallell'd
Generosity, to create in her a high E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
of him for his admirable Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of Mind; and as for his Person, he
might well be reckoned in the Eyes of
an Impartial Judge, a very desirable
Man for a Husband: For his stature
being Middle sized, his shape well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,
in most exact Symetry, and
the airy Briskness of his Face and Mien,
rendred him amongst the City Ladies, as
Eminent in his Sex, as she for her Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:44587:74"/>
and rare Accomplishments, was in
hers. And besides all this, his Genius
enclining him to thestudy of Painting
and Musick; he, during his Factorship
in <hi>Italy,</hi> while others of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
spent their vacant Hours from Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
in Drinking and Debauchery,
took the opportunity to Employ his
in the Practice of these two Ingenious
Arts; wherein, with the assistance of
the greatest Masters that the City of
<hi>Florence</hi> afforded of both, he became
no mean Proficient on the Lute, and a
most exquisite Artist at Painting in Mig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature.</p>
            <p>Althô nothing could have been more
acceptable to the fair Widow than this
Addess of Mr. <hi>Cooper's,</hi> for he was the
only Person, that for a Husband she
could have wish'd for; yet she receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Courtship with a Coldness, and
seeming distrust of all he said; and told
him, that he had made choice of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Subject to divert himself with;
for when she look'd back on her past
Miscarriage, which had rendred her
despisable even to the meanest of Men,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:44587:75"/>
if her Infamy had been publickly
known, she was too sensible that she
must be far beneath his lowest Jests and
Scorn: But as she had an abhorrence
of that Fact, which had cost her so
much Grief, and indeed ought rather
to be charged on another than her self,
and as she had also endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
her Crime by her sober and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Deportment ever since, so she
would always retain a Resolution to
live without Scandal, all the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of her Life. And that since her Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
had been supported by his means,
she could never take it unkindly at his
Hands, if he to shew the Gayety of his
Wit and Fancy should think fit, in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
to make her the pretended Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his Love. He would not suffer
her to go on, but affirming that the
Crime she mention'd was her Lords,
who well merited the Punishment, thô
the Misfortune had fallen on her; and
waving that Subject, strove with all
his Rhetorick to perswade her, that his
Courtship intended nothing less than
what he suggested. Since all his future
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:44587:75"/>
Endeavours, should be to render him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
worthy the Honour he aimed at,
which was to be accepted for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
            <p>In such Discourses as these, the time
slipped away insensibly, and her long
stay being taken notice of by her Aunt,
a Messenger was sent to call her home,
which brake off their Entertainment
for that bout: But not 'till a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
time and proper place was agreed
on, for the keeping up this Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
so fairly revived betwixt them.</p>
            <p>In short, after some few Meetings,
and Conferences had by our two Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
at their appointed Rendevous, there
was so good an understanding on both
sides, of the matter in Debate, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was now wanting to conclude
their happy Union together in the Holy
state of Matrimony, but the Consent
of her Father, and of her Aunt the
Lady <hi>D.</hi> This proved no great Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle;
for the Doctor no sooner heard
the high Character of Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> his
Daughter's Admirer, and had received
a credible Account of his ample Estate
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:44587:76"/>
and Fortune, as also of the frank Offer
he proposed of making his Mistress a
considerable Jointure, without insisting
on any Portion, but he readily gave
his free Consent to the Match. And
after the Aunt was made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the thing, she having invited
Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> three or four times to her
Lodgings, noted his Excellent
Parts, and been extreamly delighted
with his pleasant Conversation, was so
well satified both with the Man, and his
generous offer, that she declared she
would also show what value she had
for her God-Daughter; and to promote
the Match between two such deserving
Persons, was resolved to give her on
their Wedding-Day Two Thousand
Pounds for a Portion, and to settle the
greatest part of her remaining Estate,
which was considerable, so as to fall to
them after her own Death.</p>
            <p>'Tis not to be imagined but that Mr.
<hi>Cooper,</hi> notwithstanding the Proposal
which he so briskly made to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses
Father and Aunt, had some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation
of a Portion to be raised for
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:44587:76"/>
her amongst them; but it was infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
short of this; which made him
press to have the Wedding solemnized
with all possible speed, lest the Aunt's
Bounty might any way be diverted or
grow cold. And to set all Wheels the
nimbler a going, in order to a quick
dispatch, it was requisite to Oil the
Lawyers in the Fist, who were to draw
up the Writings, in which he was not
at all tardy; and so soon as those For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities
of Signing and Sealing were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
and the fine Cloaths ready a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the appointed Day, they saw the
good Old Doctor appear amongst them,
who had made a Journey to <hi>London,</hi>
on purpose to see the Gentleman,
so much cryed up for his rare Parts,
who was on the Morrow to be his Son-in-Law,
and to give them his Blessing.
The Doctor often protested that he
was very much rejoyced to find in him
so great a resemblance of that worthy
Man Mr. <hi>Fisher</hi> his Daughter's first
Husband, whose Person and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
he highly extolled: But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Doctor, his Lady, nor the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:44587:77"/>
kind Aunt had ever any knowledge of
the generous Impostor put on them by
Mr. <hi>Cooper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, the wished for Morning being
come, the Solemnities of the Church
were to be attended, which joined our
happy Lovers Hands, as their Hearts
had been before, and no sooner had the
Parson done his part, but the good Old
Lady performed hers, in delivering
them a Note for two Thousand Pounds
to be paid at sight, which was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
accepted by her Goldswith, who
was there a Guest: And the Doctor
ordered the same Person to make a
handsom set of Dressing-plate to the
value of two Hundred Pounds, to be
presented to the Bride. And he made
his Excuse to his Son and Daughter,
for the smallness of his Present, but he
let them know, that he would take
care for the good Education of his
little Son <hi>Fisher,</hi> and had already also
improved for him, the two Hundred
Broad Pieces, left by his Deceased Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi> had a great Applause from
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:44587:77"/>
his Mistress for relating so pleasant a
Novel, who Confessed she was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delighted with it, and did not much
disprove the Intrigue; but desired him
seriously to tell her, whether the Tale
or chief substance of it, were true or no;
for she doubted not, she said, but it
received much of its Beauty from him.
He was pleased to hear her commend
it, and assured her that the Story had
so much of Truth contained in it, that
he could scarce allow it to be called a
Novel, since the two chief Persons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mentioned, were then in Being, and
lived happily at that very time; having
had several fine Children together; and
he affirmed that he had often heard
Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi> play with great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
on the Lute; had seen divers of
his Excellent Limnings; and that he
had this Story from a great Confident
of Mr. <hi>Cooper</hi>'s, under these borrow'd
Names. But <hi>Don Feliz</hi> cknowledged,
that he had strove to set it off with the
best Ornament he was able, and yet it
very much needed her Excuse for his
imperfect telling it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:44587:78"/>With all the pleasantest Chat they
could invent, and such like Tales, our
two Lovers <hi>Don Feliz</hi> and his Mistress,
passed away their spare Hours: And
once she was very pressing to know
whether his intentions, at his return
home into <hi>England,</hi> were to Marry, or
to live at Rovers, as she found by him he
had hitherto done: For she fancyed,
that after he had had so many Mistresses,
he could hardly be at last confin'd
within such narrow Limits, by a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
Knot, as would tye him for ever
to a Wife. To which he reply'd, that
not having yet considered the Point,
he could give her no direct Answer.
This he said, not knowing whether she
were Marryed or no; for he never yet
durst ask her the Question, fearing to
incur her Displeasure for his being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive
after that, which he thought she
had no mind to discover. But she no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
his Hesitation, was the more pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to be satisfied in her Demand.</p>
            <p>Madam, said he, seeing himself obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to answer, I am seldom Master of
my own Resolutions for any long time,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:44587:78"/>
and my return into <hi>England</hi> being so
uncertain, I doubt I shall have great
difficulty to keep 'till then in the same
Mind I now am in; for I had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended to have wedded my self
only to my Books and Viols, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a more serious Debate with my self,
I am convinc'd, that Marriage, as I
have often been told, is a most honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Estate, and the most proper means
to reduce a Man to Sobriety, who has
been Extravagant; and to make him
live happily, without interruption to
his Studies, and his Innocent Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Therefore have I resolved when
I shall get home, to strive in the first
place to reform my Manners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
very sober, and then choose me
a Wife with whom I may partake of all
that Felicity which other Married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
enjoy. I am glad, <hi>Don Feliz,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
his Mistress, to hear you have
such an honourable Opinion of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
but I much doubt whether all
those who have Experienced that state,
will be ready to give the same Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of it which you do: And I
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:44587:79"/>
would gladly know whence all this
Current of Felicity is expected; is it
from the good Conduct of the Lady,
who shall be so happy to be your Wife?
or rather from your own prudent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement?
for I have very frequently
heard you express your slight of our
Sex, and am therefore afraid we shall
lose the glory of it.</p>
            <p>The Life of Man, <hi>Said Don Feliz,</hi>
may not unfitly be compared to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick;
the delicate Harmony whereof
is made by the Composition of several
Sounds. For that mixture of grave
Tones, with others more accute and
small, makes the Musick perfect, and
so delightful as it is to our Ears.
And this admir'd frame of Man's Body,
when enflamed with a Fever, or shiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Cold, shows that we are sick
and out of order; but when those two
Qualities are aptly united, the Body is
well and at Ease, to our unspeakable plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
The same thing may be observed
of a well-govern'd Common-Wealth,
which consists of different Orders of
People: There the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:44587:79"/>
in Agreement with the <hi>Plebaeans,</hi>
make up the true Harmony which
renders them all happy. And so Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the Mother of all things, framed
Man to Wisdom, and to undertake
weighty and serious Matters, which
is plainly demonstrated by the grave
deep Voice we Men speak with; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,
on the contrary, Woman appears
the true Portraiture of Humane Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Folly; only designed to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in the most Childish and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
of our Affairs in this World;
and that small Voice of theirs which
they always retain, hardly distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
from Childrens, gives us sufficient
Evidence, that they still partake of
Childrens Defects. But when one and
the other happen to make a proper
mixture, wherein Man's Wisdom go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
their Folly, and that Childish
Folly of theirs qualifies the Wisdom of
Man; from thence proceeds that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Life; from thence, I say, flows all
that Current of Happiness. Which
high pitch of Bliss cannot be fully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
nor this Coelestial Harmony
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:44587:80"/>
be ever truly made, if Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
be not solemnly joined together
in Matrimony.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a Faustina,</hi> laughing, told him,
she saw he was very well pleased with
the Subject, because he took such pains
to display his Rhetorick on it: and
yet at the same time could not forbear
his usual Reflections on Women. But
proceeded she, for all your quaint No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Matrimony, unless the Air of
<hi>England</hi> breath a much kinder influence
on Married Persons, than this of <hi>Spain,</hi>
'tis ten to one but you will find some
considerable difference between your
Speculation and the real Practice of it;
that your Coelestial Harmony is often
interrupted by some such Terrestrial
Discord as shall make both your Hearts
ake. They ran briskly on, and were
so zealous to maintain their Arguments;
he for Marriage, and she in dispraise
of it, that they would have continued
the Dispute 'till Break of Day, had not
<hi>Fadrique</hi> scratched at the Door and put
them in mind of parting.</p>
            <p>All the way <hi>Don Feliz</hi> went home,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:44587:80"/>
he could not forbear thinking of the
Discovery he had made, by this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
with her; for he concluded from
thence, that she must either be a Widdow,
or a Married Woman, and that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
was not, or had not been to her
liking, which made her so mueh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh
against Matrimony; and that this
dislike had put her at first upon mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him those Invitations to her House;
and he was pleased with his own Wit,
that had so industriously drawn this
Secret from her. Another Night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the various Subjects of their
Discourse, they happen'd on that of
Religion; and she would then express
a great concern for those of his Country,
<hi>Ay que lastima,</hi> would she often say. Ah
what a pity it is, that a People so
richly endued with all the Gifts of
Nature, should be so wilfully blind to
be hurried away in a course of Heresie
and Atheism, refusing to be made sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of their Danger of Eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and to be brought back into
the Pale of the true Church, which she
believed was that of <hi>Rome.</hi> And she
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:44587:81"/>
was full of those Sayings which the
Priests teach them, to create in them
an Abhorrence of the <hi>Herejes Yngleses,</hi>
the English Hereticks, as they term us:
She would also tell him, that <hi>Y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>galatier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
era tierra de Angeles, poro agora es tier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra
de Demonios,</hi> which is, that <hi>England</hi>
was once a Land of <hi>Angels,</hi> (alluding, as
I conceive, to the many <hi>Saxon</hi> Saints
formerly Canonized here) but that 'tis
now become a Country of Devils,
meaning since the Reformation. But
she took a particular pleasure in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the strange Miracles wrought by
our Saints of old, which she had read of
in the <hi>Flos Sanctorum;</hi> to all which she
gave as much Credit, as to those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Holy Writ; and was often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
angry with <hi>Don Feliz</hi> for endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to rectifie her Judgment in those
matters, and for attempting to show her
the Absurdity of their fabulous Legends.</p>
            <p>Then would she Celebrate the Praise
of the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, who, she said, had
ever kept close to the Ancient Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Faith; she commended their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
frequenting the Churches, and the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44587:81"/>
Expressions of their Zeal and Devotion
there; and she would heartily wish
that the Eyes of the <hi>English</hi> were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
to see their Errour, and follow
the Example of that Excellent People.
Yet after all, she said, she could not but
acknowledge, she had observed some
of the <hi>Irish</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> not to be so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
of Wit and quick of Apprehension,
as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> nor other Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
residing amongst them, but were
rather inclined to a strange Blundering
and Stupidity, not common to other
People; which made her curious to
know if this proceeded from a general
Defect, naturally incident to all born
under their Clime, or else happen'd to
such only as came over thither. <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> assured her, that <hi>Ireland</hi> daily
produced very accomplished Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
brave Souldiers, and Men excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in all Faculties: But that it was
there, as in all other parts of the World,
that many for want of good Education,
proved very Dull and Ignorant; and
that he had observed no other distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betwixt them and other Nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:44587:82"/>Their dwelling a little longer on this
Subject, brought to <hi>Don Feliz</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
a Story, which falling pat to the
purpose, and he knowing the Pleasure
his Mistress took in hearing such, gave
her a hint of it, which made the Lady
press him to tell it. He obeyed, and
began on this manner.</p>

            <head>The Unfortunate Collonel.</head>
            <p>AT the beginning of those dismal
Turmoils in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which brake
out about the beginning of <hi>September</hi>
in the Year 1641 or 42, if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
aright, when the <hi>Irish</hi> endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to extirpate the <hi>English</hi> utterly out
of that Kingdom; there was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of an Ancient Family, and of an
Estate of near <hi>700 l. per An.</hi> engaged
therein, whose name was <hi>OCa</hi>—He
proved very active in that cruel Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the <hi>English,</hi> expressing on all
Occasions, his implacable Hatred to
them; and being a Man of great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
Valour, tho' his Conduct was never
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44587:82"/>
much admired, he was after some time,
honoured with the Command of a Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
'Tis not to my purpose, nor is
it sit I should trouble you, Madam, with
the particulars of that War; it will be
sufficient to say, that the <hi>Irish</hi> being at
last worsted in it, all the Estates of such
Gentlemen as had been instrumental
in kindling the Coals, or industrious
in somenting the Flame of that Fatal
Combustion, were seized, and made
forseit to the <hi>English.</hi> And amongst
the rest was that of Collonel <hi>OC</hi>—
which forced him from that time to
Associate himself with the <hi>Tories,</hi> since
called <hi>Raparees,</hi> and to change his fine
Seat for a Hut in some Wood, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the Boggs; for those are the
common Retreats of such Out-Laws,
who subsist only by Spoil and Rapine.
This was his manner of living till the
Restoration of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second;
during all which time, his Company
having been only such as were then
termed Wild-<hi>Irish,</hi> Men altogether il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litterate
and rude; by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation,
our Collonel could acquire
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44587:83"/>
nothing of Ingenious Improvement,
for the bettering his Manners or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,
but rather by his suiting
himself to all their ill Customs, and
Behaviour, he had degenerated into the
lowest Degree of Clownish Barbarity.</p>
            <p>After that good King was quietly
settled on his Throne in <hi>England,</hi> to
the universal Ioy of his Subjects, and
and had also taken due care for esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing
the Peace and Tranquility of
his three Kingdoms; his Maiesty had
been pleased to bestow a considerable
Post under his Deputy in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to
a near Relation of our Collonels.
Which News reaching his Ear; and
being likewise made acquainted, that
a Court of Claims was Erected there,
wherein such as could purge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of the Imputation of those Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties
practised on the <hi>English</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
in the horrid Massacre of them,
and could make their Innocence appear,
that they had not bathed their Hands
in <hi>English</hi> Blood, should have their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
restored. He never considering
the palpable Guilt he lay under, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:44587:83"/>
on a Journey to Court, hoping
by favour of his Kinsman to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
of his forfeited Estate. So
mounting his Courser which was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Rosinante,</hi> to <hi>Dublin</hi> he posts, there
alighting at the first Inn he came to,
and being confirmed in the Account
of his Kinsman's greatness, he prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that very Morning of his Arrival
to wait on him. In order to this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,
he thought it necessary to spruce
up himself as well as he could, his Garb
being then none of the most Modish;
for he was equipped in his ordinary
Plad, which had served him in his
Function of Robbing, a narrow-brim'd
Hatt with a High Steeple-Crown, a
pair of Pumps, with a long jingling
Spur on his Right Heel, to show he was
just come off a Journey, and being a
tall lusty Man, had a huge Basket-Hilted
Sword fix'd in a broad Girdle
to his side, somewhat after the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Mode. He then goes to a Barber's
for a touch of his pollishing Hand,
ordering him to come and powder his
Hair, and to prune his Head, which
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:44587:84"/>
he affected to wear extraordinarily
long.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Barber was at his Business,
our Collonel acquainted him with the
visit he was about to make, and
asked him many Questions concerning
his Cousin; which Partly gave the
Barber Encouragement to find fault
with the shaggedness of his Short Hair,
and unfashionableness of his long Beard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for a Man of his Age, who owned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
scarce turned of Fifty; assuring him
that at Court, to which the Collonel
was going, it was the general custom
to have their Beards shaved off Clean,
and if their Hair were not very grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
to have that also cut off, and to
wear a Perry-Wigg. Though the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel's
stock of Money were but small,
yet was he willing to appear a Man
of Mode; he therefore, after some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
was perswaded to part with
both his Beard and Hair, and in a
new great blustring Wig, which there
cost him fifteen Shillings, towards the
Court he marches, attended by his
kind Friend the Barber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:44587:84"/>
to steer him to his Kinsman's
House, near the Castle. As they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Streets, our Collonel admiring
the fine Accomplishments of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor,
and quaintness of his Speech,
thought him a fit Person to advise with
about his Behaviour amongst the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.
The Barber generously condes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
to instruct him in all the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
Punctilio's to be observed there,
which was taken for a particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and when he had pointed him to
the House, he left him.</p>
            <p>'Twas just turned of Twelve a Clock
when the Collonel advancing to the
Gate, enquired if his Coshen were
within? The Porter laughing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
who was his Coshen? Thy
Master, said the Collonel, Sir <hi>G. L.</hi> is
my Coshen, and I am come to Dine
with him. No, Sir, answered the
Porter, my Master is gone up into the
Castle, and will not return 'till past one
a Clock, his usual Dining time: But
my Lady is within. Then prithee Joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
proceeded the Collonel, tell thy Lady
that here is her Coshen Collonel <hi>OC<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> come
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:44587:85"/>
to see her. The Porter supposing him
some Person of better Condition than
he appeared to be, by his preposterous
out-side, pray'd his Lady's Page, who
then happened to be present, to show
the Gentleman into the Dining Room.
The Page waited on him up stairs, and
leaving him in the Room, went to
acquaint his Lady.</p>
            <p>Our Collonel who had a keen Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
having reserved his Stomach for
a good Dinner, was glad to see the
Table so well prepared for it. And as
he was admiring the fine. Tapestry
Hangings and other Curiosities there,
he espyed a very great Looking-glass
towards the upper part of the Room,
which made him desirous to know how
his new Dress became him; and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up close to it, saw himself so strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Transformed, that he could scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe it was his own Face he was
staring at. For now instead of his short
grisled Locks and Tufts on his Crown,
intermixt with Baldness, he beheld his
Head with a huge Covering, or rather
Thatch of Black Hair, which being
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:44587:85"/>
unskilfully Composed, stood strutting
out near a Foot on each side his Face,
and instead of his long matted Beard,
reaching almost to his Waste, he found
his Chin deprived of that which he
thought to be its greatest Ornament.
The Sight was so very surprizing, that
lifting up his Hands hastily to express
his Amazement, and not falling into
Account, that thô the lower part of
the Looking-Glass was supported by
Brass Hooks close to the Wall, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
part thereof was hung enclining
forwards; he, in the raising, as I said, of his
heavy Fists, hit his Knuckles with that
Violence against it, that down fell the
Glass shatter'd all to pieces on the Floor.</p>
            <p>You may easily imagin, Madam, what
trouble our Collonel was in at this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident,
who not knowing which way
to excuse it, was going Backwards to
remove as far as he could from thence,
hoping by that means he might not be
suspected for the Person that had done
it; but not turning to see the Course
he steered, he fell suddenly back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an armed Chair, from whence at the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:44587:86"/>
same instant, he heard a great crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Noise, and feeling somewhat break
under him, he started up, and found
it to be a curious Instrument of Musick,
made of Ebony and Ivory, or at least
the Ruines of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne; being the Lady
<hi>L's,</hi> Guittar, squeezed by him to bits.</p>
            <p>This second Misfortune added much
to his Disorder, and as he was looking
with Amazement on one and the other;
the opening a Door at the further end
of the Room, obliged him to turn that
way, where he perceived the good La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who being drest very gay for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of some great Persons, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Quality which were to dine that
Day with her, was, upon the Page's
notice, coming in to entertain this
Stranger her Kinsman. He, in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
he was in, went to meet and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
her, as he remembred the Barber
had directed him, which he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in such an aukward manner, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accustomed to those Ceremonies,
that with the rude shock of his Face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Lady's, he made the Blood
fly out at her Nose; and in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:44587:86"/>
back of his Head, finding his blust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Wig to be stopt, which was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the Ladies Head-dress, either
by some of her Pins, or her Bodkin, he
to secure his Wig, pull'd it so hard, that
he tore down her Hair, Ribbons, and
all her Head-Gear about her Ears.</p>
            <p>When he saw how roughly he had
treated the Fine Lady, his Cousin, he
was going to make an humble Congee,
and to beg her Pardon for it; but his
Scrape was fetched with such a swing
of his Leg, as endangered the throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself down on his Nose; and the
great Spur by his ungainly Motion,
catching in the Ladies rich <hi>Venetian</hi>
Petticoat, not only made a great Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angular
Rent in it, but with the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Jerk, was like to have tript up
her Heels, had not the Silk given way
by being torn. As the Collonel stoop'd
suddenly to disengage his Spur, he
heard a loud Out-cry behind him, and
turning, saw Sir <hi>G</hi>'s Daughter, a little
Lady of about Seven or Eight Years
Old, with her Face all cover'd with
Blood. She was but just come into the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:44587:87"/>
Room, and standing at the Collonel's
Back, more intent on his Extravagant
Behaviour than her own safety, had
received a dangerous Cut on the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
by his reaching to separate his
Spur from the Petticoat; For as he
stooped, his Elbow happening to press
down the great Hilt of his long Sword,
had suddenly raised up its Point, from
which in his Journey he had lost the
Chape, and that hitting the Child's
Fore-head, had done her the Mischief.</p>
            <p>We may easily conclude, that the
Collonel must needs be more than a
little sensible of all this Series of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs
he had done, which were not
possible to be repaired by any Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
he could make: He therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to think of a timely Retreat, and
looking over one of his Shoulders to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Door, was sliding back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
that way, but so full of Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
he never minded, that on his other
Hand he was rubbing against the Side<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board
of Plate and Glasses, prepared
for Dinner, which being only a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Table, and loose in the Joints, was
easily overthrown.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:44587:87"/>This fall of the Table with a terrible
Clatter, thô he was scarce sensible
what it was, so affrighted the Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
that out at the Door he flew, with
a half turn, and with such Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that thô he saw himself at the
Stare-head, it was impossible to hinder
his pitching down Headlong, and
with so much Violence, as must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
have broke his Neck, had not
my Lady's Woman, who was then
coming up with a fine Pyramid of
Sweet-meats, given him some little
Impediment in his Tumble, but full
fore against her will, for she and her
Desart were overturned by him, with
no small Dammage to both: And
yet this could not prevent his rolling to
the Stair-foot, where, as the Devil
would have it, lay the great Mastiff,
who angry to be thus disturbed from
his Natural rest by all that hurly bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
fell upon the Collonel, but he get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
nimbly up, so bravely with his
Fists and Feet, encountred his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
as oblig'd him, after some time,
to give ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:44587:88"/>In this Skirmish, tho' our Man of
War seemed to have had the better on't,
he lost both his Hat and Wig, and that
of the two which lay nearest to him,
being his Hat, he, without much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
recovered it, but then finding
it must cost him a second Combat with
the Dog to regain his Perriwig; and
hearing a doleful Cry of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
upon the Stairs, of Oh Lord
he has Murdered me, the Collonel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to apprehend, and not without
Reason, that the whole Family would
soon Arm and fall upon him, to revenge
the dismal Havock he had made, he
thought it best rather to quit the Field,
and leave the Spoil to his Enemy, than
hazard another Engagement; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
clapping on his Hat, ran straight
to the Gate where the Porter was
standing, who seeing him come in all
that haste and Disorder, would have
stopped his Passage; but the Collonel
without Interruption to his Carreer, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
him one sound Bang on the Pate
with his heavy Fist, left his Opponent
sprawling on the ground, and made nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:44587:88"/>
stop nor stay 'till he got to
his Inn. There quickly mounting
his <hi>Pegasus,</hi> away he flew by the
speediest Journeys he could make to
his Comrades, protesting he would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lose a hundred Estates, than be
forced to appear at Court, and there
wait a long time with such abundance
of Formality and Address, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had some Experience of, but by
his kind Friend the Barber, was more
fully informed, that those Persons who
expected to make any Friends there,
were obliged to, and all the while must
be in danger, as he thought, of falling
into the like Misfortunes, as he had
suffer'd that Day.</p>
            <p>Before <hi>Don Feliz</hi> could reach to the
close of his Story, he was interrupted
three or four times by <hi>Doña Faustina</hi>'s
violent Fits of laughing, which thô she
fain would have suppress'd, yet were so
loud that one of the <hi>Dueña</hi>'s was forced at
each time to come into the Chamber to
advise them to be more hush and more
moderate in their Mirth, unless they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to allarm the whole House to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:44587:89"/>
their own Ruine. These sober Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
back'd with <hi>Don Feliz</hi>'s Entreaty,
could scarce restrain the current of her
Laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> she was so transported with
Pleasure at the hearing this Tale. But
after she had better composed her self,
and returned him Thanks for the great
delight he had given her in his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it: I will not, <hi>said she,</hi> be so rude,
<hi>Don Feliz,</hi> to question the Truth of its
particulars, thô I cannot but admire at
this long Concatination of Blunders and
Misfortunes, that attended the poor
Collonel, and I shall content my self
with the Old <hi>Italian</hi> Saying. <hi>Se non è
ver<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, non è mal travato.</hi> If it be not true,
yet 'tis not ill Composed. <hi>Don Feliz</hi> was
beginning to make an Excuse for his
ill wording, and his Hesitation in tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
it, but she assur'd him, it needed no
Apology, for she was extreamly pleased
with that Nights Entertainment, and to
confirm what she had said, thrust into
his Hand five Doblones at parting.</p>
            <p>At those times when <hi>Don Feliz</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
from visiting his Mistress; by
reason of the long stay he had made
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:44587:89"/>
with her, which was commonly 'till
two or three, and sometimes four a
Clock in the Morning, he had a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom
not to rise 'till ten and often E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven,
which is their Dinner time, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the hot Season of the Year: But
on other Mornings he rose early with
his Brother, and with him would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
divert himself, yet not with
that Friendship and Intimacy as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
he had done. For he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
many times into some Room alone,
to divert himself with his Instruments
of Musick; or to compose some little
Poems, Epigrams, or other Fancies in
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Tongue, to present to
<hi>Doña, Faustina,</hi> who took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in reading them; or else he would
walk abroad by himself into the Fields,
on purpose to avoid <hi>Don Henrique</hi> his
Scrutinies into his Night-Walks.</p>
            <p>On this occasion, he had one Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
got out betimes, and taken a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
Walk amongst the Gardens, that
lie ranged along the Banks of the River
<hi>Tagus,</hi> with no other Companion than
his Book, on which he cast his Eyes as
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:44587:90"/>
opportunity served; and in his return
homeward, he observing the <hi>Caracol</hi> or
Tour of Coaches not far from him in
the <hi>Vega,</hi> directed his Couse that way,
to divert himself also with the variety
of curious Objects to be seen in them;
for the Ladies there and Gentlemen, do
often take the Benefit of the Morning
Air, as well as of the Evening.</p>
            <p>He had not long feasted his Eyes
with the Prospect of those <hi>Spanish</hi> Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
when to his no little Amazement,
he espyed amongst them a Face, which
he had been more accustomed to view
by Candle than by Day-Light; and
thô quickly covered with a Vail, yet
could not the small Glimps he had of
it, hinder him from knowing his <hi>Doña
Faustina.</hi> The motion of the Coach
one way, and his walking another,
gave him reason to believe, that the
Lady had missed seeing him. And
the finding her in this splendour, at
the chief end of a rich Coach, drawn
by six good Mules well equipped; and
attended by a Page and couple of
Foot-men in gentile Liveries, made
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44587:90"/>
him conclude her a Person of no mean
Condition; and raised in him a more
than ordinary Curiosity of knowing
who she was; especially when, to be
satisfied in it, he conceived it was no
great matter of difficulty. For he took
it for granted, that the Lady not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aware she had been seen by him,
he might with safety enough, at her
going out of the Ring, follow the
Coach at a distance, amongst other
Gentlemen also on foot, so as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
into what part of the Town it
went, and there might learn her Name
and Quality. To this end he was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards the Road that leads to the
City, but at so lazy a rate, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so many stops and pauses to look
back, as might well give suspicion to
any watchful Eye, that he could not
be without a Design in his Head, on
some Lady in one of those Coaches,
and of giving her some private Signs
for Assignation, which is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
there, where even to be too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
prying after any Women, is
esteemed a high Crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:44587:91"/>His patience was put to no great
Tryal in tarrying for her, for he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
saw the Coach leave the Rest,
and make toward that Gate of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to which he was going. As the
Coach passed him, he seemed to take
little notice of it, but then left his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and carefully followed after it.
And tho' he twice saw the Page, who
had his Hand on the Coach Boot, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
looking back, give the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
orders to drive on faster, yet was
he so earnest to pursue his Intentions,
as not to perceive he was observed,
but mending his pace, he endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
still to keep up with them, 'till he
heard the Page bid, Drive on a Gallop,
which made him by this time sensible
that he was taken notice of; for the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> very rarely alter their <hi>poco
a poco,</hi> their fair and softly, which is
but a Foot pace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi> finding his Error, thought
it highly necessary to change his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
and that he might not be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
of dogging her Coach, he took
a different Path which led to another
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:44587:91"/>
Gate of the Town; hoping by this
Feinte, that the Lady might fancy his
Pursuit had been only made by Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
and not in contempt of her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
But when he had thought
better on the Thing, it made him
blame his own Folly and Dulness,
which had hindred him from reftecting,
that she must needs have perceived by
his loytering there so near the Ring,
and his often Eying the Coach, that
his Drift was to attend her Motion
homewards; and that she must have
been told by her Page, who had often
look'd back, how nimbly the <hi>Flamenco,</hi>
(for so they commonly call Strangers)
had followed after her: For he now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to consider, when too late, with
what searching Eyes, such as are jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
do pry into; and how nicely they
weigh every little Circumstance, which
they construe to their Prejudice.</p>
            <p>Such like apprehensions as these
made him very uneasie the rest of the
Morning, and on purpose stretch out
his Walk longer than he had intended,
that he might have the satisfaction of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:44587:92"/>
thinking on this matter at large by
himself before he got home. All which
served but to Augment his Trouble,
and make him expect with no small
fear, such another rattling Bout from
the Lady, as he was forced to endure
for his former Transgression. It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
brought to his Memory, the great
Danger he then was in, not only of
losing her favour, but of feeling the
effects of her Revenge for that Fault;
as also the Difficulty he had to obtain
his Pardon, and to re-instate himself in
her good Graces as before. Then he
set his Wits at work to study the best
Excuses he could, for pacifying her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
in case she should admit of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley:
But all his Invention could fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him with no better a Plea in his
own behalf, than stiffly to deny he had
seen her there; and that his sudden
hastening after the Coach, was but
his immediate Consideration of the
Suns Heat, and of the Hour of the Day,
which was then near Dinner time.</p>
            <p>Being come home, he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after a short
Meal made against Stomach, went up
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:44587:92"/>
Stairs, and threw himself upon his Bed,
but could there take no rest, for vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the ill posture his Affairs stood in
with his Mistress; For of this second
Miscarriage, he had no body to throw
the blame on but himself. His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
took notice of all this disorder in
him, and tho' he pressed to know his
grievance, having occasion to Consult
him about a Message sent them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the dispatch of their grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
in that place, yet he found him
in so peevish a Humour, that he saw
it was to no purpose to mention it to
him.</p>
            <p>In a little time after, <hi>Don Feliz</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his Brother fallen into a sound
sleep on the Bed by him, whilst he
himself could not partake of that kind
Benefit of Nature, to give some respite
to the trouble of his Mind, that was
perplexed also to think he should have
so barren a Fancy, as was not able to
bring himself off from so small an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barasment.
In which condition he lay
musing 'till past two of the Clock,
when he was allarmed at the Rattling
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:44587:93"/>
of a second Stone thrown into the
Room, as one some time before had
been. At that very moment he was
fully awake, though his Eyes were
shut, and guessing what that noise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
for he knew it must needs be
another furious Message from his angry
Lady, he started up and ran directly
to the Window, hoping to have had a
sight of the Hand that flung it in; but
was deceived, for the Person whoever
it was, had been too nimble for him,
and was retired from his view.</p>
            <p>But looking afterwards for the Stone,
he found it brought along with it a
Billette, or little Note tied up, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
as the former had been; which
he was almost afraid to open; so much
did he dread the Contents thereof: And
seeing his Brother who had been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
at the sudden Noise of running
to the Window, begin to rouse in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to get up, <hi>Don Feliz</hi> slip'd the Note
and Stone into his Pocket, and going
down Stairs into the Dining-Room, he
there trembling opened it, and read
as follows.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                     <salute>Don Feliz,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>You have now given a second Proof
of your Admirable Conduct in the
Affair of our Loves. How could you
so rashly this Morning hazard your own
safety and mine, only to gratifie an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtful
Curiosity? Sure you forgot you
were in <hi>Spain,</hi> where so many Eyes are
open to observe, Tongues ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
and Hands prepared to chastise
such indiscreet Behaviour? This very
Action being of such danger to us as it
was, would in another Woman, have rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
so high a flame of Rage, as would
not have been extinguished, but with your
Blood; or would at least have dissolved
the Correspondence for ever. But you
know that the Ascendant you have over
me, will not give me leave to think of
Revenge: And the entire Possession you
have of my Heart, may satisfie you,
that 'tis impossible for me, ever to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
you from thence. I can therefore
onely wish, I were able to invent stronger
Reasons than yet I have done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to oblige
you to be more advised for the Future.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:44587:94"/>
In the mean time I have been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an Expedient which, if rightly
pursued may I hope prevent the Insa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
I daily incur by your Indiscretion:
Which when you shall once be sensible
of, I'm sure you will not disapprove.
And because I would fain have you
make some Attonement for your Fault,
before it be worn out of Memory by a
tedious Four and Twenty Hours In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terval,
pray fail not to make your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
to Night at the usual Place
and Time, and I shall send my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Chair to meet you there.
But of this be confident, that for any
Offence <hi>Don Feliz</hi> has commited against
one, who must own she loves him better than
her own Life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he may expect to receive
no greater Punishment, than what he
will find in the Embraces of</p>
                  <closer>
                     <signed>His entirely Affectionate
<hi>Doña Faustina.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:44587:94"/>It was no small satisfaction to <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> to be thus cheaply deliver'd
from the direful. Apprehensions he
had conceived of his Mistresses An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and her Resentment of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front:
For the least thing he could
have expected before the reading her
Letter, was the certain loss of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and perpetual Exclusion from
her Presence. He read it over again
and again, and after a strict Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of every particular Sentence,
he could not discover (besides a sharp
reproof for his Fault) any thing in it
which expressed not a most tender
Affection toward him, and a great
sweetness of Temper in her self, who
could to easily pass by a Crime, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily
committed against her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
Commands; and he concluded
he should be able at Night to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
her fit of Chiding in as ample a
manner, as he had once before done
on the like occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Enrique,</hi> who knew nothing
of what had so lately happen'd, was
amazed to see his Brother come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:44587:95"/>
with so great Briskness up stairs;
and observed that now all those
black Clouds of Discontent, which at
his lying down to sleep, had hung
upon his Brow, were totally dispell'd.
He could not but be curious to know
the Reason of this suddain Change
of Humour, and yet was unwilling
to go about to pump it from his
Friend, having already made many
Attempts of that kind in vain; but
he guessed it must needs proceed
from some of those various Turns,
and Whimseys which his Love-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue
daily afforded.</p>
            <p>The rest of that Afternoon was,
by appointment of the Persons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and the Consent of <hi>Don En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rique,</hi>
to be spent in Treaty about
their Business which had kept them
so long in <hi>Toledo;</hi> and he was very
well pleased to find his Camerade in
so good a temper of Mind to assist
at it. They took their Papers, went
chearfully together to the place where
by Agreement they were to meet;
and there after a long Conference,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44587:95"/>
and many hot Disputes, with certain
<hi>Spanish</hi> Gentlemen, to whom the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
had at last been referred, a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Conclusion was made of the
whole Affair; to the greater satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Don Enrique,</hi> than of <hi>Don Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz,</hi>
who could not but be very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to think that he must now leave
his Mistress, after this new Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
which he look'd on as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
done in effect.</p>
            <p>When they were come back to
their Lodgings, they had divers Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
together, on what had then
passed in that final Adjustment of
their Business, and of the good End
made thereof, after so long an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
on it: Making also their
Remarks on the formal Gravity of
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their slow me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
of proceeding in all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.
And now the next thing
to be thought on, was to make their
necessary Preparations for leaving that
City, and for their return back to
<hi>Madrid.</hi> This thing was long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certing,
which made <hi>Don Feliz</hi> very
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44587:96"/>
uneasie, remembring his Assignation,
and that it now drew near Ten a
Clock. He therefore snatching up a
Sword and Hangers which lay on
the Table, and he supposed to be the
same he commonly walked with, hook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it to his Girdle, as the <hi>Spanish</hi>
Mode is, and after a short Excuse for
his haste, nimbly tripped out of
Doors.</p>
            <p>At the old Station he found <hi>Señor
Fadrique</hi> waiting for him with the
Chair, into which he entred with
very little Ceremony, not to lose
more time, having, as he perceived,
a little slipped his Hour; but the
<hi>Turks</hi> made haste, and quickly set him
down within the Portal of the Lady's
House. He was sufficiently acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with the Method of going up into
the Room, which was always with
great Silence and Circumspection, and
therefore needed no Guide to conduct
him thither. But as he was mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Back stairs, by which he was
accustomed to go, he was not a little
surprized to find his passage hindred
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:44587:96"/>
by a stop Door on the middle of
those winding stairs, which 'till then
he had never known to be shut.
To knock or scratch at it he durst
not, for fear of making a disturbance,
but he pushed hard, and found it fast
lock'd or barr'd. He then staid a
good while, expecting some body's
coming to open it, but not hearing
any one stir that way, he put again
his Hand to the Door, intending to
have thrust harder at it, but at the
first touch the Door flew wide open,
which somewhat encreased his Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and began to raise a suspicion in
him, that there was some unfair play
designed against him.</p>
            <p>These new Observations discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
him not, but forwards he went,
and as he entred the Room at one
Door, he saw his Mistress coming in at
the other to meet him, with her little
Lap-Dogg running by her; which
'till that time she always used to
bring in under one of her Arms. Her
manner of accosting him too, was
different from what it wont to be;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44587:97"/>
for thô she had ever at the first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
expressed a pleasure to see him,
it was still accompanied with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
Gravity; but now instead
of the violent Passion and Fury,
which on the like occasion, she had
formerly shown, and <hi>Don Feliz</hi> at
this instant expected, she with a smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Countenance and open Arms
came up nimbly to him, and calling
Ah <hi>Bellaco!</hi> Ah naughtly Man, why
would you be so unkind to forget my
repeated Orders to you? She clasp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
both her Arms about his shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and charged him with such a
volley of Kisses, and with so much
fervency, as now raised his jealousy
to a much higher Degree, than that
Accident which occur'd on the stairs
had done: For he could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the meaning of this new
manner of Salutation, not used by
Women in that Country; nor could
he guess whence all this superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
Kindness should proceed. This
made him turn his Head to mind
the little Dog, which was fiercely
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44587:97"/>
barking at the Hanging, where, at
the bottom of them, he might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
see the Feet of Men moving to
come out.</p>
            <p>'Twas now no longer time to dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for it plainly appeared there was
a Design laid against his Life; he
therefore putting forward his left Leg,
and having his Arms about the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
Waste, he threw her across his
Knee, with all the force he was able,
against the Ground: And at the same
moment stepping back, and clapping
his Hand on his Sword, drew it at
the first motion, and with it flying
vigorously at the three Assassins, who
by this time with their drawn Swords
were slip'd from behind the Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and advancing towards him, he
charged the first of them with so
home a Thrust, that he fell down,
roaring out <hi>Boto a Christo que estoy
muerto!</hi> Dam'me I'm kill'd! This
brisk Charge and quick Execution,
together with the lamentable Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry
of the two Persons, who seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
expiring on the Floar, so much
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44587:98"/>

daunted the remaining Assailants,
whom he now discover'd to be <hi>Señor
Fadrique</hi> the Gentleman Usher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
one of the Chair-men, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to shrink towards the Bed side, but
keeping still on their Guards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Feliz</hi>'s Business in that place,
was not to prosecute a Victory, as
once he was about to have done,
but to secure his own Life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
observing their motion, and how
concerned they were at the Noise
made by the other Chair-man, who
lay wallowing in his own Blood;
which had obliged the Lady, as we<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l
as she was able, to creep to him,
and endeavour to stop his Mouth
with her Hands, He resolved to take
his Advantage of their Disorder, and
make the best Retreat he could from
the threatning Danger, before the whole
Family, as he doubted they would,
might Arm against him: For he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
they must needs be allarm'd
at all this disturbance. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rushing by them, nimbly slipp'd
out at the Door, and as he was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:44587:99"/>
shutting it after him, espying the
Key left by chance on the out side, he
lock'd it, and was running down stairs;
but there met with another Obstacle;
he found the Stop-door so fast shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
that he could by no Art nor
pulling, open it. This put him to his
Wits end, for he had no time to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
what was best to be done; but
fearing the Enemy might rally, and
Charge him in that disadvantagious
Station beneath them, he was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated
to run up again, to endeavour
an Escape over the Tops of Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
            <p>Being got up to the stairs Head,
he saw a little Door, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magin'd
might possible open into some
Gutter or other Out-let for his purpose,
and was stooping to creep through
that way; but his Haste and wanting
Light (being only what the Stars and
a small glimmering of the Moon then
yielded) would not allow him the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
to see that his Passage within
that Door had no Floar; for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a narrow place or Cock-loft
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44587:100"/>
next the Tiling, was of no use, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had any thing to tread on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Ceiling of the Chamber that
was underneath it; and the Joyces
by which that was sustained. These
Joyces our flying Conquerour in his
hasty Retreat missed, and happening
to tread with all his weight upon the
Plaistering, it immediately gave way,
and he brake through, falling down
headlong into a Bed-Chamber, where
a Gentleman sate reading at a Table,
with his Sword lying by him.</p>
            <p>The studious Gentleman being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
at this amazing Accident, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Man come Armed by such an
unusual In-lett, with a Design as
might be suppos'd to attack him;
threw aside his Book, snatched up his
Sword, which he drew, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for the Encounter. But just
as <hi>Don Feliz</hi> had got up, was bustling
to recover himself after his Fall, and
putting himself into a posture to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Charge, he was the most a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonished
Man of the World, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
that the Assailant whom he was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44587:100"/>
going to Engage, was his Friend and
Comrade <hi>Don Enrique;</hi> and that the
Room in which they were, was their
own Lodging. He then called out
Hold, Hold, Brother. By which words,
(for he was cover'd with the Dust of the
broken Ceiling) the Mistake was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
on both sides, and they know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one the other, it put an end to
their furious Intentions.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Don Enrique</hi> were surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
to see his Friend brought home in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Chamber, by such a strange
piece of Conjuration; <hi>Don Feliz</hi> was
no less amazed to find himself there,
when he imagin'd at that time he had
been at the remotest part of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
from thence. Yet thus it was,
and the Thing appearing so very
strange, <hi>Don Enrique</hi> could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
an immediate Enquiry, to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
of the Mystery thereof; but
was entreated by <hi>Don Feliz</hi> to respit
his Curiosity, 'till a fitter time
of Discoursing it, because he was
then, he said, as he had reason to
believe, pursued for his Life, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44587:101"/>
knew not but his Adversaries might
probably fire down some Gun or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol
into the Room upon them. It
was therefore, after a short Consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
thought necessary, they should
immediately remove out of that Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
So down stairs they went, and
found their Landlord; for he being
disturbed at the rattling Noise he had
heard from above, was getting out of
Bed, and coming up to enquire what
was the matter.</p>
            <p>They acquainted him, as briefly as
they could, with their Resolution,
and with as much of the occasion of
it, as was convenient at that juncture.
To which the Landlord, without
Scruple, readily consented, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to get them a new Lodging to
their Desire. He had indeed been ever
ready to show the great Respect and
Esteem he had for such generous
Guests, as they had always been to
him; and more especially at this time
he was willing they should see his
Diligence and his Zeal to serve them;
for he had got some hint, that their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44587:101"/>
Business being now finished, their stay
could be but very few Days longer
in Town. His offer was kindly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and whilst he went up stairs to
fetch their <hi>Maletas</hi> or Portmantles,
and to view the Breach in his Ceil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
his two Guests went down and
had unlock'd the Door, but as they
were just stepping into the Street,
they found they were strongly push'd
at by two Persons, who had on each
side of the Door planted themselves,
thinking to have stabbed them at their
coming forth.</p>
            <p>The Pre-caution therefore which
<hi>Don Feliz</hi> had given, of marching out
very circumspectly, and with their
drawn Swords in their Hands, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the Mischief of such an Attack,
proved very lucky to them; for their
readiness to defend themselves, and
brisk answer of the Enemies Charge,
did not only secure them from this
second Treachery but did so much
discourage the Undertakers of it, that
they were easily forced by the two
Friends to scour nimbly off<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:44587:102"/>
seek for Refuge in the Portal of a
great House adjoining to their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>In this last Skirmish the Assassins
were found to be the same unhurt
Chair-man, who had been left above;
and his Companion was Old <hi>Fadrique,</hi>
whose bustling had now discover'd
him to be a young Man, by the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
fall of his long Artificial Beard.
Which two <hi>Valentones</hi> or <hi>Bravos</hi> had,
as it seem'd, engag'd to their Lady to
Execute that in the Street, which they
had failed to do in her Chamber,
but were glad to betake themselves to
their Heels for their own safety.</p>
            <p>When their Landlord, who came La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with their Goods<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had overtaken
his two Guests, and had Conducted
them safe to his Friend's House, which
was far enough off, in another part
of the City; they made Enquiry of
him, concerning his Neighbours dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in that House, next to his, and
were satisfied by him in so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as that by the help thereof,
they were able to unriddle the whole
Mystery of that Intrigue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:44587:102"/>They found that the Lady who
called her self <hi>Doña Faustina,</hi> was Wife
of <hi>Don Pedro de Solana,</hi> a rich Knight
of the Order of St. <hi>Iago,</hi> who was
turned of Threescore Years of Age,
and was Master of the great House,
as he also was Owner of that lesser
wherein they lodged, which he let
to <hi>Fancisco de Ayala</hi> their Landlord.
They were told that <hi>Don Pedro</hi> and
his Lady had been Married together
above six Years, and she never with
Child in all that time. They were sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
that she must have taken an
opportunity of looking down when
she would, through a Peep-hole into
their Bed-Chamber (which Hole by
them had but lately been Discovered)
from whence she could hear and see
every thing they said and did there;
and they guessed she might have been
invited to that Curiosity by <hi>Don Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz</hi>'s
Musick, of which she would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
talk. They also concluded, that
the Letters which seemed to have
been thrown in at the Window, were
only drop'd down through the same
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:44587:103"/>
Hole in the Ceiling. It likewise plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appeared, that the Contrivance of
carrying him about so far in the close
Chair, was but to amuse him, that
he should not be able to find out her
Lodging. And they conjectured that
this Design of Assassinating him, did
not altogether result from her Desire
to revenge the Affront of his disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her Commands, and his unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Curiosity in endeavouring to find
out who she was: But partly too,
because she having got Intelligence
by her watching at the Peep-Hole,
that those two <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen had
dispatched their whole Affair in <hi>Toledo,</hi>
and were speedily to return to <hi>Madrid;</hi>
that therefore since she must now lose
her Gallant's Conversation for ever,
she would suffer no other Woman,
to whom he might possibly speak with
Scorn of the Favours of his Mistress
<hi>Doña Faustina,</hi> to have the future En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of him.</p>
            <p>But they could not imagin what
reason she could have, to contrive
his Murder in her own House, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44587:103"/>
than in the street as they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him in the Chair; or in some
By-Corner, Alley, or other private
Hole; unless it should be, that she
thought in those Places, the Act might
be more liable to a Discovery; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
she her self had a mind to see the
Bloody Execution more effectually
performed. And upon a further scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of her last ambiguous Letter to
him, they admired how <hi>Don Feliz</hi>
could have been so blind, as not to
see, that at the close of it, she in cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Terms discover'd how she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to deal with him, which was
to hold him in her Arms, while her
Servants should Murder him. It was
also then argued, how it was possible
for <hi>Don Feliz,</hi> not to recollect, that he
must have often seen waiting at the
next door, his Mistresses Coach, and
the Lyveries which she had that Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
attending her in the Ring: But to
this he protested, his Thoughts were
so fix'd on the Lady, and his surprize
was so great at that Moment, that he
took very little notice of the Coach or
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:44587:104"/>
Servants; which at another time he
might have easily known.</p>
            <p>After these Remarks thus made,
<hi>Don Enrique</hi> took occasion to Discourse
the matter at large with his Brother,
and strove to make him sensible of the
Wicked and Extravagant life he had
led in that Town, which had plunged
him into so much Mischief, as was the
Murder of a Man, and the exposing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to so many imminent Dangers of
losing his own Life, and of ruining his
Friend; being commonly the sad effects
of such ill Courses. To all which <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> soberly attended, having very
little to say, in any respect, for his
own justification. And after finishing
this grave Lecture of Morality, it was
observed that they had by some Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
made a change of Swords; for
<hi>Don Feliz,</hi> at his hasty going out to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
his Mistresses treacherous Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
had, instead of his own, snatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up his Brother's that had an open
Scabbard, with proper <hi>Tiros</hi> or Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
belonging to it. This made him
call to mind the benefit he had had by
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:44587:104"/>
that lucky Mistake, who might else
have been kill'd before he could have
drawn his own Sword, which for its
length being of the <hi>Spanish Marco,</hi> or
Standard, with an ordinary close Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,
could not have been done, but
at two or three Motions.</p>
            <p>They made but two Days longer
stay in <hi>Toledo,</hi> during which time
they thought it not convenient to
shew themselves too publicly, lest
they might be found by some others
of the revengeful Lady's Agents to
their further Prejudice, and because
they could not yet get Intelligence
how it fared with the Chair-man;
whether he were alive or Dead. But
at their Departure for <hi>Madrid,</hi> they
were assured by their Landlord, that
the Lady was pretty well recovered
of the terrible Fall her kind Lover
had given her; and that the wounded
Chairman was in a skilful Surgeon's
Hands, with great Hopes of his Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.
Which News was very wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to <hi>Don Feliz,</hi> who had been
more than a little inquisitive to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:44587:105"/>
know in what Condition they both
were.</p>
            <p>Well, they now took leave of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi>
and mounting a couple of good
Mules, they, with their Muletteer,
rode jogging on together for <hi>Illescas,</hi>
which they reached that Night, as
they did <hi>Madrid</hi> the Day after; <hi>Don
Feliz</hi> promising a thousand times, on
the Road, to his Brother, never more
to be drawn into such ill Courses so
long as he liv'd; but whether he may
since have justly comply'd with those
Promises or no, I must leave it to his
own Conscience to be the Judge. I
confess, I am apt to believe the best of
him, for he was frequently observ'd to
repeat these <hi>Italian</hi> Verses.</p>
