            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>O you not know that you ought to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of God, and Christ, and the Saints, <hi>Ephes. 5. 1. Matth. 16. 24. Heb. 6. 12.</hi> and not the multitude, <hi>Exod. 23. 2.</hi> not the world, <hi>Rom. 12. 2.</hi> And dare you yet to set up them to be your patterns, and to follow their

examples, who are not at all esteemed in the Church? I speak it to your shame, Is there not a Holy Christ to be your Pattern, and a Holy Word to be your Rule; but Professors of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must needs be as the irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of the world, taking ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from them, who will take no example from Christ? Now therefore there is utterly a fault amongst you, because you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form so much to this world, contrary to that express prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom. 12. 2. Be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to this world;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause you have so much fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with the unfruitful works of darkness; contrary to that word, <hi>Eph. 5. 11.</hi> Why are ye


<pb facs="tcp:42999:3"/>
not rather Reprovers of the world, and condemners of it, as <hi>Noah</hi> was, <hi>Heb. 11. 7.</hi> By your walking as Christ walked, <hi>1 John 2. 6.</hi> and according to Rule? <hi>Gal. 6. 16.</hi> Why do you not rather suffer your selves to be derided and despised? Know you not that the world you conform to lies in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness? <hi>1 John 5. 19.</hi> And that the unrighteous world shall not inherit the Kingdom of God? <hi>1 Cor. 6. 9.</hi> you know it. And you know also that Eyes are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, observers you have many, God, Angels, and Men; you had need look well to your wayes: you have a Rule to talk and walk by. 'Tis not for


<pb facs="tcp:42999:4"/>
you to say, we will be as the Heathen, <hi>Ezek. 20. 32.</hi> we will be as others, contrary to <hi>Eph. 4. 17.</hi> Which forbids you to walk as others, in the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your minds: Remember the words of Christ to his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Luke 22. 26.</hi> ye shall not be so: <hi>You must walk as Christ walked</hi> He has left you an example, <hi>1 Pet. 2. 21. If you shall walk as others, you will by so doing give great occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the enemies of God to Blaspheme,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 14. And be stumbling blocks to the world: and if offences come by you unto the world, woe unto you, <hi>Matth. 18. 7.</hi> Remember <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and what God told him,

               <hi>The child that is born to thee shall surely dye;</hi> verily the name of God is blasphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the prophane through you; <hi>Rom. 2. 24. You should adorn the doctrine of God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our in all things;</hi> mark <hi>In all things,</hi> Tit. 2. 10. and be very tender of the name of God and his doctrine, that it be not blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed through you, <hi>1 Tim. 6. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

first works, or else I will come unto you quickly, and will remove your candlestick out of its place, except you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> Rev. 2. 4, 5. Would I could say of you as it follows, <hi>vers. 6.</hi> with a little alteration, But this you have, that you hate conformity to the world which Christ also hateth. Brethren, be ye followers of Christ, and mark them which walk so, as that ye have Christ for an ensample. For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction, whose God is their back and belly,


<pb facs="tcp:42999:5"/>
whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things, <hi>Phil. 3. 17, 18, 19.</hi> But let your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation be in Heaven, as was <hi>Pauls</hi> and the Saints at <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. Seek you the things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. Set your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on things above, and not on things on the earth; for you profess your selves to be dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ, who is your life, shall appear, then shall you appear with him in Glory. Mortifie therefore your members which are upon the earth; <hi>Col. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi> I beseech you by the


<pb facs="tcp:42999:6"/>
mercies of God, the meekness of Christ, and by your appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before his judgment seat; hear counsel and receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, that you may be wise at length, <hi>Prov. 19. 20.</hi> If you will not hear counsel and receive instruction, read <hi>Jer. 6. 8.</hi> and consider and tremble. That you may is the prayer of one who wisheth above all things that your souls may prosper, and be adorned as your bodies do and are.</p>

            <epigraph>

               <q>And be not conformed to this world.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this and the foregoing verse we have an exhortation to holiness, branched out into three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That we present our bodies, a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>And not be conformed to this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>But to be transformed by the renewing of our mind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beseech you:</hi> though I might be bold in Christ to enjoyn you, yet for love sake, I rather beseech you, pray and intreat you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> seeing you have received so much mercy from God through Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Brethren,</hi> being all the Children of God through faith in Christ. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By the mercies of God, bestowed on you.</hi> Gods mercy is one, but the effects and


<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42999:7"/>
fruits of it are many; Election, Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Justification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you present your Bodies;</hi> not your Souls onely, but your Bodies also: God will have the Body conformed to his will, and not to the world, as well as the Soul; for the Body is for the Lord, for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord, and the Lord for the Body, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 13. Our Bodies being his, and bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 19, 20. Our Bodies being the members of Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so must we glorifie God with our Bodies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
            <p>The Apostle praying for the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> prayes that their Bodies, as well as their Souls, might be sanctified, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. I note this the rather, because many think they may do what they will with, and make what use they will of their Bodies; but they are greatly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for the Body is not for Fornication, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. no not for Ostentation, to make a shew with it. Read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 13, 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That you present them;</hi> 1. That you offer and consecrate them to God as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of thankfulness; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 35.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Holy,</hi> not regarding, but hating iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in our hearts; for if iniquity be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, we cannot be accepted: <hi>Psalm</hi> 66. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Acceptable to God,</hi> well pleasing to him through Jesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. through faith in him, without which we cannot please God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The Mode of the Dehortation, tis in a beseeching way; <hi>I beseech you.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I shall shew you,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What meant by conformed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What of the World must not be conformed unto.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is so.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Why.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Use.</p>
            <p>First, What is meant by the World? By the world understand <hi>The Men of the world,</hi> Psal. 17. 14. Worldly minded Men and Women, who have their hearts, inheritance, and happiness here, their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this life. <hi>The wicked of the world,</hi> Joh. 14. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:42999:9"/>
These are called the World,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because they are ruled by the God of this world, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. Eph.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because they have received onely the spirit of the world, that spirit which teacheth worldly things, and placeth its happiness in worldly things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because they are satisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the things of this world, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6. &amp; 17. 14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because they are the major part of world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What meant by Conformed?</p>
            <p>By conforming to the world under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, fashioning our selves according to it; resembling the world, and being like to it; making the men of the world our Pattern, our Example, and Copy to write after.</p>
            <p>When we approve, imitate and follow the sinful fashions and practices of this world, then we conform to it.</p>
            <p>Now, not to be Conformed to this world, is not to approve, not to imitate, not to follow the sinful, vain, foolish fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practices of this world.</p>
            <p>Not to put on their form and shape in our behaviour.</p>

Thirdly, What of the world it is wherein we must not be conformed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not in that wickedness the world lies in, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19.</p>
            <p>Not in that unrighteousness it is filled with: a Catalogue whereof is set down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29, 30, 31.</p>

            <p>We must not be conformed to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of worldly men, in Natural, Civil, and Religious actions.</p>
            <p>We must not eat and drink as they do, for they feed themselves without fear; <hi>Jude</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>We must not buy and sell as they do, for therein they walk not by that rule <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12.</p>
            <p>We must not carry our selves in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters as they do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:42999:10"/>
We must not hear as they do, for they hear without preparation before hearing,

Practice after hearing. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31.</p>
            <p>We must not pray as they do: For</p>
            <p n="1">1. They make light of Prayer, <hi>Job</hi> 21. 15.</p>

            <p>We must not come to the Lords Table as they do, for they come unpreparedly.</p>

            <p>Nor sing Psalms as they do, for they sing not with the heart, but voice onely.</p>
            <p>Nor fast as they do, for they abstain onely from food, not from sin.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That it is so, That Saints must not conform to sinners.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23. 2.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, Why.
<list>
                  <item>1. From the World.</item>
                  <item>2. From themselves.</item>
                  <item>3. From Christ.</item>
                  <item>4. From the things themselves wherein conformity to the world is practiced.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, From this World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because Satan is the God and Prince of it, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 4. Joh.</hi> 12. 31. &amp; 14. 13. &amp; 16. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because 'tis an evil world, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. and lyes in wickedness, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 19. See its description, <hi>Psal.</hi> 36. 1, to 5. &amp; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 11, &amp;c. &amp; 8. 7. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because this evil world must give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, even for those things wherein we are so prone to follow it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Because the end of it is destruction, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. You would not suffer with it, and will you sin with it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:42999:11"/>
Secondly, From themselves, who by profession are Saints, Christians.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Because they are not of the world, but are called out of it;</hi> Joh. 15. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath seperated you from others to be his own peculiar;</hi> Levit. 20. 24. Exod. 19. 5.</p>
            <p>Hence, for this cause, as well as others, 'twas that God was displeased with his people of old, <hi>for desiring a King, that they might be like the Nations,</hi> 1 Sam. 8. 5. <hi>viz. Because God hath severed them from other people that they should be his:</hi> Levit. 20. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because they have better Principles, then the world has, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <head>1 Tim. 1. 5.</head>
               <item>A pure Heart,</item>
               <item>Good Conscience,</item>
               <item>Faith unfeigned,</item>
            </list>
            <p>They have Christ in them, as a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. And the spirit of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 4. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>The Principles of the world are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>An impure Heart,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A bad Conscience,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Real unbelief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yea Satan, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 4. and the spirit of the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42999:12"/>
Now is not this a good reason why the people of God should not conform to this world? for should they of <hi>better principles</hi> conform to them of <hi>worse?</hi> should they that have a <hi>pure Heart, good Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> conform to those that have an <hi>impure Heart,</hi> a <hi>bad Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and <hi>real Unbelief?</hi> Should they who have <hi>Christ and the Spirit of God in them,</hi> conform to them who have <hi>Satan and the Spirit of the world in them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Because they have better patterns to conform to, then the world is, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ, <hi>Col. 2. 6. 1 John</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample:</hi> So as ye have the servants of Christ, not the world for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Angels and glorified Saints. We must study so to do the will of God on Earth, as 'tis done in Heaven: <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
            <p>Now, judge in your own Consciences, should they who have such excellent pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, conform to the pattern of a base world?</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42999:12"/>
4. Because they are bound by their Baptism to the contrary, <hi>viz. To renounce the world, the pomps and vanities thereof, and not to follow, or to be led by it.</hi> Now should we do that which is a breach of our Baptismal Covenant.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Because you that are Saints are born to great matters, <hi>even to an inheritance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible and undefiled,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 3, 4. and should you, persons that are new born to so great an estate, should you please your selves in a conformity to the poor things of this world?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Because you are grown up to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to years of discretion; so that it is time for you to put away childish things: Whilst you were Children 'twas more tollerable, but now that you are grown up to be men, to be so childish and foolish is intollerable. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Because <hi>you are more excellent then your neighbour, Prov.</hi> 12. 26. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must not conform to them. For shall the more noble conform to the more igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? <hi>Ye are Gods treasure,</hi> Psal. 135. 4. And shall Gods treasure conform to the refuse of this world? You are <hi>Priests of God,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. And shall the Priests of God conform to common people? The


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42999:13"/>
Priests of old were not to touch any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Because <hi>you have not so learned Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4. 20. <hi>q. d.</hi> The Doctrine of Christ in which you are instructed, and which you have learned, requires another manner of life from you, then that which the Gentiles lead, therefore you should not imitate them. Christ hath taught you otherwise, <hi>The grace of God which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth salvation, teacheth you to deny ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and worldly lusts, and to live Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, soberly, and godly in this present world;</hi> and not to conform to its unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, intemperate and ungodly life, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Because you are now within sight of home, your Fathers house; <hi>and your sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is nearer, and therefore must cast off the works of darkness, and walk honestly as in the day, not in rioting, drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying:</hi> As the world does. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 11, 12. Your thoughts should now be so taken up and pleased with what you have in view, the great things which are to come, and so near to come, that all the toyes and trifles this world is so much pleased with, should be looked upon by you with disdain.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42999:13"/>
10. Because you shall now very speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be separated from this world, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from it, and delivered from that wrath which they shall suffer for ever and for ever; and will you conform to them now, in those things for which they shall suffer the vengeance of eternal fire? would you have your souls gathered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after with those you conform to here, and whose fashions you have learned here? <hi>David</hi> would not, <hi>Psal.</hi> 26. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, From Christ.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because <hi>Christ designedly gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God and our Father,</hi> Gal. 1. 4. To what he gave himself, see <hi>Isa.</hi> 50. 6. &amp; 52. 14. <hi>His back to smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, his checks to them that plucked off the hair, his face to shame and spitting.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this you proud men and women, whose Backs, Faces, Heads, Necks, Brests, and Armes, shew the pride of your Hearts. Did Christ give himself to suffer all this, that he might separate and deliver you from conformity to this world? And is not this a good Reason why you should not conform unto it, in hair, habit, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:42999:14"/>
2. Because Christ and his Kingdom is not of this world. 1. <hi>Christ is not of it,</hi> Joh. 8. 23. 2. <hi>His Kingdom is not of it,</hi> Joh. 18. 36. Not onely in respect of the subjects, but in opposition to worldly Kingdoms, which come with external pomp and observation. But Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not so, <hi>Luke</hi> 17. 20, 21.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, From the things themselves wherein conformity to the world is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because these things are not of the Father, but of the Devil, and the world, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because the love of these will not consist with the love of God, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because these things pass away, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 31. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Use.</p>

            <p>Answer, They offend in and about them in respect of the Matter, Time, and End of them.</p>
            <p>First, In respect of the Matter. The world makes that the matter of Sport and Recreation, which should be the matter of Devotion and Humiliation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That which should be the matter of Devotion, as Scripture, Lots.</p>
            <p>First, Scripture phraze and story. This is a taking of Gods name i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore I beseech you by this mercy of God, be not conformed to the world in sporting your selves with Scripture.</hi>

            <p>Quest. <hi>If the Question should be asked whither Card-playing, and Dice-playing be a sin?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I answer, That as Carding and Dicing are commonly used, it is sin; and I think I have good ground so to answer; for as 'tis commonly used, 'tis a swerving from Scripture rules. To Instance in some known Rules.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Whatsoever is not of faith is sin,</hi> Rom. 14. 23. Now will any say that Carding and Dicing as commonly used is done in faith, with assurance that it is pleasing to God in Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42999:28"/>
Secondly, <hi>Whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him,</hi> Col. 3. 17. Now who can say that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and Dicing as commonly used is thus done.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatsoever else ye do, do all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. Now do you think in your Consciences that Carding and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, as commonly used, is done to the glory of God?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>In every thing, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests be made known to God,</hi> Phil. 4. 6. Now is it thus used, and if not, is it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule?</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Give no offence to Jew or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, or the Church of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 32. Is no offence given by it?</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Whatsoever is of Good report think of and do,</hi> Phil. 4. 8. Is Carding and Dicing of good report?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Abstain from all appearance of e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>il,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 22. Sure Carding and Dicing hath the appearance of evil.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Avoid all occasions of sin,</hi> Prov. 23. 21. &amp; 4. 14, 15. &amp; 58. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less 'tis the occasion of much sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:42999:28"/>
Ninthly, <hi>Thou shalt not covet any thing that is thy neighbours,</hi> Exod. 20. 17. Now as commonly used, sure there is covering in it.</p>
            <p>Tenthly, <hi>Thou shalt not go beyond or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud thy Brother in any matter,</hi> 1 Thes. 4. 6. As 'tis commonly used, 'tis a breach of this Rule also.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That which should be the matter of Humiliation, the world makes matter of Sport and Recreation, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, and the Judgments of God.</p>
            <p>First, Sin: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mens living without a calling, to make sport.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mens wearing womens apparel.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mens playing the fool and acting to make sport, as if they had no understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus to do is sin, and sin is matter of sorrow and humiliation; and to take pleasure in that which is matter of sorrow, must needs be sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Judgments of God: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Foolishness and madness, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. 14, 15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The enmity between the creatures caused by mans sin. Now to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in these, is to take pleasure in those things which are matter of sorrow and humiliation.</p>

            <p>Thus you see the world offends in and about Pleasures and Recreations, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The world offends in and about them in respect of Time, too much being spent in and about them, <hi>viz.</hi> whole dayes and nights, contrary to <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 16.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Are not our cloathes Memorials of our sin and shame?</p>
            <p>Before our first Parents had sinned, <hi>they were both naked and were not ashamed,</hi> Gen. 2. 25. But when they had sinned, <hi>they were ashamed, and sewed fig-leaves together to cover their nakedness,</hi> Gen. 3. 7. <hi>But God made them coats of skins,</hi> ver. 21.</p>

Now suppose a man to have many Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and he borrows a Hat of one, a Coat or Cloak of another, and Shoes and Stockins of another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then goes strutting up and down the Streets in these borrowed things, what would you think of him?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are not your Cloaths, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials of them, much baser then your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? And will you be proud of what is inferior to your selves?</p>
            <p n="4">4. What are your Bodies which you thus dress up and adorn? Are they not vile, loathsom, stinking, foul, diseased bodies, which must dye and turn to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Do Cloaths commend you to God, or to wise and sober men? Nay, onely to men of vain minds they commend you.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Does not dressing, decking and adorning of our selves in such a way as is usual, discover the vanity of our own minds?</p>

            <p n="8">8. Is not much of our Cloathing waste and lost, and so a slighting of Christs counsel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 12. If the Disciples of

            <p n="9">9. Do not many poor want that which you put on for Pride?</p>
            <p n="10">10. What will you do in the day when God shall come to deal with you, and reckon with you about your layings out upon your Pride? and Conscience shall witness against you: So much laid out upon my proud lust.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, Understand well wherein you are not to conform to this world.</p>
            <p>Sure not in any thing which is a swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving from the Rule, the written word of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42999:45"/>
Not in any thing which is a transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a known Law.</p>
            <p>Take some instances of known Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Abstain from all appearances of evil,</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 22. This is one Rule.</p>
            <p>Now in any thing that is or has the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil, we must not conform to the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Avoid all occasions of evil of sin, to our selves or others.</hi> All Snares, Traps and Temptati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>Now in any thing which is an occasion of sin to our selves or others, we must not conform to the world.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Give no offence,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor. 10. 32. Phil. 1. 10. 1 Joh.</hi> 2. 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Those things think upon and do which are of good report,</hi> Phil. 4. 8. and this you must have a care of lest you fall into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, and the snare of the Devil; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 7.</p>
            <p>Now those things which are not of good report, we must not conform to the world in.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Do all in the name of Christ,</hi> Col. 4. 17. <hi>giving thanks,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now if the world do any thing which cannot be said to be done in the name of


<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42999:45"/>
Christ, therein you are not to conform to the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Follow others as they follow Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 1.</p>
            <p>Now in those things wherein the world does not follow Christ, we are not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Whatsoever you would that men should do to you, do you the same to them,</hi> Matth. 7. 12.</p>
            <p>Now if the world do those things to others which they would not have done to themselves, therein we must not conform to them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Let all things be done for edifying,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 26. In Knowledge, Faith, Love, and holy Obedience.</p>
            <p>Now if the world do any thing that tends to building up of others in Unholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Disobedience, Pride and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonness; we must not conform to the world therein, for all must be done to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory,</hi> Phil. 2. 3.</p>
            <p>Now if the world do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Look not every man on his own, but on the things of others,</hi> Phil. 2. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:42999:46"/>
Now if the world be all for it self, with the neglect of others, we must not therein conform to the world.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>Redeem the time because the days are evil,</hi> Eph. 5. 16.</p>
            <p>Now if the world trifle away time, on Lords dayes and other dayes, we must not therein conform to the world.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever else ye do, do all to the glory of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</p>
            <p>Now if the world do that which can have no tendency to the glory of God, we must not conform to the world therein.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be convinced that 'tis a sin to be conformed to this world in such matters before mentioned; Gods prohibition makes it a sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2.</p>
            <p>When a man is sure a thing is sinful, he will resist it the more easily; but if he be in doubt whether it be sin or no, he will the more easily venture upon it, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
            <p>The Devils business is to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that sin is not sin, that they may commit it.</p>
            <p>For this end he raiseth up one Prophet or another, to say as to <hi>Ahab, Go up and prosper;</hi> or to say, <hi>There is no hurt in this;</hi>


               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42999:46"/>
or to dispute for it, or practice it himself, and then the Devil has gotten ground.</p>
            <p>For when a thing is come to be a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, and some that are Wise and Learned, Holy and Religious, are on one side, and some of another; Then the Hypocrite, as one sayes, hath a cloak for his sin, and a Dose of Opium for his Conscience.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Get the fear of the Lord,</hi> this will restrain from sin, <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. 15.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Make a covenant with your eyes,</hi> Gaze not on the fashions of others; See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 16.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Set upon the work of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> look upon it as a duty of absolute necessity, <hi>Col. 3. 5. Rom.</hi> 8. 13.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Get to be crucified to the world;</hi> and for this end make use of the Cross of Christ, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, <hi>Have your conversations in Heaven, and your affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,</hi> Phil. 3. Col. 3. <hi>Mind things not seen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Eighthly, <hi>Set God alwayes before you,</hi> Psal. 16 8. Gen. 17. 1.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Think much of death and judgment,</hi> and what thoughts you will then have of conformity to this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:42999:47"/>
And now in Conclusion let me again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, <hi>Be not conformed to this world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I beseech you by the mercies of God, be not conformed to,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And by me God himself beseeches you,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20.</p>
            <p>Now suppose a Mother should beseech her Child,</p>
            <p>By the Womb that bare him.</p>
            <p>By the Paps that gave him suck.</p>
            <p>By the Knees that dandled him.</p>
            <p>And by all her care of and kindness to him: what would you think of him, if he should not in a lawful thing yield unto her? would you not think him to be of a flinty heart?</p>
            <p>In like manner when God by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters shall beseech you by the multitude of his tender mercies; whereby,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He begat you to a lively hope of an Inheritance incorruptible,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 1. 3, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He hath quickned us together with Christ, and raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,</hi> Eph. 2. 4, 5, 6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He hath pardoned us,</hi> Psal. 78. 38.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He hath called us,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9.</p>

            <p>What stony hearts have they that will not yield when God thus beseeches by his mercies bestowed on them?</p>
            <p>Hear me you Professors, let me expostu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Why Sirs shall God loose and miss of the main end of bestowing his mercies on you?</p>
            <p>Our obedience is the main end of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing mercies on us. See <hi>Psal. 130. 4. Luke 1. 73, 74. Psalm</hi> 105. 39. to end.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not to you that God applies himself in this beseeching way, even to you who have received mercy to be begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten again, quickned, pardoned, called, renewed and saved?</p>
            <p>Tis to you he comes and beseeches by all his mercies, be not conformed to this world.</p>
            <p>Others that have not received these mercies, he cannot beseech by them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Had others received the mercies you have, and being beseeched by them, would they not, think you, be perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?</p>

4. Will you hazard and endanger your selves by conforming to, and keeping company with the men of this world?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> did so, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 1, 2. and wrath was upon him therefore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Josiah</hi> did so, 2 King. 23. 29. His for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness to pleasure the King of <hi>Assiria</hi> cost him his life.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Israelites</hi> conformed to <hi>Egypt</hi> in Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 1, 2, 3. And Gods wrath waxes hot against them, <hi>v.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>And to the <hi>Moabites</hi> in Adultery, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 1, 2. and the anger of the Lord was kindled against them.</p>
            <p>If you live after the manner of wicked men, you are like to be judged after their manner, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 23. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Assirian</hi> or others will persecute after the manner of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they shall be punished after the manner of <hi>Egypt, Isa.</hi> 10. 24, 26.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Doth not God find fault with doing after the manner of others? See 2 <hi>King. 17. 33. 2 Chron.</hi> 13. 9.</p>

That course of life which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the fashions of the world, is most commendable and acceptable to God.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, God delayes to execute ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance for a time.</p>
            <p>Secondly, At length he will take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God delayes for a time to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, <hi>Psal. 50. 21. Isa.</hi> 42. 14.</p>
            <p>Thus God did bear long with the old world, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
            <p>He will avenge at last though he bear long, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7.</p>
            <p>After a long time the Lord of those ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants cometh and reckoneth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 19.</p>

Though God keep silence for a time, yet he will speak at last. See <hi>Habak.</hi> 2. 3.</p>

               <hi>Reasons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negatively,</hi> Not because God is slack, as we are too apt to conceive, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>1.</p>
            <p>No, not as if God were slack, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward through weakness, forgetfulness or fickleness and inconstancy, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
            <p>They are not slack that are long ere they come, but they that come not at the due and appointed time. Now God never stayes beyond that time, <hi>Heb. 10. 37. Habak.</hi> 2. 3. So then this is not the Reason: but,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Affirmatively,</hi> 1. Because God is long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, 2 <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>et.</hi> 3. 9. willing that we should have time and means to repent, and so not perish. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To leave sinners at last without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 5. 11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Because he has an eternity wherein to be revenged on them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:42999:68"/>
2. At length God will take venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He will do it, <hi>Psal. 50. 21, 22. Isa. 42. 14. Ezek.</hi> 24. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Consider we a little,</p>
            <p>First, Who it is that will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence?</p>
            <p>Secondly, How he will do it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Why.</p>
            <p>First, Who it is?</p>
            <p>He to whom it belongeth, and who claims a propriety in it; <hi>Deut. 32. 35. Rom.</hi> 12. 19.</p>
            <p>Who this is? See <hi>Jer. 32. 18, 19. Nah. 1. 2. Jer.</hi> 51. 56.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He will do it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Abundantly, plentifully, <hi>Psal.</hi> 79. 12. Sevenfold, seven times more, and seven times more, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>He poures it out, <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Terribly, <hi>Joel 2. 11, 31. Isa.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
            <p>What terrible things did he do by the Red Sea? <hi>Psal.</hi> 116. 22. See <hi>Nah.</hi> 1. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:42999:69"/>
So terribly that the ears of those that hear shall tingle, 1 <hi>Sam. 3. 11. 2 King. 21. 12. Jer.</hi> 19. 3. Shall have his ears stricken with horror and astonishment, at the report of it, though he see it not. See also, <hi>Psalm 119. 53, 120. Ezek</hi> 21. 7.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Certainly, surely, <hi>Jer.</hi> 51. 56. and therefore is the threat,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Doubled in the Text, and <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sworn to; God swears he will do it, <hi>Dent.</hi> 32. 40, 41.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Written down, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 14. &amp; 34. 27.</p>
            <p>Or thus, God will do it: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He has said it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Said it again and again in the Text, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24. 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sworn it, <hi>Deur.</hi> 32. 40, 41.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Sealed it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 34.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When? In due time, <hi>Deut. 32. 34, 35. Joel</hi> 3. 13.</p>
            <p>When <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

            <p>These were not yet full, not at their growth. Sin comes to it by degrees, <hi>Jer. 51. 13. Dan. 8. 23. Matth.</hi> 23. 32.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Why? Because Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Justice, Truth, and Honour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. His Holiness; Which is such, that he cannot away with iniquity, <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 13. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 13.</p>

            <p n="3">3. His Truth, and Oath requires it; he hath said it, and doubled it; and sworn it, and caused it to be written, as you have heard.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His Honour; See <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Their enmity to God and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple requires it, <hi>Psal.</hi> 83. 1, to 6.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Gods Soveraignty over all requires it, <hi>Psalm</hi> 83. 18. with the foregoing <hi>verses.</hi>

            <p>Seeing this is so, will you take the course prescribed, that if possible none of these things may come upon you; or if they should, that your eternal estate may be secured.</p>
            <p>First, What can you object against it?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it not the course that God hath prescribed. That it is, has been proved before; therefore you can't object, 'tis not required; you cannot say, <hi>Who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this;</hi> for you have heard that God does.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:42999:75"/>
2. Is there any unreasonableness or unrighteousness in the prescribing of it? Can you object against it as being unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and unrighteous? nay is it not most reasonable and righteous, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sinned and provoked God, you should consider, confess, humble, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it not that course that others with success have used? as <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12. 7, 12.</p>
            <p>Can you object, and say, others have taken this course to no purpose? <hi>Ahabs</hi> external humiliation was not without some success? The judgment was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon it, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. 29.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Have not others perished for want of taking this course: See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 12. of <hi>Zed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Can you now object, and say, others have neglected this course and done well enough?</p>
            <p>Thus you see you cannot object against this course.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Can you think of a better, a safer course? Can you, or you, or you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> speak if you can; by your silence I take it for granted that you cannot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:42999:75"/>
Thirdly, If you cannot, are you resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon this? To consider, confess, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, If you be not resolved on this course as yet; must I dismiss you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved and desperate as they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. will you say as they, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. &amp; 18. 12.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Lord,</hi> God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; we must not leave out any of the Three, for we cannot be without the Presence of any one of them; nor can you have the Presence of the one without the Presence of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for these three are one, and where One is All are. Of the Fathers, and of the Sons, and of the Holy Ghosts coming to be with his People. You read <hi>Joh. 14. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus said, if a man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him,</hi> and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him. O for faith to believe this! that the Father and the Son will come and


<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42999:77"/>
make their abode with such. Whosoever goes from you, you may be sure the Father and Son will come, <hi>if you love him and keep his words,</hi> See verse 23. And for the coming of the Holy Ghost See Joh. 15. 16. <hi>I will pray the Father,</hi> saith Christ (Here's a praying friend, and praying friends we use to say are our best friends) <hi>and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit of Truth,</hi> verse 17. That he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with you for ever, mark that; when he comes, he will not be like a wayfaring man that comes for a night, and then is gon, but he will abide for ever: when I came down from Heaven, I came with a purpose to return again, when I had done my work here, but this Comforter, my Spirit, shall abide with you for ever. Well then the Lord be with you, the Father Son and Holy Spirit be with you, the eternal Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, who hath his being of himself, and gives being to all things else, even the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of performance to his promises; This Lord be with you, Be with your whole man, This Lord be with your Bodies, This Lord be with your Souls, This Lord be with every part of your Bodies, and with every Power of your Souls. The


<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42999:78"/>
Apostle in his former epistle, praying for these <hi>Thessalonians.</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 23. Prayes thus, <hi>The very God of Peace sanctify you wholly, and I pray God your whole Spirit, and Soul and Body be preserved blameless, unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> So then the Apostle would have the Lord <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o be with their whole man, not with a part of it, not with their Souls and Spirits only, or Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies only, but with their Spirit Soul and Body: and the same Apostle praying for <hi>Timothy,</hi> prayes, <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy Spirit,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 22. It matters not who are absent, so Christ be present; his presence is more, then the presence of the nearest and dearest relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Lord be with you all, not only with a part of you, I know not which of you to leave out of my Prayers: For you all have need of Gods presence, whether you be Saints or Sinners. If Sinners, you have need of the Lord to be with you, to convince you and convert you. And as for those that are Saints, I know none that have so much grace that they need no more, the Lord therefore be with them, to establish, confirm, and encrease grace in them; the Lord be with you at all times. If God be absent at any time, we know


<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42999:78"/>
not what to do. Some of you have had experience, that when God hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn never so little, your case hath been bad enough. The Lord be with you in all places. We can be secure and safe in no place without his presence.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you in all conditions, in all estates; for if you be in the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous estate, you cannot tell how to be without God. <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> thought so, 2. Chron. 20. 12. <hi>In the fulness of a mans sufficiency he may be in straights.</hi> Job 20. 22. You cannot be any where, in any estate, a minute without him. You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to be a Truth, <hi>that in him you live, move, and have your being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. not naturally only, but spiritually too. The Lord therefore be with you at all times, in all conditions, in sickness and in health, in peace and in trouble, in all Adversity and in all Prosperity. The Lord be with you with all kind of Aids, Helps, and Assistances, variety of Aids and Assistances we need. This is the sence and meaning of this vale dictory Prayer, the Lord be with you all. The observation that I shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you, is this,</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>God with us is a priviledge great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be desired, and much to be prayed for.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:42999:79"/>
The Apostle makes this Prayer for the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> whom he dearly loved, who were <hi>his hope and joy, and Crown of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,</hi> 1 Thes. 2. 19. Could he have thought of a greater mercy, he would have wisht it to them. In speaking to this great Truth, I shall shew,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is a presence of God with his people.</p>

            <p n="4">4. The reasons of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And after this apply it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a presence of God with his people. I speak not of the general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, whereby he is not far from every one of us, Act. 17. 27. <hi>For in him we live, move, and have our being:</hi> v. 28. not only as we had our being from him at first, but we have our being in him, as the Beam has its Being in the Sun. Of this presence of God you read <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. from which there is no fleeing, v. 7. <hi>he is every where,</hi> v. 8, 9, <hi>I fill Heaven and Earth</hi> saith the Lord, Jer. 23. 24. and Isa. 66. 1. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my Throne, and the Earth my foot stool.</hi>


               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:42999:79"/>
This general presence of God, if seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously considered, and believingly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, would be of great use. But 'tis the special presence of God that I am to speak to, his favourable and gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, such as that wished and desired by <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons of old, Num. 6. 24, 25, 26. <hi>The Lord bless thee, and keep thee, the Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee, the Lord lift up his Countenance upon thee, and give thee peace.</hi> This blessing is saith <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apostle 2 Cor. 13. 14. <hi>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all.</hi> Thus the first branch of the blessing v. 24. <hi>The Lord bless thee and keep thee,</hi> implieth the love of the Father.</p>
            <p>The second branch v. 25. <hi>The Lord make his face shine upon thee, and be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto thee,</hi> implieth the grace of the Son.</p>
            <p>And the third branch, <hi>The Lord lift up his Countenance upon thee, and give thee peace,</hi> implieth the communion with the Holy Ghost.

of the Lord which is so great a priviledge, and so much to be desired.

If you had no Dross, you would need no Fire. If you had no Dirt, you would need no washing. If no Rust, you would need no File, and if no Chaff you would need no Flail. If no Folly, you would need no Rod. But seeing you have Dross, Dirt, Rust and Chaff not a little, Is it not best for the Gold to be refined, and best for the Dirt and Filth to be washed out, and for the Chaff to be fann'd away, and for the Rust to be scoured off?

            <p>First, The Devil is with you, and he is with you as a roaring Lion, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 18. ready to tear you in pieces, and none but God can deliver you: What will you do when the Devil is with you, if God be not with you to help you? Whither will the Devil drive you, if God do not stop him? If God do not stand in the way, and hedge up the way with thornes? How did the Swine run when the Devil did enter into them, they stopt not till they were choaked and drowned in the Sea. What work will the Devil make, if God be not with us to deliver us? What work did he make with our first Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 1. and with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 Chron. 21. 1. and with <hi>Judas, John</hi> 13. 2, 27.

It was with <hi>Gehazi,</hi> and what work it made with him, see 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 22. It made him tell lye upon lye: and all this for want of Gods presence with them.

Thus you comfort your selves in the want of some things, with the presence of some other.

How near may the Mother be, when the Child thinks her lost, and falls a crying? And all this while the Mother is but in the next room. Thus it is between God and his People; Christ withdraws from his Spouse, yet is really present; for by vertue of his presence she seeks after him till she has found him; if he had not been present, she could not have sought him: for if he draw not, there is no running after him. <hi>Draw me, and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. Pray then for the presence of God, let God see that you will not be satisfied without him: How unsatisfied are some without Persons and Things? They must enjoy such a Person,


<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42999:101"/>
such a Thing, or they cannot be satisfied: They cannot live, they shall dye without them. Let God see that you cannot live without his presence. If you long for it, you shall not long be without it.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 11. Pray continually. This pleases God. <hi>The prayer of the upright is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,</hi> Prov. 15. 8. 'Tis <hi>sweet unto him,</hi> Cant. 2. 14. <hi>He will be nigh to them that call upon him in truth,</hi> Psal. 145. 18. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>'s praying pleased God; as appears by the event. <hi>Prayers come up for a me norial before God,</hi> Acts 10. 4. God is so well pleased with prayer, that he will never turn it away, <hi>Psal.</hi> 66. 20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 12. Meditate on Gods Law day and night. Shew thy love to God and it thereby, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 97. <hi>O how I love thy Law, it is my meditation all the day.</hi> Let it be yours also, and God will make you like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season, and whose leaf shall not wither, and whatsoever you do shall prosper, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 13. Worship God in spirit and in truth: Sure this is pleasing to him; for <hi>the Father seeketh such to worship him,</hi> Joh, 4. 23. He is greatly delighted with such worship. <hi>God loveth the gates of Zion more then all the dwellings of Jacob,</hi> Psal. 87. 2.


<pb n="207" facs="tcp:42999:109"/>
The gates of <hi>Zion,</hi> the place of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, which he had chosen to dwell in, more then all the Towns and Cities else which he had given <hi>Jacob</hi> to dwell in. 'Tis not all worship that God is so delighted with; some worship is an abomination to him. God complains of those that draw nigh to him with their mouths, when their hearts are far from him, <hi>Isa. 29. 13. Mat.</hi> 15. 8. 'Tis the heart God calls for, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 26. and truth in the inward parts, that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 6. 'Tis worship in spirit and truth that pleases God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 14. Love God heartily, and seek him early. God loves them that love him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 17. and will shew it, <hi>John 14. 21, 23. He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest my self to him, and we will come and make our abode with him.</hi> Obedience to this first and great command of loving God, is more then all whole burnt offerings and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, <hi>Mark</hi> 12. 33. Therefore for certain it pleases God. <hi>Delight thy self in the Lord, and he will give thee the desires of thy heart, Psal.</hi> 37. 4. And let the desire of thy soul


<pb n="208" facs="tcp:42999:110"/>
be to his name, and to the remembrance of him. With thy spirit seek him early, <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 8, 9. and he will be found of thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 15. Fear God greatly, as <hi>Obadiah</hi> did, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 3. On such the Sun of righteousness will shine, <hi>Mal. 4. 2. The Lord will fulfil the desires of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them,</hi> Psal. 145. 19.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 16. Chuse to suffer rather then to sin. This was <hi>Moses</hi>'s choice, <hi>Heb. 11. 25. rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</hi> This pleaseth God highly. Those three servants of the most high God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. who did chuse to burn to ashes, rather then to bow to an Image, God was so well pleased with, that he restrained the fire from burning of them. <hi>Daniel</hi> chuses to be torn to pieces, rather then not to pray, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. and God was so well pleased with his choice, that he shuts the mouths of the Lions, that they hurt him not, <hi>v.</hi> 22. God also was so well' pleased with the Martyrs choyce of sufferings rather then of sinning, that he so wrought for many of them; that they felt little or no pain. <hi>Baynam;</hi> one


<pb n="209" facs="tcp:42999:110"/>
of our English Martyrs, in the midst of flames, with arms and legs half consumed, uttered these words; <hi>O ye Papists! behold, ye look for miracles; here now ye may see a miracle: for in this fire I feel no more pain, then if I were in a Bed of Down; but it is to me as a Bed of Roses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 17. Get a meek and a quiet spirit: This is in the sight of God an ornament of great price, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. But a froward heart is an abomination to God, <hi>Prov. 11. 20. Moses</hi> had this commendation, that he was very meek above all the men which were upon the face of the earth, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 3. God takes his part, and appears for him, <hi>Num. 12. 2, 4. Moses.</hi> is deaf and dumb, but God hears and calls suddenly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the wrong done to <hi>Moses.</hi> And what a good end did God make with patient <hi>Job? Jam.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 18. Be zealous, hot, fervent in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, serving the Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. God cannot away with lukewarmness: luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm <hi>Laodicea</hi> he loaths, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. but zealous <hi>Phineas</hi> he loves, <hi>Num. 25. 11, 12, 13.

<pb n="211" facs="tcp:42999:111"/>
for sin. This heat in duty, will please God.</p>
            <p>Do justly. This pleases God, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8. more then thousands of Rams. To do judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and justice, to judge the cause of the poor and needy, is the way to have it be well with us, <hi>Jer.</hi> 22. 15, 16. The just and rtghteous God hates injustice, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8. 17. Doing justice and judgment, is the way of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. And sure he is well pleased with those that walk in his way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 20. Love mercy. This also pleases God. To do good and communicate, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not; for with such sacrifice God is well pleased, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. 'Tis an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. Christ is so well pleased with it, that he takes it as done to himself, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 34, 35, 36. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, shewing no mercy, he takes so ill, that he threatens, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 13. He shall have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 21. Walk humbly. To such an one God will look, <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 2. yea, God will dwell with the humble, and revive the humble, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15. God resisteth the


<pb n="210" facs="tcp:42999:111"/>
proud, but giveth grace to the humble, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 6. And if he give them grace, sure he will give them glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 22. Be fruitful in every good work. This pleases God. The earth that brings forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing from God, <hi>Heb. 6. 7. I am come into my Garden, my Sister, my Spouse:</hi> Now there is such pleasant fruit there, I cannot keep away. He is so well pleased with the fruit he finds, that he gathers, eats and drinks, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
            <p>A fruitful Vine pleaseth the Dresser.</p>
            <p>A fruitful Tree the Planter.</p>
            <p>A fruitful Field the Husbandman.</p>
            <p>And a fruitful Christian pleaseth God much more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dir.</hi> 23. Be thankful. This pleaseth the Lord, <hi>Psal. 69. 30, 31. I will praise the name of the Lord with a song, and will mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie him with thanksgiving.</hi> v. 30. <hi>This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so shall please the Lord better then an Oxe or Bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</hi> v. 31. This rendring the Calves of our lips, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 2. is very pleasing to God, when offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by Christ. By him therefore let us of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is the fruit of our lips, giving thanks


<pb n="212" facs="tcp:42999:112"/>
to his Name, <hi>Heb. 13. 15. He that offereth praise, glorifieth me,</hi> saies God, <hi>Psal</hi> 50. Alwaies provided that the praise be cordial and real, as well as oral; provided that there be estimation of benefits, and retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution for them, as well as recognition of them.</p>
            <p>And now beloved, I must take my leave of you, and what more or better can I wish or desire for you then this gracious presence of God. The Lord be with you all. The Lord be with you little children, and incline your hearts to learn <hi>Solomons</hi> lesson which his father taught him, 1 <hi>Chron. 28. 9. viz. To know the God of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the thoughts,</hi> if you seek him, he will be found of you, but if you forsake him, he will cast you off for ever: and for this end, The Lord be with you, and incline your hearts whilst you are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to know, as <hi>Timothy</hi> did from a Child, the Holy Scriptures, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15. and perswade you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue


<pb n="213" facs="tcp:42999:112"/>
in the things which you have learned, and have been assured of, knowing of whom you have learned them, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you young men, and incline your hearts to remember your Creatour in the dayes of your youth, as you are commanded, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 1. and to be kind to him in your youth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 2. that he may another day say to you, <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the kindness of your youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord be with you to be the guide of your youth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 4. and to teach you from your youth, as he did <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 71. 17.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you, that you may with <hi>Obadiah</hi> fear the Lord from your youth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 12. and that you may flee youthful lusts, as you are commanded, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 22.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you, and be your hope and trust from your youth, as he was <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids, Psal.</hi> 71. 5. and make you sober minded, as you are exhorted to be, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you, and cause you to grow up as plants in your youth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 144. 12. That you may never complain, as <hi>Job</hi> chap. 13. 26. <hi>Thou hast made me possess the sins of my youth.</hi> And that you may not be forced to pray as <hi>David, Remember not


<pb n="214" facs="tcp:42999:113"/>
against me the sins of my youth,</hi> Psal. 25. 7. <hi>nor lie down in shame because of the sins of your youth,</hi> as they, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 25. and that in your age, you may not find <hi>your bones full of the sins of your youth,</hi> Job 20. 11.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you Aged men, to make you sober, grave, temperate, to make you sound in the faith, sound in charity, in patience, as you are taught to be, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you young women, to make you such as you are taught to be, <hi>Tit. 2. 4. viz.</hi> Sober, and to love your Husbands, and your children, and to be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to your own Husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed, and that your Husbands beholding your chaste con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation coupled with fear, may be won by it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1, 2.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you and deliver you from all unchaste thoughts, words, and actions, and make you careful to preserve your own and your neighbours chastity in heart, speech, and behaviour. This prayer for you is not without need; too much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaste behaviour is to be seen in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations. I cannot think that the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of your naked backs and breasts to the


<pb n="215" facs="tcp:42999:113"/>
view of all, can consist with chastity of heart. I wish that some or other would do that office for you, that <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth</hi> did for their father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 23. and cast at least a Scarf or Handkerchief over your naked necks, backs and breasts.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you aged women, that you may be such as you are required to be, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 3. That you may be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, Teachers of good things.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you widowes, to cause you to trust in God, as 'tis your duty, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49. 11. and continue in prayer and supplications night and day, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 5.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you Parents, That you may bring up your children <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> Ephes. 6. 4. and <hi>that you may not provoke them to anger lest they be discouraged,</hi> Col. 3. 21.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you Children, that you may <hi>obey your Parents in the Lord, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them, that it may be well with you, and that you may live long in the earth,</hi> Ephes. 6. 1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you Masters, that you may give unto your Servants, that which


<pb n="216" facs="tcp:42999:114"/>
is just and equal, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 1. and forbear threatning, <hi>knowing that your Master also is in Heaven, neither is there respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons with him,</hi> Ephes. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you Servants, that you may <hi>be obedient to them that are your Masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as unto Christ, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,</hi> Ephes. 6. 5, 6. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the Inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
            <p>Yea, the Lord be with you, that you may <hi>be subject not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward: for this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, if for conscience towards God, you endure grief, suffering wrong fully; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God, if when you do well, and suffer for it, you take it patiently,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you Husbands, that you may <hi>love your wives, and not be bitter against them,</hi> Col. 3. 19. <hi>And that you may dwell with them according to knowledge, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving honour unto them, as unto the weaker vessels, and as being heirs together of the


<pb n="217" facs="tcp:42999:114"/>
grace of life, that your prayers be not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 7.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you wives, <hi>that you may be in subjection to your own husbands; that if any obey not the word, they may be won by your conversation, while they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear; and that your adornin<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g may not be with outward adorning, of plaiting the hair, and of wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gold, or of putting on of apparel, but that it may be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of God is of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>The Lord be with you poor: (and my request for you is double.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. That you may be <hi>poor in spirit,</hi> and so blessed, that yours may be the kingdom of heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 3.</p>

            <p>The Lord be with you old Disciples, that you may <hi>bring forth much good fruit, and be fat and flourishing,</hi> Psal. 62. 14.</p>
