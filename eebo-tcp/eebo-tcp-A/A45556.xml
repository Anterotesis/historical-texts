            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Finally, no such characters of Ethical vertues, sound rules of State-po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, choice precepts for Oeconomical practice, as these holy lines afford. Astronomy the Queen of Mathematicks, Logick and Rhetorick the chief of Arts, yea both natural and moral Philosophy may by an intelligent Reader be found graven up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Bible in their several characters: One of these, to wit, Moral Philosophy in the Oeconomical part of it, is that which our Apostle teacheth in the close of this Epistle.

Before I enter upon the Text it will be needful to take a little notice of the context, the connexion which these words have with the preceding, and that is implied in the particle which begins the Verse, <hi>Nevertheless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed because the Apostle in these words concludes his former argumentation, <hi>Beza</hi> renders it <hi>it aque, therefore,</hi> as if <note place="margin">Initio versiculi non converti <gap reason="foreign">

That Marriage is nearest to the primitive institution, surest of divine Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is only between two persons, who thus united are here called <hi>Husband and Wife:</hi> and so much be spoken of the Relations.

            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:44917:6"/>
               <hi>Obligations laid upon them,</hi> These are summed up by the Apostle in two words, and those may very well be exprest in two Monosyllables <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Fear; that,</hi> the Sugar to sweeten all the duties of authority belonging to the man; <hi>this,</hi> the salt to season all the duties of subjection belonging to the wife. <hi>Both,</hi> the marks which they must severally shoot at in all their carriages and behaviours one towards another.</p>
            <p>The mans duty is set down first, and indeed fit it is the man should be first in the practice of his duty: precedency cals for presidency, priority of place priority of duty; the inferiours are best encouraged to do their part when they that are above them become exemplary to them in performing theirs: the man would be accounted, nay indeed is, superiour to the wife; but then he must go before her in a good example; that by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his she may be animated in performance of her duty.</p>
            <p>In the duty of the man there are three things worthy our Observation.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. The quality of the act, <hi>Love.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. The propriety of the object, <hi>his wife.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. The energy of the rule upon which it's grounded, by which it's measured, so <hi>as himself.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, The <hi>act</hi> required is <hi>Love,</hi> in the handling whereof I shall endeavor to resolve a double <hi>Quaery,</hi> namely,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>Why</hi> this duty is particularly mentioned.</item>
               <item>2. <hi>Wherein</hi> the practice of it consists.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. It's a Question not unfitly moved, why the Apostle makes choice of <hi>Love,</hi> to express the mans duty by, since there are many duties which the man oweth to the wife as well as love? To which I answer, That it is not without speciall reason both in regard of the present <hi>fitnesse</hi> and the comprehensive <hi>fullnesse</hi> of this duty of <hi>Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>fitnesse</hi> of expressing the mans duty here by <hi>Love</hi> will appear, whether you looke <hi>backward</hi> or <hi>forward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Apostle a little before cals upon the Wives to <hi>submit.</hi> Now indeed that which belongs to the man in most direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to submitting, is governing, but men are apt enough to exercise their authority without bidding, and besides, this
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44917:7"/>
was already implyed in the womans duty of submitting; let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that go therefore he rather chooseth to call upon the man for <hi>Love,</hi> both because that men are most apt to be defective in this, and likewise that this will teach them how to use their authority. For though it is not love but fondnesse which <note place="margin">In ea sope defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimus licet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini satis stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diosi. <hi>Aret.</hi> in loc. Rigorem virilis Legis emollit, neu potestate quae praevalet nimius quis sit in dominatu uxoris. <hi>Amb. in Col.</hi> 3. 19.</note> makes a man forget himself, and that power God hath given him over the Wife, yet true Love will learn him to exercise this power sparingly, mildely, and affectionately. It is too often seen that men because of their superiority insult over their Wives, and why this? but for want of Love; no marvel if authority degenerate into Tyranny where this Moderator is absent; for this cause it is that the Apostle supposeth the power of governing, and requires Love as <hi>potestatis tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that which should temper and moderate the use of that power.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the following clause S. <hi>Paul</hi> mindes the <hi>Wife of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> and therefore the Man of <hi>Love,</hi> to intimate that his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Oecum. <hi>ibid.</hi>
               </note> of Love is the best way to gain reverence from the Wife, in which respect the <hi>Scholiast</hi> saith excellently, <hi>If thou wouldst have thy Wife to reverence thee, do thou love her.</hi> To force a fear from the Wife by an austere, churlish, and surly carriage, is that which neither befits the Husbands place to exact, nor the Wives to yield: the Woman must be not drawn but led, not forced but wooed unto her duty by Love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As this duty of Love was the most <hi>fit</hi> to be here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, so is it the most <hi>comprehensive</hi> of all other duties; so that in naming this he implies all the rest. What the Greek O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator answered when asked what was the chief thing: in an <note place="margin">Demosth.</note> Orator, first <hi>action,</hi> secondly <hi>action,</hi> thirdly <hi>action,</hi> the like may be returned to any that shall enquire what is the prime duty of an Husband, first <hi>affection,</hi> secondly <hi>affection,</hi> thirdly <hi>affection;</hi> And as Love in general is said by the Apostle to be <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 10.</note> the <hi>fulfilling of the Law,</hi> in which respect it is fitly resembled to <hi>Davids Instrument of ten strings,</hi> and wittily called <hi>a good Catholick,</hi> so Love in particular is the fulfilling of that Law wherein the duty of the man to the wife is required, which that it may the better appear passe we on to the</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:44917:7"/>
2. <hi>Quest.</hi> Namely, Wherein the exercise of this Love con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists; To resolve which we must consider it in its Antecedent, Concomitants and Consequents.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Antecedent</hi> of this Love is a due estimation of the Wife. Judgement is the source and spring of affection from which it proceeds, and according to which it is proportioned; what the mind esteems not the heart affects not, whereas what we highly prize we dearly love. The Love then of a man to his wife supposeth in him a singular accompt and an high valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her. Thus every man ought to esteem of his wife as <hi>donum Dei,</hi> God's gift, and that choice and precious, such a present as the whole world cannot afford him the like. And yet more particularly the man ought to look upon his Wife under that notion which was the special end of God's giving her, namely, as an <hi>help meet for</hi> and sutable to him.</p>
            <p>The Wife since the fall is appointed for three ends, <hi>ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medium, ad sobolem, in adjutorium,</hi> for a remedy against for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, for the procreation of Children, and for helpful communion; this last was no doubt the first in divine intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so ought to be in the mans apprehension. He that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a wife only as a remedy will love her but as men do phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, for use, yea, for meer necessity. He that marrieth onely for posterity will love her as a Mother not as a Wife. He onely can rightly love a Wife who looketh upon her, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taketh her for a oke-fellow and companion. The right esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation then of a Wife is to account her as next to himself, and <note place="margin">Non es dominus sed maritus, non ancillam sed uxorem sortitus es, &amp; guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torem te voluit esse Deus mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris sexus, non praepotentem. <hi>Amb Hexam.</hi> lib 5. cap. 7. <hi>Psa.</hi> 128. 3.

                  </gap> Conjug.</note> so above either children or servants. Thus the <hi>Father</hi> willeth the man to consider, that by Marriage he becomes not a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> but an <hi>Husband,</hi> and taketh not an <hi>Handmaid</hi> but a <hi>Wife;</hi> In this respect the Psalmist comparing the Wife to a <hi>Vine,</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth her <hi>by the sides of his House,</hi> not <hi>in fastigio</hi> on the top of an House, nor <hi>in pavimento</hi> by the floor of an house, but <hi>in late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus</hi> by the sides of the House, a middle place between both: <hi>Lateribus sibi junguntur qut pariter ambulant,</hi> they that go by our sides are our companions, such is the wife to the man, and so ought to be in his esteem. Indeed the formation of woman out of mans rib clearly represents this truth. On the one hand she was not made of the Head, and therefore not <hi>domina,</hi> she
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44917:8"/>
must not rule over the Husband; nor yet of any anterior part, and therefore not <hi>praelata,</hi> she must not be before the Husband: On the other hand she was not made of the foot, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not <hi>serva,</hi> to be kept under as a servant; nor yet of any hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der part, and therefore not <hi>postposita</hi> to be put behind as a child; but she was made of a rib in his side, and therefore <hi>socia,</hi> to be esteemed and used as a fellow-helper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Concomitants</hi> or ingredients of this Love are desire <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">

The Moralists distinguish of a double Love, to wit, <hi>amor benevolentiae</hi> and <hi>amor complacentiae,</hi> a love of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, whereby we heartily wish and accordingly endeavour the good of another, a Love of complacency whereby we are well pleased and satisfied in the enjoyment one of another. Both of these make up the mans Love to his Wife, namely a cordial desire of her welfare, and an affectionate delight in her society. The most proper act of Matrimonial Love is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency, <note place="margin">Pro. 5. 18. Deut. 13. 6. Ezek. 24. 16.</note> in which respect this Loving is called elsewhere a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing,</hi> and the Wife is called <hi>the Wife of the bosome, the desire of the eyes.</hi> The bosome is a place of repose, and the things we put in our bosomes are such as we take delight in; for this cause <hi>Christ</hi> is said to be <hi>in the bosome of the Father,</hi> to note that it <hi>is</hi> 
               <note place="margin">John 1. 28. Mat. 3. 17. Joh. 13. 23. Joh. 20. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he in whom the Father is well pleased;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> is said <hi>to lean on Jesus bosome,</hi> because <hi>the Disciple whom Jesus loved,</hi> and in whose converse he was singularly delighted. <hi>The desire of the eyes</hi> is that which in the absence we long for, and the presence of which we behold with joy; So that both these expressions do plainly intimate what contentment and satisfaction the man ought to take in the converse and enjoyment of his Wife. And therefore it is <hi>Solomon</hi>'s counsel, <hi>Let thy Wife be to thee as the</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prov. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>Loving Hinde, and as the pleasant Roe,</hi> or according to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, an Hinde of Loves, a Roe of favours: the mates of those females are the Hart and the Roe-buck, which as Naturalists observe are of all other creatures the most inamored with <note place="margin">Diligendi vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabulum tum ad affectum sum ad effectum referre oportet. <hi>Daven.</hi> in <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 19.</note> their mates, to instruct the man what an affectionate wel-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse he should have with his wife.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Consequents</hi> of this Love are chiefly <hi>protection, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision,</hi> and <hi>Toleration;</hi> Love is ever active, being like the fire, which where it is sends forth light and heat. Indeed <hi>Exhibitio

operis probatio amoris,</hi> action is the most real proof of affection, only that love being true which is not <hi>otiosus</hi> but <hi>officiosus,</hi> in word but in deed: Thus the husbands love to his wife must manifest it self.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In protecting her to his power from injuries:</hi> it is the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists expression, <hi>Thou Lord wilt blesse the righteous, with favour wilt thou compasse him as with a shield.</hi> Love alwayes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves what ability it hath in being a shield to what it affects; <note place="margin">Psal. 5. 20.</note> so ought the husbands love to expresse it self in defending his wife from wrong. It is well observed that the rib of which woman was made, was taken from under the mans arm, to teach him, that as the use of the arm is to keep off blowes from the body, so the office of an husband is to ward off dangers from his wife. It is the speech of <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Boaz, Spread thy skirt over thine handmaid:</hi> The Hebrew word which we render skirt, <note place="margin">

Be pleased to consider a while in particular the contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties between the rule and mens practices; How many Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands have base and unworthy esteems of their wives, as if they were their drudges, being more kinde to their servants then them? Little better are they who with that Emperour imagine wife to be a name <hi>dignitatis</hi> not <hi>voluptatis,</hi> as if it <note place="margin">Aelius Verus.</note> were enough for wives that their Husbands vouchsafe to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them in marrying them, and in the mean time they may indulge themselves the licentious liberty of voluptuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with other women; whence it is their wives society is rather a burthen then a pleasure to them. No lesse justly are they to be condemned who prodigally consume that estate in riot and luxury by which their wives and family should be maintained with needful conveniences: Surely in such men <hi>Nec amor viget mariti nec fides Christiani,</hi> there is neither the faith of a Christian nor the love of an Husband. Finally, how deservedly are they to be blamed who put a sinister constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon all their wives actions? if she be devout, she is an hypocrite; if grave, she is melancholy; if chearful, she is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; if she stay at home, she is a drone; if she go abroad, a gadder; so that, nothing their wives doe can please them: whence it is that they are apt to quarrel with them <hi>de lanâ ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prinâ,</hi> upon every trifle, and are often enraged without any just occasion.</p>
            <p>By these and several other waies do men discover a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of this duty which our Apostle here calls for; but I wish that such would sadly consider how repugnant these courses are to Christianity, since what S. <hi>John</hi> saith in another case, I may no lesse truly say in this, <hi>If a man say I love God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi>

               </gap> (which is by some therefore made the Etymology of it) such a love whereby a man rests satisfied in the object loved; this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> requireth where he saith, <hi>Let her breasts</hi>

            <p>Oh far be this distemper from us: learn we therefore as to

refine our love that it be not sensual, so to confine it that it be not extravagant. It was the praise of <hi>Constantine</hi> that he was <hi>Juvenis Uxorius,</hi> though young, devoted in his love only to his Wife, let him be our pattern. The <hi>Ring</hi> given in Marriage is but <hi>one,</hi> to teach the man that his love must be singularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted to the person of the Wife. The truth is, that love which is as it were cut into many rivulets must needs run weakly, nay, he that giveth not all his love to his wife indeed giveth none at all; besides that is most true in this sense, <hi>Deus amat cor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensum</hi>

               <hi>non divisum,</hi> the Husbands love must be extended but not divided; <hi>a heart and a heart</hi> is hateful in God's sight, nor can such expect his benediction. It is well observed that in the beginning whilest the waters were over the earth, there was nothing but barrenness; but when they were gathered into one place, the earth brought forth fruits, and the Sea fishes: that love will be most fruitful, which is only setled upon the Wife, and therefore let this counsel be acceptable to all men; Cause the stream of thy affection to run in one channel, the lines of thy delight to meet in one center: Love as intirely as thou canst so it be thy own Wife, and so much the rather because she is <hi>thy self:</hi> which leadeth me to</p>

            <p>It is a <hi>question</hi> here moved by some, Why the Apostle having <note place="margin">Quest.</note> proposed so excellent a pattern already as that of <hi>Christ's</hi> love to his <hi>Church,</hi> should now add another of a far inferiour na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, our love to our selves; to which this <hi>answer</hi> is fitly returned.</p>
            <p>This pattern of self-love is annexed, not as if the other were <note place="margin">Answ.</note> not abundantly sufficient both to perswade and direct to the duty, but because this, as S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith excellently, is <note place="margin">Chrys. in loc.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a more domestick and familiar example. The love we bear to our selves is plainly felt and discerned by us; not so <hi>Christ's</hi> Love to his <hi>Church,</hi> it being <hi>a love which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth knowledge:</hi> every man knoweth how he loveth himself; <note place="margin">Eph. 3. 19.</note> only the spiritual man knoweth, and that but in a scant mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, how <hi>Christ</hi> loveth his <hi>Church:</hi> besides, our love to our selves as it is better known, so more easily imitated; whereas <hi>Christ's</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:44917:11"/>
love to his <hi>Church</hi> is both so transcendent in its own nature, and so far remote from our apprehension, that though we must follow after it, yet we may despair ever to come near it.</p>
            <p>But it may be further <hi>objected,</hi> Is not self-love a vice? are <note place="margin">Obj.</note> not those hypocrites branded for this among others, that <hi>they are Lovers of their own selves?</hi> how then comes it to passe that <note place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 2.</note> self-love is here set down as the rule of a mans love to his Wife?</p>
            <p>To which it is easily <hi>answered,</hi> That it is not self-love but the exorbitancy of it, which is elsewhere condemned as a vice, <note place="margin">Sol.</note> and it is not an inordinate but a regular self-love which is here commended as a rule. The first and primary object of our love is God himself, and as he is a superexcellent good, so our love to him must be a superlative love, such was <hi>David</hi>'s when he cried out, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire besides thee;</hi> not goods, nor children, <note place="margin">Psal. 73. 25.</note> nor wife, no nor self may be loved as God. Next to, and under God comes in self, there being nothing except God which can or ought to be dearer to a man then himself, this is that love by which in general the love to our neighbour, and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the love to the wife ought to be regulated; for so our Apostle here proposeth it, that a man should <hi>love his wife as himself.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This as in the Text may very well admit of a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, there is a <hi>sicut similitudinis</hi> and <hi>veritatis,</hi> an <hi>as</hi> of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and resemblance, and an <hi>as</hi> of verity and samenesse; both these may be here used, and accordingly it representeth two things in order to Conjugal love, namely, <hi>modum</hi> and <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum,</hi> the manner how, and the reason why the man should love his Wife.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The most proper and frequent acception of this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <hi>as,</hi> is only to note <hi>likeness,</hi> and thus the meaning is, that a mans love to his Wife should be like that he bears to himself, so that by tracing the similitude we shall learn much of the manner how this love is to be performed, and that in these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing parallels.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A mans love to himself is <hi>cordial</hi> without dissimulation. Though a man may seign amity to others, yet no man ever in

this kind dissembled with himself; such should a mans love be to his Wife; not an outside but an inside, not a feigned but a hearty love. The Poet calls love <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a fire that burns withinin; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith of friendship, That as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are hid in the bowels of the earth, so this must be seated in the bottom of the heart. And surely much more true ought this to be of the love between man and wife, who as they are <hi>one flesh,</hi> so should their hearts be joyned together in one, and as it was said of <hi>Jonathan that his soul was knit to David,</hi> so <note place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 1.</note> ought the soul of the Husband to the Wife.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ring</hi> in Marriage is put upon the fourth finger of the left hand, concerning which <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> acquaints us from <hi>Appion,</hi> that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in anatomizing mens bodies, observed <hi>ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum</hi>

            <p n="2">2. A mans love to himself is <hi>constant.</hi> No man in his right minde was ever brought to hate himself; such ought his love to be to his wife: not like <hi>Nero</hi>'s <hi>quinquennium,</hi> for a short time, a few years; but as long as the relation so long must the affection continue, even till death do part them. The <hi>Ring</hi> given in marriage is of a circular figure, and a circle is the image of constancy, to teach the man how perpetual his love should be. This latter will follow upon the former, since <hi>quos verus amor tenuit tenebit,</hi> that affection which is unfaigned will not be fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <note place="margin">Sen. Tract.</note> And yet more particularly, look as though a man see others stronger, healthier, handsomer then himself; yet he doth not therefore fall in love with them to slight himself, or wish his head upon their shoulders: So though other women be more beautiful and lovely then his own Wife, yet must he not dote on them and neglect her, or so much as wish an exchange. And yet further, as nothing can make a man to be out of love with himself though he be deformed or by some sad accident maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and debilitated; so neither ought any natural defect or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44917:12"/>
mischance cause a remission, much lesse a cessation of the mans love to his wife.</p>

Indeed I read of some who in stead of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse have been cruel to themselves in cutting and lancing, but they were either idolatrous, as <hi>Baal</hi>'s <hi>Priests,</hi> or <hi>Daemonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks,</hi>

The Husband indeed is to govern the wife, but <hi>consiliis non plagis,</hi> with counsels not stripes; neither divine nor humane Law intrusts the man with a power of castigation over his Wife; yea, the civil Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth her a Bill of Divorce, <hi>si probare possit maritum verberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus illam assecisse,</hi> if she have evidence that her Husband striketh <note place="margin">

            <p n="4">4. A mans love to himself is <hi>industrious,</hi> whilest his head is ever contriving and his hand acting what may do himself good; nor doth he account the greatest study or pains too much for his own advantage; nay, what is not a man willing to part with, lands, goods, all he hath for the preservation of himself? such ought his love to be to his Wife, parting with, going about any thing which may conduce to her comfort, and this not grudgingly but freely: Right Love is not in verbal Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment but real implement,; nor need beneficence be squeezed as wine out of the grape, but it floweth naturally from love as water from the fountain; thus doth the loving Husband pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44917:12"/>
his wives desire in seeking and endeavouring her good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The love of a man to himselfe is <hi>pure,</hi> not for base and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister ends, it is not himself as thus or thus accomplished, but purely himself that he loveth; such ought a mans love to be to his wife, not because she is rich, or young, or fair, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause she is his Wife. When <hi>Martia Cato's</hi> daughter was as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked why she did not marry, she answered, <hi>Non se invenire vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

               <hi>qui se magis veliet quam sua,</hi> she could not finde a man that would love her more then hers. I wish it might not be charged on too many men: they love only with their eyes and their fingers, because of the beauty they see in, or the money they receive with their wives; not with their hearts, out of an ingenuous or rather pious respect, to that relation of a Wife wherein they belong to them.</p>

               <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> such a fear as is joyned with trembling; whereas the wives fear is only so much as doth declare that the man is superiour; nor must it be of that nature as to cause a trembling at, but rather a delighting in her husbands presence; not such as maketh her to quake when she seeth him, but only keepeth her from rising up against, contradicting of, and insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting over him.</p>
            <p>To unfold more particularly both the intent and extent of this <hi>reverence,</hi> which is the wives debt to the Husband, be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to know that there is an inward and outward reverence due from all inferiours, and in special the wife; the intent of this fear wherein it consists, we shall finde in the inward; the

extent of it how far it reacheth, we shall see by the outward acts.</p>
            <p>The inward reverence carrieth in it an act both of the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the will; Of the judgement, dictating the Husbands superiority; of the will dreading to doe any thing which may displease him.</p>

            <p n="2">2. Nor is this all the ground of his superiority, since not only as man he is before the woman, but as an husband he is over the wife; and therefore as in respect of <hi>sex,</hi> so much more of <hi>relation</hi> and <hi>office,</hi> is the mans authority to be asserted. In <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 17. 1 Cor. 11. 3.</note> which regard those titles of <hi>head</hi> and <hi>guide</hi> are given to him: since what the <hi>guide</hi> is to the <hi>traveller,</hi> and the <hi>head</hi> to the <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> that is the <hi>Husband</hi> to the <hi>wife</hi> for <hi>direction</hi> and <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Indeed this truth is so clear in sacred Writ, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ignorance but arrogancy, want of sufficient informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but peremptoriness of pride that causeth in any a denial, or so much as a doubt concerning it. That pattern of women, <hi>Sarak,</hi> acknowledged this, when not out of a feigned flattery <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 6.

               </note> but a just humility she <hi>called her Husband Lord;</hi> and this is the first step of that reverence here commanded and commended to all the daughters of <hi>Sarah,</hi> that they cordially assent to the Husbands primacy and authority over them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this naturally floweth in the will an <hi>aversation</hi> from what offendeth her husband, whereby out of an awful respect to his power and place she dareth not displease him; yea, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of which she abhorreth it as the greatest evil next to the breach of God's precepts, to contradict her Husbands will. Hence it is that as the Apostles expression is <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:44917:15"/>
she taketh care, and that a serious thoughtful care which <note place="margin">Cor. 7. 34.</note> way she may please her Husband, so as it is her joy when she can give him content, and her grief when any thing falleth out that crosseth his will, and proveth distasteful to him. Thus as the iron is drawn by the Loadstone, the marigold openeth and shutteth with the Sun, and the glasse reflecteth the form and figure, the posture and motion of the body; so doth her will conform it self next under God's to her Husbands pleasure.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon both these followeth that outward reverence in her.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Gestures,</hi> When by her respectful carriage and observant demeanour towards him she testifieth her reverent regard of him: in token of this it was that <hi>Rebeccah</hi> when she saw <hi>Isaac, lighted of her camell, and covered her self with a Veil:</hi> this is <note place="margin">Gen. 24. 64: 65</note> that fear which S. <hi>Peter</hi> mindeth the Wives of in those words, <hi>Whilest they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear,</hi> it <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 2.</note> being such a fear he there calleth for which is exprest in their conversation; and that such as others may behold, to wit, in their reverent deportment towards their husbands. Thus as the <hi>Moon</hi> though when the <hi>Sun</hi> is absent she govern the world by her influence, yet when the <hi>Sun</hi> appeareth she veileth her light: So the <hi>wife</hi> though she be Ruler of the Family in her <hi>husbands absence,</hi> yet when he is present she must declare her reverence by giving place to him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Speeches,</hi> and that both <hi>to</hi> and <hi>of</hi> him; <hi>To</hi> him, when he is with her, fairly entreating, modestly answering, mildely perswading, humbly admonishing; and when occasion is, wisely forbearing to retort upon his passionate expressions. <hi>Of</hi> him, when he may be far from her, having the fear of him before her; and therefore not mentioning his name without respect, and avoiding any expressions which (though out of his hearing) may betray any contempt either of his person, or power, or place.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Actions,</hi> When her reverence of him causeth her willingly to doe what he requireth, and abstain from what he <note place="margin">Nunquam erit voluntaria sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectio nisi prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dat reverentia. <hi>Marlor.</hi> in loc.</note> forbiddeth. Indeed reverence is the rise of obedience, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience the best testimony of reverence: that subjection can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be voluntary which is not the effect of reverence; nor can that reverence be real which doth not put upon subjection. It
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44917:15"/>
is very observable in Scripture that the <hi>fear of God</hi> and <hi>keeping his Commandments</hi> are frequently joyned together, to intimate <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 29.</note> the inseparable connexion between them, since whoso <hi>feareth God</hi> cannot but <hi>keep Gods Commandments;</hi> and he cannot <hi>keep</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 12. 15.</note> 
               <hi>God's Commandments</hi> that doth not <hi>fear</hi> him: It is no lesse true in this of the wife to the Husband, who ought to manifest her fear of him by her obedience to his desires.</p>
            <p>And now beloved, I could wish there were not cause given by wives as well as men of a deserved accusation and a severe increpation. Indeed some kinde of <hi>fear</hi> is too prevalent in many women; nor are the men in this to be exempted, I mean <note place="margin">Sancti caeteros de suo affectu aestimant, &amp; quia ipsis est a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mica veritas mentiri nemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem putant, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benter credant quod ipsi sunt non possunt sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectum habere quod non sunt. <hi>Ambros.</hi> l. 3. de offic. 10.</note> a fear of <hi>suspicion</hi> and <hi>jealousie</hi> in regard of each others fidelity. A crime that for the most part is found in them that are guilty themselves: as charity prompts good men to think others are as faithful and just as themselves; so lust maketh evil ones sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise others to be as vicious and licentious as they. A sin which cannot but be an enemy to the duties here enjoyned, since jealousie must needs expel love out of the mans heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his wife, and hinder the woman from yielding that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verential fear she oweth to her husband. Finally, a fault which like envy carrieth with it its own punishments, guawing the bowels, distracting the thoughts, and tormenting the spirits of them who give entertainment to it: in which respect wise per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are unwilling to harbour it even when there may be too just ground and reason for it.</p>
            <p>But to return to the fear my Text calls for, though there be too much oft-times of that other, yet too little of this fear is to be found in most women: how true this charge is let the carelesse irreverent carriage of many wives testifie. <hi>Solomon</hi> in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> mentioneth, <hi>An eye that mocketh at his Father and despiseth to obey his mother:</hi> Indeed by the eye it is that the <note place="margin">Prov. 30. 17,</note> soul doth much expresse it self in mocking and despising, and there are too easily to be observed <hi>eyes</hi> that despise their <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands.</hi> Women of proud and scornful behaviour not only to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their Neighbours but Husbands. Nor are only the <hi>eyes</hi> but the <hi>tongues</hi> of many in fault, by reason of sharp, passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, presumptuous and impetuous speeches, whilest they speak either chidingly like <hi>Jezabel,</hi> railingly like <hi>Zipporah,</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44917:16"/>
scoffingly like <hi>Michol,</hi> or reproachfully like <hi>Job</hi>'s <hi>wife;</hi> nay, so little regard have they of their husbands, that they care not in discourse before others to divulge their faults, and (it may be) load them with calumnies: So that what <hi>Jacob</hi> saith to his sons <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> in regard of their cruel exploit, <hi>You have made we to stink amongst the Inhabitants of the Land,</hi> may <note place="margin">Gen. 34. 30.</note> many men say to their wives, <hi>You make me to stink amongst my neighbours and friends by your reviling words and opprobrious speeches;</hi> yea, to carry it on a little further, I would to God there were not a generation of women in the world who tread <hi>Antipodes</hi> to this duty, instead of fearing their Husbands they would make their Husbands stand in fear of them; whose stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is not to please but crosse their Husbands wills, who will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have the mastery, or wage a continual warre with them; Aspiring shoulders that will not content themselves to have a room below their head; Monsters of their sex inverting the order in which nature or rather the God of nature hath set them, as if the woman were not made for the mans comfort, but the man to be at the womans command.</p>
            <p>But I am perswaded better things of you, though I thus speak, only I beseech you accept a word of exhortation to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this duty. Our English Translation here supplieth a word <hi>see,</hi> which is not in the original; but yet it is implied in the <hi>

                  </gap> that she reverence,</hi> before which is supposed a verb that must signifie as much as <hi>see,</hi> let the wife look to it that she fear her husband. It is then a strict charge that is here laid upon the woman by the Apostle, give me leave from him to give it you. Have a care that this duty of fear be not omitted; it is not an arbitrary thing which you may doe or leave, but a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary work to be performed by you; I know you are ready to say with them in the Gospel, <hi>This is an hard saying, who can bear it?</hi> but be it never so hard in your apprehention, it is but just and right according to God's Ordination, and to repine at <note place="margin">John 6. 60.</note> it is no lesse then to murmure at God himself.</p>

In a word, let there be but a cordiall love in the wife to her husband, and this command of fear will not be grievous to her: as fear is the spring of subjection, so love is the rise of fear; in which respect the <hi>Scholiast</hi> saith fitly, <hi>if love be present, fear will follow after it and attend upon it;</hi> and as the mans love engageth him to honour and protect, so the wives will no lesse oblige her to fear and subjection.</p>
            <p>I shut up this, yea both the man and the womans part with one admonition to them both: As the one desireth to <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Wife,</hi> and the other to <hi>fear</hi> her <hi>Husband,</hi> let both strive to have the <hi>love and fear of God</hi> rooted in their hearts. It is very consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that <hi>fear God and the King</hi> are put together by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>fear God and honour the King</hi> by S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to intimate, that the former always inclines to the latter: the like I may say here, fear God and thy husband, fear God and honour thy wife, since he that is faithful in his duty to God, cannot but be careful of his duty to man. The Rabbins have observed, that if the word <gap reason="foreign">

It is, though very sad, yet too common for both sexes to plead ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses for their non-observance of these divine injunctions.

On the other hand many a Wife is ready to pretend, I could <hi>reverence</hi> my <hi>Husband</hi> were he not <hi>a mean person,</hi> one whose fortune hath been raised by my estate; not considering, that how <hi>superiour</hi> soever she were before, yet by <hi>marriage</hi> she becometh his <hi>inferior:</hi> And again, I could <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> him were he not a man <hi>of a debaucht, prophane and vicious life.</hi> Indeed I could wish that many men did not give too much occasion by their loose lives of that contempt they finde in the eyes not only of Wife, but servants; but still be the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band never so faulty, and his practices licentious, yet in respect of his <hi>place and relation,</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> oweth him <hi>reverence:</hi> the truth is, <hi>nemo excipitur,</hi> none is excepted, let none of either sex dare to exempt themselves.</p>

            <p>And so much the rather would this be considered in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent matter, because it is so frequent for both the Man and the <hi>Wife</hi> to <hi>excuse</hi> their own <hi>neglect</hi> by the others <hi>default.</hi> What <hi>apologies</hi> more usual then these? the <hi>Man</hi> saith, I could <hi>love</hi> my <hi>Wife</hi> did she <hi>reverence</hi> me; and the <hi>Wife</hi> I would <hi>reverence</hi> my <hi>Husband</hi> did he <hi>love</hi> me: both are ready to say, <hi>Let him do his, or she her duty, and I will doe mine.</hi> But oh how vain is this plea, since neither is the man only obliged in case the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man perform hers, nor the woman if the man perform his part, but both because God hath enjoyned each particular to fulfill their own work whatsoever the other doe. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent counsel to this purpose is that which a Greek Father giveth, where he puts the question and answers it, <hi>What if the Woman do not fear thee, yet do thou love her, and so perform thy part; and likewise the Woman though she be not beloved, yet let her reverence her Husband:</hi> Surely, as our blessed Saviour was used to say, <hi>it is better to give then to receive,</hi> so in this case it is better to pay then to require; if another fail in duty to thee it

               <hi>To end all:</hi> Though we must every one apply to our selves, yet we may every one exhort each other; the <hi>Husband</hi> the <hi>Wife,</hi> and the <hi>Wife</hi> (with a due regard) the <hi>Husband.</hi> Though our <hi>application</hi> must be <hi>peculiar,</hi> yet our <hi>supplication</hi> ought to be <hi>mutual;</hi> the <hi>Husband</hi> for the <hi>Wife,</hi> the <hi>Wife</hi> for the <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, both together</hi> that they may know and practise their duties.
