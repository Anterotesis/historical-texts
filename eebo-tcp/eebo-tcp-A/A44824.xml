            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO whom can the <hi>Tryal</hi> of <hi>Wits</hi> more properly belong, than to him that is every way qualified for one of the <hi>Tryers,</hi> if ſuch, as it is to be wiſh'd, were appointed by the State? And who has a better Right to judge of the ſeveral <hi>Differences</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> in Others, than
<pb facs="tcp:53763:3"/>
he who has firſt aſſembled and united them <hi>All</hi> in Himſelf?</p>
            <p>The Difference of Studies ſeems not greater, than the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Talents in Men that are framed for them: The <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> of a Logician lies not the ſame way with that of a good Grammarian, inſomuch that <hi>Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard, Ludovicus Vives</hi>'s Maſter, uſed to ſay, as his Scholar himſelf has told us, that the worſt <hi>Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marian</hi> would make the beſt <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gician</hi>: Nor are the Talents of a Linguiſt the ſame with thoſe of a Mathematician, as appeared in a Tryal of Skill between an Eminent Linguiſt, and a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician of no leſs Name, of our Own, <hi>Bryan Walton,</hi> Biſhop of

               <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Oughtred</hi> upon a mutual Agreement between them, that each ſhould teach the other his Skill. The Succeſs of which was no other than this, that tho' the Biſhop proceeded a great way in making Mr. <hi>Ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred</hi> a good Oriental Linguiſt, yet ſo far was the other in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from making the Biſhop a tolerable Mathematician, that he could never get hm to take out ſo plain a Leſſon as that in <hi>Euclide</hi> of <hi>ab Aequalibus, ſi dempſeris Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, manent Aequalia.</hi> And I find a late <note n="*" place="margin">Bartolus.</note>

Nor is the Diſproportion between ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Arts greater or more viſible, than even the Diſparity between ſeveral Parts of the ſame Art, of which, to ſay no more, this may ſuffice for Inſtance, which hath been obſerv'd by Painters, of Men of their own Profeſſion, that the greateſt Maſters in <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring,</hi> have rarely or ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved good <hi>Deſigners,</hi> and ſo on the contrary: Whether it be eaſier for Colours to meet and mingle, than to unite good Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring and Deſign in the ſame Picture; or whether it be that
<pb facs="tcp:53763:4"/>
Painters in this inherit the Fate of their own Colours, and that different Parts of their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will no more unite than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing and unſociable Colours, I leave to others to enquire. This only I take leave to ſay, that nothing is more ordinary than for that as well as other Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to abound with Pedants, and Men of narrow Spirits, whoſe Heads are filled with Images all of one Colour, whereas but few alas! (<hi>Sir</hi>) beſides Your ſelf, appear of ſo Univerſal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative a <hi>Genius</hi> and Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as the Light, which is alike Friendly and Impartial in the Viſits it makes, and the Colours it receives, diſdaining not to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend

            <p>More I might add, but that You poſſeſs another and a greater Quality of Light, which is the faireſt Thing in the World, and yet it ſelf knows nothing of it, as Your Excellences are only unknown to Your Self, at the ſame time as they Shine ſo Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to all the World of Your Admirers, and in particular to</p>

            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Here preſent you <hi>Examen de Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nios,</hi> made <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, whereas that which was done before, was from the <hi>Italian,</hi> which of it ſelf was but a Tranſlation. I ſhall ſay nothing in Diſparagement of the Old, or in Favour of this New Verſion. I queſtion not but that Gentleman did his Beſt, as I have now done mine; and I hope this Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Critical Age will kindly receive it, as being my Virgin-Eſſay; which may encourage me to proceed to teach ſome more <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Authors of great Wit and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (Strangers as yet to this Nation) ſoon to ſpeak our Tongue.</p>
            <p>Nor need I offer one Word in Behalf of this Excellent Book, becauſe it ſpeaks ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently for it ſelf it is well known among
<pb facs="tcp:53763:6"/>
the Learned, and was well received when firſt Writ, and is yet no leſs in Eſteem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt moſt Men of Letters.</p>
            <p>There have been no leſs than Five or Six ſeveral Editions of the Original, Three of the <hi>Italian,</hi> Ten or Eleven of the <hi>French,</hi> into which it was at two ſeveral times Tranſlated; as alſo Once into <hi>Latin,</hi> and as often into <hi>Dutch.</hi> If all this Proclaims not its Merit, at leaſt it ſpeaks its good Fortune, in the kind Reception this Book has met with in the World.</p>
            <p>Of this only I am to inform the Reader, that <hi>Huartes</hi> a few Years before he died, made ſome Additions to, and Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſeveral Places, entirely leaving out the Seventh, in the Old, and adding the Firſt, Second, and Fifth Chapters in the New Edition, with a large Supplement to the <hi>Proem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be no ſmall Advantage to this Kingdom (in Particular) and to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Learning (in General) if this Reformation were attempted, and put in Practice; for if there were <hi>Triers</hi> of
<pb facs="tcp:53763:6"/>
Wit appointed by the State, according to our Authors Propoſal, to watch the <hi>Genius</hi> of Children, in their first Appearances and Efforts, whether to make the Scrutiny as the Antients adviſed, by leading them to the Shops of Mechanics, and to chuſe Trades for them, according to the Tools they chuſe to Play with, or to deſcend ſo far as to obſerve their Childiſh Plays and Diverſions, wherein the Man is often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in Miniature. Thus <hi>Veſalius</hi> began in his Childhood to cut up Rats and Mice. <hi>Michael Angelo</hi> at the ſame Age to draw Figures, and <hi>Galen</hi> to make Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines.</p>
            <p>By theſe Means there would be fewer Dunces in the Univerſities, as well as fewer Bunglers in the Shops; not a few upon En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry in the Schools and Inns of Court would be ſent to take their Degrees in the Trades and Manual Arts; their Bodies being made for Labour, not their Minds; and their <hi>Genius</hi> ſuiting rather with ſuch Profeſſions, to require more good Shoulders and good Backs, than good Heads: Nor upon Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb facs="tcp:53763:7"/>
would there be found fewer in the Shops, fit to fill the Places of many Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duates in the Univerſities. And thus by this mutual Tranſplantation, in the end, the Univerſities might be ſupplied with abler Profeſſors from the Shops, and the Shops again in Return, ſtored with better Artiſts from the Univerſities. Were this Care duly taken to prevent the Miſmatching Men and Profeſſions, what ſurer and more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Way could be opened, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Learning, and the Flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trade at once?</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but I ſhall detain you no longer from the Work it ſelf, not doubting in the leaſt but you will be not a little pleaſed and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Curious and Uncommon No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this <hi>Spaniard.</hi> And that you may be ſo, has been the Endeavour of,</p>

            <p>TO the end that the Works of all Artiſts may attain the utmoſt Pitch of Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and be of the greateſt uſe to the Common-Wealth, it ſeems very Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that by a Law it ſhould be provided, that the Carpenter ſhould not interfere with the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, nor the Weaver with the Architect, nor yet the Lawyer play the Phyſician, nor the Doctor the Advocate, but that each ſhould ſtick cloſe to the Profeſſion moſt agreeable to his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and let the reſt alone. For conſidering how ſhort and limited the Wit of Man is to one thing and no more; I have been always of Opinion, that no Man could underſtand two Arts perfectly well, without proving defective in one of them: And that accordingly none might err in the Choice of that which was moſt agreeable to the Bent of his Natural Inclination, there ſhould be <hi>Triers</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the State, Men of approved Sagacity and Knowledge, to ſearch and found the Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Youth, and after due Search, to oblige them to the Study of that Science their Heads lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt to, inſtead of abandoning them to their own Choice. Whence would proceed in Your Majeſty's Kingdoms and Dominions, the moſt ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Artiſts in the World, as well as the moſt
<pb facs="tcp:53763:8"/>
Accompliſh'd Works, by this way of ſuiting Art and Nature. I would have the ſame thing Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in all the Univerſities in Your Kingdoms, ſeeing they allow not the Student to proceed to another Faculty till he be firſt well entred in the Latin Tongue; for even there ſhould alſo be <hi>Triers,</hi> to diſcover if he that deſigned to Study Logic, Philoſophy, Phyſic, Theology, or the Law, had a <hi>Genius</hi> adapted to each of thoſe Sciences; if not (beſides the detriment accruing from ſuch a one to the State, exerciſing a Profeſſion he is inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of) 'twould be a ſhame to ſee a Man ſlave and beat his Brains for a thing impoſſible ever to be extracted thence. And for want of ſuch Caution at this day, the Chriſtian Religion is in danger by Pretenders to Divinity, who want proper <hi>Genius</hi>'s for it; nay, unskilful Phyſicians have deſtroyed Mens Bodies; nor has the Skill of the Law arrived at that Pitch it ought, for want of knowing to what Rational Faculty the Uſe and true Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Laws belong. All the Antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers have found by Experience, that where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſpoſes not a Man for Knowledge, 'tis in vain for him to labour in the Rules of the Art. But not one of them has clearly and diſtinctly declar'd what that Nature is, which renders a Man fit for one, and unfit for another Science, nor what difference of Wit is obſerved among Men, nor what Arts and Sciences are moſt ſuitable to each Man in particular, nor by what Marks they may be diſcern'd, which is of the greateſt Importance. Theſe four Points (tho' ſeemingly impoſſible) are contained in the Matter here treated of, beſides many other that by the by fall in with this Doctrin, to the intent that curious Fathers may learn the Art and Secret of diſcovering Wit in their Children, and know how
<pb facs="tcp:53763:8"/>
to apply to each the Science in which he ſhall moſt Excel; which Caution <hi>Galen</hi> reports his Father uſed towards him, when a Child, being of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That the Scholar who takes pains in a Science with which his <hi>Genius</hi> and Natural Inclination ſuits not, makes himſelf a Slave to that Science.

            <p>
               <hi>PLATO</hi> pickt out the nimbleſt Witted Scholars he had, whenever he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to advance any grave, ſubtil, and uncommon Doctrin, and to ſuch only he imparted his Sentiments; being taught by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it would be but Time thrown away, piercing empty Nodels in vain, and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitleſly ſquandred, in communicating ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Matters to incapable Blockheads. The next thing he did (after ſuch a Choice) was to prepare them by certain Suppoſitions in themſelves clear, true, and not wide of the Concluſion: Becauſe Sayings and Sentences ſtarted on a ſudden, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the receiv'd Opinion, at firſt, ſerve to no other purpoſe (ſuch precaution not being uſed) but to confound and perplex the Auditors, to loſe their Favour, and make them diſtaſte the Doctrin. The ſame Method (Curious Reader) would I take with you, if you could by any manner of means before-hand penetrate into and diſcover to me alone, what kind of <hi>Genius</hi> Your's is: For if it be ſuited to this Doctrin, I would diſtinguiſh you from Common Wits, and privately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to you, ſuch new and ſingular Opinions, as were never once thought of, nor ever entered
<pb facs="tcp:53763:10"/>
Man's Imagination. However this not being to be done (our Work appearing in Public to all the World) it is impoſſible but I muſt needs leave you ſomewhat Surprized; for if your's is a common and Vulgar Wit, I doubt not but you are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Number and Perfection of the Sciences has been by the Antients long ſince determined, guided by a vain Reaſon, that ſince they could find out nothing more to ſay, 'tis a ſign that there is nothing new; and if you happen to have ſuch Sentiments, go no further, nor read any longer, for it will but vex you to know what a wretched kind of Wit you are Maſter of; but if you are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate and diſcreet, I have three very true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions to propoſe to you, which for their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, are not a little to be admired. The firſt is, That of all the different Wits of Men, there is but one (as predominant) can fall to thy ſhare,<note place="margin">In <hi>Spain</hi> Nature can join but two different kinds of Wit, and in <hi>Greece</hi> three.</note> unleſs Nature ſtraining hard as it were to form two or three Excellencies more in thee, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to effect what ſhe deſigned, has left thee off unwrought in haſte, as a rude Eſſay of an unfiniſh'd Piece. The Second, that to each diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent kind of Wit correſponds one Science only tranſcendently, and no more; for which reaſon, if thou art not well aſſured in the Choice of what ſuits thy Talent, thou wilt find thy ſelf very ſhort in the reſt, with the moſt aſſiduous Application. The Third, that after thou haſt found out what Science correſponds beſt with thy Wit, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, if thou wouldſt not err, another greater difficulty, which is, whether the Practic, or Theory ſuits beſt with thy <hi>Genius</hi>; for theſe two Parts (in all Sciences whatever) are ſo oppoſite to each other, and require Wits ſo diverſe, that they may be ſet one againſt the other in the place
<pb facs="tcp:53763:10"/>
of Contraries. A hard ſaying this I own, and yet hard as it is, what is yet the hardeſt of all, is, there is no Writ of Error, or Appeal; for who can ſay that he has received any Wrong? for <hi>God</hi> is the Author of Nature, who diſpenſes to each Man but one kind of <hi>Genius</hi> (as I ſaid but now); notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Oppoſition and Difficulty, that lies in the uniting them, he accommodates himſelf to her, and of the Sciences he diſtributes <hi>Gratis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men, in a Miraculous way he gives no more than one in an Eminent Degree. <note place="margin">

               <hi>There are diverſities of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit. And there are diverſities of Adminiſtrations, but the ſame Lord: And there are diverſities of Operations, but it is the ſame God which worketh all in all; but the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every Man to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit withal; for to one is given by the Spirit the Word of Wiſdom; to another the Word of Knowledge, by the ſame Spirit; to another Faith, by the ſame Spirit; to another the Gift of Healing, by the ſame Spirit; to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other the Working of Miracles; to another Prophecy; to another the diſcerning of Spirits; to another divers kinds of Tongues; to another the Interpretation of Tongues; But all theſe worketh one and the ſame Spirit; dividing to every Man ſeverally as he will.</hi> Upon the whole Matter, you ſee that even the Graces Men poſſeſs in the Church are very different, yet are they all diſtributed by one and the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who is the ſource of all. The Miniſterial Employments are divers, and yet 'tis one and the ſame Lord who calls both the one and the other to his reſpective Function. Neither is the Power of working Miracles equal and alike in all, though it is the ſame <hi>God</hi> who produceth thoſe Miraculous Acts, which are performed by thoſe to whom he has given that Power. Nor are you to think,
<pb facs="tcp:53763:11"/>
that the Diſtribution of theſe Gifts, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Holy Spirit's dwelling in him, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the ſame, is without reaſon unequal. Since in their diſtribution, God has regard to what is of more Uſe and Advantage, either for the farther Confirmation of thoſe who already are Believers, or for the Converſion of ſuch as are yet Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Whence it comes, that one receives from the Holy Ghoſt the Gift of Wiſdom to uncypher Divine Myſteries, and another the Gift of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the ſame Spirit; and that alſo one has Faith, by virtue of which, he works a vaſt number of Miracles, and heals all incurable Diſeaſes; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is armed with a power of Miracles of another kind, as of foretelling many things to Come, of Penetrating into the Breaſts of Men, and diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeveral ſecret Springs of all their outward Motions. Hence is it one ſpeaks many Languages (unlearned) and another is the Interpreter to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them all, becauſe, as I told you before, it is one and the ſame Spirit who is Author of all theſe Gifts, and who diſtributes them according to his good Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I queſtion not in the leaſt but God made that diſtribution of Sciences with regard to each Man's Wit and Natural <hi>Genius,</hi> ſeeing the Talents he beſtow'd in <note n="*" rend="inter">Chap. XXV,</note> 
               <hi>St. Matthew</hi> (ſays the ſame Evangeliſt) that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed them <hi>to each according to his own Virtue.</hi>
               <note rend="inter">The reaſon of this is, that the Supernatural Sciences have their Seat in the Soul, and the Soul is, according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſubject to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and Conſtitution of the Body. <hi>Ariſt. lib. 2. de</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>He has filled them with the Spirit of God in Wiſdom in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and in all manner of Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip.</hi> And according to the difference of each Man's Wit, one Science was rather infuſed than another, and more or leſs of each of them, which may be underſtood by the ſame Inſtance of our firſt Parents; for when God fill'd 'em both with Wiſdom, 'tis agreed on by all hands, that he gave leſs to <hi>Eve,</hi> which was the Cauſe (ſay the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) that the Devil undertook to ſeduce her, not daring to tempt Man, as being in awe of a Superior Wiſdom. The reaſon of this (as we ſhall prove by and by) is, that the Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of Woman's Brains is not ſuſceptible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of much Wit or great Wiſdom. We ſhall find the ſame thing in Angelic Subſtances, that God to raiſe one Angel to greater Degrees of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and more elevated Gifts, gave him firſt a more delicate Nature. And if one ſhould ask the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, of what uſe is that Delicate Nature, they anſwer, That an Angel who is of a more Eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Underſtanding, and refined Nature, more readily inclines to the Will of God, and more efficaciouſly employs thoſe Gifts, the ſelf ſame Thing happening even among Men.</p>
            <p>Whence may manifeſtly be inferred, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is a difference of Wits for Supernatural Sciences, and that all kind of Capacities are not fit Inſtruments alike for them, by far greater reaſon Humane Learning requires it, becauſe what Men learn is purely by force of their Wit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53763:12"/>The Deſign of this Work is to know and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the Natural Differences of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and how with Skill to apply to each the Science he may moſt Excel in. If I gain my Point, I ſhall give God the Glory, from whom proceeds all that is Good and Profitable. And if not (know Wiſe Reader) that to Invent and Perfect an Art at one and the ſame time is impoſſible, becauſe Humane Sciences are ſo large, and of ſo wide an Extent, that no Man's Life is ſufficient to diſcover them all, and to bring them to their due Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The firſt Inventor does enough to point out ſome conſiderable Principles, from which, like Seeds, others may take occaſion to raiſe the Art to its Height. <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in alluſion to this, ſaid, That we ought highly to eſteem the very Errors of thoſe that firſt began to Philoſophize, becauſe 'tis ſo very difficult to invent new things, and ſo eaſy to add to what has been Invented and Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, for this very reaſon the Errors of the firſt Inventor ought not much to be blamed, no more than the Improvements of him that adds, to be extravagantly Praiſed. I readily confeſs this Work may not be abſolutely free from Errors, the Matter being ſo nice and delicate, and beſide I had no Guide to lend me a hand in this difficult and untrodden Way. But if they happen to be in the Matter, wherein the Underſtanding has room to expatiate, in that Caſe (Ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) I intreat you, before you play the Critic, to read the following Preface, where you will ſee the Reaſon why Men are of different Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and then to go thorow with the Book, to diſcover what kind of Wit your's is, and if you find any thing not well ſaid according to your Senſe, carefully conſider the contrary Reaſons

            <head type="sub">The Reaſon why Men are of different Sentiments and Opinions.</head>
            <p>I Have for ſome Days paſt been perplext in my Mind with a Doubt (Curious Reader) of which conceiving the Solution to be very difficult, and hid from my Underſtanding, I own I have always hitherto diſſembled it; but now, that I can no longer endure to be ſo often Teiz'd, I am reſolved to find the Deciſion of it, coſt what it will. This Doubt is to know how it can be, ſeeing all Men are of the ſame indiviſible Species, and the Powers of the Rational Soul (the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, Underſtanding, Imagination, and Will) of the ſame perfect Nature in every Body, and which encreaſes the Difficulty, the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a Spiritual Faculty, and acting with material Organs, yet nevertheleſs we ſee by Experience, if a Thouſand Perſons meet together, to give their Opinion upon any Point, each will have his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Sentiment, and not one Man's ſhall agree with anothers, whence comes that Saying, <hi>That there are a Thouſand Differences of Opinion among Men, that each diſcerns things, and uſes them after his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
<pb facs="tcp:53763:13"/>
that their Inclinations are ever diſagreeing, and the Deſigns of every Man's Life wholly New and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not one of the Antient or Modern Philoſophers that I know of has ſo much as touched upon this Difficulty to clear it, according to my Opinion, from its Obſcurity, although every one complains enough of the Difference of Mens Judgments and Guſts. For which reaſon I muſt break the Ice, and open the Way, making uſe of my own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, as in ſome other Important Queſtions, which have never yet been diſcuſs'd by any Body elſe. I find therefore in the particular Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each Man, there is a certain <hi>Je ne ſçay quois,</hi> that makes us naturally fall into this diverſity of Opinions, nay whether we will or no, which is neither Hatred nor Paſſion, nor an Inclination to ſpeak ill, or contradict, as they imagine that Write long Epiſtles Dedicatory, to thoſe they call their <hi>Mecaenas</hi>'s, imploring their Favour, and ſingular Protection; but to aſſign what it is, and by what Principles to be attained, there lies the Point, and Knot of the Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>To underſtand this then it muſt be obſerv'd, that it has been the old Opinion of ſome great Phyſicians, that be we what we will who inhabit the intemperate Regions, we are actually and in earneſt ſickly, and have ſome hurt, although that we were begot and born with it, and never enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a better Temperament, yet we perceive it not, but if we arm againſt the depraved Actions of our Faculties, and the Cares that are incident every moment (not knowing whence or why) we ſhall ſoon be of Opinion, that there is no Man can ſay in truth he is free from Pains and Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53763:13"/>All Phyſicians agree, that perfect Health in Man conſiſts in a certain Equality of the four Firſt Qualities, wherein Heat over-ballances not Gold, nor Moiſture Drineſs; from which Equality when ever a Man receds, 'tis impoſſible he ſhould be ſo well as he us'd to be; and the reaſon of it is clear, becauſe when a Man is in right Temper, he acts perfectly well, and it cannot well be otherwiſe when a Man is in ill Temper (which is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) but his Faculties will be Vitiated, and his Actions ſomewhat defective. Now to preſerve this State of Health, Heaven ought always to ſhed the ſame Influence, there ſhould be neither Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor Summer, nor Autumn, Man ſhould not roll on through the Courſe of ſo many Years; the Motions of Soul and Body ſhould always be equal and uniform; in Sleeping and Waking, Eating and Drinking, they ſhould be moderate, minding nothing but to maintain this good Temperament, which is a thing unattainable as well by the Art of Phyſic as by Nature.</p>
            <p>God only had done this in the Perſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> placing him in the earthly Paradice, and giving him the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> to eat, which had that Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preſerve Man in the ſame Degrees of perfect Health, with which he was Born. But other Men living as they do, in ſome intemperate Regions, and ſubject to ſuch Alteration of Weather, in the Winter, Summer and Autumn and paſſing thro' ſo many different Stages of Life, and eating ſuch variety of Meats, hot and cold, muſt of Courſe find themſelves diſorder'd, and that they hourly loſe that happy Harmony of thoſe four Firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which we ſee evidently in all Men that are Born, ſome are Flegmatic, others Sanguine, ſome Choleric, others Melancholic, and not one Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
<pb facs="tcp:53763:14"/>
except by Miracle; and if there be any ſuch, his good Temperament laſts not a moment without Change and Alteration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi> blames theſe Phyſicians, declaring they ſpeak with too much Rigour; for Man's Health conſiſts not in an indiviſible Point, but has ſome ſcope and latitude; for the firſt Qualities may ſomewhat decline from the perfect Temperament, without our falling Sick upon it. The Flegmatic are viſibly far from it, becauſe of their too great Coldneſs and Moiſture; the Choleric, by reaſon of their exceſſive Heat and Drineſs; the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic, becauſe of their extraordinary Coldneſs and Drineſs; yet nevertheleſs all theſe fail not to live in Health, without Pain or Sickneſs; and tho' it be true that they are not ſo perfectly well as thoſe that are temperate, yet they ſubſiſt without any conſiderable Inconvenience, and without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourſe to Phyſic. For which reaſon Phyſic it ſelf conſerves them in their natural Diſpoſitions, though <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid that theſe were Vitious Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, and that they muſt be treated as Diſeaſes, applying to each the Qualities contrary to them, to reduce them to that perfect Health, in which is no Pain, or Infirmity whatever. Of this we have plain Proof; for Nature in all her Efforts and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations endeavours not the Preſervation of him that is of an ill Conſtitution, by things that accord with his Nature, but to this end will always ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe thoſe that are moſt contrary to it, as if he really were ſick; thus we obſerve the Summer agrees beſt with the Choleric, the Winter worſt; and that Wine inflames him, but Water makes him eaſier and pleaſanter; which occaſion'd <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the Good and Welfare of a hot Conſtitution conſiſted in drinking Water, and in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:53763:14"/>
But to attain the end I propoſe, there is no neceſſity to ſay, that this evil Conſtitution is a Diſeaſe, as theſe Antient Phyſicians have direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintain'd, or an imperfect Health, as <hi>Galen</hi> rather intimates, ſince neither the one nor the other Opinion, is to be clearly drawn from what I pretend to prove, but the cauſe of the ill Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Men, and their not being in the Purity and Vigour of their Natural Conſtitution, is, that they are inclined to quite different Guſts, and Appetites, not only in what touches the Iraſcible and Concupiſcible Faculty, but alſo in things which regard the Rational Soul. Which we may eaſily obſerve, if we run through all the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powers in the Man of ill Conſtitution. He that is Choleric, following his Natural Faculties, requires cold and moiſt Meats; and he that is Phlegmatic, claims hot and dry. The Choleric purſuing the generative Virtue is employ'd in queſt of Women, who are the Averſion of the Phlegmatic. The Choleric, according to the Ira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcible Faculty, is Ambitious of Honour, aſpiring to Greatneſs and Glory, to Command and Rule like a Superior, and Magiſterially: The Phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic has more ſatisfaction in Sleeping ſoundly, than in being Lord of the Univerſe; but now to what end ſerves this Knowledge of the different Inclinations of Men? It is to conſider the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity there is amongſt the ſame Perſons, Choleric, Phlegmatic, Sanguine, or Melancholic, becauſe of the vaſt difference between Choler, Phlegm, Blood, and Melancholy; in order to underſtand more clearly, that the Variety of Ill Conſtitutions and Diſeaſes among Men is abſolutely the Cauſe of the Diverſity of their Judgments, (as far as reſpects the Rational Part) it will be convenient to ſet
<pb facs="tcp:53763:15"/>
down here an Inſtance in the External Faculties, becauſe the ſame thing we obſerve in them, we may alſo conclude in the others.</p>
            <p>All the Natural Philoſophers are agreed, that all the Faculties with which an Act of Senſation is performed, ſhould be clear and pure from the Tinctures of the ſenſible Object; not to make quite different and abſolutely falſe Reports of the ſame. For Inſtance, let us ſuppoſe Four Men defective in the Compoſition of the Organ of Sight, and that in one, a drop of Blood ſhould be mixt with the Chriſtallin Humour, in the other a drop of Choler, in the third one of Phlegm, and in the fourth one of Melancholy; if theſe know nothing of their Defects, we will lay before their Eyes a piece of Blue Cloath to judge of its true Colour; 'tis certain the firſt will ſay 'tis Scarlet, the ſecond that it is Yellow, the third that it is White, and the fourth that it is Black, and that each of them would make no difficulty to ſwear it, and to ridicule his Companion upon it, as a Fellow that ſuffers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be deceived in a thing ſo clear: And if we ſhould let theſe four drops of Humour fall down to the Tongue, and give to theſe Four Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a Glaſs of Water to drink, one would ſay, it was ſweet; another, it was bitter; the third, it was ſalt; and the laſt, that it was ſower. Thus you ſee here Four different Judgments in two Qualities, becauſe each has his ſenſory Organs tinctured, not one of them all hitting upon the Truth. The ſame Reaſon and Proportion is kept by the Internal Faculties, in the Place of their Objects; and thus it would be ſhould we carry up theſe Four Humours even to the Brain; if they happened to cauſe an Inflammation there, we ſhould ſee a Thouſand ſorts of Follies and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances;
<pb facs="tcp:53763:15"/>
whence comes the Saying, <hi>That every Man has his blind-ſide, in which he is obſtinate.</hi> Thoſe who are not incommoded with this Diſtemper'd Exceſs, ſeem to be of a very ſound Judgment, and ſpeak and do very Rational Things, and yet in effect are Extravagant, but do not reflect upon it, becauſe of the calm and moderate Temper they poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>Phyſicians have no better a way to know if a Man be ſick or well, than to reflect on his Actions; for if they are Rational and Sound, he is in Health; but if they are Evil and Deprav'd, it is an infallible Indication of his being Indiſpoſed. Upon this Argument the great Philoſopher <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi> inſiſted when he proved to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that Man from the Day of his Birth to that of his Death, as to his Rational Acts, was nothing elſe but a continual Diſeaſe; <hi>Every Man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>from his Birth is but a Diſeaſe; when he is brought up he is Helpleſs, and wants the Aid of another; when he encreaſes in Strength, he becomes Inſolent, muſt be Corrected, and have a Maſter; when he is at full Strength, he is Raſh; when he declines to Old Age, he is Miſerable, does nothing but Vaunt and Prate of his paſt Labours; at length he drops with his fair Qualities into the Ordeur of his Mother's Belly:</hi> Which Words were admired by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who finding them ſo true, and being convinc'd by them, recounted them to his Friend <hi>Demagetes.</hi> And returning to Viſit him, who reliſhed a Treat of ſuch high Wiſdom, he ask'd him why he laugh'd without ceaſing, upon his ridiculing all Mankind. To which he returned as follows. <hi>Don't you ſee that the whole World is Raving mad in a burning Fever, ſome buy and feed Kenels of Hounds that are to Devour them; others run Mad after Hunting-Horſes, theſe
<pb facs="tcp:53763:16"/>
would command many People, and yet know not ſo much as how to govern themſelves; thoſe take Wives to drive away Incontinence, and yet burn with Love, and ſoon prove as irreconcilable in their Hatred; they die with deſire to have Children, and when theſe Children are once grown up, they turn them out of Doors. All theſe unprofitable tranſient Cares and Affections, what are they but fair Tokens of their Folly? Nor do they ſtop there, for having no greater Enemy than Quiet, they wage War one with another, depoſing their Kings, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing others to their Dignities; they account it a Glory to Murder one another, or rather turn their Swords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Mother's Breaſts; go on wickedly ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Bowels of the Earth, which adminiſters Matter to all their Crimes</hi>; continuing after this manner all along, recounting the various Capricio's of Men, and the monſtrous things they do and ſay, by reaſon they are all diſtemper'd. In fine, he told him, <hi>That this World (to ſpeak properly) was but one great Bedlam, where every Man's Life was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Comedy to make ſport for all the reſt, and that truly was the Subject of his fit of Laughter:</hi> Which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> having heard, cryed out aloud, tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Abderites,</hi> Democritus <hi>is no mad Man, but the Wiſeſt of Men, and one that can make us all Wiſer.</hi> If we are not all miſtaken, we that live in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Regions, and eat with moderation, ſhall all have, though not always, yet for the moſt part, the very ſame Opinions, the ſame Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſame Conceptions; and would eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one take the Pains to reaſon and judge of any Point of Difficulty, almoſt all at the ſame inſtant would be of the ſame Sentiments: But living as we do in Intemperate Regions, and in thoſe ſo ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly, in what relates to Eating and Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beſet with ſo many Paſſions and Cares, and
<pb facs="tcp:53763:16"/>
ſubjected to every Change and Alteration of Air and Weather, it is impoſſible but we ſhould be ſick, or at leaſt indiſpoſed; and as we are not all ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe, ſo uſually we are not all of the ſame Mind, nor eſpouſe the ſame Opinion; but each in proportion to his Evil Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>The Parable of St. <hi>Luke</hi> agrees excellently well with this Philoſophy, which ſays, <hi>that a certain Man went down from Jeruſalem to Jerico, and fell among Thieves, which ſtript him of his Raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead</hi>; which ſome Doctors explain, ſaying, That this Man thus maim'd, repreſents Humane Nature af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had ſinn'd; for God Created him moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, with a Conſtitution and Temperament, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and agreeable to his Kind, beſtowing on him many Supernatural Graces for his greater Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and among others Original Juſtice, by which Man gained entire Health, and as Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious a Conſtitution, as he could wiſh. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it <hi>the Health of Nature,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was from it proceeded that excellent Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Man, which ſubjects the Inferior Part to the Superior, and the Superior to God; all which Graces he loſt in the very inſtant he Sin'd, when he not only ſaw himſelf deſpoiled of his Gifts of Grace, but of thoſe of Nature, alſo, remaining as maim'd in both at once. But be that ſo or not, let us conſider his Deſcendents, in what State they are, and what Actions they perform, and we ſhall eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive they could not proceed, but from Men Maim'd and Diſtempered. At leaſt, as to what reſpects Free-Will, 'tis a certain and judged Caſe, that ſince he Sin'd, he remain'd in a manner half dead, deprived of the Strength he had before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at the ſame inſtant <hi>Adam</hi> Sin'd, he was caſt
<pb facs="tcp:53763:17"/>
out of the Terreſtrial Paradice, a very Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Place, and was depriv'd of the Fruit of the Tree of Life, and of other means he had to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his good Conſtitution. The Life he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards led was exttreamly Painful, he made the Earth his Bed, was expoſed to Heat, Cold, and all the Injuries of Weather; the Country where he dwealt was Intemperate, his Meat and Drink con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his Health; to go bare-Footed and Naked, to Sweat and Slave, to ſpin out, and get a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; to have neither Houſe, nor Home; to wander from Place to Place; for ſuch a Man as he eſpecially that had been ſo nicely Educated, doubtleſs might very well render him Unhealthful and Diſtemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: So that there remained not in his Body an Organ that was not in the ſame Condition, or that could Act with the accuſtomed Sweetneſs and Vigour. Being ſo Diſtempered he enjoyed his Wife, and beget <hi>Cain,</hi> a Child of ſuch a Perverſe and Malicious Spirit, Proud, Rough, Shameleſs, Envious, Wicked, and of ſuch Corrupted Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as he tranſmitted, together with that State of impaired Health, this dangerous Diſorder to his whole Race, Phyſicians being of Opinion, that the Parents Diſeaſes fail not to deſcend to the Children.</p>
            <p>But a great Objection ariſes againſt this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, requiring no ſlight Solution, which is this; Suppoſe it be true that all Men are Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd and of evil Conſtitution, as we have prov'd; and that from each ill Conſtitution is bred a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prav'd Opinion, what Method ſhall we take, to diſtinguiſh who ſpeaks Truth amongſt ſo many Perſons that pretend to be Judges of it? For if theſe Four Men, of whom we formerly ſpoke, were all miſtaken in their Judgment of the piece
<pb facs="tcp:53763:17"/>
of Blue Cloath they ſaw, and had each an ill Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture in his Sight, may not the ſame happen in other things, if each ſhould have ſome particular Diſtemper in his Brains? and after this manner Truth would remain hid, without any Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to diſcover it, becauſe all the World is Crazed and Diſtemper'd.</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer, That the Knowlege of Man is Uncertain and Doubtful, for the Reaſons I have mentioned; but beſides, that 'tis to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that never any ill Conſtitution attends a Man, but if it ſhould debilitate him in one Faculty, in the ſame proportion it ſtrengthens him in another; and if you would have it ſo, in that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a different Temperament: For Inſtance, If the Brain being well temper'd, ſhould happen by Exceſs of Moiſture to loſe its good Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, aſſuredly the Memory would thereby prove more Excellent, but the Underſtanding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair'd, as we ſhall hereafter make out: And if he loſes this good Temperament by too much Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the Underſtanding will be thereby encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but the Memory diminiſh'd. So that as to what concerns the Operations relating to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, a Man that has a dry Brain, ſhall much more Excel therein, than he that has a ſounder, and more temperate one: And for the Operations of the Memory, a Man of a bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, becauſe of his too much Moiſture, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels much more in that than a Man of the beſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution in the World; for, according to the Opinion of Phyſicians, Men of the worſt Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, in many things ſurpaſs thoſe of the beſt. For which reaſon ſaid <hi>Plato,</hi> it is a Miracle to find a Man of an excellent Wit, that has not ſome Madneſs (as much as to ſay, a hot and dry Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb facs="tcp:53763:18"/>
of the Brain;) ſo that there is an intemperate Diſtemper appropriate to one ſort of Science, which is quite contrary to another. Therefore 'tis requiſie a Man ſhould diſtinguiſh what kind of Infirmity and Diſtemper his is, and what Science in particular it ſuits with (which is the Subject of this Treatiſe) for in that Science he ſhall diſcover Truth, but in the others he ſhall only make Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures at random.</p>
            <p>Men of Harmonious Conſtitutions, as we ſhall hereafter prove, have in a degree of Mediocrity a Capacity for all Sciences, though they will never excell in any; but thoſe that are otherwiſe, are fit but for one only, which if they happen to hit upon, and Study with Care and Application, they may be aſſured to ſucceed wonderfully in it; but if they fail in their Choice and Application, they will make but ſmall Advancements in the other Sciences. Hiſtory confirms to us, that each Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was diſcover'd by Men of ill Conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Children had continued in the Terreſtrial Paradice, they would have had no occaſion for Mechanic Arts, nor any of the Sciences now taught in the Schools, nor would they as yet have been found out, or Practiſed; for inaſmuch as they went bare-footed and naked, they wanted neither Shooe-makers, nor Taylors, nor Weavers, no more than Carpenters, or Maſons, becauſe there was no Rain in this Earthly Garden of Pleaſure, nor was the Weather too hot, or too cold, that they needed any Cover or Retreat. Nor was there any Scholaſtic, or Poſitive Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, much leſs was it branched out as it is now, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> not having Sin'd, Jeſus Chriſt was not Born, of whoſe Incarnation, Life, and Death, as alſo of Original Sin, and the Remedy thereby
<pb facs="tcp:53763:18"/>
obtained, this Science conſiſts. There had been leſs of the Knowledge of the Law, becauſe the Juſt have no occaſion for Law and Right; all things had been in Common, there had been no <hi>Mine</hi> nor <hi>Thine,</hi> which are the cauſe of Law Suits and Quarrels. Phyſic had likewiſe been ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, Man had then been Immortal, and free from the Corruptions and Changes attending Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; all had eat of the Fruit of the Tree of Life, which had that Property, daily to repair our Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Moiſture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi> no ſooner Sin'd, but he began to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Exerciſing of all the Arts and Sciences, as neceſſary to ſupport his Miſery. The firſt Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that appeared in the Earthly Paradice, was Skill of the Law, by means of which was form'd a Proceſs, with the ſame Order of Juſtice, as at this day obſerv'd, citing the Party, and declaring the Crime he was accuſed of, the Accuſed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, and the Judge pronouncing Arreſt of Judgment, or Condemnation.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was Divinity; for when God ſaid to the Serpent, <hi>And ſhe ſhall bruiſe thy Head, Adam</hi> underſtood, as he was a Man, whoſe Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was full of infus'd Sciences, that to repair his Fault, the Divine Word was to take Fleſh in the Virgin's Womb, who by her happy Delivery ſhould trample under her Feet the Devil, and all his Powers, by which Faith and Belief he was Saved.</p>
            <p>After Theology ſoon came the Military-Art; becauſe in the way <hi>Adam</hi> went to eat the Fruit of Life, God had placed a Gariſon and Fort, into which he had put an Armed Cherubim, to diſpute the Paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:53763:19"/>Next the Art-Military, came alſo Phyſic, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Adam</hi> by Sin became Mortal, and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, ſubject to an infinite number of Dolours and Infirmities.</p>
            <p>All theſe Arts and Sciences were firſt exerciſed there, receiving afterwards their due Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Perfection, each in the temperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, beſt adapted to it, by means of Men of Wit and Ability every way qualified to invent them.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I conclude (Curious Reader) frankly confeſſing my ſelf to be of evil Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Diſtemper'd, and that you may well be ſo, being Born as I was, in an intemperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and that the ſame Thing may happen to us, as to thoſe Four Men, who ſeeing a Piece of Blue Cloath, ſwore, one, that it was Scarlet; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, White; the third, Yellow; and the fourth, Black; not one of them ſpeaking true, becauſe each had a particular Vitiation in the Organ of Sight.</p>

            <div n="1" type="chapter">
               <head>CHAP. I. What Wit is, and what Differences of it are ordinarily obſerv'd among Men.</head>
               <p>'TIS one of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Precepts, That all who pretend to Write or Teach, ought to begin their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin with the Definition of the thing treated of, its Nature, Difference, and Propriety. That gives the Learner a true reliſh, and prevents the Writers launch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out into needleſs Queſtions, or flying from thoſe moſt proper for compleating the Work. The reaſon of this is, that the Definition ought to be ſo cloſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53763:22"/>
that there ſhould hardly be found any thing either in the handling that Science, or in the due method, which ſhould not be pointed to in it: Therefore if they do not begin thus, 'tis impoſſible to obſerve Order in any ſort of Science. Seeing then that Wit and Ability in Men is the entire Subject of this Book, it will be convenient, firſt, to underſtand the Definition, and what it eſſentially comprehends; for when we rightly apprehend that, we ſhall then alſo find the true method of teaching this New Doctrin; and whereas the Name, as the ſame Philoſopher obſerves, is <hi>as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument by which the Subſtances of things are taught and diſtinguiſh'd</hi>; We muſt know this word <hi>Ingenio</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and <hi>Ingenium</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> which ſignifies Wit, is derived from one of theſe three <hi>Latin</hi> Words, <hi>Gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Genero, Ingenero,</hi> as much as to Ingender, and it ſeems rather to come from the laſt, conſidering the Sound and Number of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Syllables it borrows thence, and what we ſhall hereafter add of its Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon upon which the firſt Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this Word built, is not trivial, in order to know how to find the Names, and good Agreement, which things lately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd require. <hi>Plato</hi> ſays this only belongs to Heroes, and to Men of deep Thought,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53763:22"/>
as may be ſeen in the Invention of this Word <hi>Ingenio</hi>; to find it out there will be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red much ſubtle Speculation, and ſtrong Natural Philoſophy, by which one may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover two generative Powers in Man, one common with the Beaſts and Plants, and the other Participating of Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, God and the Angels. It is our Province to diſcourſe of the firſt, which is well known, there being more difficulty in the ſecond, becauſe their Birth, and manner of Procreation, are not ſo manifeſt to all the World: Nevertheleſs, ſpeaking according to Natural Philoſophers, 'tis a clear Caſe, that Wit is a Generative Power, and if we may ſo ſay, becomes pregnant, and brings forth; that has, I ſay, Children; and moreover, as <hi>Plato</hi> affirms, wants a Midwife to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver her. For like as the Plant or Animal in the Generation of the firſt ſort, gives a real and ſubſtantial Being, to what they produce, which they have not before Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; even ſo Wit has the Power and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Force to produce and bring forth within it ſelf a Son, which the Natural Philoſophers call <hi>Notion,</hi> or as it has been accounted, <hi>the Word of the Spirit.</hi> And not only the aforeſaid Philoſophers ſpeak of it after this manner, maintaining the Underſtanding to be a Generative Faculty, and calling that a Son which it produces; but Sacred Writ it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53763:23"/>
ſelf, ſpeaking of the Generation of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, makes uſe of the ſame Terms of Father and Son, or Ingender and bring forth. <hi>When there were no Depths I was brought forth, when there were no Fountains abounding with Water; before the Mountains were ſetled, before the Hills was I brought forth:</hi> So alſo is it certain that the Divine Word had its Eternal Generation from the Prolifick Underſtanding of the Father. <hi>My Heart, that is to ſay, my Thoughts, have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted a good Word:</hi> And not only the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Word, but alſo all things comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Univerſe, Viſible and Inviſible, have been produc'd by the ſelf-ſame Power. Whence the Natural Philoſophers conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Fecundity of the Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, have named it <hi>Genius,</hi> which is, by an Excellence, as much as the <hi>Engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And though the rational Soul, and other Spiritual Subſtances, may be call'd <hi>Genii,</hi> from being Fruitful in the Production of ſome Thoughts relating to Science and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, yet they have not always an Intellect of ſufficient Force and Power in their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to give a real being to what they In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender, as ſubſiſting by its ſelf, like as it happens in the Generation of thoſe things which God has made; all their Generative Virtue ſerves to produce an accident in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53763:23"/>
Memory, which after it is produced, is in the end but an Idea and Image of what we know and underſtand; very far from that, which comes to paſs in the Ineffable Generation of the Word Divine, where that which is Engender'd, is of <hi>the ſame Subſtance with the Father,</hi> as the other things, which God has produc'd, repreſent him from without, by a real and ſubſtantial Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which we now ſee in them; but for the Ideas in Man's Underſtanding, if they are ſuch things as relate to Art, they don't im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately receive the Being they ought to have: However, thus much muſt be done to draw a perfect Idea, by which we are to form 'em; 'tis neceſſary before-hand to make a thouſand ſtrokes in the Air, to build many Models, and in the end to ſet our hand to the Work to give them the Being they ought to have; and notwithſtanding all that, they happen for the moſt part to be defective. The ſame thing falls out in other Conceptions Man forms to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Natural things, and what relates to their being there, or the Image the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conceives of 'em, by an Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Reſemblance of the firſt Thought, with ſomething living; and to draw a Copy, that may come up pretty near the Original, 'tis requiſite to aſſemble an Infinite Number of Spirits, to labour a long time, that after all,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53763:24"/>
ſpend themſelves in producing only a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Extravagancies.</p>
               <p>This Doctrin then being ſuppos'd, we muſt now underſtand, that the Arts and Sciences Men ſtudy, are only a ſort of Images, and Figures, begotten by their Minds in their Memory, which repreſent to the Life the Poſture and natural Compoſition of the Subject relating to the intended Science: As for Inſtance, Phyſick was nothing elſe in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>'s Heads, but a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, nakedly preſenting the Structure of the Body of Man, together with the Cauſe and Cure of his Diſeaſes. The Skill of the Law is another Figure, repreſenting the Form of Juſtice, which preſerves Human-Society, making Man live in Peace and Tranquility. Whence 'tis eaſy to perceive, that if a Scholar under the Conduct of an able Maſter, cannot form in his memory ſuch another Image, and as exact as that laid before his Eyes, when he is diſcourſing to him of it, there is no doubt to be made, but he has a barren Invention, and ſuch as will never be able to conceive, or bring forth any thing but Extravagancies and Monſters. And ſo much for the Word <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio,</hi> deriv'd from the Verb <hi>Ingenero,</hi> as much as to ſay, to <hi>Engender within himſelf an entire and true Figure, repreſenting to the Life the nature of the Subject intended to be ſtudied.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53763:24"/>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> defines Wit after this manner, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility and Memory ordinarily call'd by the ſame name of Wit</hi>; wherein he has followed the Opinion of the common People, who reſt themſelves contented, if their Children are but Docible, to be the eaſier inſtructed by another, and endu'd with a competent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory to retain and preſerve the Figures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Underſtanding: For which reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, That the Ear and the Memory muſt be join'd to reap any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the Sciences. But to ſpeak truth, that Definition is too ſhort, not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending all the differences of Wit, whereas this word <hi>Docility</hi> only imports Wits that want a Maſter, leaving out a great many others, whoſe Felicity is ſuch, that aſſiſted by the ſubject only, without the help of any Body, produce a thouſand Conceits they never heard ſpoke of; ſuch were thoſe who firſt found out the Arts. Elſewhere <hi>Tully</hi> adds Memory to the Definition of Wit, of which however <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, That it has no kind of Invention; as much as to ſay, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of it ſelf to Engender any thing, for ſo much <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teaches us, that when 'tis in Excellence, it impedes the Copiouſneſs of the Underſtanding, as not being prompt to conceive, or bring forth, but ſeeming only to keep and preſerve the Figures and Species of what the other Powers have conceived,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:53763:25"/>
as is obſerv'd of the Learn'd, who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Memories, that they ſpeak and write nothing but what others have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, if we conſider well the term <hi>Docility,</hi> we ſhall find that <hi>Cicero</hi> has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily hit on't; for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Wiſdom, and the Truth of Sciences are ſtow'd among natural Things, there to be ſought after, as in their proper Fountain. The Natural Philoſophers that believe a Propoſition, becauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpoke it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enquiring any further, want Wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Truth is not in his Mouth that affirms it, but in the thing in queſtion, crying out with a loud Voice, and teaching Man the Being Nature has given him, and to what end ſhe was created, according to that, <hi>Does not Wiſdom cry out, and Prudence does not ſhe make her Voice to be heard?</hi> He that has ſharpneſs of Underſtanding, and a good Ear to diſtinguiſh what Nature teaches and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulges in her Works, ſhall wonderfully improve by the Contemplation of natural things, and has no need of a Maſter to ſhew him what he may learn well enough from the Brute Beaſts and the Plants. <hi>Go Drone, take thy Leſſon from the Ant; conſider her toyl, and become wiſe by her Example; ſee how ſhe, without Teacher or Learning, lays up Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Summer for the Winter. Plato</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:53763:25"/>
took little notice of this Docility, imagining perhaps there were no other Maſters to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct Men, than thoſe mounted in Chairs; which made him ſay, <hi>The Field and the Trees can teach me nothing, but the Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Men only in the City. Solomon</hi> ſpoke better, when not in the leaſt doubting but that the ſecond kind of Docility might really be found, he begg'd of God the Ability to Govern his People. <hi>Give, if thou pleaſeſt, O God, to thy Servant Judgment, that he may Rule thy People, and diſtinguiſh between Good and Evil.</hi> By which he ask'd only a clear and refin'd Underſtanding, (inſomuch that what he obtain'd was more than he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded) to the end that when Doubts oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd to him in his Government, he might derive from the Nature of the thing the true Judgment he ought to make of it, without going to ſeek it in Books; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeen in the Sentence he pronounced upon the firſt Difference that aroſe between the two Women; for no doubt it was the Nature of the thing that inform'd him, which was the Child's true Mother, namely ſhe, who could not bear the dividing of it.</p>
               <p>The ſame kind of Docility and clearneſs of Underſtanding was given by Jeſus Chriſt to his Diſciples, for their underſtanding the Holy Scriptures, after their natural Dull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Indiſpoſition of mind was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:53763:26"/>
as it is ſaid, <hi>He opened their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, that they might underſtand the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</hi> For which reaſon the Catholick Church, as being ſenſible of what high Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is to have all due Qualifications to comprehend the Divine Book, forbids all Novices as well as Superannuated Perſons to ſtudy Theology: <hi>For we must inviolately obſerve a Law, to exerciſe in all ſorts of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences young Men only; and not all thoſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction, but chiefly thoſe that are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, baniſhing thence all the Dotards, and thoſe whoſe Intellects are dull and depraved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaking of Wits that were to learn the Divine Sciences, has ſaid the ſame thing, becauſe Spiritual Subſtances are ſo remote from Senſe, and of ſo pure Matter in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that moſt elevated and nice Wits were to be choſen; 'twas therefore he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That they ought not only to make choice of Bold Men, that ſhould ſtrike a Terror into their Enemies, but alſo more of thoſe to whom Nature had been liberal in the Gifts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to Divinity, that is to ſay, thoſe of a ſharp and ready Wit.</hi> By the way repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending <hi>Solon</hi> for ſaying, this ſort of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was to be Studied in Old Age.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are Maſters of ſuch Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, proceed in the Studies they are engaged in with very little Labour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Underſtanding has nothing to do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:53763:26"/>
but to preſerve in their memory the Figures and Species, that enable them upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Diſpute; thoſe natural things at all times, ſuggeſting to us ſuch Ideas as we would frame to our ſelves in Speculation, and when they are Supernatural, they need only to underſtand the Species and Figures that have paſt through their Senſes: Which occaſioned <hi>Plato</hi> to ſay, <hi>That we need not diveſt Sublime things of their Matter, to make them ſenſible to us; for being in their nature most excellent and elevated, they are not ſuch as naked Reaſon is ſo well able to comprehend.</hi> So ſaid he, that the greateſt Wits were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Divine Studies rather than any other, ſeeing they were above our Reaſon. Whence 'tis certain, that that ſo fam'd Maxim of <hi>Ariſtotle, That there is nothing in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, but what has paſt through the Senſe</hi>; has no place in the ſecond ſort of Docility, but only in the firſt, in which the Ability extends no farther than to receive and retain in the Memory what the Maſter has ſaid and taught. Whence may be clearly collected what Abuſe is committed in theſe days in the Study of Theology, ſeeing without making the choice, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Church requires, many Perſons whom Nature deſign'd to Cultivate and Till the Earth, are very forward to thruſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into Holy Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53763:27"/>With theſe two ſorts of Qualities of which we have treated, correſpend as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kinds of Wit; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> takes notice of the firſt, <hi>He has true Wit that acquieſces in, and aſſents to him that ſpeaks Truth,</hi> becauſe the Man who remains not convinc'd by ſtrong and ſolid Reaſons, and that forms not in his Memory a good Idea of what is propos'd to him, ſufficiently declares to us, that his Underſtanding is ſhallow. 'Tis true, there is ſomething in this worthy of Conſideration, which is this, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve many Scholars very readily learn all their Maſters teach them, retaining and preſerving it in their Memories, without any difficulty, which for two Reaſons may happen, either becauſe the Maſter is of great Ability, and ſuch a one as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, when he ſaid, that it is requiſite for <hi>a Learned Man not only to know all that may be drawn from the Principles, but alſo that he have a perfect knowledge of the Principles themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe Scholars that concurr with ſuch a Maſter, without doubt have an excellent Wit; which they alſo further ſhew, when they receive the Doctrin of the Maſter that Inſtructs them, without his ſubjoining, or declaring his own Opinions and Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with the Principles upon which they are founded.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53763:27"/>Not to lead a Wit this way, which is ſo very ſhort, and narrow, a thouſand Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties at all times readily preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to him, and as many different Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; for he that learns from ſuch a Maſter, forms not to himſelf the true Idea and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence requir'd by the true Principles of Learning; ſo that his Underſtanding ever remains doubtful, and diſquieted, which is occaſion'd by the fault of him that teaches him.</p>
               <p>There are other rude and groſs Dunces, who perceiving the ſharper Wits in more Eſteem, very inconveniently, and for quite different Reaſons, oppoſe their Maſters at the end of their Leſſon, and in imitation of the other, preſs him with a thouſand Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinences, he not being ſo able to clear their Doubts, as they are to diſcover their Weakneſs, more than if they had been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: 'Tis of them <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, That they have not Senſe enough to be convinc'd. But he that has a nimble and ready Wit, need not wholly rely on his Maſter, nor ſwallow down any thing that appears not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to his Doctrin.</p>
               <p>Others are ſilent, and obey their Maſter without the leaſt Contradiction, becauſe they have not Wit enough to diſcern the Falſity and ill Conſequence of his Corolla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, from the firſt Principles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:53763:28"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has thus defin'd the ſecond Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Wit, <hi>He has the most excellent Wit, who of himſelf underſtands every thing:</hi> Which kind of diſcerning Wit, bears the ſame proportion with regard to Knowledge and Underſtanding, as humane Sight does to Forms and Colours, when 'tis clear and penetrating. As ſoon as one opens his Eyes, he diſtinguiſhes every thing, failing not to tell where the Place is, and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance there is interpoſed between the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, without another View or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; but if the Sight be ſhort and weak, the moſt apparent and cleareſt things in View cannot be diſcern'd, without borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eyes of a third Man, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them to him. An Ingenious Man, when he Contemplates (that is to ſay, opens the Eyes of his Underſtanding) compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends from the leaſt Diſcourſe, being of Natural Things, their Difference, Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to what end they were Created; but if there be not ſo large a Capacity, the Maſter of courſe muſt take the more pains with him, and yet even then (as 'tis fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent) all his Labour and Application are to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Vulgar are not acquainted with this Difference of Wit, imagining 'tis no where to be found; and indeed not without great ſhow of Reaſon, as the ſame Philoſopher
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:53763:28"/>
has very well obſerv'd. <hi>No Man ever came compleatly Learned into the World, nor is there any Natural Knowledge amongst Men:</hi> In ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, we ſee by Experience, that all they who have ſtudied, even to this very day, have wanted a Maſter. <hi>Prodicus</hi> was <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Maſter, who by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> was pronounc'd the wiſeſt Man in the World; and <hi>Socrates</hi> taught <hi>Plato,</hi> whoſe Wit was ſo extraordinary, that he deſerv'd the Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name of Divine: <hi>Plato</hi> was <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, of whom <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he was the greateſt Wit that ever was.</hi> Now if this laſt Difference of Wit had been to be found in any, without doubt it would have been amongſt thoſe Eminent Perſons: Seeing then not one of them had it, 'tis a ſtrong preſumption Nature cannot give it us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> only himſelf, as the Divines deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was born entirely inſtructed, and fill'd with the infus'd Sciences; and he 'twas, who communicated them to his Succeſſors: From whence it may be concluded for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that there is nothing new, and that there is no Opinion in any kind of Science, that has not been maintain'd by one or other, according to that ſaying, <hi>There is nothing yet ſaid, that has not been ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this 'tis anſwer'd, That <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has defin'd a perfect Wit, as it ought to be,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:53763:29"/>
rather than as it was; for he knew full well, there was none ſuch in Nature. Even as <hi>Tully</hi> deſcrib'd a compleat Orator, not but that himſelf own'd, 'twas impoſſible to find ſuch a one, but that he would be the beſt Orator that approach'd neareſt to the Idea he had drawn of one. 'Tis the very ſame in this Difference of Wit; for though we cannot meet with ſuch a perfect one as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has fram'd, yet it muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we have obſerv'd many Perſons ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach very near it, inventing and ſaying ſuch things as they never heard from their Maſters, nor any Mouth, and that have been able to diſcern and diſprove the Errors they taught them; and the truth is, they ſhew'd them that they could of themſelves comprehend, being arriv'd at the greateſt Pitch of Wit; at leaſt it cannot be denied of <hi>Galen,</hi> that he had this Difference of Wit, when he ſaid, <hi>I have found out all things my ſelf, having no other Guide but the Light only of my Natural Reaſon; whereas had I follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Maſters, I had fallen into a thouſand Errors.</hi> Now though Nature gave theſe very Perſons a Wit that had its riſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, perfect ſtate, and declenſion, yet ſhe render'd them compleat at laſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, though they arrived late at it, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid; but ſince ſhe gives it not but with theſe Conditions, we need not be
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:53763:29"/>
amazed if <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtood in need of their Maſters to inſtruct them.</p>
               <p>There is a third Difference of Wit, which nevertheleſs is not abſolutely different from what I have but now treated of; by means of which, ſome have without Art or Study ſpoke ſuch ſubtle and ſurprizing things, and yet true, that were never before ſeen, heard, or writ, no nor ever ſo much as thought of. <hi>Plato</hi> calls this ſort of Wit, <hi>An excellent Wit, with a mixture of Madneſs.</hi> 'Tis the ſame which Inſpires the Poets with what is impoſſible for them to conceive (ſays the ſame Divine Philoſopher) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Divine Revelation. Whereupon he adds, <hi>Well may a Poet be all in Flames and Raptures, his Perſon being wholly Sacred, he can ſing nothing but what is full of God, who agitates him, tranſporting him beyond himſelf, and above his own Reaſon: But as for thoſe of an unelevated Spirit, they can never make moving Verſes, nor prevail in Propheſy. It is not then from any humane Art Poets chaunt ſuch fine things, that thou, O</hi> Homer, <hi>breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, but rather from Tranſports Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This third Difference of Wit adjuſted by <hi>Plato,</hi> is actually found among Men, of which I am an Eye-witneſs, and could alſo, if need were, with a Finger point out thoſe that have it: But to aſſert what they ſay to be by Divine Revelation, and not to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:53763:30"/>
proceed from their particular Nature, would be an apparent and manifeſt Abuſe, and ill-becoming ſo great a Philoſopher as <hi>Plato</hi>; and is to have recourſe to Univerſal Cauſes, without having before-hand made an exact Enquiry into Particulars. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did better, who being curious to know the Reaſon of thoſe wonderful things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd in his time by the <hi>Sibyls,</hi> ſaid, <hi>That it came not to paſs by Diſtemper nor by Divine Inſpiration, but only by a natural Ill-Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament.</hi> The Cauſe whereof is evident in natural Philoſophy; for all the governing Faculties in Man, the Natural, the Vital, the Animal, and even the Rational, require each their particular Temperament to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Functions as they ought, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing, or interfering one with another. The Natural Virtue, as digeſtive of the Food in the Stomach, muſt have a due Heat; that which gives Appetite, Cold; the Retentive, Drineſs; and the Expulſive, of what is Nauſeous or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, a due Moiſture. Whichſoever of theſe Faculties poſſeſſes in a greater degree any of the four Qualities, by which it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, will thereby become more powerful in that Point, but not without impairing the reſt; becauſe, in effect, it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that all the four Virtues and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould be aſſembled in one and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:53763:30"/>
ſame place; ſince if that which requires ſome Heat, becomes more Potent; the other that operates by Cold, cannot but be found more Weak: Which made <hi>Galen</hi> ſay, That a hot Stomach digeſted much, yet had a bad Appetite; that a cold Stomach dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ill, but had a good one. The ſame thing happens in the Senſes, and Motions, which are Operations of the Animal Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Great Strength of Body ſhews abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Earthineſs in the Nerves and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; for if thoſe Parts are not ſinewy, hard and dry, they cannot act ſteadily: On the contrary, to have a quick and lively Senſe, is a ſign the Nerves are compos'd of more airy, fine, and delicate Parts; and that their Temperament is hot and moiſt: How is it then poſſible that the ſame Nerves ſhould have the Temperament, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Compoſition which is requir'd for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and for Senſe, at one and the ſame time, ſeeing that for theſe two things, there muſt be quite contrary Qualities? Which is clear'd from Experience; for whereas a Man that is very Robuſt of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, has infallibly the Senſe of Touching rude and groſs, ſo when that Senſe is very exquiſite, he is faint, and if one may ſay ſo, ravelled out.</p>
               <p>The Rational Powers, Memory, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and Underſtanding are under the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:53763:31"/>
ſame Rules. The Memory to be good and tenacious, requires ſome Moiſture, and that the Brain be of a groſs Subſtance, as we ſhall prove hereafter: On the contrary, the Underſtanding muſt have a dry Brain, compos'd of very ſubtile and delicate Parts: The Memory then proceeding to a pitch, the Underſtanding muſt neceſſarily be lower'd and diminiſh'd as much: But be it as it will, I beg the curious Reader to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon all the Men he has known en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with an Excellent Memory, and I am aſſur'd he'll find, as to the Operations belonging to the Underſtanding, they are in a manner indiſcernible.</p>
               <p>The ſame happens as to the Imagination when it exerts its ſelf: For as to the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations relating to it, it produceth prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conceptions, and ſuch as aſtoniſhed <hi>Plato:</hi> And when a Man endued with ſuch an Imagination, comes to concern himſelf in acting with Underſtanding, one may bind him without doing him any Injury, as a Lunatic, and void of Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Whence may be concluded, that the Wiſdom of Man muſt be moderate, well tempered, and not ſo unequal; as <hi>Galen</hi> eſteems thoſe the wiſeſt Men that are well tempered, becauſe, <hi>they are not as it were intoxicate with too much Wiſdom.</hi>

                  <hi>Democritus</hi> was one of the greateſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Moral Philoſophers of his Time, though <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid of him, That he was a better Divine than Naturaliſt, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at ſo great a Perfection of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in his Old Age, that he entirely loſt his Imagination, inſomuch, that he both ſaid and did things ſo extraordinary, that the whole City of <hi>Abdera</hi> took him for a Natural, and accordingly diſpatch'd a Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier to the Iſle of <hi>Coa,</hi> where <hi>Hippocrates</hi> lived, to entreat him earneſtly, with offer of abundance of rich Preſents, to come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to Cure <hi>Democritus,</hi> who had loſt all his Senſes: Which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily complied with, as being curious to ſee and confer with the Man, of whoſe admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Wiſdom he had heard ſo much noiſe; He departed that very inſtant, and being arrived at the Place of his Abode, which was a Deſart, where he lived on a Plain, he fell to diſcourſe him; and upon asking him Queſtions in order to diſcover the Defects of his Rational Faculty, found him the Wiſeſt Man in the World; and told them that had brought him thither, That they themſelves were Fools, and void of Senſe, for having given ſo raſh a Judgment of ſo Diſcreet a Perſon; for as good Fortune would have it for <hi>Democritus,</hi> the Matters treated on with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi>

               <head>CHAP. II. The Differences amongſt Men unqualified for Science.</head>
               <p>ONE of the greateſt Indignities that can be offer'd in Words to a Man ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Years of Diſcretion, is, ſaid <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> to accuſe him of want of Wit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his Honour and Nobility, as <hi>Cicero</hi> obſerves, conſiſts in his being favour'd with, and having an Eloquent Tongue: <hi>As Wit is the Ornament of a Man, ſo Eloquence is the Light and Beauty of Wit.</hi> In this alone he diſtinguiſhes himſelf from the Brutes, and approaches near to God, as being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Glory which is poſſible to be obtained in Nature. On the contrary, he that is born a Blockhead, is incapable of any ſort of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature; and where there is no Wiſdom, there, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> can neither be true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor good Fortune; inſomuch, as the wiſe Man declared, <hi>The Fool is born to his own Shame,</hi> ſeeing he muſt neceſſarily be degraded to the inferior Animals, and be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:53763:32"/>
one of the Herd, although he enjoy other Advantages, as well thoſe of Nature as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, in being Handſom, Noble, Rich, High-born, and raiſed even to the Dignity of a King or Emperor.</p>
               <p>This will appear yet more evident, if we come to conſider the Happy and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable State in which the firſt Man was placed before he loſt the Wit with which he was Created, and what he was after he was ſpoiled of his Wiſdom; <hi>Man that is in Honour, and underſtandeth not, is like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> Where we may obſerve, that Sacred Writ is not content to compare him only to other Animals, but even to the Brutes of the Brutes; if we remember that in another place it has praiſed the Wiſdom and Subtilty of the Serpent and the Ant, with whom, of all kinds of Creatures, Man without Wit bears no compariſon.</p>
               <p>Now the Sacred Text with a more particular regard to the greatneſs of this Indignity, and to the ill Opinion concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him, who lies under ſo unhappy an Imputation, has declared, <hi>Whoſoever in Anger ſhall ſay to his Brother, Racha, (as much as to ſay Shallow-Pate) ſhall be in danger of the Council; but whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou Fool, ſhall be in danger of Hell Fire.</hi> Hitherto this Indignity has paſſed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than a bare Examination and Cenſure
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:53763:33"/>
in ſo many Courts and Tribunals, becauſe in a heap of Words even this may have dropt from one to another, <hi>Racha,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Paſſion, and with no deſign of Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. From him that has an excellent Underſtanding, we have taken away Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; from him that is endued with a happy Memory, the Underſtanding; from him whoſe Imagination is Excellent, both Underſtanding and Memory; from the Practical Preacher, School Divinity; and from the great School Divine, Polemical Divinity: To him that has been well vers'd in Poſitive Divinity, we have ſaid that all his Stock of Sufficiency lay only in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, a picquant Touch that has galled, from him that ſhould be a good Advocate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have taken away all kind of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and after this manner we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded for the moſt part; but becauſe we have not yet call'd any Man Fool or Dunce, the Imputation has not deſerv'd Fire.</p>
               <p>Now I foreſee ſome that have read this Book again and again, looking for the Chapter that diſcovers their <hi>Genius,</hi> and what kind of Learning they ſhould advance moſt in, but not finding it, are ready to Arraign the Title of this Book of Falſity, and to ſay, that the Author made large Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, but that his Performances were as ſlender; and not ſatisfied with that, take
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53763:33"/>
the Liberty of making many other baſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, as if I were oblig'd in this Work, to give Wit to thoſe to whom God and Nature have denied it.</p>
               <p>The Wiſe Man has given us two very juſt and reaſonable Cautions, which by conſequence he requires us to obſerve. The one is, <hi>Anſwer not a Fool according to his folly, leſt thou alſo be like unto him</hi>; the other, <hi>Anſwer a Fool according to his folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own conceit</hi>; and not unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe nothing can be more prejudicial to the good of the Commonwealth, than for a Fool to paſs for a Man of Senſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he have any Poſt in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And for what touches the <hi>Tryal of Wits,</hi> of which we treat, 'tis certain that Learning and Wiſdom, as much more as they qualify a Man for Diſcourſe and Philoſophizing, ſo much and more they expoſe him that by Nature is a Blockhead. <hi>Learning is a ſnare to the feet of the Fool, and as Manicles to his right hands:</hi> He that is not a Man of Parts, will be much more paſſable without Letters than with them; becauſe when one is not engag'd in any Study, he may live in the World with leſs noiſe. Therefore Arts and Sciences are in a manner Chains to fetter the Minds of Fools, rather than to diſpoſe them to be more free and eaſy; which may be clearly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53763:34"/>
ſeen in Univerſity Scholars, amongſt whom ſome may be found that learn more in the firſt Year than in the ſecond, and in the ſecond more than in the third: Whence came the ſaying, In the firſt Year, they are <hi>Doctors</hi>; in the ſecond, <hi>Licentiates</hi>; in the third, <hi>Batchelors</hi>; and in the fourth, <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ramus's</hi>; and the reaſon of it is, as the Wiſeman ſaid, The Precepts and Rules of Arts are but Letters for Inſipids. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, knowing full well that many ſuch have read, and will read this Treatiſe, in hope to find what Wit and Ability falls to their ſhare; it ſeems proper to me, that I ſhould obſerve the Wiſe-Man's Precept, in ſetting forth here the different Diſabilities to be found amongſt Men, with reſpect to Learning, and by what Marks one may know them, to the end that they who come to ſeek their own kind of Wit, may in lieu thereof meet with the Indications of their Incapacity, in imitation of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Anſwer not a Fool</hi>; for by this means taking their ſolemn leave of Letters, it may be they will apply themſelves to another manner of Life, much more agreeable to the ſenſe they have, than the other, ſeeing that there is no Man, how groſs and imperfect ſoever formed, but Nature has deſign'd him for ſomething.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53763:34"/>To come then to matter of Fact, you muſt know to the <hi>three kinds</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the foregoing Chapter, correſpond <hi>three</hi> reſpective <hi>kinds</hi> of <hi>Diſability.</hi> There are ſome Men whoſe Souls are ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſt in Matter, and clogg'd with the Qualities of the Body, that oppreſs the Rational Faculty, that they are eternally incapable of conceiving or acting any thing relating to Learning and Knowledge. The Diſability of theſe People, very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of Eunuchs; for as there are Men unable for Generation, wanting the Parts proper thereunto, ſo likewiſe are there diſabled Underſtandings, cold and malefic, if one may ſay ſo, without natural Heat or Vigor to emit the leaſt thought of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; theſe never arrive ſo much as at the firſt Principles of all Arts implanted in the Scholar's Mind, before he begin to learn, for which the Wit can give no other proofs of it ſelf, than to receive them as things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready known; and if he be not able to form an Idea of them in his Mind, we may ſtrongly conclude him wholly incapable of the Sciences, and that the Gate through which they ſhould paſs is compleatly barr'd; ſo that he need not break his Brains to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, for neither the Laſh of the Rod, nor his Cries, nor Method, nor Examples, nor Time, nor Experience, nor any thing in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53763:35"/>
Nature can ſufficiently Excite him to bring forth any thing. The Men of this Incapacity differ not at all from Brute Beaſts, they are ever drowſy, nor ſeem they ever to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake; of ſuch the Wiſe-man ſpeaks, <hi>To ſet the Treaſures of Wiſdom before the Eyes of a Fool, is as ſpeaking to a Man in a ſound Sleep</hi>; the Compariſon is very juſt and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, becauſe <hi>Sleep</hi> and <hi>Stupidity</hi> proceed alike from the ſame Principles, that is to ſay, the great Coldneſs and exceeding Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Brain.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of Incapacity in Wit, not quite ſo Stupid as the former, becauſe at leaſt they conceive the firſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and draw Concluſions thence, tho' few, and not without much pains; but the Impreſſion of them remains in their Memories no longer than their Maſters are talking to them, and making them underſtand the ſame by Examples and Methods of Teaching, agreeable to their rude and groſs Underſtandings. They reſemble ſome Women, who being big with Child, are delivered, but the Child dies as ſoon as it is born. Theſe Mens Brains are full of a Flegmatic Moiſture, for which cauſe the Ideas finding nothing Oily, or Viſcous, neither ſtick nor are pliant; ſo to teach them, would be to draw Water with a Sieve. <hi>A Fool's Heart and Mind
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:53763:35"/>
are like a bottomleſs Veſſel, pour what Precepts of Wiſdom you pleaſe in, none will remain there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a third ſort of Diſability very common among Men of Letters, who have ſome ſmattering of Wit; for they take the firſt Notions, and draw thence their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, with which they overcharge and load their Memory, but when they ſhould range every thing in Order, commit a Thouſand Blunders. Theſe may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd to a Woman deliver'd of a Child with the Head in the place of the Feet, and the Eyes ſeated behind the Head. There is found ſo great a Confuſion of the Figures in the Memory of this third ſort of Inſipids, that when they would be underſtood, they have no leſs than an Hundred ways of ſpeaking to Expreſs themſelves, becauſe they have conceiv'd an Infinity of things, altogether undigeſted, and without Order or Connexion of Parts. Theſe in the Schools are call'd Confus'd, whoſe Brains are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal, as well in Subſtance as Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in ſome places compos'd of delicate Parts, and in others of groſs, and ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd; and becauſe it is alſo Various and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uniform, ſometimes they ſpeak Witty and Notable things, and immediately after fall into a Thouſand Impertinences: Of theſe it is ſaid, <hi>A Fool's Wiſdom in his Brains is like a Houſe in Ruins, his Knowledge wants Words to expreſs its ſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53763:36"/>Nay, I have obſerv'd a fourth Defect amongſt Men of Letters, which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Incapacity, and yet they have not Wit enough; for I find they that poſſeſs it, take Learning, retain it firmly in their Memory, fix the Forms with the Correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence they ought to have, ſpeaking and acting very well when there is occaſion for it, but if one ſounds them, and ſhould ask the Eſſential Cauſes of what they know and underſtand, they are eaſily found they have no bottom, and that all their Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficience was but a Facility to comprehend the Terms and Axioms of the Doctrin they were taught, without penetrating why, or how it was ſo. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of theſe, <hi>That there are ſome Men who Brute-beaſt-like ſpeak by Natural Inſtinct, and ſay more than they know, or conſider, after the manner of inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Beings, who fail not to act very well, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are as inſenſible of the Effects they produce, as the Fire of what it burns; and the Cauſe of this is, Nature leads them, ſo that they cannot fail of attaining their End. Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> might well have compar'd them to ſome Animals, who ſeem to perform all their Actions with a ſhow of Reaſon and Deſign; but he ſuppoſing theſe Animals had at leaſt ſome kind of knowledge of what they did, paſt to Inanimate Agents, becauſe in his Opinion, theſe though not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:53763:36"/>
wiſe, and wanting Wit, yet operated, and very well too, without being able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Effect from the ultimate Cauſe. This difference of Incapacity, or if you pleaſe of Wit, might be fully made out, if without offence to any, I were permitted to point to them with my Finger, for I have both ſeen and known many ſuch.</p>

                  <hi>Plato</hi> will ſoon be ſatisfied of the Truth of this Doctrin, who tells us, That <hi>Socrates</hi> was the Son (as he himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts) of a Midwife, yet that his Mother (though of great Experience in her Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) could not deliver a Woman that came to her,<note rend="inter">That Compariſon may be Verified in <hi>Socrates</hi>'s Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alone, becauſe he taught by Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; in a manner cauſing the Scholar to attain the Science without being taught it.</note> except ſhe were firſt with Child; ſo likewiſe he in (imitation of his Mother) could not inculcate Learning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Scholars, if their <hi>Genius</hi> was not adapted to it, he knew full well, Sciences were in a manner natural to thoſe only that had proper Wits; and ſo it happens (as we find by Experience) to thoſe that have forgot what they knew for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, who upon receiving the leaſt Hints, recollect the whole matter. Nor have Maſters any more to do with their Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars (as I take it) than to open the way to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53763:38"/>
Learning; for if they have good Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by theſe alone they may attain great Perfection; otherwiſe they do but plague themſelves and their Teachers, and will never arrive at what they pretend to. For were I my ſelf a Maſter, before I received any Scholar to my School, I would ſift him narrowly, to find out if I could, what kind of <hi>Genius</hi> he had; and if I diſcover'd in him a propenſity for Learning, I profeſs I ſhould chearfully receive him; for it is a great ſatisfaction to the Teacher to inſtruct a Man of Parts, otherwiſe I ſhould adviſe him, to apply himſelf to ſome Study fitter for him; but if I found he was not in the leaſt capable of any Learning, I ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to him in ſuch tender and endearing Words as theſe; Brother, there being no likelihood of your ever ſucceeding in what you have undertaken, for God's ſake, waſte no more Time, nor loſe no more Pains, but ſeek out ſome other way to live, that requires not ſuch Abilities as Learning.</p>
               <p>Experience exactly agrees with this, for we ſee a great many Scholars enter upon the Study of each Science (let the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter be good or bad) and in the concluſion, ſome attain to great Learning, others to indifferent, and the reſt have done nothing throughout their whole courſe, but loſt their Time, ſpent their Money, and beat their Brains to no purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:53763:39"/>I cannot imagin how this ſhould happen, they all having the ſame Maſter, and uſing equal care and diligence of their own; the Dull too, it may be, taking more pains than the Sharp Witted. The Difficulty yet ſeems greater, when we obſerve that thoſe who are unapt for one, are fit for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Science; and the moſt Ingenious in one ſort of Learning, proceeding to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make nothing of it. Nay, I my ſelf can atteſt the Truth of this, for there were three School-fellows of us, that were ſet at the ſame time to learn <hi>Latin,</hi> one took it very readily, the other two could never ſo much as make a tolerable Oration. However, all three fell upon Logic, and one that could make no hand of <hi>Grammar,</hi> Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle-like penetrated into that Art, whereas the other two could not advance the leaſt ſtep therein, during the whole Courſe. But then again, all three paſſing to the Study of <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> a thing very obſervable, he that could neither learn <hi>Latin,</hi> nor <hi>Logic,</hi> in a few days ſpace underſtood Aſtronomy bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the Maſter that taught him, of which the other two could underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Whereat being a little ſurpriz'd, I forthwith began to Reaſon, and play the Philoſopher, and at length found, that each Science required a particular and proper <hi>Genius,</hi> which being diverted from that,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53763:39"/>
was inſignificant in any other. Admitting this to be true (as it is, of which we ſhall by and by give Proof) whoever ſhould at this time of day, go into any of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, to found and examin their Abilities, how many would he move from one Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to another, and how many would he turn out of Doors for Dunces, and Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, and how many would he put in their places, whoſe narrow Fortunes have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd them to ſome Mechanic Trade, that nevertheleſs are by Nature better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for Learning? But ſeeing this is not to be done, nor remedied, we ſhall even leave it as we found it.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be denied, but that, as I have ſaid, ſome Wits that are diſpos'd for one, are not ſo fit for another Science. And for that very reaſon, it is convenient before the Child be ſent to School, to diſcover his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and the tendency of his Parts, to find out what Study is moſt agreeable to his Capacity, ſo to order Matters, that he wholly apply himſelf to that. But it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite alſo to recollect that what I have ſaid upon this occaſion, is not ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a Learned Man, but we muſt conſider other Qualifications no leſs neceſſary than a natural Diſpoſition.

The Age adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Sciences being known, a proper place to learn them in ſhould be forthwith ſought after, where they teach nothing elſe<note n="*" place="margin">Cic. 1.

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53763:42"/>
a meer chance, not in the choice of the Pupil, to come at that very inſtant the Univerſity is ſtored with good or bad Tutors. Thus it befel certain Phyſicians (of whom <note n="*" place="margin">VIII. Meth c. IV.</note> 
                  <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> makes mention) who being convinc'd from Reaſon and Experience of the Errors in their Practice, ſo highly prejudicial to Mens Bodies, dropt Tears from their Eyes in the Preſence of the ſame Phyſician, and began to Curſe their ill Fate, for lighting on ſuch bad Maſters, when they entred on their Studies. True it is, there are to be found ſome Sagacious Pupils, that can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately penetrate into the Parts of their Tutor, and if his Doctrin be bad, reject, if good, approve it. Such as theſe, at the long run inſtruct their Maſters more than he does them; for in ſifting, and ſubtilly poſing them, they inform him in the ſharp Replies they make, ſuch as he would never have once dream'd of, or known, if the Scholar by his happy Wit had not put them into his Head. But of ſuch as can do theſe feats, there be but one or two at moſt, but the Dunces are without Number; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is expedient (ſeeing no care is taken to Elect and Examin what Wits are fit for Sciences) that the Academies ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways provided with able Maſters, of clear Heads, and ſound Learning, which may not impoſe their Errors and falſe Doctrins on the Ignorant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53763:42"/>The fourth Conſideration to be made uſe of, is, to Study the Science with Order, beginning at its very Principles, paſſing through the middle to the end, not making thoſe Firſt Principles, which preſuppoſe Others. For this reaſon it was ever eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fault to hear ſeveral Lectures on divers Subjects, and to carry them home promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, leaving, by this means, ſuch a medly of things in the Underſtanding, that when they come to be put in Practice, a Man can have no recourſe to the Precepts of his Art, becauſe they are not in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Order: It is much better to take ſome pains in each diſtinct Study, in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod moſt natural to its Inſtitution, becauſe the ſame way it is acquir'd, it will be ſtill retain'd in the Memory. And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly it is neceſſary this be obſerv'd by ſuch as have naturally a confus'd Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which may be eaſily remedied, by hearing one thing at once, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over, to proceed to another, and ſo till the whole Art be run through. <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Ordin. li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bror. ſuo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> well knowing of what Importance it was to ſtudy the Matter with Method and Order, Writ a Book on purpoſe to direct the Method which ought to be obſerv'd in Reading his Works, to the end the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian might not be confounded. To this Others add, That a Scholar in Learning
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53763:43"/>
ſhould never have more than one Book, in which is clearly contain'd the Point he Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and apply himſelf to that alone, and not to many, leſt he ſhould be confounded and perplex'd; and ſo far they are in the right. The laſt thing that makes a very Learned Man, is to ſpend much time in Study, to wait patiently its Digeſtion, and to allow it good Settlement; for even as the Body is not nouriſhed by the quantity of what we Eat or Drink in a day, ſo much as by the quality of it, when it is aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and digeſted by the Stomach; ſo our Underſtanding is not improv'd by the great deal we read in a ſhort time, but by what we underſtand by little and little, and pauſe upon between whiles. Our Wit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes more and more each day, in light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by length of time upon thoſe things we ſhould not otherwiſe have known or apprehended. Wit, like Plant, Animal, and Man, has its ſeveral Stages, that is to ſay, its Beginning, Progreſſion, Perfect State and Declenſion: It ſprings in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, grows up in Nonage, comes to a Conſiſtence in the Middle-age, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines in Old Age. So that he, who would know when his Underſtanding is at the Pitch of Perfection, may be aſſur'd 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Thirty-three, and the end of Fifty Years, more or leſs; in which compaſs, he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:53763:43"/>
may be able to judge of Grave Authors, who in the courſe of their Lives have broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uncommon Opinions. And whoever would write Books, ſhould do it at that very Age, not ſooner, or later, unleſs he would eat his Words, or change his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. However the Age of Man holds not in all People the ſame Meaſure and Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for in ſome, Childhood draws to a Period in the Twelfth; in others, not till the Fourteenth; in ſome, it determines the Sixteenth; and in the reſt, not till the Eighteenth Year. Theſe live long, becauſe their Youth reaches not to little leſs than Forty; and their Manhood holds on to Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years. Beſides which, they have Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years of Old Age; whence their Thread ſtretches to Eighty; which is the limit of the Healthieſt. The firſt that finiſh their Childhood at Twelve Years, are very ſhort liv'd, begin early to Diſcourſe, their Beard comes ſoon, and their Wit laſts but a little time; theſe ordinarily decline at Thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five, and end their Days at Eight and forty Years.</p>
               <p>There is not one of all the Qualifications already mention'd, but what is very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, uſeful, and convenient to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the young Student may come to ſomething; but above all, to poſſeſs a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> ſuitable to the Science he is to Study.

               <p>IT is a common Saying, and much uſed by the Antient Philoſophers, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture qualifies Man for Learning: Art with its Rules and Precepts facilitates, but Uſe and Experience of Particulars gains the Maſtery. But no Man has yet declared what this Nature is, nor in what Claſs of Cauſes it ought to be rank'd; they only affirm, <hi>Whoſoever pretends to Learning, and wants that alone, Arts, Experience, Maſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Books, and Induſtry prove but all in Vain.</hi> There is a great Conteſt between the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophers, and the Vulgar, about aſſigning the cauſe of this Effect; The Vulgar obſerving a Man of great Abilities, immediately declare God to be the Author of them, without giving themſelves any further trouble, and with good reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in <hi>Effect every good and perfect Gift cometh from above, from the Father of Lights.</hi> There is no Natural Cauſe (ſay the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers) can produce Effects arm'd with ſuch Force and Energy as God: So far they are all agreed, that the firſt Cauſe heats more than Fire, refreſhes more than Water, illuminates more than the Sun himſelf, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:53763:45"/>
in our particular Formation, 'tis that which preſides over Nature, and that diſpenſes or denies Wit to Men. Which Conſideration made the Royal Prophet <hi>David</hi> cry out, <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhioned me, give me <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding that I may learn thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi> All the Antient Philoſophers in a ſort confeſs the ſame thing, by Inſtinct of Nature alone, conducted by right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to atteſt this Truth in ſpight of all Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. 'Twas upon that foot, <hi>Plato</hi> knowing no City could be built without the Divine Aſſiſtance, nor any good Laws made to conſerve Men in Peace after an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, framed a Law, by which it was provided, <hi>That the Divine Aſſiſtance ſhould be invoked at the beginning of every Action, becauſe without that no good thing could have a juſt Accompliſhment.</hi> Which is the ſame thing that was ſaid by King <hi>David</hi> before, <hi>Except the Lord keep the City, the Watchman waketh but in vain. Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> deſigning to reduce into Method the Art of Curing thoſe Diſeaſes to which Women, by reaſon of their Sex, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and eſteeming it to be a very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter, ſaid, <hi>He that would treat of theſe Matters to purpoſe, ought firſt to invoke the Gods, and afterwards to conſider and nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtinguiſh the Nature, Age, and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Women, as alſo the Climate where
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53763:45"/>
they live.</hi> Which the Natural Philoſophers could not away with, becauſe when they were to ſearch into the Cauſe of any Effect, they ſtop'd at the Firſt and Univerſal, without looking further, of having regard to the Order or Dependence of Second Cauſes, as if they had not been Influenc'd to produce ſuch an Effect. Which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to blame <hi>Diana</hi>'s Prieſts for moving the Women, in their grievous Diſeaſes, to offer up at the Temple, their ſtately Garments, and moſt precious Jewels, and to leave there the Medicines; whereas the proper Remedy for their Malady, was (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays) to Bleed, or Purge, it may be, or adviſe them to Marry, if they were at Age. A Natural Philoſopher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Diſcourſe one day with a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, a curious Gardiner came up to them, and asked them, what was the reaſon that having taken ſuch pains with the Earth, to dig, to ſift, to cleanſe, and dung it, yet it never brought forth ſo good Seed as he Sow'd; whereas the Plants it produc'd of its own accord, grew up with a great deal of eaſe? The Grammarian anſwer'd, It came to paſs by the Divine Providence, which had ſo diſpos'd it, for the good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World. But the Natural Philoſopher fell a Laughing at that anſwer, ſeeing he had recourſe to God, as being Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:53763:46"/>
of the Connexion of Natural Cauſes, and in what manner their Effects are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. The other ſeeing him laugh,<note rend="inter">A Man ought to know enough of each Science, how far its Juriſdiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, and what Queſtions properly belong to it.</note> ask'd him if he ridicul'd him? The Philoſopher anſwer'd, it was not him, but the Maſter that had taught him no better, becauſe the Cognizance and Solution of the Motions of Divine Providence (as they are Supernatural Acts) appertain to the Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicians (now a-days called Divines) for the Gardener's queſtion was Natural, and properly belong'd to the Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, thoſe being eſtabliſh'd and manifeſt Cauſes, whence ſuch Effects are produc'd. For which reaſon the Philoſopher ſays, That the Earth reſembled a Mother-in-law, that took a particular care of her own Children, but ſtarved thoſe of her Husband; for we obſerve hers to be plump and in good liking, but the other meager, lank, and ill colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Plants the Earth produces of her ſelf, come out of her own Bowels; thoſe the Gardener raiſes, are forc'd by Art, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Daughters of another ſtrange Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, void of the Virtue and Nouriſhment that ſhould make them thrive, and what is communicated only to the Plants, ſhe her ſelf brings forth.</p>

                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> confirm'd this in his Viſit he made to the great Philoſopher <hi>Democritus,</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53763:46"/>
who acquainted him with the falſe Notions the People had of Phyſic, who, as if they were free from all Diſeaſes, had nothing in their Mouths, but that God had healed them, and if it had not pleaſed him, the Phyſicians Care and Skill had been all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to no purpoſe, and the like. This is the old way of Talking, and which has ſo often been in vain exploded by the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, that it is not worth while to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſilence it; Neither is it altogether convenient, becauſe the Vulgar, who are not acquainted with the particular Cauſes of any Effect whatever, anſwer better, and with more truth, from the univerſal Cauſe (which is God) than to run into Impertinences. However, I have many times conſider'd with my ſelf, whence it ſhould come, that the Vulgar ſhould ſo readily aſcribe all things to God, taking no notice at all of Nature, and not without ſome ſecret Abhorrence of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Means. I know not well how to divine the true Cauſe, but thus much I find, that the Generality of People being ignorant, which Effects more immediately to refer to God, and which to Nature, prate after this manner; beſides, that Men are (for the moſt part) impatient, and Friends to thoſe that firſt gratify their Deſires. And the Proceſs of Nature being ſlow, and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring length of Time, they have not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53763:47"/>
to attend the Event, but knowing the Omnipotence of God, who in an Inſtant does what he pleaſes, of which they want not many Inſtances, they either beg at his Hands Health, with the <hi>Paralitic</hi>; or Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with <hi>Solomon</hi>; or Riches, with <hi>Job</hi>; or Deliverance from their Enemies, with <hi>David.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>An other Reaſon is, becauſe Men are Opinionative and Conceited, moſt of them wiſhing in their Hearts that God would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them by ſome particular Favour, not in the common Road, and as he makes the Sun to ſhine upon the Juſt and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and the Rain to deſcend upon all alike; Favours being rather the more eſteem'd, by how much the Rarer they are, and more Appropriate to a few. Upon which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence we have ſeen many Men feign Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, in Times, and Places of Devotion, for which cauſe People flock about them, and pay juſt Veneration to them, (as Perſons in Favour and Eſteem with Heaven) and if they are poor, they beſtow conſiderable Alms upon them, who play the Religious Counterfeits for Intereſt.</p>
               <p>The third Cauſe is, Men are lovers of their Eaſe, and Natural Cauſes being in ſuch an Order, and Concatenation, as requires a great deal of Time and Application to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Effects; therefore they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:53763:47"/>
God ſhould exert his Omnipotence, that ſo they might without the leaſt Pain or Delay obtain their Deſires. I ſhall take no notice of the Malice of thoſe, who ſeek for Miracles from God, to tempt his Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, to try if he can work them; nor of others, who to gratify their Revenge, call for Fire from Heaven, and the like ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Inſtances of the Divine Vengeance.</p>
               <p>The laſt Reaſon is, that the Vulgar, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, are very Religious, and deſirous that God ſhould be greatly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and much Glorified, which comes to paſs by Miracles, rather than Natural Events; for the common People are not aware, that God is not the Author of all Supernatural and Extraordinary things, ſo much to proclaim his Almighty Power to the Ignorant, as to employ them as nobler Arguments to confirm his Doctrin, and that unleſs upon ſuch an Emergency, he never works any. This is eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if we conſider, that God works not now ſuch Miracles as once in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and the Reaſon is, becauſe he has already done all that was neceſſary on his part, that Man might not pretend Ignorance, but to imagine that he ſhould be ready to employ the ſame Arguments again and again, and work new Miracles to confirm afreſh his old Doctrin (as in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:53763:48"/>
Inſtances of raiſing the Dead, giving Sight to the Blind, Feet to the Lame and Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litic) is a great miſtake; for at the ſame inſtant as God teaches Men what is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient, he confirms it by Miracles, without repeating them every day a-new. <note n="*" place="margin">Job ch. XXXIII.</note> 
                  <hi>God ſpoke once, and did not repeat the ſame a ſecond time.</hi> The cleareſt Indication I have to diſcover a Man that has no Wit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to Natural Philoſophy, is, when I ſee him referring all things to Miracles, without any diſtinction: As on the other hand, there is no need to call in queſtion their Underſtanding, who cannot reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without diſcerning the particular Cauſe of every Effect. Theſe are well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that ſome Events are to be referred immediately to God, as are Miracles; and others again to Nature, as thoſe that have their immediate Cauſes, from which they ordinarily flow. But let us talk at what rate we pleaſe, God is always underſtood to be the Author, even of the laſt; for when <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. 1. de Coelo.</note> 
                  <hi>God and Nature make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in Vain,</hi> he never meant that Nature was an Univerſal Cauſe, having a Power independent upon God, but a Name only of that Order and Subordinate Rule ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God himſelf, in the Creation of the World, to the end that ſuch Effects might duly ſucceed, as were neceſſary to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:53763:48"/>
its Conſervation and Continuance in the ſame ſtate. So we ſay the King and Civil Right can do no Wrong, by which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking, no Man takes the Term (Right) to ſignifie another Prince of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Juriſdiction from the King, but rather as a Term by its ſignification importing all the Laws and Ordinances made by the King himſelf to preſerve the State in Peace.</p>
               <p>Like as a King has ſome peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives, that cannot be Determined by the Law, as being Paramount and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary; even ſo has God reſerv'd to himſelf the Effects of Miracles, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of which, he has given no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Power to Natural Cauſes; where, by the way, we may obſerve that he who takes them for ſuch, and can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from natural Effects, muſt needs be a very acute Natural Philoſopher, and underſtand no leſs than every Effect, as it ſprings from its immediate Cauſe, tho' this is not enough neither, if the Catholic Church hath never declared them for ſuch;<note rend="inter">The Ignorance of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy makes Men aſſign Miracles where they ſhould not.</note> for like as Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates engaged in the Study of the Civil Law, have it imprint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Memory, the better to know and underſtand the Kings Pleaſure in the Determination of each particular Caſe: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſo the Natural Philoſophers (being
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53763:49"/>
Advocates in their Faculty) place their whole Study in this, to know the Order God eſtabliſh'd at the inſtant he created the World, the better to diſcern what Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes produce, what Effects and why? And as it would be ridiculous for a Lawyer to alledge in his Breviate, as a ſtrong Proof, that the King commanded ſuch an Arreſt in ſuch a Caſe, without ſhewing the Law, and the Rule of Court, by which it ought to be decided: So the Natural Philoſophers laugh at them, who pronounce this or that is God's Work, without running through the Order, and inſeparable Connexion of all the particular Cauſes concern'd in its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Production.</p>
               <p>And for the ſame reaſon as a King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies to hearken to thoſe that preſs him to Abrogate and Null a juſt Law, or finally to decide a Caſe contrary to the ſtanding Rules and Orders of his Miniſterial Courts; ſo neither will God likely hearken to thoſe that importune him for Miracles and Signs out of the ordinary Courſe and Miniſtry of Nature, when there is no Occaſion for them. For ſhould a King every day null and make Laws, and alter the Courſe of Juſtice (be it for the diverſity of Occaſions, or through the changes in his Councils, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Right and Juſtice are not arrived at all at once) yet the Natural Order of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:53763:49"/>
Univerſe, by us called Nature, from the Creation to this Day, has ſuffer'd no Change or Alteration in the leaſt; for he made it with ſo much Wiſdom and Prudence, that not to continue conſtant in that Order, would be tacitly to lay a blame upon his Works.</p>
               <p>But to return to that common Saying of the Antient Philoſophers, <hi>Nature makes able</hi>; it is to be underſtood, that there is a Wit and Ability beſtow'd by God on Men, out of the ordinary Courſe of Nature, ſuch was the Wiſdom of the Apoſtles, who being rude and illiterate, were wonderfully enlightned and fill'd with Wiſdom and Knowledge. Which ſort of Parts and Qualifications ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify not that <hi>Nature makes able</hi>; for that is a Work to be attributed immediately to God, and not to Nature. The like is to be underſtood of the Wiſdom of the Prophets, and of all others, upon whom God has pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any of his Gifts. There is another ſort of Wit among Men, produced by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Dependence of Cauſes appointed by God to lead to ſuch an end; and of this kind it may be truly ſaid, <hi>Nature makes able.</hi> For (as we ſhall prove in the laſt Chapter of this Work) there is a certain Order and Dependence of Natural Cauſes, ſo that if Parents in the Act of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would duly obſerve it, all their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53763:50"/>
would be Wiſe, and none of them O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</p>
               <p>However, in this Diſcourſe ſuch a ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Nature is too looſe and confus'd, nor is the Underſtanding content to reſt here, without tracing every particular Effect up to its Ultimate Cauſe; and therefore there is need to find out another meaning of this Word (Nature) which may be more accommodate to our purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and all other Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, were more Particular, calling Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, every ſubſtantial Form that gives Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a thing, and is the Principle of all its Operations. In which ſenſe, our Rational Soul with good Reaſon is call'd Nature, for from thence we receive the Form and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have of Men, and the ſame is the Principle of all our Actions; for all Rational Souls are of equal Perfection (as well the Wiſe Man's as the Fool's) and ſo we may not pronounce, that it is Nature (in this ſenſe) makes a Man witty; for if that were true, all Men would be equal in Wit and Capacity, and thereupon the ſame <note n="†" place="margin">XXX. Sect. Prob. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> found out another Signification of Nature, importing the Reaſon and Cauſe of a Man's being capable or incapable; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Temperament of the four firſt Qualities (Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and Drineſs) were to be call'd Nature, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:53763:50"/>
as from them proceed all the Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Men, all the Virtues and Vices, and all the great variety of Wit we diſcover in the World. And he proves it clearly by conſidering the ſeveral Parts of the Age of the wiſeſt Man, who in his Childhood is no more than a Brute Beaſt, employing no other Powers than the Iraſcible and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible; when Youth comes, he betrays an admirable Wit, which we ſee continues to a certain Period, and no longer; for old Age drawing on, his Wit every day declines, till in the End it is wholly loſt. Aſſuredly the diverſity of Wit proceeds not from the Rational Soul, for that in all Ages is the ſame, without ſuffering any Alteration in its Vigor, or Subſtance, except a Man in the ſeveral Stages of his Life changes his Conſtitution, or has a different Diſpoſition; and from hence is it that the Soul acts one part in the Childhood, another in Youth, and yet another in old Age; whence may be drawn an evident Argument, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Soul performs contrary Acts in one and the ſame Body, by having in each Diviſion of Age, a different Temperament; whenſoever of two Boys, the one is Witty, the other a Dunce, the ſame happens by each having a diverſe Temperament from the other, which (being the Principle of all the Operations of the reaſonable Soul)
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53763:51"/>
is by Phyſicians and Philoſophers call'd Nature; in which ſenſe this Saying, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes able,</hi> is properly Verified. In confirmation of which Doctrin, <hi>Galen</hi> writ a Book, proving, that the Operations of the Soul were influenc'd by the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body, in which it dwelt; and that by reaſon either of the Heat, Cold, Moiſture and Drineſs, of the Climate where they lived, or the Qualities of the Meat, they eat, and of the Waters they drank, and of the Air they breathed in, ſome were Fools, and others Wiſe; ſome Stout, and others Cowards; ſome Cruel, and others Gentle; ſome Reſerv'd, and others Open; ſome Lyars, and others Speakers of Truth; ſome Traytors, and others Loyal; ſome Turbulent, and others Calm; ſome Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and others Sincere; ſome Sordid, and others Generous; ſome Modeſt, and others Impudent; ſome Incredulous, and others Credulous; in Proof of which, he quotes many Places out of <hi>Hippocrates, Plato,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> aſſerting, that the Diverſity of Nations as to the Frame of their Bodies, and the Turn of their Soul, was owing to this Difference of Temperament. Which is found true by Experience, how much the <hi>Greeks</hi> differ from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> from the <hi>Germans,</hi> and the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> from
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:53763:51"/>
the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Neither is this only to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in Parts ſo remote from each other, but if we conſider even the Provinces that ſurround all <hi>Spain,</hi> we may diſtribute the Virtues and Vices already mentioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Inhabitants, allotting to each his Virtue and his Vice reſpectively. For if we reflect on the Wit and Manners of the <hi>Catalans, Valentians, Murcians, Granadins, Andaluſians, Eſtremadurians, Portugueſes, Gallicians, Aſturians, Miquelets, Biſcayners, Navarrers, Arragonians,</hi> and <hi>Caſtilians,</hi> who ſees and knows not that they differ one from another, not only in the Lineaments of their Faces, and Make of their Bodies, but alſo in the Virtues and Vices of the Soul, and that all this is the Conſequence of each Provinces poſſeſſing a different Temperament? Nor is this Diverſity of Manners only to be obſerv'd in Countries ſo disjoined, but even in Places ſeated not more than a little League diſtant, the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Wit amongſt the Inhabitants is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be believed. Finally, what <hi>Galen</hi> writ in his Book, is the Foundation of this Work; although he did not arrive at the particular diſcuſſion of the Difference of Wits amongſt Men, nor the Sciences which each in particular required; yet he knew full well it was neceſſary to make a Repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of the Sciences among the Youth,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:53763:52"/>
and to aſſign to each, that which was moſt ſuitable to his <hi>Genius</hi>; when he ſaid, that Well-order'd Republics ſhould employ Men of great Wiſdom and Knowledge, who in their growing Years ſhould ſound the Wit and Natural Application of each, ſo to engage them to learn the Art moſt agreeable to them, not leaving it to them to act at their own choice.</p>

                  <hi>HIppocrates,</hi> in conſideration of the good diſpoſition of our Rational Souls, and how frail, and every way ſubject to change Human Bodies, wherein they dwell are; delivered a Sentence worthy ſo great an Author. <hi>Our Rational Soul is always the ſame, throughout the whole courſe of our Life, in Youth and in Age, when we are Children, and grown Men; the Body quite contrary, never continues in one State, nor is there any Means to keep it ſo.</hi> And although ſome Phyſicians have been in ſearch of an Art to this purpoſe, yet they have never been
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:53763:52"/>
able to prevent the Changes attending eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Age of Man, with all their Rules and Precepts: For Childhood is, and will be, hot and moiſt; Youth, temperate; Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, hot and dry; Middle-Age, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in heat and cold, but offending in too much drineſs; and Old-Age, cold and dry. We can no more hinder Heaven from changing the Weather almoſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than we can the Air making ſuch changeable Impreſſions on our Bodies. Whence he concludes to make a Man wiſe that was not ſo at firſt, there need not be any Jog in the Rational Soul, nor any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Meliorate its Nature; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that it is impoſſible, there is no need, it wanting in effect nothing of the Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Temper with which it was framed, that can hinder Man from performing in Perfection thoſe Actions that are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him. Therefore he ſaid, <hi>When the Four Elements, but more eſpecially Fire and Water, enter the Compoſition of Man's Body, in the ſame Proportion and Meaſure, the Soul becomes very Ingenious, and endued with an Excellent Memory; but if the Water exceed the Fire, it proves Stupid and Dull,</hi> not ſo much through any defect of her own, as from the Inſtrument wherewith ſhe acts being depraved. Which <hi>Galen</hi> weighing well, boldly concluded, that all the Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:53763:53"/>
and Diſpoſitions of the Rational Soul, follow'd without doubt the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Body, with which ſhe was clothed; and proceeding yet further, he blames the Moral Philoſophers, for not Studying Phyſic, ſeeing 'tis certain, that not only Prudence, which is the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Virtues, but alſo Fortitude, Juſtice, and Temperance, with their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Vices, depend in great meaſure on our Conſtitutions; therefore he ſaid, it was the Employment of Phyſic, to expel Vices from Man, and to introduce their contrary Virtues: So that he has left us an Art to Extinguiſh Luſt, and to raiſe Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to render the Proud, more Pliant and Tractable; the Covetous, Liberal; the Coward, Valiant; the Ignorant, Wiſe and Knowing; and all the care he employs to obtain his End, is, only to correct the Ill Conſtitution of the Body, by the aſſiſtance of Phyſic, and a Regimen correſponding to each Virtue, and contrary to each Vice, without any regard in the leaſt of the Soul, purſuant to the Opinion of <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> who openly declar'd, the Soul was not ſubject to any Change, and ſtood in need of no Power to acquit her ſelf of thoſe Ties ſhe was under, provided ſhe had good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans: Whereupon he conceiv'd it was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leſs than an Error, to ſeat the Virtues in
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:53763:53"/>
the Soul, and not in the Organs of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by which the Soul acted, and without which he thought no Virtue was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, except by introducing a new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament.</p>
               <p>But this Opinion of his is falſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that ordinarily receiv'd by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophers that the Virtues are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Habits, having their Seat in the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul; for ſuch as the Subject is, ſuch muſt be the Accident which is received: Moreover, that the Soul being the Agent and Mover, and the Body the Patient which is moved by it, it is much more to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to place the Virtues in the Agent, rather than in the Patient.</p>
               <p>And were the Virtues and Vices ſuch Habits as depended purely on the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, it might thence be concluded, that Man acted only as a Natural Agent, and not as a Free one; for ſo he would be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably ſway'd, in proportion to the good or bad Diſpoſition attending his Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by conſequence his Beſt Actions would deſerve no Reward, nor his Worſt no Puniſhment, according to the Saying, <hi>That as to things which are Natural to us, we can neither Merit nor Demerit.</hi> But on the contrary, we ſee a great many Perſons, who fail not to be Virtuous, in ſpite of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution that is Vitious and Deprav'd, and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:53763:54"/>
ſuch as rather diſpoſes them to Evil than Good, according to that Saying, <hi>That a wiſe Man is Superior to the ill Influences of Heaven:</hi> And for what concerns wiſe and diſcreet Actions, we ſee many indiſcreet Actions committed by very Wiſe and well Temper'd Men; as on the other ſide, not a few diſcreet Actions committed by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that are not ſo; and who are of no happy Conſtitution. Whence we may collect, that Prudence and Wiſdom, and other Human Virtues, are from the Soul, and depend not at all upon the Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Frame of Body, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> have vainly imagin'd. Though it may ſeem ſtrange, that theſe two great Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, and with them <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> were of the ſame Opinion, and all without Truth. We are to take notice therefore, that the Perfect Virtues, ſuch as the Moral Philoſophers treat of, are Spiritual Habits, which have place in the Rational Soul, and whoſe Being is altogether independent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Body. From which it is evident, there is in Man neither Virtue nor Vice, (I ſay nothing of Supernatural Virtues, as being not of this Rank) that has its proper Temperament of Body, either to facilitate, or retard him in his Actions; this Temperament then, the Moraliſts im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly call Virtue, or Vice, conſidering
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:53763:54"/>
that Men, ordinarily ſpeaking, betray no other Inclinations than thoſe mark'd out by this Temperament; I ſay ordinarily ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe in effect many Mens Souls are fill'd with perfect Virtue, although the Organs of their Body afford them no Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament ſubſervient to accompliſh the Deſires of the Soul; and yet nevertheleſs for all that, by virtue of their Free Will, they fail not to act like good Men, though not without ſome Struggle and Reluctance: According to which St. <hi>Paul</hi> has ſaid, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God after the Inward Man, but I ſee another Law in my Members warring againſt the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of Sin, which is in my Members. O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death? I thank God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. So then with the Mind I my ſelf ſerve the Law of God, but with the Fleſh the Law of Sin.</hi> In which Words St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us to underſtand, that he felt within himſelf two Laws, wholly oppoſite; one in his Soul, which made him to love God's Law; the other in his Members, that led him to Sin.</p>
               <p>Whence we may gather, that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues St. <hi>Paul</hi> had in his Soul, did not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with the Conſtitution of his Body, it being neceſſary for them to act with a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:53763:55"/>
ſweet Conſent, and without the Reſiſtance of the Fleſh, his Soul aſpir'd to Pray and Meditate; but when in order to this, the motion preſented to his Brain, it was found indiſpoſed, becauſe of his great Coldneſs and Moiſture, which are ſtupifying Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and proper to move to Sleep. Of the ſame Temper were the three Diſciples that accompanied Jeſus Chriſt in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, when he Pray'd, telling them, <hi>The Spirit is willing, but the Fleſh is weak.</hi> In like manner his Spirit would have Faſted, and when to that end the Offer was made to his Stomach, he found it weak and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, as having an unruly Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite: His Soul would have him Chaſt and Continent, but when the motion preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Parts of Generation, it found them inflamed with Concupiſcence, and inciting him to Actions of a contrary Nature and Tendency.</p>
               <p>With ſuch like Inclinations as theſe, virtuous Perſons find it a hard Task to live well, and not without Reaſon was it ſaid, <hi>That the Road to Virtue was covered over with Thorns:</hi> But if the ſame Soul that is bent upon Meditation, meets a Brain Hot and Dry, which are the Diſpoſitions peculiar to Watching; and if when it attempts to Faſt, it finds a Stomach Hot and Dry, of which Conſtitution, according to <hi>Galen,</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53763:55"/>
the Man is that loaths Meats; and if when it aims to Embrace Chaſtity, it meets the Parts of Generation Cold and Moiſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it will accompliſh the ſeveral Propoſals without any Struggle or Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance whatever; becauſe the Law of the Mind and the Law of the Members exact both the ſame thing, and ſuch a Man, in ſuch a Caſe, may act Virtuouſly, without any Violence to his Nature. Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, That it was the Part of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to make a Man Virtuous, that was formerly Vitious; and that the Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers committed a great over-ſight in not making uſe of Phyſic, for attaining the Perfection of their Art; ſince in Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the ill Conſtitution of the Body, they might make the Virtuous act with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Check, and with a ſweet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>What I would deſire of <hi>Galen,</hi> and all the Moral Philoſophers, is, that admitting it to be true, that to each Virtue and Vice ſeated in the Soul, there correſponds a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Temperament of Body, which Aids, or Diverts it in Acting, they would have given us a particular Account of all Mens Virtues and Vices; and have told us by which Corporal Qualities, both one, and the other, are Supplanted, or Maintain'd, to the End we might not be to ſeek for a proper Remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:53763:56"/>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew well, that a good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament made a Man Prudent, and of a good Diſpoſition, which occaſion'd him to ſay, <hi>That the good Temperament did not only affect the Body, but alſo the Mind of Man:</hi> But he has not ſhewn what this good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament was; on the contrary, he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That Mens Diſpoſitions were founded upon Hot and Cold. But <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> exclude thoſe two Qualities as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, approving the Equality of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament, where the Heat exceeds not Cold; nor the Moiſture, Drineſs. Which made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſay, <hi>If the great Moiſture of the Water, and the exceſſive Drineſs of the Fire, are equally Temper'd in the Body, the Man will be very Wiſe.</hi> Nevertheleſs many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, becauſe of the great Reputation of the Author, upon Enquiring into this Temperament, have found that it does not Anſwer what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> promiſed; but on the contrary, their Opinion was, that thoſe who had it, were Weak Men, and of little Vigor, and did not expreſs in their Actions ſo much Conduct as thoſe of an ill Conſtitution: They are of a very Sweet and Affable Temper, and Inoffenſive to every Man in Word and Deed, which makes them paſs for very Virtuous, and void of Paſſion, which raiſes Tempeſts in the Soul. Theſe Phyſicians diſapprove the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:53763:56"/>
equal Temperament, inaſmuch as it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables and flats the force of the Spirits, and is the cauſe they do not act freely as they ought. Which appears evidently in two Seaſons of the Year, the Spring, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn, when the Air falls out to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, for then happen the Diſeaſes, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Body is obſerv'd to be much more healthful when it is either very Hot or very Cold, than during the mediocrity of the Spring Time.</p>
               <p>Sacred Writ, in ſpeaking of the ſenſible Qualities, ſeems in a mariner to favour this Opinion, <hi>I would thou wert either Cold or Hot; ſo then becauſe thou art Lukewarm, I will ſpue thee out of my Mouth.</hi> Which ſeems to me to be grounded upon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who held for an infallible Opinion, that all the Natural Actions of Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in Heat and Cold, and not in a Luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs and Mediocrity of Conſtitution. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would have done well to have told us, what Virtue correſponds to each of the Qualities, and to what again the contrary Vice, that ſo we might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in Practice the Remedies preſcribed by <hi>Galen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for me, I believe Cold is of more Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Rational Soul, to preſerve its Virtues in due Peace, and to prevent all undue Ferments amongſt the Humours;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:53763:57"/>
for <hi>Galen</hi> ſays no leſs, there is no Quality ſo much blunts the Concupiſcible and Iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Faculty as Cold, nor that ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excites the Rational Faculty, as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> aſſures us that does, eſpecially if it be joined with Drineſs; for this is certain, as the Inferior Part is diſabled or depreſſed, the Faculties of the Rational Soul in the ſame proportion are exalted and inlarged. But be that as it will, I would preſent to a Moral Philoſopher a Luxurious Drunkard and a Glutton, to manage him according to the Rules of his Art, and to inſtill into his Soul the contrary good Habits of Chaſtity and Temperance, by theſe means reducing him to act with all Moderation and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without introducing into his Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Cold and Drineſs, and without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the over-ruling Heat and Moiſture there was before; let us ſee how he will go about it. Without doubt the firſt thing he does will be to ſhew him the Sordidneſs of Luxury, and to lay before him the Train of Evils it draws after it, and in what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his Soul would be, if Death ſhould happen to ſurprize him on a ſudden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving him reſpite to repent of his Sins. After this, he gravely admoniſhes him to Faſt, Pray, and Meditate; to Sleep but little, to lie hard, and without Delicacy; to wear Hair Clothes, and Diſcipline him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:53763:57"/>
to fly the Company of Women, and to give himſelf wholly to Pious Works; all which are comprized in this fine Aphoriſm of St. <hi>Paul, I keep under my Body, and bring it into Subjection.</hi> By means of theſe Auſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, if he practiſes them long, he'll ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear Meager, Pale, and much Alter'd from what he was, inſomuch that he who before hunted after Women, and that plac'd all his Happineſs in the Pleaſures of Eating and Drinking, will hardly have Patience to hear them ſpoke of. The Moraliſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Lewd Man ſo changed, will ſay, and not without reaſon, this Man has now acquired a Habit of Chaſtity and Temperance: But becauſe his Art reaches no further, he vainly imagines theſe two Virtues are come I know not from whence to make him a Viſit, and to take up their Lodgings in his Rational Soul, without having ſo much as part through his Body. Inſtead of which the diſcerning Phyſician, who knows whence his loſs of Blood and Spirits proceeds, and how the Virtues are Begot, and the Vices Extinguiſhed, will be apt to pronounce, that this ſame Man has now the Habit of Chaſtity and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, inaſmuch as by means of theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities he has impair'd his Natural Heat, in whoſe ſtead the Cold is introduc'd: For if we reflect a little further, we ſhall clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:53763:58"/>
ſee this new way of living is capable of cooling him more; the Horror into which the Reprimand he received threw him, and the awful conſideration of the Pains of Hell prepared for him, if he had died in mortal Sin, had without doubt mortified and chil'd his Blood. Whereupon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> propoſed this Queſtion; <hi>Why thoſe who are in fear falter in their Speech, tremble with their Hands, and hang their Lips? It is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>becauſe this Paſſion is a defect of Heat, which commences from the Parts above:</hi> Whence comes the Paleneſs of the Face. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence likewiſe is one of the things which chiefly mortifies the Natural Heat, leaving the Man cold: For our Nature is ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſays <hi>Galen,</hi> by Eating and Drinking, in the ſame manner, as the Flame of the Lamp is fed by the Oil; and there is ſo much natural Heat in the Body, that has digeſted Fleſh-meats, that they afford him Nouriſhment in proportion to his Heat, and if they ſhould yield him leſs in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, his Heat would inſenſibly diminiſh. Which made <hi>Hippocrates</hi> forbid the letting of Children faſt, becauſe their natural Heat Evaporated and Waſted for want of being fed. The Diſcipline given, if it be dolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and reach even to the fetching Blood, every man knows it extreamly diſſipates the vital and animal Spirits; and from the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:53763:58"/>
loſs of Blood, the Man ſoon comes to loſe his Hair, and natural Heat. As for Sleep, <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, it's one of the things which moſt fortifies our Heat, for by it's means that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuates into the hidden receſſes of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Animates the Natural Virtues; and much after the ſame manner our Food is aſſimilated and turned to our Subſtance: Whereas Waking generates Corruptions and Crudities; and the reaſon is, becauſe Sleep warms the inward Parts, and cools the outward; as on the contrary, Waking cools the Stomach, Liver, and Heart, which are the Vitals, and inflames the external Parts, the leſs noble, and leſs neceſſary: Hence he that does not Sleep well, muſt needs be ſubject to many cold Diſeaſes. <hi>To Lie hard, to Eat but once a day, and to go Naked, Hippocrates</hi> ſaid was the utter Ruin of the Fleſh and Blood, wherein the natural Heat is plac'd. And <hi>Galen</hi> giving the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why a hard Bed weakens and waſtes the Fleſh, ſaid, That the Body was in pain and ſuffered deeply for want of Sleep, and that by the uneaſie changes of motion from ſide to ſide, it was Haraſſed in the vain purſuit of reſtleſs Nights; and how the Natural Heat decays, and is diſſipated by bodily Labour, the ſame <hi>Hippocrates</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, teaching how a Man may become Wiſe: <hi>In order to be Wiſe, a Man muſt not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53763:59"/>
be oppreſſed with too much Fleſh, for that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a hot Temperament, which is the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that deſtroys Wiſdom.</hi> Prayer, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, cauſe the Heat to mount up to the Brains, in the abſence of which, the other Parts of the Body remain cold, and if the Intention of Mind be great, they ſoon loſe the ſenſe of Feeling, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be neceſſary to the Being of Animals, and that the other Senſes, in compariſon of that, ſerved only for Ornament and Well-Being. For in effect we might live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Taſting, Smelling, Seeing, and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but the Mind being buſied in ſome high Contemplation, fails to diſpatch the Natural Faculties to their Poſts; without which, neither the Ears, can hear; nor the Eyes, ſee; nor the Noſtrils, breath; nor the Taſte, reliſh; nor the Touch feel; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as they who Meditate are neither ſenſible of Cold, Heat, Hunger, Thirſt, nor any Wearineſs whatever: And Feeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sentinel that diſcovers to a Man the Good or Ill done to him, he cannot be without it: So that being Frozen with Cold, or Burnt up with Heat, or Dying away with Hunger, or Thirſt; he is not ſenſible of any of theſe Inconveniencies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has nothing to report them to him. In ſuch a ſtate, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, the Soul neglects its Charge, and whereas its
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53763:59"/>
Duty is to Animate the Body, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to it Senſe and Motion, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it leaves it wholly deſtitute and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided of any Succours. They who are hurt in any Part of the Body, and feel no Pain, aſſuredly are diſtempered in Mind.</p>
               <p>But the worſt Diſpoſition obſerved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men of Learning, and thoſe that are devoted to Studies, is a Weak Stomach, becauſe the Natural Heat required for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion is wanting, that very Heat being uſually carried to the Brain, which is the cauſe the Stomach is filled with Crudities and Phlegm. For which reaſon, <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Celſus</hi> recommends it to the Phyſicians care to Fortify that Part in Men of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation more than any others, becauſe Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Meditation, and hard Study extreamly cool and dry the Body, rendering it Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. For which reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Whence it is we ſee all that have Excelled, whether it be in the Study of Philoſophy, or Government, or the Poets, or in any other Art whatſoever, have been Melancholy.</p>
               <p>Never to ſee Women but to fly wholly their Company, how much that over-cools the Body, and what new Changes are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to Perſons becoming Chaſt, <hi>Galen</hi> makes appear by abundance of Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had made. He recounts, amongſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53763:60"/>
others, what happened to a Friend of his, a Widdower, who immediately loſt his Stomach to that degree as he could only digeſt the Yolk of an Egg; and if by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint he Eat as formerly, he ſtrait Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and was withal Lumpiſh and Dull, upon which <hi>Galen</hi>'s advice to him was, to Marry again if he'd recover his Health; and thereupon ſaid he, <hi>He was immediately freed from all his Complaints, as ſoon as he returned to his old way of Living.</hi> The ſame Phyſician tells of ſome Choriſters, who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Experience the near Correſpondence between the Teſticles and the Throat, and that to ſport with Women endangers the ſpoiling of the Voice; they were Chaſt by conſtraint, that they might not loſe the good Cheer, and the Pay which were the returns of their Muſick: And <hi>Galen</hi> ſays further, That their Privy Parts were ſo ſmall, ſo cold, and ſo lank, as they look'd like Old Men. But on the contrary, the Wanton had large Genitals, becauſe they kept them often in uſe, the Seminal Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels being large and diſtended, from which iſſued abundance of Spirits, and Natural Heat; for as <hi>Plato</hi> obſerv'd long ſince, <hi>It is Exerciſe makes the Parts of the Body more able, as they are Impaired by not Exerting them as they are directed.</hi> As it is certain, that in each Act of Venery, the Parts of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:53763:60"/>
Generation are more and more provoked, remaining more able and diſpoſed to repeat the Act again; but as often as a Man checks his Inclination, he becomes colder, and leſs able for Generation. Whence I col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that a Man who by this means is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Continent and Chaſt, ſoon obtains an habitual Frigidity, by which he Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms with the ſame Averſion and Relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctance, as an Old Man, or one that is born Impotent, or an Eunuch. Thoſe then that deſire to be Chaſt, and not to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the Fleſh, being conſcious of their Infirmity, may ſerve themſelves of cold Medicines, and of ſuch things as by Impairing and Conſuming the Seed, render them frigid, and in this Senſe this Paſſage is to be underſtood, <hi>Happy are they that are made Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All that ever we have ſaid, and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in relation to Chaſtity and Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, is no leſs true of other Virtues and Vices reſpectively, for each has his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Temperament of Heat and Cold, and is to be underſtood more or leſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of each Part of the Body, and of the greater or leſſer degrees of theſe two Qualities. I have declared for Heat and Cold, becauſe there is neither Virtue nor Vice rooted in Moiſture nor in Drineſs; for, according to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Opinion, theſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53763:61"/>
two Qualities are purely Paſſive, as Heat and Cold are Active. Whereupon he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, That <hi>our Natural Inclinations are more from Heat and Cold, than from any thing elſe in our Bodies</hi>; and in this he conſpires with the Holy Scripture, which ſays, <hi>I would rather thou wert Cold or Hot, &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon of which is, becauſe there is no Man found of ſo exact a Conſtitution as is required to be the Foundation of Virtue. Whereupon Sacred Writ and Philoſophy, choſe Heat and Cold, becauſe there are no other Qualities wherein to place the Virtues, although this be not without ſomething in Counterballance to them; for ſuppoſe there are abundance of Virtues correſpondent to Cold and Heat, theſe Qualities fail no leſs at all times to be the ſource of abundance of Vices, by which means it is a great Miracle if there be a Man found ſo Lewd, who has not ſome Virtues natural to him, or ſo Virtuous that has not ſome Vices.</p>
               <p>But the Quality obſerved to be beſt for the Rational Soul, is the cold Conſtitution of Body. This is eaſily prov'd, if we run through the ſeveral Stages of Man's Life; Infancy, Youth, Manhood, Middle-Age, and Old-Age; for we find that becauſe each Age reſpectively has its particular Temperament, accordingly at one time a Man is Vitious, at another Virtuous; in
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53763:61"/>
one he is Indiſcreet, or Perverſe, and in the other Wiſe and better Advis'd. Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is nothing elſe but a hot and moiſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, in which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, the Rational Soul was as it were plunged and ſtifled, not being able freely to employ the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Will, or Affections, till in length of Time it paſſes to another Age, and has gain'd a new Temperament. The Virtues of Infancy are very many, and the Vices but very few; Children, ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> admire from what Principles the Sciences ariſe. In the next Place they are Docile, Tractable, Gentle, and Eaſy to receive the Impreſſion of all Kinds of Virtues. In the third Place, they are Baſhful, and full of Fear, which, according to <hi>Plato,</hi> is the Foundation of Temperance. In the fourth place they are Credulous and Eaſy to be led; they are Charitable, Frank, Chaſt, Humble, Innocent, and Undeſigning. To which Virtues Jeſus Chriſt had regard, when he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Except you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as little Children, you ſhall not Enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> We know not of what Age the Child was, whom God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed for our Imitation, but you muſt know <hi>Hippocrates</hi> divided Infancy into three or four Stations, and becauſe Children from the Firſt to the Fourteenth Year always admit abundance of Humours, and a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53763:62"/>
of Temperament; ſo likewiſe they are ſubject to divers Diſeaſes, and their Souls at the ſame time not without a great many different Virtues and Vices. In conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which, <hi>Plato</hi> began to Inſtruct a Child from the very Firſt Year, although he could not then Speak, directing his Nurſe, how to diſtinguiſh by his Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, his Tears, and even his Silence, his Virtues and Vices; and how ſhe ſhould Correct them. Holy Writ declared that <hi>Saul</hi> had the Virtues of this Age, when he was choſen King, <hi>He was a Child of a Year Old when he began to Reign.</hi> Whence it appears, that God made the ſame Diviſion as <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> obſerving the Virtues of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy by the Years.</p>
               <p>Youth, which is the Second Age of Man, is reckon'd from the Fourteenth to the Five and Twentieth Year; this Age, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Opinion of Phyſicians, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hot nor Cold, nor Moiſt nor Dry, but Temperate, and in a Mediocrity of all the Qualities; the Parts of the Body in this Temperament are ſuch as the Soul requires for all ſorts of Virtues, and eſpecially for Wiſdom. For after this manner ſpeaks <hi>Hippocrates</hi>; if the great Moiſture of the Water, and the extream Drineſs of the Fire happen to be equally Temper'd in the Body, the Man will be very Wiſe, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:53763:62"/>
endued with an Excellent Memory. The Virtues we have allotted to Infancy, ſeem to be acts. proceeding from meer Inſtinct of Nature, like thoſe of Ants, Serpents, and little Bees, which act without Reaſon; but thoſe of Youth are performed with Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Diſcretion; ſo that he who acts at that Age, diſcerns what he does, and with what deſign, and knowing the End accordingly he diſpoſes the Means that lead to it. Where the Holy Scripture ſays, <hi>That the Heart of Man was inclined, to Evil from his Youth</hi>; that is to be underſtood exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, that is to ſay, from the time he paſſes from Infancy to Youth, which are the moſt virtuous Ages of Man's Life.</p>
               <p>The third Age is Manhood, which is reckoned from Twenty-five to Thirty-five Years; its Temperament is Hot and Dry, of which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid, <hi>When the Fire exceeds the Water, the Mind becomes Mad and Furious</hi>; and Experience no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, for there is no Ill which a Man is not acquainted with, and tempted to at that very Time: Paſſion, Gluttony, Lechery, Pride, Murders, Adulteries, Thefts, and Rapines; raſh Deſigns, Vanity, Tricks, Lyes, Quarrels, Revenge, Hatred, Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Inſolence, are the faireſt Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of theſe; at which Age <hi>David</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving himſelf to be, cried out, <hi>Lord cut
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53763:63"/>
me not off in the midſt of my days:</hi> For Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is the middlemoſt of the Five Ages of Man's Life, which are Infancy, Youth, Manhood, Middle-Age, and Old-Age; and Man is ſo Wicked at that Age, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> has ſaid, <hi>There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea four, which I know not; the way of an Eagle in the Air; the way of a Serpent upon a Rock; the way of a Ship in the midſt of the Sea; and the way of a Man with a Maid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which it is no leſs than evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Soul may in ſome ſenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Excuſe, if ſhe makes any falſe Steps, ſeeing ſhe is the ſame through the whole Courſe of the Ages of Man's Life, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as God has Created her at firſt; who then can blame the divers Temperaments which the Body paſſes through in each Age, becauſe in Manhood the Body is more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, which occaſions the Soul to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline with more difficulty to what is Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and with more eaſe to what is Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious? 'Tis to the very Letter, what the Wiſeman Intimates; <hi>I had for my Lot a good Soul, and from my Infancy I appeared of great Wit, and ſtill growing wiſer and wiſer,</hi> (which is to to be underſtood of his Youth.) <hi>I had nevertheleſs a Filthy and Intemperate Body,</hi> (ſuch an one is in Manhood,) <hi>and I found at the end of the account, that Man could not be Chaſt or Continent, were it not for the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53763:63"/>
ſpecial Grace of God.</hi> Whereupon <hi>David</hi> knowing he had eſcaped ſo dangerous an Age, and remembring what had paſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſaid, <hi>Remember not the Sins of my Youth, nor my Tranſgreſſions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the fourth Age, which is the Middle Age, or Age of Conſiſtence, Man returns to be more Temperate, becauſe in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Hot to Cold, he muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily paſs through the intermediate Degrees by which with that Drineſs that Manhood has left in the Body, the Soul is made Wiſe. Whence it comes that Men who have lived faſt in their Younger Days, are ſubject to the great Changes we ſee every Day appear, when they recollect their ill-ſpent Days, with Endeavour to amend them. This Age begins from Thirty-five Years, and reaches to Forty-five, more or leſs, in proportion to the Temperament and Complexion of each reſpectively.</p>
               <p>The laſt Age of Man, is Old-Age, in which the Body is Cold and Dry, ſubject to a Thouſand Ills and Infirmities, all the Faculties are beſotted, and diſabled in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their ordinary Functions, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Rational Soul is ſtill the ſame in Infancy, Youth, Manhood, Middle-Age, and Old-Age, without receiving any Change to diminiſh its Powers, therefore when it reaches this laſt Age, and to this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:53763:64"/>
Cold and Dry Temperament; it is Juſt, Prudent, Strong, and endued with Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance; and though we ought to attribute theſe Virtues to the whole Man, yet is the Soul allow'd to be the firſt Mover, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, <hi>That the Soul is the Principle from which we <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand.</hi> So long as the Body is vigorous and active in its Vital, Natural, and Animal Faculties, Man is but very ſlenderly provided with Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; but as that comes to loſe its ſtrength, the Soul ſtrait advances in Virtues. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeem'd to inſinuate no leſs in theſe Words, <hi>For when I am Weak, then am I Strong.</hi> And aſſuredly this is very true, becauſe the Body in no Age is weaker than in Old-Age, nor the Soul more expedite to perform ſuch Actions as are conformable to Reaſon. Notwithſtanding all which, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> always reckon'd Six Vices incident to Old Men, from the coldneſs of Age. The Firſt, That they are Cowards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Courage and Valour have great Fire in them, and a large Stock of Blood, of which Old-men have but very little, and that little too Congeal'd. The Second, That they are Covetous, and that they guard their Treaſure more carefully than they need; for though they find themſelves ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the laſt Stage of their Lives, and that Reaſon ſhould teach them, where the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:53763:64"/>
Journey is ſhort, the Charge of defraying it is ſmall, their Avarice nevertheleſs and their Thrift fail not to haunt them, as if they were but yet in their Infancy, and they were to run through no leſs than all the Five Stages of their Lives, and that it is good to Store, as if they were always to live. The third, that they are ſuſpicious; but I cannot imagin why <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calls this a Vice, ſince it is certain, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Experience they have had of ſo many Tricks in the World, and alſo from recollecting what part they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Acted in their Younger days; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they are ever upon their Guard, as knowing full well how little Men are to be truſted. The Fourth, That they are Diffident, and of ſmall Hopes, never promiſing themſelves ſucceſs in their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and of two or three Deſigns they may have, they always fall upon the Worſt, and upon that lay out all their Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Fifth, that they are ſhameleſs, becauſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, Baſhfulneſs and Bluſhing are full of Blood, of which Old Men have ſo little, as by conſequence they are without ſhame<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Sixth, That they are very Incredulous, thinking that the Truth is never told them, becauſe their Memories are ſo freſh of the Jugling and Deceits they have met with in the World,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:53763:65"/>
during the paſt Courſe of their Lives.</p>
               <p>Young Children have, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has noted, all the Virtues quite contrary to their Vices; they are Fearleſs, Frank, not Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſtful in the leaſt, always full of Hopes, very Baſhful, eaſily perſwaded and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon.</p>
               <p>The ſame things we have evidenced in the ſeveral Ages of Man's Life, we might alſo ſhew in the difference of Sex, what Virtues and what Vices Man has, and what Woman, as well by the reaſon of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, Blood, Choler, Phlegm, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; as alſo from the Diverſity of Climates, and Particular Countries. In one Province the Men are Valiant, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, Cowards; in this, Deliberate; in that, Raſh; in one, lovers of Truth; in another, Lyars; according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>The Cretians are always Lyars, evil Beaſts, ſlow Bellies.</hi> And if we run through all the Variety of Meats and Drinks, we ſhall find that ſome feed this Virtue, and ſtarve that Vice; and others on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nouriſh ſuch a Vice, and depreſs ſuch a Virtue; but in ſuch a manner, as the Man nevertheleſs ſtill remains free to chuſe as he pleaſes; according to that, <hi>He hath ſet Fire and Water before thee, ſtretch out thy hand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which thou wilt</hi>; for there is no Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution can do more than incite the Man,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53763:65"/>
without forcing him, if he loſes not his Reaſon; and it is to be obſerved, that in Studying, and Contemplating things, Man acquires another Temperament beſides what belongs naturally to the Conſtitution of his Body; for, as we ſhall prove here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, of the three Powers a Man has, the Memory, common Senſe, and Imagination; the Imagination only, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has noted, is free to frame what it pleaſes; and by the Operations of this Faculty, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> ſay, the vital Spirits, and the Blood of the Arteries are always ſet on Work, and in Motion; ſhe diſpatches them where it ſeems good to her, and the Parts to which the Natural Heat flies, become thereby more effectual to perform their Functions, and other Parts weaker. Hence <hi>Galen</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the Choriſters of <hi>Diana,</hi> not to deal with Women, ſince by thoſe means, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out attending the Conſequences, the Parts of Generation would be inflamed, and as they once took Fire, the Voice would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more harſh and untuneable, becauſe, as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> noted, <hi>The Heat of the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles lays the Cough, and ſo on the Contrary</hi>; for let any be put to the Bluſh at an Offence taken, the Natural Heat ſtrait mounts up, all the Blood flying to the Heart to fortify the Iraſcible Faculty, and to depreſs the Rational. But if we proceed to conſider,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:53763:66"/>
that God enjoins us to forgive Injuries, and do good to our Enemies, and to reflect a while upon the recompence attending it, all the Natural Heat and Blood ſtrait riſes up to the Face, to ſtrengthen the Rational and debilitate the Iraſcible Faculty; and ſo it being at our choice, with the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to fortify what Faculty we pleaſe, we are juſtly Rewarded when we ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Rational and diſable the Iraſcible Faculty; and as fairly Puniſhed when we raiſe the Iraſcible and depreſs the Rational Faculty. From which we may judge, with how good reaſon the Moral Philoſophers recommend to us the Study and Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Divine Matters, ſince by theſe means alone we might acquire the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament and Strength which the Rational Soul has uſe of, as well as ſuppreſs the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Part. But I cannot forbear adding one thing before I end this Chapter, which is, That a Man may Exerciſe all the Acts of Virtue without having that advantageous Conſtitution of Body required, although not without great pain and difficulty; Acts of Prudence excepted; for if the Man be by Nature Imprudent, nothing but God can Cure it with a Remedy; the ſame is to be underſtood of diſtributive Juſtice, and of all the Arts and Sciences acquir'd.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VI. What Part of the Body ought to be well Tempered, that the Child may be Witty.</head>
               <p>THE Body of Man having ſo great a Difference of Parts and Powers (each deſtin'd to its end) it will not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but rather highly neceſſary above all things, to know what Part Nature has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as the principal Inſtrument to diſpoſe a Man to be Wiſe and Prudent. For it is certain we reaſon not with the Foot, nor walk upon our Head, nor ſee with our Noſe, nor hear with our Eyes; but each Part has its proper Uſe and particular Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for the Office it is to diſcharge.</p>
               <p>That the Heart is the chief Seat where Reaſon reſides, and the Inſtrument by which our Souls perform the Actions of Prudence, Memory, and Underſtanding, was a received Opinion amongſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Philoſophers before <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> were born. The Heart is therefore ſtiled the Superior Part of Man in many places of Sacred Writ, which accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates it ſelf to the way of ſpeaking in uſe at that time. But thoſe two great Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:53763:67"/>
have given us to underſtand, that this Opinion is Falſe, and with great Reaſon and Experience have proved the Brain to be the chief Seat of the Rational Soul; and thus it was generally received, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> only diſſenting, who revived that old Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, endeavouring by Topical Arguments, and ſeveral Conjectures, to make it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for the ſake of contradicting <hi>Plato</hi> in every thing. Not to diſpute which is the trueſt Opinion (for in our days there is not a Philoſopher but allows the Brain to be the Inſtrument by Nature deſign'd to make a Man Wiſe and Prudent) it will only be requiſite to lay down the Conditions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that Part is beſt Organized, that the Youth may thereby become towardly and Witty.</p>
               <p>That the Rational Soul may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently perform the Actions of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Prudence, there are required four Qualifications of the Brain. Good Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, is the Firſt. Unity of Parts, the Second. That the Heat exceed not the Cold, nor the Moiſture ſurpaſs the Drineſs, is the Third. That the Subſtance of the Brain be compoſed of very fine and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Parts, is the Fourth.</p>
               <p>Four other things are comprized under the good Configuration. A good Figure, is the Firſt <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Sufficient Quantity, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:53763:67"/>
That there be four ſeparate and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Ventricles in the Brain, each diſpoſed in its proper place, the Third. That its Capacity ſhould not be greater nor leſs than is convenient for its Functions, the Fourth.</p>
               <p>We are taught by <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. Art. Medic. ch. XI.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> to know when the Figure of the Brain is good, for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the outward Form and Figure of the Head, he declares it is as it ought to be, if it reſembles a Ball of Wax made ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly round, and compreſt gently on each ſide; which is much the Turn of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and the Hind-part of the Head a little jetting out; whence it follows that the Forehead and Hind-part of the Head very flat, are a ſign the Brain has not the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure approved for a ſharp Wit and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
               <p>What is moſt to be admired is the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Brains the Soul has occaſion to make uſe of for Reaſon and Diſcourſe; becauſe not one amongſt all the Brute-Animals has ſo much as Man. Inſomuch, that if the Brains of two very large Oxen were join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they would not ſo much as equal the Brains of one Man, though never ſo little; and what is yet more obſervable, is, that amongſt Brute Beaſts, thoſe who approach neareſt to Man in Wit and Cunning (as the Monkey, the Fox, and the Dog) have
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:53763:68"/>
ſtill a greater quantity of Brains than other Animals, although the ſame Animals are much of greater bulk than theſe. Which made <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. Art. Med. cap. XXI.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſay, That a little Head in Man was always defective, becauſe it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Brains; as he alſo affirm'd, it was no leſs an ill Indication, to be Born with a great Jolt Head, becauſe it was all Fleſh and Bones, with very little Brains; as it fares with very fair Oranges, which when they come to be opened, have little Juice and Pulp, but a very thick Rind. Nor is any thing more grievous to the Rational Soul, than to be plunged in a Body over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtock'd with Bones, with Fat, and with Fleſh. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaking of the Cure of a certain kind of Phrenzy, cauſed by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of Heat, above all gave in charge that the Sick ſhould eat no Fleſh, but only Fiſh and Herbs, and drink no Wine at all, but only Water; and if he were too Corpulent, too Groſs, and Unweildy, their Endeavour ſhould be to bring down his Fleſh; and for this Reaſon he ſaid, <hi>It was abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for a Man that would be very Wiſe, not to be oppreſſed with much Fleſh, nor Fat, but rather to be lean and ſlender: For the Fleſhy Temperament is Hot and Moiſt, with which 'tis impoſſible, or at leaſt very improbable, but the Soul ſhould become Blockiſh and Stupid.</hi> He brings for Inſtance the Hog, affirming
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:53763:68"/>
him to be of all Brute Beaſts the moſt Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, becauſe of the load of Fleſh about him, his Soul, (in the Words of <hi>Chryſippus</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of no other uſe to him than Salt to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his Body from ſtinking. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> confirms this Opinion, affirming that Man to be a Sot that had an over-great Head, and fleſhy; comparing him to an Aſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in proportion to the other Parts of his Body, there is no Beaſt's Head ſo very fleſhy as an Aſs's. But as to Corpulence, it ought to be obſerv'd, groſs Men are of two ſorts, ſome abounding with Fleſh and Blood, whoſe Temperament is hot and moiſt; as others again, who have not ſo much Fleſh and Blood as they are crammed with Fat; theſe are of a cold and dry Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. <hi>Hippocrates</hi>'s Opinion is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the firſt, becauſe of the great Heat and Humidity, and the abundance of Fumes and Vapors ariſing without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in thoſe Bodies, which cloud and overthrow their Reaſon; which is not the caſe of the other, that are only plump and fat, whom the Phyſicians dare not bleed, becauſe they have too little Blood; and there is ordinarily abundance of Wit to be found, where there is not ſo much Fleſh and Blood. That we may throughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the great Agreement and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence between the Stomach and Brains,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53763:69"/>
eſpecially in what relates to Wit and Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Galen</hi> has declared, <hi>A groſs Paunch makes a groſs <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> But if he means this of thoſe that are fat, he has leſs reaſon, for they have a very wateriſh Wit. <hi>Perſius</hi> proceeded upon this Reaſon, when he ſaid, <hi>That the Belly gave Wit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> affirmed there is nothing darkens the Soul ſo much, nor more overcaſts the Brain, than the black Fumes and Vapours ariſing from the Stomach and the Liver at the time of Digeſtion; nor is there on the other hand, any thing that elevates it to ſuch high Meditations as Faſting and a ſpare Body, not too overcharged with Blood, as the Catholic Church ſings, <hi>Thou that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveneſt and relieveſt the Spirit by Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Humbling of the Body, and by the ſame means depreſſeſt Vices, and beſtoweſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues on us, and with them their Reward.</hi> This great Grace God did to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he called to him out of the higheſt Heaven, he remained three days without Eating, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed in Extaſy with admiration of the incomparable Favours he had receiv'd at the very inſtant he was plunged in Vice and Sin. Moreover <hi>Plato</hi> affirms, that the Heads of wiſe Men are ordinarily tender, and apt to be anoy'd upon the leaſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and the reaſon why Nature has made them of ſo delicate a Head, ſeems to be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53763:69"/>
for fear of loading them with too much Brains to the diminiſhing of their Wit. So true is this Doctrin of <hi>Plato,</hi> that tho' the Stomach be far enough from the Brain, nevertheleſs it annoies it, if it be overcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Fat and Fleſh: Nor is there any Myſtery in this, becauſe the Brain, and the Stomach are knit and tyed together by means of certain Nerves, which Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate their Diſaffections to each other; and on the contrary, if the Stomach be dry and empty, it much ſharpens the Wit, as we may ſee in thoſe who are pinch't with Hunger and Want. But what is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable upon this Occaſion is, that if the other parts of the Body are Fat and Fleſhy, and the Man by this means be over-Groſs, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. IV. de part. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimalum.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms he runs a riſque of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Wit at all. For which reaſon I am of Opinion, if a Man has a great Head, let it be from meer Strength of Nature, and from too-great abundance of well-diſpoſed Matter, yet ſuch a one will not have ſo much Capacity as if he had a Head of a more moderate Size.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="†" place="margin">XXX Sect. prob. III.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> demanding, what may be the Reaſon of Man's being the Wiſeſt of all Creatures? Is of a contrary Opinion, when he replies, that no living Creature has ſo ſmall a Head as Man in proportion to the Bulk of his Body, for even amongſt Men
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53763:70"/>
themſelves (ſaid he) they are the Wiſeſt who have the leaſt Heads, tho' there be no Reaſon for this, for if he had ever opened a man's Head, he might have found ſo great a Stock of Brains, that, that of two Horſes equals not that of one Man. What I have found by Experience is, that little Men have large Heads, as on the contrary great Men have little Heads; for a very moderate quantity of Brains better Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the rational Soul in diſcharge of her Functions.</p>
               <p>Beſides all this, it is requiſite that there be four Ventricles in the Brain, to enable the rational Soul to Reaſon and Diſcourſe; one diſpoſed on the right, the other on the left Side, the third in the Middle, and the fourth in the hinder part of the Brains, as appears from Anatomy. Hereafter where we ſhall treat of the Difference of Wits, we ſhall ſhew what uſe the rational Faculty makes of theſe Ventricles, be they greater or leſs.</p>
               <p>That the Brain be well figured, of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Quantity, and the Number of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles ſo many, little or great, as we have ſhewn, is not yet enough. It's parts muſt alſo obſerve a kind of Continuity, without being disjoyned; for which Cauſe we have obſerved ſome Men wounded in the Head, have loſt their Memory, others their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:53763:70"/>
Senſe, and others their Imagination, nay even tho' the Brain after Cure has been rejoyned by Art, becauſe there was not the ſame Natural Union as before.</p>
               <p>The third of the Four Principal Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, is, that the Brain ſhould be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, of a moderate Heat, and without Exceſs of the other Qualities; which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Brain we have already af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be that, called True Temper, for 'tis that which makes a Man capable, and the contrary Incapable.</p>
               <p>The Fourth, that the Brain ſhould be Compoſed of very fine and delicate Parts, and is what <hi>Galen</hi> thought the moſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Qualification of all the reſt. For giving an Indication of the good Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Brain, he ſaies, that the ſharp Wit ſhews the Brain to be formed of very ſubtile and delicate Parts; but if the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be Dull, it denotes the Brain to be Compoſed of a Groſs Subſtance, where he takes no Notice of the Temperament.</p>
               <p>To the end the Rational Soul might by this means Reaſon well, the Brain ought to have theſe Qualities. But here ariſes a great Difficulty, which is in opening the Head of any Beaſt whatever, we ſhall find his Brains compoſed after the ſelf ſame manner as Man's, without being wanting in any of the Conditions mentioned. To which it is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53763:71"/>
Anſwered, that in this, Man and Brute Beaſts agree, in having a Temperament of the four firſt Qualities, without which 'twould be impoſſible for them to Subſiſt; ſo are they compoſed of the four Elements, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth, whence ſpring and proceed, Heat, Cold, Moyſture, and Dryneſs. In the Actions of the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Soul they alſo agree; accordingly Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has given to both alike Organs and Inſtruments neceſſary for Nouriſhment; ſuch are the right Fibres, traverſe and oblique, ſubſervient to the four Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. They alſo conſpire in the Senſitive Soul, for ſo they have Nerves and Sinews alike for the Inſtruments of Senſe. In lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Motion they alſo agree no leſs, thus have they both Muſcles, as fit Inſtruments directed by Nature to move from place to place. They alſo accord in Memory and Fancy, for ſo have they both Brains, as an Inſtrument ſubſervient to thoſe two Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that are alike compoſed in both. The Underſtanding is the ſole Faculty that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes Man from Beaſt, and becauſe the Underſtanding acts without any corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Organ, or depends not on the ſame for it's being or preſervation, therefore Nature had no need of a new Turn in the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man's Brain. However the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hath Occaſion for other Faculties
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:53763:71"/>
to operate, which Faculties likewiſe have the Brain for the Inſtrument of their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: We add farther, that the Brain of Man requires the Conditions we have laid down, to the end the Rational Faculty may by means thereof perform Operations every way agreeable and conformable to its Species. As to Brute Beaſts, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they have Memory and Fancy, and ſome other Power that Apes the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, even as a Monkey Apes a Man.</p>

               <p>THE Temperament of the four Firſt Qualities, which we have already called Nature, hath force ſufficient of it ſelf, to leave the Plants, the Brutes, and Man unprovided of nothing wherewith to Act well, each according to his Species, and to arrive at the higheſt Perfection each is capable of; for without any Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

And what moſt aſtoniſhes thoſe that do not underſtand Natural Philoſophy, is, that Man having a well tempered and diſpoſed Brain, ſuitable to each Science, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and without being directed by any Teachers, ſpeaks concerning that Science of his own accord ſuch elevate and ſubtle Things, as are almoſt incredible. Vulgar Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſeeing the admirable Actions per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Brute Beaſts, ſay that there is nothing in them to Surprize us, becauſe they act thoſe things by Inſtinct of Nature, which directs each Species what it ought to do.

The good
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:53763:73"/>
Order for this Effect, is, that the Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative Soul have a right Temperament. Otherwiſe let <hi>Galen</hi> and all the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in the World give a Reaſon, why the Vegetative Soul ſhould have more Skill and Ability in the firſt Age of Man's Life, to ſhape the Body, to Nouriſh, and make it Thrive; than when Old Age approaches, when ſhe is diſabled? For inſtance, if an Old Man have a Tooth drop out, there is no means or expedient to get another to grow in the ſame Place; whereas, if a Child loſe all his, we ſee Nature repairs the Loſs, by helping him to new ones. How then is it poſſible that a Soul that has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Buſineſs throughout the whole Courſe of Life; but to attract Aliments, to retain and digeſt them, and expel the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and duly repair the loſt Parts, at the end of our Life ſhould either forget or not be able to do the ſame? Certainly <hi>Galen</hi> would reply, that the Vegetative Soul is skilful and able in Infancy, becauſe of the great Degrees of Natural Heat and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture; and that in Old Age, ſhe wants ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ability or Skill to do the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the extream Cold and Dryneſs, of the Body incident to Age.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Skill of the Senſitive Soul depends much on the Temperament of the Brain, for if it be ſuch as it's Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

require, it fails not to perform them aright; otherwiſe, ſhe commits a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Errors, as well as the Vegetative Soul. <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. VI. de locis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectis. cap. VI.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi>'s Teſt to diſcover in one view the Skill and Efforts of the Senſitive Soul, was this, he took a Kid newly Kidded, which being on his Legs began to go, as if he had been informed and taught that his Feet were given for that very end; after he had dried up the Superfluous Humor, that came with him from his Dam, and lift up his Feet, and rubbed behind his Ears, finding before him ſeveral Platters full of Wine, Water, Vineger, Oyl and Milk, upon ſmelling to each of them, he lapped only the Milk. Which being obſerved by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Philoſophers preſent, they began to cry out, that <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had with good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid, <hi>That Souls were directed what to do without the Teaching of any Maſter. Which is the ſame with the wiſe Mans ſaying, Go to the Ant thou Sluggard, conſider her waies, and be wiſe, which having no Guide, Overſeer, or Ruler, provideth her Meat in the Summer, and gathereth her Food in the Harvest. Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> not reſting contented with this ſingle Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, two Months after he brought the Kid into the Fields, almoſt Starved to Death, and ſmelling on ſeveral ſorts of Herbs, he fed only on that which was Goats-meat. But if <hi>Galen,</hi> who ruminated
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:53763:74"/>
on the Efforts of this Kid, had ſeen three or four of them together, and obſerved ſome run better than their Fellows, ſhift better, and ſcratch their Ears better; and quit themſelves better in each Point we have mentioned; and had <hi>Galen</hi> brought up two Colts of the ſame Mare, he might have obſerved the one to be more Graceful in going, to have better Heels, to be more Manageable, and ſtop better than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and had he taken an <hi>Airy</hi> of <hi>Hawks</hi> to train, he might have diſcovered, that one would have delighted much in Seizing his Game, another to be Rank-winged, and the third a Haggard, and Ill-mann'd. He would have found the ſame Difference in Setting-Dogs, or Harriers, tho' each were littered from the ſame Sire and Dam, the one needs only the noiſe of the Chaſe, and Rouſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never ſo loudly, it would affect him no more than a Shepherds Dog. All which can never be aſcribed to the vain Inſtincts of Nature, imagined by Philoſophers; for if they were asked, why one Dog has a better Inſtinct than an other, both being of the ſame kind and breed? I know not what they could Anſwer, without having recourſe to their common Shift, namely, that God had trained one above the other, having given him a better Natural Inſtinct. And if they were further ask'd, why this
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53763:75"/>
hopeful Hound, when Young, hunted well, but become Old, was not ſo good for the Sport; and on the other Hand, why the other when Young, could not Hunt, but being Old, was Expert and fit to fly at all Game? I know not what they could ſay. For my particular, I ſhould ſay, that the Dog that hunted better than the other, had more Sagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and as for him that hunted well when Young, and turned Cur when Old, that ſo it fared, becauſe ſometimes he had the Qualities fit for the Chaſe, which at other times he wanted. Whence we may Collect, that ſince the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the four Firſt Qualities is the Reaſon why one brute Beaſt aquits him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf better than another of the ſame Kind, the Temperament is no leſs the Maſter which directs the Senſitive Soul what it ought to do. Had <hi>Galen</hi> but reflected on the Steps and Motions of the Ant, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved her Providence, her Mercy, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and good Government, he would have been at a loſs, as we are, to ſee ſo ſmall an Animal endued with ſo great Senſe, without the Teaching of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Maſter whatſoever. But when we come to conſider more cloſely the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Ant's Brain, and obſerve how proper it is, for Prudence, as we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:53763:75"/>
ſhall hereafter make appear, then will all our Admiration ceaſe,<note rend="inter">A Faulconer affirmed to me upon Oath, that he had an excellent Hawk for Sport, which became good for nothing, yet by applying a Cautery he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him.</note> and we ſhall underſtand, that Brute Beaſts, from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of their Brain, and the Images that enter there, thro' the Senſes, arrive at the Ability we diſcover in them. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as amongſt Animals of the ſame Kind, one is more Docile, and Ingenious than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, It happens from the Brain, being better Tempered; ſo that if by any Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or Diſtemper it ſhould chance to alter and impair, he would forthwith loſe his Ability, as Man does under the like Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
               <p>But here ariſes a Difficulty touching the Rational Soul, how ſhe comes to be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with this Natural Inſtinct, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe performs the Acts proper to her Species, of Wiſdom and Prudence, and yet all on a ſudden, by means of a good Temperament, a Man may underſtand the Sciences without the help of a Teacher, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſince we are told by Experience, if they do not learn them, no Man brings them into the World with him. It has long been a controverted Point betwixt <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which way Man comes by Knowledge; one ſaies, that the Rational Soul is much Older than the Body, and it's
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:53763:76"/>
Natural Birth enjoying in Heaven the Company of God, from whom ſhe came filled with Wiſdom and Knowledge, but after ſhe dropt down to inform the Body, ſhe loſt this Wiſdom and Knowledg, becauſe of the ill Temperament ſhe met with, till by tract of Time this ill Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was Corrected,<note rend="inter">

It is much the ſame thing at this preſent; only with this Difference, that Nature now frames the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and when that is once done, God infuſes the Soul into it, from which it never departs, no not the ſpace of a ſingle Moment.</p>

as if he had ſaid, all that Men know, and all that they learn; comes from what they Hear, or See, or Smell, or Taſt, or Touch; for the Underſtanding can receive no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, but what muſt firſt paſs through ſome one of the five Senſes. For which Reaſon he ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. III. de ani.</note> that the Natural Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were in the Nature of a Blank-Paper, which Opinion is no leſs falſe than <hi>Plato</hi>'s, and to make Proof, and Illuſtration of this, I muſt firſt agree with the Philoſophers, that there is but one Soul in a Human-Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is the Rational, that is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of whatever we do or Accompliſh; altho' there want not contrary Opinions, aſſerting no leſs than two or three diſtinct Souls beſides the Rational. This being ſo, as to the Acts performed by the Rational Soul, ſo far forth as it is Vegetative, we have already proved that it knows how to Form a Man, and to Figure him as he ought to be; that we know how to draw Nouriſhment, to retain and digeſt the ſame, as well as to expel Excrements; and if there be Defects in any parts of the Body, it knows how to repair them anew, and to give them that Structure which their uſe requires. And as to the Acts of the Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Motive Faculties, a new-born-Babe can apply and lay its Lips cloſe to preſs the Milk, and this with ſo much Art
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53763:77"/>
and Addreſs, as the wiſeſt Man in the World knows not how to do it ſo well. Beſides this, it follows what tends moſt to the Preſervation of it's Nature, and flyes what is noxious and offenſive, he knows how to Laugh and to Cry, without ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Taught by any. And if this be not ſo, who can the Vulgar Philoſopher pretend has taught Children to perform theſe Actions, or through which of their Senſes have any Notices arrived, that made them do it? I know well they may reply, that God has given them the ſame Natural Inſtinct as to Brute Beaſts, in which they ſay not ill, if by Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct they mean no other thing than the Temperament.</p>
               <p>Man as ſoon as he is born cannot exert Acts proper to the Rational Soul; ſuch as are to Underſtand, Imagine, and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; becauſe the Temperaments of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are not well Adapted to ſuch Acts, but rather appropriate to the Vegetative and Senſitive, as the Temperament in Old Age is more proper for the Rational Soul, and leſs for the Vegetative and Senſitive Soul; and if the Brain, which by little and little acquires the Temper that Wiſdom requires, might obtain it at once, Man at the ſame inſtant would be able to Reaſon and Diſcourſe better than if he had learnt
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:53763:77"/>
the ſame at any time in the Schools; but as Nature cannot beſtow it but ſucceſſively and in time, ſo Man by degrees gains Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. This is the main Reaſon, as one may clearly ſee, if he will conſider, that from the time a Man arrives at the pitch of Wiſdom, by little and little he declines to Ignorance, becauſe as he approaches nearer to the laſt and decrepit Age, he daily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires another Temperament wholly new. As for me, I am of Opinion,<note rend="inter">The Menſtrous Seed and Blood, the two Principal Matters of which we are formed, are hot and moiſt; by means of which Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament Children, are of neceſſity Stupid and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>Galen. lib.

                  </note> that whereas Nature makes a Man of hot and moiſt Seed, which is the Temperament that directs the Vegetative and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Soul what it ought to do; if inſtead of that ſhe had form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of cold and dry Seed, he would Diſcourſe and Reaſon ſoon after he was Born, and would not be able to Suck, inaſmuch as his Temperament would not well agree with ſuch Actions. But to the end we may by Experience know, if the Brain be Temperate, ſo far as the Natural Sciences require, we need no Maſter to teach us, but only to attend to a thing, which happens every day; that if a Man falls ſick of any Diſtemper, that changes the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of his Brain on a ſudden (<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53763:78"/>
once Wiſe and Underſtanding, whatever Wiſdom, Underſtanding, and Knowledge, he had, and would utter a thouſand Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagances; and on the contrary, though he had been once an Ignorant Fellow, he would be Inſpired with more Wit and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility than ever he had before. To prove which, I cannot forbear telling you what happened at <hi>Corduba,</hi> in the Year 1570. (the Court being then there) to a Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſan in her Sickneſs, named <hi>Loviſa Lopez,</hi> who was turned Fool: She had during her Health utterly loſt her Underſtanding, but as for her Imagination, ſhe converſed Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly, and made her Complements with a good Grace; a certain contagious Diſeaſe then rife, threw her into a malignant Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, in the midſt of which, ſhe ſhewed ſo much Wit and Judgment, as ſurprized the whole Court. Inſomuch, that when they had given her the Sacraments, ſhe made her laſt Will, the diſcreeteſt in the World, and died begging the Mercy of God, and Pardon for her Sins. But what raiſed the greateſt Admiration was, that the ſame Diſtemper ſeized on a very ſenſible and ſober Man, who had the Cure of this Sick Perſon in charge, who died bereft both of Wit and Judgment, and neither did, nor ſpoke the leaſt ſenſible thing. And the Reaſon of this was, that the Temperament
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:53763:78"/>
of the laſt, to which he owed his Wit when he was well, was the ſelf-ſame that <hi>Loviſa Lopez</hi> took poſſeſſion of by her Diſtemper, inſtead of the Temperament ſhe had in her Health, which was the lot of the other in his Sickneſs. Let me give you an Inſtance of this, in a certain Labourer, who being Frantic, made a Speech in my hearing, wherein he recommended his Welfare to thoſe about him, deſiring them to take care of his Wife and Children, if it ſhould pleaſe God to call him out of this World, with ſo many ſtrains of Rhetoric, and ſo great Elegance, and Purity of Speech, that <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> himſelf could ſcarce have made a better Harangue in the open Senate: At which, the Standers-by, not a little ſurprized, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, whence appeared ſo great Wit and Eloquence in a Man,<note rend="inter">When the Brain becomes hot in the firſt Degree, it makes the Man fluent, ſuggeſting to his Wit many things to ſay; but the reſerv'd have all a cold Brain, as the great Talkers a hot one.

I can confirm the Truth of this, from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lunatic, who for more than eight days, ſpoke never
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:53763:79"/>
a word, and then immediately fell into a fit of Rhiming, very often making no leſs than a good entire Stanza; the By-ſtanders ſurprized to hear a Man Diſcourſe all in Verſe, who in his Health never knew how to make one; I told them it could never well be, that he who was a Poet in his Madneſs, ſhould be one when he was well, becauſe the Temperament of the Brain a Man has in Health, and from which he is to turn a Poet, is ordinarily Renver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his Sickneſs, which is the cauſe of his falling into Raptures. I remember the Lunatic's Wife, and Siſter (whoſe Name was <hi>Mary Garcia</hi>) chid him for ſpeaking ill of the Saints, which ſo enraged him, that he ſpoke to his Wife after this manner. <hi>Then I renounce God for your ſake, and the Virgin</hi> Mary <hi>for</hi> Mary Garcia<hi>'s ſake, and Saint</hi> Peter <hi>for</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Olmedo<hi>'s ſake,</hi> which fell into the following <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Stanza:

After this rate running over a Bead-roll of Saints, which Rhimed to the Names

But this is a Matter of nothing, a meer Trifle to the ſmart and ſubtle things which fell from a Page of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Grandee, when Delirious, though in his Health he was reckoned a Fellow of ſmall Wit, yet in Sickneſs he made ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Diſcourſes, and ſuch pertinent An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, to whatever was asked him, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withal ſo fair an Idea of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Kingdom (of which he conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf King) that all who came to ſee and hear him were ſurprized, nay his own Maſter, who never ſtirred from the Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, wiſhed he might never be Cured. As afterwards appeared more plain, when the Page was recovered of his Sickneſs, for the Phyſician that cur'd him, going to take leave of his Lord, not without hopes of receiving ſome Gratuity, or at leaſt a fair Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, inſtead of that, met with this Welcom. I aſſure you Maſter Doctor, I never was ſo vext at any Accident that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fel me, as I am now, to ſee my Page cured, becauſe it ſeems unreaſonable to me, to change ſo wiſe a Folly into ſuch a ſtupid Underſtanding as his is when he is well.

diſagreeable the Cure he had performed was, went to take leave of the Page, and at length, after many things that paſſed to and fro between them, the Page ſaid to him.

'Tis of no great Importance what the Philoſophers think of this, and by what means it is brought to paſs; for I am able to aſſure them from very credible Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that ſome Ignorant Fellows that were Sick of the ſame Diſeaſe, have talked Latin, without ever ſo much as knowing what they ſaid, when they came once to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

and Vices: And ſometimes with greater certainty than thoſe who uſually pretend to Divine by Signs and Conjectures; ſo that no Body durſt go ſee her, for fear of the Truths ſhe revealed. And what raiſed their Admiration yet higher, was at the Inſtant the Barber-Surgeon was bleeding her, ſhe ſaid to him, take care what you do, for you have not many Days to live, and your Wife ſhall marry again, with ſuch an one; which prov'd true, and came to paſs ere ſix Months were expired, tho' ſhe ſaid it at random. Methinks I already hear from thoſe that ſlight Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, that it is a meer Mockery, and a Fable; or if it be true, that the Devil, as he is ſubtle and cunning, enters by God's Permiſſion into the Body of this Woman, and the other Lunatics, we have already ſpoke of, making them utter thoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing things.

Or it may be, as we ſhall hereafter prove, becauſe there is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and proper Wit to invent Languages. <hi>Latin</hi> Words, and the manner of ſpeaking this Tongue, are ſo Rational, and ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſtrike the Ear, that the Rational Soul meeting with the Temperament neceſſary to invent a very eloquent Language, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtumbles on the <hi>Latin:</hi> For that two Inventers of Languages may forge the ſame Words, having both the ſame Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ability, may be clearly underſtood, if we ſuppoſe, that as God created <hi>Adam,</hi> he preſented all the Creatures to him, to give them what Names they ought to have; ſo he might have made another at the ſame time with the ſame Perfection, and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Grace; Now I demand, had God preſented to this other, the ſame Creatures for him to give them Proper Names, what Names would he have given them? It is not to be doubted but they would have been the ſame that <hi>Adam</hi> gave them; and the reaſon is clear, becauſe both in Naming would have conſider'd the Nature of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which was but One.

Tongue, and ſpeak <hi>Latin</hi> without having learn'd it in his Wits; becauſe the Natural Temperament of his Brain being altered by that Diſtemper, he might do it in a ſhort time after the ſame manner, as he who firſt invented the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and ſo he might pronounce almoſt the ſame Words, though not ſuch laboured Periods, or with ſuch a continued Elegance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is a ſign the Devil moves their Tongue, according to what the Church teaches her Exorciſts. The ſame thing is affirmed by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to have befallen ſome Children, who at their Birth pronounced diſtinctly ſome Words, and afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came mute.

Children that are begot of cold and dry Seed, as thoſe got in old Age, begin to reaſon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe a few Days and Months after they are Born, becauſe the cold and dry Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, as we ſhall prove hereafter, is more appropriate to the Operations of the Rational Soul, and what Time, and the long ſucceſſion of Days and Months might effect, is ſupplied by the ſudden Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of the Brain, that after this manner is puſhed forward by many Cauſes leading to that end. <note n="*" place="margin">XI.

'Tis certain he did this by the Spirit of God; but if Holy Writ and our Faith had not aſſured us of it, how ſhould the Natural Philoſophers know that this was the Work of God, and that of the She Lunatic's tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe that came to ſee her, their Virtues and Vices, was a Work of the Devil, ſince that in part it reſembled <hi>Jacob</hi>'s? They conceive the Nature of the Rational Soul to be far different from that of the Devil, and that its Powers, the Underſtanding, Imagination, and Memory, are of another kind much different: In which they are miſtaken; for let the Rational Soul animate a well-organiz'd Body, ſuch as <hi>Adam</hi>'s was, it ſhall know no leſs than the moſt clear-ſighted Devil; and when it is ſeparated from the Body, it has as ſubtle Faculties as he.

               <head>CHAP. VIII. From theſe three Qualities alone, Heat, Moiſture, and Drineſs, proceed all the differences of Wit obſerv'd among Men.</head>
               <p>AS long as the Rational Soul is in the Body, it is impoſſible it ſhould perform different and contrary Actions, if to each it have its proper and peculiar Inſtruments. This is clearly ſeen in the Animal Faculty, which exerciſes divers Actions in the exterior Senſes, each having its particular and proper Organ; the Sight has it after one manner, the Hearing after another; the Taſte, the Smell and the Touch after another; and if this were not ſo, there would be but one ſort of Actions, all would conſiſt either in the Sight, or in the Hearing, or in the Taſte, or in the Smell, or in the Touch; becauſe the Organ determines the Power to one Action only, and not to more. From what paſſes plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the exterior Senſes, we may collect what is acted in the Interior. We Underſtand, we Imagine, and Remember, by the ſame Animal Virtue. But if it be true, that each Action requires its particular Inſtrument; there muſt neceſſarily be one
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:53763:86"/>
Organ in the Brain to Underſtand, another to Imagin, and a third to Remember; for if the whole Brain were Organized after one and the ſame Manner, all would be either Memory, or Underſtanding, or Imagination. But when we ſee ſuch different Actions, of neceſſity there muſt alſo be divers Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And yet if one ſhould Diſſect a Head to Anatomize the Brain, all would ſeem compoſed after the ſame manner, of the like ſubſtance, without difference of Parts or diverſity of Kinds. I ſay, that it ſeems ſo, becauſe, as <hi>Galen</hi> has obſerv'd, Nature has placed abundance of things in Man's Body, that are compound, which the Senſes nevertheleſs judge to be ſimple, becauſe of the Subtilty of the Mixture: Which may alſo happen in the Brain of a Man, though to ſight it ſeems no ſuch thing. Beſides this, there are four ſmall Ventricles in the Cavity of the Brain, of which <hi>Galen</hi> taught the uſe to him that would learn it of him: But for my part, I hold, that the fourth Ventricle, which is behind the Head, has no other Function than to digeſt and refine the Vital Spirits, and turn them into Animal Spirits, enabling them to give Senſe and Motion to all the Parts of the Body, becauſe we cannot find in Humane Bodies two ſuch contrary Operations, that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with each other, ſo much as Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Digeſtive Faculty. The reaſon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53763:86"/>
is, that Speculation requires the Repoſe, Serenity, and Clearneſs of the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; whereas the Digeſtion is made with noiſe and ferment, and from that Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes many Vapours which infeſt and darken the Animal Spirits, in ſuch manner as the Rational Soul cannot well diſtinguiſh the Figures of things. Nor was Nature ſo Inconſiderate to join in one place two Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are performed with ſo great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance and Contrariety. Be it how it will, <note n="*" place="margin">Dialogo de Natura.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> mightily commends the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and Care of him, who made us; for having ſeparated the Liver at ſo great a diſtance from the Brain, leſt by the noiſe made by the Boiling and Concoction of the Food, and by the Obſcurity and Clouds caſt on the Animal Spirits by the Vapours, the Rational Soul ſhould be diſcompoſed in Reaſoning. However if <hi>Plato</hi> had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark'd this from Philoſophy, we ſee it every hour by Experience, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Liver and the Stomach are ſo very diſtant from the Brain, yet none can ſet to Study immediately upon Eating, or ſome time after.</p>
               <p>What ſeems moſt true in this matter, is, that the Office of the fourth Ventricle, is to digeſt and alter the Vital, and reſolve them into Animal Spirits, for the end we have ſpoke of: And for this Reaſon Nature has alſo ſeparated the three other, and has
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53763:87"/>
logded it like a little Brain by it ſelf apart, as is to be obſerved, leſt by its Operation, the Speculation of the other ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed. For as to the three little Cells before, it is not to be doubted, but Nature has made them to Reaſon and Diſcourſe; it clearly appears in deep Studies and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, which never fails to make that part of the Head ake, which correſponds to theſe three Cavities. The ſtrength of this Argument appears, if we conſider, that even the other Powers being Fatigued in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming their Office, ever cauſe ſome Pain to thoſe Organs with which they are Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed: As after gazing too long a time, the Eyes water, and after Walking too much the Soles of the Feet will ake. Now the difficulty is to know in which of theſe Cells dwells the Underſtanding; in which the Memory, and in which the Imagination; becauſe they are ſo cloſe and near Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that one cannot well diſtinguiſh, or know it by the Experience we even now ſpoke of, nor by any other Token. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over if we conſider, that the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can do nothing without the Memory be preſent to it, to offer and repreſent to it the Figures and Species, according to the Saying of <hi>Ariſtotle; He that underſtands has no more to do but to reflect on the Images.</hi> Nor the Memory again, without being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by the Imagination, according as
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:53763:87"/>
we have elſewhere noted; we may eaſily conclude, that all the three Faculties are joined and united together in each Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle; that the Underſtanding is not by it ſelf in one, nor the Memory by it ſelf in the other, nor the Imagination by its ſelf in the third, as the Vulgar Philoſophers have thought. This Union of Powers and Virtues uſes to be made in Humane Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, when one cannot act without the Concurrence of the other, as appears in the four Natural Virtues. The Attractive, the Retentive, Digeſtive, and Expulſive; which, to be of uſe one to the other, have by Nature been aſſembled in one and the ſame Place, and not ſeparated from each other.</p>
               <p>But if all this be true, to what end has Nature prepared thoſe three Ventricles, and to each of them joined all the three Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Powers, ſince any one of the three was ſufficient for the Underſtanding and the Memory to play their parts? To this may be anſwered, That it is equally diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to know why Nature has made two Eyes, and as many Ears, ſince in each of them the whole power of Seeing and Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſides, and one may ſee with one Eye alone? To this it may be ſaid, That how much greater the Number of Organs of the Powers appointed and eſtabliſhed for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:53763:88"/>
Perfection of the Animal is, ſo much more aſſured is the Perfection and Poſſeſſion of them; becauſe by ſome Accident one or two may fail, and then it is convenient, that there ſhould be a Supply from others of the ſame kind, which may be ready to Act.</p>
               <p>In the Diſeaſe call'd by Phyſicians, the Reſolution of the Sinews, or Palſy of half the Body, the Operation of the Ventricle that anſwers to the Sick-ſide, is uſually loſt, in ſuch manner as if the two others remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not entire and unhurt, the Man would be ſtupid without Reaſon. And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs from the want of this Ventricle alone, he is obſerved to be very weak, as well in the Actions of the Underſtanding, as of the Imagination, and Memory: Even as he who uſes to See with two Eyes, would be at a loſs in his Sight, if one of them was quite out. By which means it may be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood, that in each Ventricle, all the three Faculties are found, ſince from the hurt of one alone, the other three are all weakned.</p>
               <p>Say now, that all the three Ventricles are compoſed after the ſame manner, and that there is no Diverſity of Parts to be found in them, we cannot be at a loſs if we take the firſt Qualities for the Inſtrument, and ſo make as many differences of Wit as there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:53763:88"/>
be of the firſt Qualities. For it is againſt all Natural Philoſophy, to believe that the Rational Soul being in the Body can exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe her Operations without the Mediation of a Corporeal Inſtrument to aſſiſt her. But of the four Qualities that appear, the Heat, Cold, Moiſture, and Drineſs, all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians reject the Cold as of no uſe at all, in the Operations of the Rational Soul: And accordingly it is obſerved by Experience, in all the other Powers of Man, that where the Cold overballances the Heat, they are blunted and retarded in their Offices; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as neither the Stomach digeſts the Meat, nor the Parts of Generation produce effective Seed, nor the Muſcles duly move the Body, nor the Brain duly Reaſons and Diſcourſes. For which reaſon <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, <hi>The Cold manifeſtly incommodes and retards all the Operations of the Soul:</hi> Serving only in the Body to allay the Natural Heat, and to hinder it from being inflamed. But <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> is of a contrary Opinion, where he ſays, <hi>The thick and hot Blood renders the Man ſtrong and robuſt, and the thinner and more Cold of a more delicate Senſe and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> Whence it clearly appears, that from Cold proceeds the greateſt difference of Wit in Man, <hi>viz.</hi> the Underſtanding. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> therefore enquiring, why the Men inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting hotter Countries (as <hi>Aegypt</hi> is) are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53763:89"/>
more Subtile and Ingenious than thoſe who live in colder Climates, makes Anſwer, That the Ambient Heat being exceſſive, draws forth and conſumes the Natural Heat of the Brain, leaving it cold, which makes Men more ſharp. And that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the great Ambient Cold concentrates the Natural Heat of the Brain, not ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to diſperſe: And further, they who have very hot Brains, ſays he, can neither Reaſon nor Diſcourſe, but are Volatile, never fixing on one Opinion. <hi>Galen,</hi> as it ſeems, alluded to this, where he ſays, the reaſon why a Man changes his Opinion every moment, is, becauſe he had a very hot Brain; and on the contrary, he that has a cold Brain will be firm and ſteady in his Opinion. But the Truth is, there is no difference of Wit proceeds from this Quality, neither could <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> mean that the Blood, cold in exceſs, made the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding better, but only when it is leſs hot. When a Man is fickle, it is true, it proceeds from too great a Heat, that raiſes tranſient Figures in his Brain, making them as it were to boil, by which means the Images of many things repreſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at once to the Rational Soul, awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inviting it to a Conſideration of them, and to enjoy all, ſhe leaves ſome, and Embraces others. The quite contrary
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53763:89"/>
happens in Cold, which renders a Man fixt and ſtable in an Opinion; becauſe it keeps the Figures faſt locked up, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to fly ſo faſt, ſo that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents no other Image to a Man but what is called for. Cold has this Peculiar, that it retards the Motions, not only of Corporeal things, but alſo renders the Figures and the Species (by Philoſophers termed Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual) immovable in the Brain; but this firmneſs ſeems rather to be a certain Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than a Difference of Wit. There is another kind of Steadineſs, which proceeds from the Underſtanding, being cloſer and more compact, and not from any coldneſs of Brain.

That all the Men that ever ſignaliz'd themſelves in the Sciences, were Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholic. In fine, all agree, that Drineſs makes a Man very Wiſe; but no Man ſhews which of the Rational Faculties it moſt favours. The Prophet <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. xxviii</note>

Now we call the Memory a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faculty, becauſe without it the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Imagination are of no uſe.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:53763:92"/>
by way of Compreſſion. Infancy is an evident Proof of this Doctrin; ſeeing in that Age the Memory is readier than in all the other, becauſe the Brain then is moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. <note n="*" place="margin">XXX. Sect. prob. IV.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> therefore demands, <hi>Why the Old have more Wit and a better <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the Young learn readier and with more eaſe?</hi> To which he makes Anſwer, That the Memory of Old People is filled with ſo many Images of things which they have ſeen and heard during the long courſe of their Life, that there is no room left to receive any thing new; but that of Young People, as Perſons late Born, meets with no difficulty therein, which makes them receive and retain immediately all that is told and taught them. Which may be better underſtood by compairing the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening Memory, and ſhewing that we learn better in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we then riſe with a freſh Memory, but in the evening we learn ill, becauſe it is ſtuffed with all the Objects of the Day paſt. And to the end the curious Reader may not be ſurprized that ſo great a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhould never light upon a true Anſwer, and which even thoſe of leſs Wit than himſelf ſometimes find, and form better Arguments than his; he muſt know that <hi>Plato</hi> not at all doubting but the Graveſt Philoſophers do often as men
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:53763:92"/>
miſtake, either through Inadvertence, or for want of Weighing, and being well enough acquainted with all the Principles contained in the Doctrin they teach, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes ſuch as read his Works, to conſider them with great care, and not to rely too much upon him, or on the good Opinion they have conceived of them; <hi>To examin,</hi> ſays he, <hi>and cautiouſly weigh all his Words, and thoſe of the Philoſophers, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them before they have made ſome Proof of them, no though they may ſeem the trueſt in the World.</hi> Becauſe in effect it would be a great ſhame to me, that Nature having given me Eyes to See, and an Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to Diſtinguiſh, yet I ſhould ask <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> and the other Philoſophers, what are the Figures and Colours of things, and what Being and Nature they have. Open your Eyes (ſays <hi>Plato</hi>) make uſe of your own Wit and Ability, and fear nothing; for the ſame He that made <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> made you alſo; and he who formed ſo great a Wit, may very well alſo form a greater. 'Tis nevertheleſs very Reaſonable to have Excellent Authors in great Veneration, for the Abundance of things they have taught us; but we ought to uſe ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and not abſolutely ſtifle all the Wit we have; ſeeing that the Scholar's Knowledge conſiſts not only in believing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53763:93"/>
the Maſter that taught him, but his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ought rather to be ſatisfied with, and feed on the Truth and Conformity of the Doctrin. Accordingly <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaking to the Phyſicians, and in their Name, to all thoſe who Pin themſelves on their Sleeves, and ſwear to the Words of their Maſter, ſaid, <hi>That</hi> Hippocrates <hi>was not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to be relied upon, but when the Matter in diſpute agreed with Reaſon, and with our Sentiments.</hi> For in doing otherwiſe we acquire no Science, but Humane Faith, which is quite contrary to the deſire we have of Knowledge. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays of true Science, <hi>We may believe that we know a thing, when we know the Cauſe of it, and how it is the Cauſe of it, and that it cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe produced.</hi> Which we are ignorant of, when we have only Faith and a Pious Opinion of him that teaches us. But if we will carry this Conſideration yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we ſhall find, that Man has not only leave to Examine, and bring to the Proof what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and all the other Natural Philoſophers affirm; but if the Philoſophers, and even the Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who know more than all the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers in the World, come to teach him any Doctrin whatever, he is directed and commanded not to believe, without ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before-hand tried and known if the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:53763:93"/>
Doctrin be true or falſe, and without duly oppoſing all the Difficulties and Arguments he can make and object upon that matter. 'Twas therefore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> conſidering that we are without ceaſing encompaſſed with Devils ſeeking how they may deſtroy us, and our good Angels who guard and preſerve us; and that both the one and the other ſpeak to us, and ſhew us the things in their ſpiritual Language; adviſes us not to give any aſſent to them, till we have Tried and Examined if they are good or evil Angels. Accordingly ſaid he, <hi>My Brethren, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are of God.</hi> What more certain and truer Embaſſy, and of more Importance to Mankind was ever made in the World, than that of the Arch-Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> to the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin?</hi> Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs ſhe failed not firſt to Try and Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, and to oppoſe the ſtrongeſt Reaſons ſhe could find upon that occaſion, and ſeeing and believing that it was a good Angel, and that it was a good Salutation, ſhe ſpoke to it, <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word.</hi> Which had ſhe done without this Precaution, ſhe had not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd her Duty.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Buſineſs, <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, <hi>That he who will not aſſent to what is ſaid to him, ought to diſprove it; and he that cannot diſprove it, ought to aſſent.</hi> By which he gives us to underſtand, that there are two different ſorts
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:53763:94"/>
of Wits among Men of Learning; ſome who are not able enough to diſprove, and thoſe he directs to aſſent, although they be not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the Author's Doctrin; Others, who are able enough to diſprove, whom he obliges to give a Reaſon for their Diſſent. Since then the Anſwer <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gave to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem ſatifies me not, I am obliged by what I have now ſaid to give a Reaſon, why my Underſtanding will not admit it, and the reaſon is very clear, becauſe that if the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Figures which are in the Memory had matter and quantity to poſſeſs place, it ſeems that his Anſwer would have been good; but being Indiviſible and Immaterial as they are, they can neither fill nor vacate the place where they are. Nay, we ſee by Experience, the more the Memory is exerciſed in receiving every day new Figures, the more capable ſhe is to receive them. According to my Doctrin, the Anſwer to the Problem is very eaſie; for I ſhould chuſe to ſay that Old Men have a good Underſtanding, becauſe they are very dry; and that they have no Memory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have no moiſture. By which means the ſubſtance of their Brain is harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo that they cannot receive the Impreſſion of Figures, neither more nor leſs than hard Wax receives with difficulty the Figure of the Seal; but that which is ſoft receives it eaſily. Among Young People the contrary happens, who from abundance of moiſture of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:53763:94"/>
the Brain want Underſtanding, and have a good Memory, becauſe of the ſweetneſs and ſoftneſs of the ſame Brain, in which by reaſon of the moiſture the Figures and Species from without make a good, firm, eaſie, and deep Impreſſion.</p>
               <p>That the Memory is better and readier in the morning than evening, is not to be denied, but not for the Reaſon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gave but juſt now. The night ſleep is the cauſe of it, that moiſtens and ſtrengthens the Brain, which by the waking of the whole day drys up and hardens. Therefore <note n="*" place="margin">VI. Apho. com. xxvi.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid, <hi>They that deſire to drink in the night, being very dry, if they ſleep upon it, it is good</hi>; and that the drought goes off, becauſe ſleep moiſtens the Body, and fortifies the Ruling Faculties of Man. But that ſleep produces ſome effect, it follows clearly from this Doctrin; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf confeſſes, That the Underſtanding and the Memory are oppoſite and contrary Faculties; ſo that he who hath a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, may want Underſtanding; and on the other hand, he who has a better Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may not have a good Memory; becauſe it is impoſſible for the Brain to be moiſt and dry at the ſame time in an intenſe degree. <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. de memor &amp; reminiſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> built upon this Maxim, to prove that the Memory is a different Faculty from Remembrance, and forms his Argument after this manner. Such as have a great Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance are Men of great Underſtanding, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:53763:95"/>
thoſe who have a good Memory, want Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; the Memory and Remembrance then are two Contrary Powers. According to my Doctrin the firſt Propoſition is falſe, becauſe they who have a great Remembrance want Underſtanding, but are Maſters of a large Invention, as I ſhall preſently prove: But the ſecond Propoſition is true, though <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> did not know the Reaſon upon which he grounded the Contrariety between the Underſtanding and the Memory.</p>
               <p>The Imagination ariſes from the Heat (which is the third Quality) becauſe as there remains in the Brain no other Rational Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, ſo have we no other Quality to aſcribe to it. For the Sciences appertaining to the Imagination, are the Exerciſe of them that rave in their Sickneſs, and not the ſame with thoſe which belong to the Underſtanding and Memory. And ſuppoſe that Phrenſy, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Melancholy, are the over-heated Paſſions of the Brain, we may thence draw a ſtrong Proof, that the Imagination conſiſts in Heat. There is but one thing in which I find ſome difficulty, which is, that the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination is contrary to the Underſtanding, and to the Memory alſo; and the reaſon is not cleared by Experience, becauſe great heat and drineſs may well enough meet in the Brain in an intenſe degree, and ſo may great heat and moiſture; inſomuch, that a Man may gave a good Underſtanding with a great
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:53763:95"/>
Invention, and a happy Memory with a vaſt Invention; and yet nevertheleſs it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to find one of a great Invention, who has neither a good Underſtanding nor a good Memory. The reaſon of which is, that the Underſtanding requires that the Brain be compoſed of very ſubtle and delicate Parts, as we have elſewhere proved from <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. Art. Med. cap. XII.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> and that a great Heat diſcuſſes and conſumes the more delicate Parts, leaving behind thoſe that are more groſs and earthy. And for the ſame reaſon a good Invention cannot be coupled with a great Memory, becauſe the exceſſive Heat diſſolves the moiſture of the Brain, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it hard and dry; by which means it cannot ſo eaſily receive the Figures.</p>
               <p>So that there remain no more than three principal Differences of Wit to be found in Man, becauſe there appear but three Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Qualities, whence they can proceed. But under theſe three General Differences are contained many other Particular Differences, by reaſon of the ſeveral Degrees, Heat, Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and Drineſs may have: Yet is it not preciſely true, that from every Degree of theſe three Qualities reſults a different Wit, becauſe the Drineſs, Heat and Moiſture, may exceed to ſuch a degree as the whole Rational Faculty may be Renverſed; according to that of <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. II. Aph. com. XX.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen, Every Exceſs of Temperament diſſolves the Powers.</hi> A thing moſt ſure; for altho' the Underſtanding be advantaged by Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:53763:96"/>
yet nevertheleſs it may be in ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as to incommode its Operations. Which neither <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. Quod animi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. cap. V.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> nor the Antient Philoſophers allow of; for they, on the contrary, aſſure us, That if Old-mens Brains were not, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cold, they would never decay, though they were dry even in the fourth Degree. But in this there is no reaſon, as appears by what we ſhall prove from the Imagination, for though its Operations are performed by means of Heat, as ſoon as it is paſt the third Degree, that Faculty forthwith begins to decay, and the ſame equally happens to the Memory from too great a Moiſture.</p>
               <p>Now I cannot ſay in particular how many Differences of Wit ariſe by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe Degrees of each of theſe three Qualities; but I muſt firſt deduce, and recount all the Operations of the Underſtanding, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Memory; then amongſt ſo many, you are to know there are three principal Actions of the Underſtanding: The Firſt is, to Diſcourſe; the Second, to Diſtinguiſh; and the Third, to Chuſe. And theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the three Differences of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; the Memory is likewiſe divided into three other, into that which readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and as ſoon loſes; that which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly receives, but long retains; and that which eaſily receives, and is long a loſing.</p>
               <p>The Imagination comprehends many more Differences; for it has three of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53763:96"/>
as the Underſtanding and the Memory, and from each Degree ariſes three others. We will hereafter ſpeak more diſtinctly of them, where we ſhall aſſign to each the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that Anſwers it in particular.</p>
               <p>But he that would conſider the three other Differences of Wit, ſhall find, that there are certain Abilities amongſt thoſe that Study; ſome of which naturally diſpoſe them to the clear and eaſie Speculation of the Art they learn;<note rend="inter">Of theſe two Differences of Wit <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks thus; He indeed is the Beſt, that of himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends every thing; but then again, he is not Bad, who follows him that is in the right.

In this Rank are all the half-Witted in all Sciences whatever, who being Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in the obvious Points of their Art, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer all they underſtand of it; but being put to the very delicate and ſubtil Part, utter a thouſand Abſurdities.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53763:97"/>
need to learn the Science from able Maſters, who know a great deal, to have abundance of Books, and be aſſiduous in Study, for the leſs they read and labour, ſtill the leſs they know.

all the Arts would improve, and the Men that are yet unborn, would enjoy the Labours and Inventions of thoſe that lived before them.

Who takes no pleaſure in the open and eaſy Plains, but loves to Caper along the Hill-tops, and upon the Points of Precipices, not caring for the beaten Road, or the Company of the Herd. Of the ſame Nature is the Rational Soul that meets a well Organiz'd and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Brain, as is never bounded with any Speculation, ever aſpiring and daily looking out to diſcover things new and elevate. Of this ſort of Souls, that of<note n="*" place="margin">VI. Epid. V. Com. XI.</note>

Theſe two differences of Wit are very ordinary amongſt Men of Letters;<note rend="inter">This Difference of Wit is very agreeable to Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which only ought to follow the Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity declared by the Holy Councils and the Sacred Doctors.</note> ſome there are who are elevated, and above the common Level, judging and treating of things in a very particular manner, and are free to give their Opinion without following any Man.

               <head>CHAP. IX. Some Doubts and Arguments againſt the Doctrin of the laſt Chapter, with their Anſwers.</head>
               <p>ONE of the Reaſons why the Wiſdom of <hi>Socrates</hi> has been ſo Celebrated even to this day, was, That after he had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> the Wiſeſt Man in the World, he ſpoke thus: <hi>This only I know, that I know nothing.</hi> All who heard or read this Saying, were of Opinion, that it was his, becauſe <hi>Socrates</hi> was an humble Man, who deſpiſed the things of this World, and in reſpect of Divine things counted them nothing. But they were deceived in effect, for not one of the Antient Philoſophers was endued with that Virtue of Humility, nor ſo much as knew what it was, till the Coming of our Lord, who taught it us.</p>
               <p>All that <hi>Socrates</hi> intended thereby, was, the little certainty there is in Human Sciences, and how far the Knowledge of Philoſophy is in whatever it pretends, from any Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Aſſurance; ſince it is found by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that all is full of Doubts and Diſputes; and that they cannot give their Sentiment in any one thing whatever, without fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contradicted; to which purpoſe is that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:53763:99"/>
Saying, <hi>The Thoughts of Men are full of fear, and all their foreſight uncertain.</hi> But he that has the true Knowledge of things, may be ſettled and at eaſe, without Fear or Doubt of being deceived, and the Philoſopher that is not ſo, may truly, and without the leaſt diſſimulation aſſert, that he knows nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Galen</hi> made the ſame Reflection, when he ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc. c. V.</note> 
                  <hi>Science is a ſort of Knowledge, congruous, ſettled, and never wide of Reaſon: Not to be found among the Philoſophers, eſpecially when they ſearch into the Nature of things, and yet much leſs in the Art of Phyſic; and to ſay all in a word, it is unknown to Men.</hi> According to this the true Knowledge of things is placed out of our reach, Man only having a kind of Opinion, which holds him wavering and in ſuſpence, whether what he affirms be true or no. But what <hi>Galen</hi> obſerv'd more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in this, was, that Philoſophy and Phyſic are of all Sciences in uſe among Men the moſt uncertain: And if this be true, what ſhall we ſay to the Philoſophy here handled, in which the Underſtanding makes an Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of things, ſo obſcure, as are the Powers and Faculties of the Rational Soul? In which Matter, ſo many Doubts and Difficulties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelves, that there is nothing upon which one may ſafely rely or depend. One of which is, that we have given to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for an Inſtrument wherewith to Act, the Brain with Drineſs, having ſaid
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53763:99"/>
thereupon, that the reaſon why Men have Brains organiz'd much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Brute Beaſts, was, becauſe the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (by which Man much excels other Animals) was a Faculty which wanted not Corporeal Organs, and ſo Nature wiſely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided no particular Inſtrument for it, in the Brain of Man. Which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proved clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he ſaid, That it belong'd to this Faculty to know and underſtand. Beſides, the Reaſons on which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> inſiſted, to prove that the Underſtanding was not an Organic Faculty, are of ſuch force, that it cannot well be otherwiſe concluded; becauſe to this Faculty belongs to know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Nature and Being of all the material things in the World; inſomuch, as if it were united with any Corporeal thing, that very thing would hinder the Knowledge of all others; as we ſee in the exterior Senſes; that if the Taſte be bitter, whatever the Tongue touches has the ſame ſavour; and if the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalin-Humour be green or yellow, the Eye judges whatever it ſees to be of the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and the Cauſe of it is, that <hi>Inward Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures bar the entrance of Objects from without. Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid alſo, that if the Underſtanding were united to any Corporeal Inſtrument, it would be ſuſceptible of a material Quality, becauſe that which is united to it, be it hot or cold, muſt neceſſarily have Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with heat or cold. But to ſay the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:53763:100"/>
is hot, cold, moiſt, or dry, is a Propoſition abominable to the Ears of any Natural Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>The other principal Difficulty is, That <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi> and all the Peripatitics, have eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two other Powers beſides the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Imagination, and Memory; which are the Remembrance and the Common Senſe; in purſuance of this Rule. <hi>The Faculties are diſcerned by their Acts.</hi> They find beſides the Operations of the Underſtanding, Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Memory, there are two others very different; the Wit of Man then ariſes from Five Faculties, and not from three alone, as we have already proved.</p>
               <p>We have alſo ſaid in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, following <hi>Galen</hi>'s Opinion, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory does nought elſe in the Brain but bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerve the Figures and Species of things, even as a Coffer keeps Clothes and whatever elſe is laid up in it. And if by this Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon we may come to underſtand the Office of this Faculty, there will be ſtill need to find a Rational Faculty to draw and fetch out the Figures from the Memory, and repreſent them to the Underſtanding, even as it is no leſs than neceſſary for ſome hand to open the Coffer, to take out thence what was laid up therein. Moreover we have ſaid, that the Underſtanding and Memory were two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Powers, and that one deſtroyed the other; becauſe one required much Drineſs;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:53763:100"/>
and the other, much Moiſture and Softneſs of Brain. But if that be true, how came <hi>Plato</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. II. de anima.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> to affirm, That Men of a ſoft Fleſh had a great deal of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince ſoftneſs is an effect of moiſture? We have alſo granted, That to have a good Memory the Brain muſt be ſoft, inaſmuch as the Figures muſt be ſtamped thereon, to make an Impreſſion, and if it were hard, they could not be ſo well imprinted. True it is, that to receive the Figures eaſily, it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the Brain ſhould be ſoft, but to preſerve the Species long, all the Philoſophers aſſert, that hardneſs and drineſs are no leſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; as it appears in things from without; for an impreſſion in a ſoft Matter ſoon wears out; but is never utterly effac'd, if made on a dry and hard Body. Accordingly we ſee many learn eaſily by Heart, what they as ſoon after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get. Of which <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. Art. Med. cap. XII.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> giving the Reaſon, affirms, That ſuch from the abundance of Moiſture have a fluid and no ſolid Subſtance in the Brain, which occaſions the Figure to wear out as ſoon as it would do, ſhould any pretend to Grave on Water. On the contrary, the other difficultly take any thlng, but never loſe what they have once learned. Wherefore it ſeems impoſſible to have that Difference of Memory we have ſpoke of, to learn readily and to retain long.</p>
               <p>'Tis alſo no leſs difficult to underſtand how ſo many Figures can be imprinted together in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53763:101"/>
the Brain, without one effacing the other; and that the ſame thing falls not out as we ſee in ſoft Wax, on which if one imprints ſeveral Seals of different Forms, ſome will force out the others, there remaining only behind a promiſcuous Confuſion of Figures. And what affords no leſs pain and difficulty, is, to know whence it ariſes, that the Memory by conſtant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is made more capable to receive the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; ſince it is certain, that the Exerciſe not only of the Body, but even of the Mind, dries and conſumes the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>It is alſo as difficult to diſcern how the Imagination is contrary to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if there appear no other reaſon more preſſing than to ſay the ſubtil Parts of the Brain are reſolved and diſcuſſed by much Heat, and that there remain behind the groſſeſt and moſt earthy, ſince Melancholy is allow'd to be one of the groſſeſt and earthieſt Humors of the Body. Yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, That the Underſtanding received more Advantage from that, than from any other: The difficulty ſeems yet greater, when we come to conſider, that Melancholy is a groſs, cold, and dry Humor; and that Choler is of a delicate Subſtance, and of a hot and dry Temperament. This appears repugnant to Reaſon, becauſe this laſt Humor promotes the Underſtanding by means of two Qualities, and is contrary only to one, which is Heat: And Melancholy favours it by Drineſs alone,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53763:101"/>
and nothing elſe, being contrary to it, both in the coldneſs and groſſneſs of the Subſtance, which is what the Underſtanding moſt of all abhors. For which reaſon <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. de natura humana, com. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> aſſigned more Wit and Prudence to Choler than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. <hi>Dexterity and Prudence are owing to Choler, but the Melancholy Humour is the cauſe of Integrity and Conſtancy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly it is demanded, Whence it comes, that the Application to Study and Aſſiduous Speculation renders many knowing and wiſe, who at the beginning wanted the good Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Qualities we have mentioned, and yet nevertheleſs by the force of Intention of Mind, they have attained the Knowledge of many Truths, of which before they were ignorant when it appears they had not the requiſite Temperament to arrive at it; for if they had had it, they needed not to have taken ſo much pains.</p>
               <p>All theſe Difficulties and many more, are oppoſite to the Doctrin laid down in the laſt Chapter, becauſe in effect Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy has no ſuch certain Principles to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed by as the Mathematics, in which a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician and Philoſopher (who is alſo a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician) may always give ſome Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but in coming to Cure Diſeaſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rules of Phyſic, he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit therein many Errors, not always through his own fault, (ſince in the Mathematics he may be always ſure) but becauſe of the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53763:102"/>
of his Art. Which made <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. Topic.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſay, <hi>The Phyſician who uſes all the Diligence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by his Art, though he does not always Cure the Patient, yet he ought not to be eſteemed <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful in his Profeſſion.</hi> But if the ſame man ſhould commit the leaſt Error in the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics, he would be without Excuſe, becauſe if they employ what care they ought in this Science, it is impoſſible to fail of being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. So that ſince there is no Demonſtration to be given of our Doctrin, all the fault is not to be attributed to Defect of Skill, nor is it to be inferred from thence that what we have deliver'd is falſe.</p>
               <p>To the firſt and main Doubt we Anſwer, that it muſt be conſider'd there are two ſorts of Underſtanding in man, one of which is the Power in the Rational Soul, and that is as incorruptible as the Rational Soul it ſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out depending in the leaſt upon the Body or its material Organs, either for its Being, or Preſervation; and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Arguments have only place, with regard to this Power. The other ſort of Underſtanding is all that, which appears neceſſary in the Brain of man, to the end he may underſtand as he ought: 'Tis in this Senſe we uſe to ſay <hi>Peter</hi> has a better Underſtanding than <hi>John,</hi> which cannot be taken for the Power lodged in the Soul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is of equal Perfection in all, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for ſome of the organic Powers, which the Underſtanding makes uſe of in its Acts;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53763:102"/>
ſome of which it performs well, and others ill; not at all through its own fault, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Powers it makes uſe of in ſome find good Organs, and in others ill. Which is to be underſtood in no other manner, ſince we find by Experience, not only that ſome men Reaſon better than others; but even that the ſame Perſon Reaſons and Diſcourſes well at one Age, and ill at another, as we have, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prov'd. Nay, there are ſome who loſe their Judgment, even as others recover it, from certain Diſtempers of the Brain. Which is particularly ſeen in the Hectic Fever better than in any other; for when that once begins to reach the Brain, the Sick Perſon begins alſo to Speak and Reaſon more Eloquently and Judiciouſly than he uſed, and how much the deeper that Evil gets Root, ſo much the more excellent are the Operations of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; which was not conſider'd by ſome of the Antient Phyſicians, though this Knowledge be of ſo great importance in the firſt Appearance of the Diſeaſe when the Cure is eaſy.</p>
               <p>But what theſe organic Powers are, of which the Underſtanding makes uſe in its O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, has not yet been reſolv'd or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd, ſeeing the Natural Philoſophers ſay, that if one man Reaſons better than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it comes from the Underſtanding's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Organic Power, and better diſpos'd in one than another, and not for any other
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53763:103"/>
Reaſon. For all Rational Souls and their Capacities (when ſeparated from their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) are of equal Perfection and Knowledge. Thoſe that follow the Doctrin of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſeeing by Experience that ſome Reaſon better than others, have found out a ſeeming Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſaying, That if one Man Reaſons better than another, it comes not from the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding's being an organic Power, nor from the Brain's being better diſpoſed in one than in the other, but becauſe the Underſtanding, ſo long as the Rational Soul is in the Body, has occaſion for theſe Figures and Species which are in the Imagination and Memory; in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of which, the Underſtanding happens to Diſcourſe ill, though not through its own Fault, or by being joined to ill Organiz'd Matter. But this Anſwer contradicts the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de memoria &amp; remini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcentia.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Doctrin, who proves that the Underſtanding is better, as the Memory is worſe; and on the other hand, the more the Memory advances and riſes to a point, the more the Underſtanding fails and declines; which we have already prov'd in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In purſuance of this, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, Why the Old have ſo bad a Memory, with ſo good an Underſtanding; and the Young a good Memory, with a bad Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding? Experience furniſhes us with an Inſtance obſerv'd alſo by <hi>Galen,</hi> that when the Temperament and good Diſpoſition of the Brain are deſtroy'd by Sickneſs, we often loſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53763:103"/>
the uſe of the Operations of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, while thoſe of the Memory and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation remain unimpair'd; which could never be, if the Underſtanding had not a particular Inſtrument by its ſelf, diſtinct from that of the other Powers. What I ſhall Anſwer to this, is, That when the Brain is obſerved to be moiſter than it ſhould, the eaſineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and retain in the Memory improves; but when the Repreſentation of the Species is not ſo vivid, nor ſo good, it is better effected without compariſon with Drineſs, which is light and clear, than with Moiſture, which is dark and troubled; inſomuch, that the Underſtanding fails in its Operations, from the Clouds and Obſcurity of the Species. Quite contrary, thoſe who are of a dry Brain, have not a Memory that receives and retains well; but in recompence hereof they are provided with an Imagination which helps them to ſee clearly the Figures, becauſe of the Light which attends the Drineſs, and it is that of which the Underſtanding has moſt need, according to <hi>Heraclitus</hi>'s Saying, <hi>The dry light makes the Soul wiſe.</hi> What darkneſs, and what miſts, moiſture ſpreads over the Objects, and what light, drineſs brings along with it, may be eaſily obſerved in the Night, when the South or North Winds blow: The firſt renders the Stars dark and overcaſt, and the other bright and clear. The ſame thing falls out with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Figures and Species in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53763:104"/>
inſomuch that it is not to be admired, that the Underſtanding ſometimes blunders, and ſometimes hits right, according as theſe Species and Figures which it makes uſe of in Speculation, prove either clear or obſcure, without any neceſſity of its being therefore a Faculty tied to its Organs, or of any defect to be imputed to it.</p>
               <p>Some Natural Philoſophers have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Incorruptibility of the Heavens, their Clearneſs and Tranſparency, as well as the ſparkling of the Stars, was owing to the great Drineſs of their Compoſition. 'Tis for the ſame cauſe Old men Reaſon ſo well, and Sleep ſo ill; becauſe, ſay I, of the great Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Brain, which is in a manner clear and tranſparent, and the Species and Figures as ſparkling as the Stars. And as Drineſs har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the ſubſtance of the Brain, from thence comes it, that they learn ſo ill by Heart: On the contrary, Children have a good Memory, Sleep well, and Reaſon ill, becauſe of the great moiſture of the Brain, which renders it ſoft, dark, full of Vapours, Clouds, Obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, and the Species troubled and unclear, which preſenting in that Condition to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, make it commit Errors, through the Defects of the Object, rather than its own. In this conſiſts the difficulty found by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in joining a good Underſtanding with a great Memory, and not from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory's being contrary to the Underſtanding.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:53763:104"/>
For if we conſider well, we ſhall find, there is no Faculty ſubſervient to ſo many Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Underſtanding, as is the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for ſo long as that has not ſomething that keeps it employ'd, in repreſenting the Figures and Species, this cannot reaſon after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the World; inſomuch that for want of having wherewith to buſie it ſelf, the Man remains imperfect and a very Blockhead. 'Tis even as <hi>Galen</hi> reports, That in a certain Plague that happen'd in <hi>Aſia,</hi> the men there loſt their Memory to that Degree, as they forgot even their own Names; many forgot alſo what they had Learn'd in the Arts and Sciences; inſomuch, as they were obliged to Study them again, as if they had never learn'd them at all. Some others alſo forgot their Language, remaining like Brute Beaſts, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able either to Speak, or Reaſon in any wiſe, for want of Memory. It was upon this occaſion, ſaid <hi>Plato,</hi> that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients raiſed Temples and Altars to Memory, adoring her as the Goddeſs of the Sciences; for ſo he ſpeaks: <hi>But beſides the Gods thou haſt brought me, there muſt be others alſo invok'd, and eſpecially Memory, which gives the chief weight and Ornament to our Diſcourſe, to the end that we may publickly acquit our ſelves well of our Charge.</hi> In which he had great Reaſon; for a Man knows not how many things the ſame Faculty has in ſtore for him, it being no leſs than the Treaſury of the Sciences. Now as
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:53763:105"/>
we ſhall elſewhere prove, when the Brain is well Temper'd, and no Quality exceeds the others, a Man has at the ſame time a good Underſtanding with a great Memory; which could not fall out, if theſe two Faculties were exact Contraries.</p>
               <p>One may Anſwer to the ſecond Argument, That not all difference of Actions ſhew a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Powers; for, as we ſhall prove hereafter, the Imagination performs ſuch ſtrange Actions, that if this Maxim were true, which the Vulgar Philoſophers receive, and to be Interpreted as they interpret it, there would be more than ten or twelve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Powers in the Brain. But becauſe all theſe Actions agree in one kind, they denote but one Imagination, which afterward is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral particular Differences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Diverſity of Actions it performs. To compoſe the Species in the preſence or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Objects, not only does not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there are ſome different generical Powers, as are the Common Senſe and the Imagination, but alſo that the ſame are no particular Faculties.</p>
               <p>To the third Objection it may be Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That the Memory may be under two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations. The one, as a Faculty that has its ſubject in the Rational Soul; and the other, as it regards a Corporeal Organ, which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has framed for it in the Brain. For the firſt, it belongs not to the Juriſdiction of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:53763:105"/>
Philoſophy, but to the Metaphyſician, from whom we ought to learn what it is. For the ſecond, it is a thing ſo difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, after what manner one man is furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a great Memory, and another has none at all, and what Inſtruments Nature has made in our Head, to make us recollect what is paſt, that Natural Philoſophy is driven to invent and ſearch out for ſome Inſtances more proper to make it underſtood, which are not true and certain. <hi>Plato</hi> willing to teach us how it came to paſs that one man had a great Memory, and another but a little one, and how one remembred what was paſt clearly and diſtinctly, and the other confuſedly, found two Examples very pertinent, by ſuppoſing a thing that is not. Let us feign, ſaid he, to ſerve us for an Inſtance, that Nature had put into mens Souls a piece of Wax, in one greater, in the other leſs; in one purer and finer Wax, and in the other more courſe and droſſy; in one harder, and difficulter to penetrate, and the other plianter, ſofter, and more ductile; and that the Sight, Hearing, and other Senſes, were imprinted with a Seal, being no other than the Figure of what they had receiv'd and reported. After this rate, thoſe who had a great deal of Wax, would have a large Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, becauſe they had a great Field to ſow it in. Thoſe who had but a little Wax, would have a ſmall Memory, for the ſame Reaſon. Thoſe who had the Wax foul, unpurged and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:53763:106"/>
droſſy, would form confuſed, and ill-mark'd Ideas. Thoſe who had the hard, would have trouble to learn by Heart, becauſe that kind of Wax difficultly receives the Figures. They who have ſoft and tender, will have a great Memory, will eaſily learn, and retain by Heart all they know. After all this, it is certain, that <hi>Plato</hi> did not in good earneſt believe, that when Nature formed us, ſhe put in our Souls any ſuch pieces of Wax; nor that man's Memory was made of any ſuch matter; but it was only an Inſtance of a thing feigned, and accommodated to the rudeneſs of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity: And not content with this Example, he ſought out another, affording no leſs means to underſtand what he meant; which is, of the Writer and the Paper; for as the Writer ſets down in Paper thoſe things he would not forget, and reviſes them after he has put them in Writing; in the ſame manner it muſt be underſtood, that the Imagination imprints in the Memory the Figures of things, which the Senſes and the Underſtanding have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, as well as thoſe others, which ſhe her ſelf invents; and when it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect them, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has ſaid, it returns to review and revolve. <hi>Plato</hi> made uſe of this Compariſon, when he declared, that in Apprehenſion of the failing of his Memory in his Old Age, he was diligent in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting another of Paper (which was his Books) that he might not loſe his Labour,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:53763:106"/>
but upon each Review, it might a-new be repreſented to him; the Imagination does no more, as often as it imprints in the Memory, and reads it over again, whenever it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect it ſelf. <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. III. de anima.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was the firſt that broach'd this Opinion, and <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. II. de motu muſculor.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> the next, who ſpoke after this manner. <hi>For the Part of the Soul that Imagins, which ever it is, it ſeems to be the very ſame that Remembers.</hi> And this appears plainly, in that the things which we Imagin with much intention of mind, ſink deeper into the Memory, and thoſe of which we think but ſlightly, are ſoon forgot. And as the Writer, when he has writ a fair Letter, reads it eaſily, and without miſtake; even ſo it fairs with the Imagination; for if it ſtamp them with force, the Figures remain well imprinted and mark'd in the Brain, otherwiſe they are hard to be diſtinguiſhed. The ſame alſo befalls old Writings, of which, part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſound and freſh, and part worn out by Time, which cannot well be read, unleſs the Defects are ſupplied by Gueſs: The Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation preciſely takes the ſame Courſe, when ſome Figures are effaced in the Memory, and others retain'd. Whence ſprang <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Error, who for no other reaſon believ'd that Remembrance was a different Power from Memory. Beſides which, he ſaid, that thoſe who have a great Remembrance, have a good Underſtanding, which is equally falſe; becauſe the Imagination, whence the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:53763:107"/>
proceeds, is contrary to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. For to fix things in the Memory, and to remember them after they are known, is an Act of the Imagination; even as Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any thing, and reading it afterwards, is an Act of the Writer, and not of the Paper. According to which, the Memory is a Paſſive, and not an Active Power, as the Blank-Paper is no more than a Capacity for one to Write on.</p>
               <p>The fourth Doubt may be thus ſolv'd, That it imports nothing to a Man's Wit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Fleſh be hard, or delicate and ſoft, if the Brain enjoy not alſo the ſame quality; for that we obſerve very often poſſeſſes a Temperament diſtinct from that of all other Parts of the Body. Nay, even when the Fleſh, and the Brain accord, in being both alike tender and ſoft, it is a bad Indication for the Underſtanding, and no leſs for the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. Be it as it will, if we conſider the Fleſh of Women, and Children, we ſhall find, that it is ſofter and more tender than Men's, yet nevertheleſs Men are for the moſt part of a better Wit than Women. The Natural Reaſon of which, is, That the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours that make the Fleſh ſoft are Phlegm and Blood, becauſe both the one and the other are moiſt (as we have already noted) and of theſe Humours, <hi>Galen</hi> has pronounced, that they make Men ſilly and blockiſh: On the contrary, the Humours which harden the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53763:107"/>
Fleſh, are Choler and Melancholy, whence proceed the Wiſdom and Knowledge of Men. So that to have ſoft and delicate Fleſh,<note place="margin">Amongſt brute Beaſts there is none comes ſo near hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as the Elephant, and yet none have ſo hard and rough Fleſh as he.</note> is a worſe ſign than to have dry and hard. And accordingly among Men that are of an equal Temperament, throughout the whole Body, it is very eaſie to gueſs at the Difference of their Wit, from the ſoftneſs or hardneſs of the Fleſh; for if it be hard and rough, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages a good Underſtanding, or a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, but if ſoft and delicate, it denotes the contrary, which is a good Memory with little Underſtanding, and leſs Invention. To diſcover then if the Brain correſpond with the Fleſh, the Hair ought to be conſider'd; for if that be thick, black, harſh, and curled, it is a ſign of a good Invention, or a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but if lank, and ſoft, it is an Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a good Memory, and nothing more. But he that would know, and diſtinguiſh, whether it be Underſtanding, or Imagination, which is betoken'd, when the Hair is ſuch as we mentioned, muſt conſider, how the Youth behaves himſelf in Laughing, for that Paſſion ſtrongly diſcovers if the Imagination be good or bad.</p>
               <p>What the cauſe of Laughter is, many Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers have pretended to know; but not one has made it Intelligible; they only all agree in this, that the Blood is the Humour that provokes a Man to Laugh, though none of them have told us what are the particular
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53763:108"/>
Qualities of this Humour, that make a Man ſubject to Laughter. <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. VI. Aph. LIII.</note> 
                  <hi>In a Phrenſy the Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fits are ſecurer, and the crying Fits more deſperate</hi>; for the firſt is made by means of the Blood, which a very benign Humour; but the other is no leſs than an effect of deep Melancholy. But we grounding only on the Doctrin we have handled, may eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is to be known in this matter. The cauſe of Laughter is no other (in my Opinion) than a tacit allowance of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, when it ſees or hears ſome Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter or Accident, which proves very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. And as this Power reſides in the Brain, when any of thoſe things preſent, it is ſtrait mov'd, and with it the Muſcles all over the Body; ſo we often approve ſharp and witty Sayings, by a nod of the Head. But when the Imagination is very good, it is not grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with every Paſſage, but with thoſe only, which are very pleaſing; and if they are not ſuch, it receives rather a Diſguſt than Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Whence it comes, that we ſeldom ſee Men of good Invention laugh; and what is yet more conſiderable, is, that thoſe who rally the moſt agreeably, and are very Face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, never laugh at their own Jeſts, or thoſe of others; becauſe they have ſo delicate and fine a Fancy, that their own witty Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and Railleries, are not moving, nor have all the Agreeableneſs and Grace they ought to have. To which may be added,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:53763:108"/>
That the Grace and Air of the thing ſpoke, or offer'd, ought to be new, unheard-of, and unſeen. Which is not the aim only of the Imagination, but alſo of the other ruling Powers in Man. Accordingly we find the Stomach ſtrait nauſeates the ſame Food it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived twice; the Sight, the return of the ſame Figure and Colour; the Hearing, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the ſame Tune, though it be good; and ſo even the Underſtanding is tired with the ſame Thought. Therefore he that rallies well, laughs not at all at his own witty Jeſts, becauſe e'er they proceed out of his mouth, he knows well enough before-hand what he is to ſay. Whence I conclude the great Laughers want Imagination; and let the Jeſt be what it will, as flat as it is, it extreamly moves and tickles 'em. And therefore thoſe who are very ſanguine, as they have a great deal of moiſture, which we have affirm'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to, and deſtructive of the Imagination, ſo they alſo are very great Laughers. Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture has this peculiar, that becauſe of its ſmoothneſs and ſoftneſs, it blunts the edge, and allays the heat, cauſing it not to burn ſo much: Accordingly that agrees beſt with Drineſs, becauſe it quickens its Actions; Add to this, that where Moiſture is found, it is a ſign that the Heat is ſlack and moderate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot reſolve and conſume it, nor can the Imagination with ſo weak a Heat ſpeed its own Operations. From whence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:53763:109"/>
it follows, that Men of great Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are great Laughers, becauſe they want Invention. As we may read of that great Philoſopher <hi>Democritus,</hi> and many others whom I have ſeen and obſerved. Thus by means of Laughter we may diſcern, if the Perſons that have hard and rough Fleſh, and beſides that, black and criſp, harſh and hard Hair, excel in the Underſtanding, or Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. So that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has been miſtaken in what regards the ſmoothneſs or ſoftneſs of the Fleſh.</p>
               <p>One may Anſwer the fifth Argument, That there are two ſorts of Moiſture in the Brain; one, which proceeds from the Air, when that Element is prodominant, in the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and the other from Water, by means of which, the other Elements are blended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>If the Brain partake of the firſt Moiſture, the Memory will be very good, eaſie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and ſtrong to retain the Figures long, becauſe the moiſture of the Air is very Oily, and unctuous, in which the Species of things faſten ſtrongly, as may be ſeen by Painting in Oil, which expoſed to the Sun, or caſt into the Water, ſuſtains no damage; and if we rub a Writing all over with Oil, it never wears out. Since that which is obliterated to that degree that one cannot read it, is made legible by Oil, which gives it a kind of clearneſs and tranſparence. But if the ſmoothneſs and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:53763:109"/>
of the Brain proceed from any other Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the Argument is ſtrong; for if it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive eaſily the Figure, it alſo as ſuddenly wears out, becauſe the moiſture of the Water has no Oil, to which the Species could ſtick and catch. Theſe two kinds of Moiſture are diſtinguiſhed in Hair; that which proceeds from Air, makes them thick, oily, and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy; and that from Water, ſlimy and limber.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Argument may receive this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That the Figures of things in the Brain are not imprinted there like the Figure of the Seal in the Wax, but only by penetrating, remain there fixt; or after the manner as Birds are caught with Birdlime, and Flies with Honey, becauſe theſe are not Corporeal Figures, and cannot be blended, nor break in upon one another.</p>
               <p>We may reſolve the ſeventh Difficulty thus, That the Figures confound and ſoften the Subſtance of the Brain, neither more nor leſs than Wax is ſoftned between the Fingers. Beſides that the Vital Spirits have the Virtue to ſoften and moiſten the Members that are hard and dry, even as we ſee the heat of the Fire ſoften Iron. And we have already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the Vital Spirits aſcend up to the Brain, as often as any thing is learn'd by heart. Whether all Corporeal and Spiritual Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe drys or not, all Phyſicians hold, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Exerciſe fattens.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:53763:110"/>The eighth Argument is capable of this Reply, there are two kinds of Melancholy; <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Galen.</hi> lib. II de ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda.</note> one Natural, which is as it were the Cement of the Blood, whoſe Temperament is cold and dry, and which is of a very groſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and the ſame is of no advantage to the Wit, but makes Men Fools, Sots, and Gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, becauſe of a defect in their Imagination. There is another call'd <hi>Atra-bilis,</hi> black or burnt Choler, which, according to <note n="†" place="margin">III. Sect Prob. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Opinion, made the wiſeſt Men; whoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament is various, as is that of Vinegar,<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>Horace</hi> reports <hi>Oreſtes</hi> to have been made ſuch a one, but that he would do no harm to any one, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very fine things from the brightneſs of his Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and therefore he ſaid, <hi>Juſſit quod ſplendida bilis.</hi> Sermonum III.</note> which ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces ſome effects of heat, making the Earth quake like Dough, and at other times too much cools it; but is always dry, and of a very delicate ſubſtance. <hi>Cicero</hi> own'd, he had a ſlow Wit, becauſe he had no aduſt Choler, and he ſpoke truth; for if he had been ſo, he would not have proved ſo Eloquent; for the Men of black Choler, want Memory, to which belongs Volubility of Speech. It has another quality, which mightily helps the Underſtanding, that is to be as reſplendent as an Agat, by means of which Splendor, the Brain is illuminated, to the end the Figures may be clearly reflected. And this <hi>Heraclitus</hi> meant, when he ſaid, <hi>A dry Light makes a moſt excellent Wit</hi>; which Splendor, the Natural Melancholy has not, but its Black, is Sleep and Death. And we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:53763:110"/>
ſhall hereafter prove, that the Rational Soul has occaſion to have a Brain of Light to reflect the Figures and the Species.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer to the ninth Argument, is, That the Prudence and Dexterity of Wit, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, belong'd to the Imagination, by means of which Futurities are known, and with Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to this, <note n="*" place="margin">Dialo de Senectute.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmed, <hi>The Memory is of the Paſt, and Prudence of the Future.</hi> The Dexterity of Wit is what we call in Spaniſh <hi>(Agudeza, in agibilibus)</hi> and is in other terms, Fineneſs, Wilineſs, or Cunning and Craft in the things and Intrigues of the World. And therefore <note n="†" place="margin">In Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culan.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Prudence was a Skill, which had a certain way to make choice of Good and Evil.</hi> Men of great Underſtanding are without this ſort of Prudence, and Skill, becauſe they want Imagination. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſee by Experience, that great Scholars, as to the things appertaining to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, taken from their Books, ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to go and engage in the Affairs of the World. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid excellently well, That this ſort of Prudence proceeded from Choler;<note n="‖" place="margin">In Epiſt. ad Dama.</note> for <hi>Hippocrates</hi> acquainting his Friend <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getes</hi> with the Condition he found <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus</hi> in, when he went to Viſit him, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his Cure, writ that he was in the open Field under a <hi>Plain-tree,</hi> bare Leg'd,<note place="margin">Note, that Men of great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have little Neatneſs in their Dreſs; they are all ſlovenly and greaſy: The Reaſon of which, we ſhall ſhew in the Xth and XIth Chapters.</note> ſet upon a Stone, a Book in his hand, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded

with Dead and Flead Beaſts; at which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> being ſurpriz'd, asked him what he did with thoſe Beaſts that were in ſuch a caſe? He Anſwer'd him, that he was in ſearch of the Humor that made Men Fickle, Crafty, Falſe, and Deceitful; and that in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting thoſe brute Beaſts, he had found, that Choler was the cauſe of this miſchievous Quality, and that to be revenged on Men of Gall and Guile, he would treat them as he had done the Fox, the Serpent, and the Ape. This kind of Prudence is not only odious to Men, but alſo <note n="*" place="margin">Ch. VIII. to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>

                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays this kind belongs to the Underſtanding, becauſe that Faculty is wholly incapable of Craft or Malice, only knowing how Evil is not done, but is Upright, Juſt, Frank and Innocent. The Man who is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd with this kind of Wit, is called Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and Simple.

               <p>We may Anſwer to the laſt Doubt, That when a Man is engaged in the Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a truth he would know, and does not preſently attain it, it is becauſe his Brain is deprived of the Temperament convenient to what he deſir'd, but fixing a while in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation as ſoon as the Natural Heat (that is in the Vital Spirits and Arterial Blood) flys to the Head,<note rend="inter">Note of what impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance it is to apply dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to Learning, becauſe when the proper Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Brain is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is attained by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous Plodding.</note> the ſame cauſes the Temperament of the Brain to riſe always till it arrive at the degree it has occaſion for. 'Tis true, that much Plodding does good to ſome, and harm to others; for if there be no want in the Brain to attain the due degree of Heat, there will be no occaſion for deep Meditation; and if it paſs beyond the point, the Underſtanding is ſtrait diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, by an overflow of too many Vital Spirits; by means of which, it attains not to the Notice of the Truth it is in ſearch of. Whence it comes, that we obſerve many Men ſpeak very well <hi>extempore,</hi> but perform
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:53763:112"/>
very meanly with premeditation. On the contrary, others have ſuch a ſlow Capacity, becauſe of their great Coldneſs or Drineſs, that of neceſſity the Natural Heat, muſt be a long time in the Head to cauſe the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to riſe to the degree it wants, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they quit themſelves much better, when they have had time to recollect what they have to ſay, than when they are to ſpeak <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore.</hi>

From thence came ſo great a number of Words, and ſo many different Modes of Speech, with ſo few Rules, and as little Reaſon, that without a good Memory it would not be poſſible, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to comprehend, or retain them by any other Faculty. How improper the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and the Underſtanding are, to learn the Languages, and the different Modes of Speech, Infancy plainly proves, in which, though it be an Age wherein the Child is leaſt provided with theſe two Faculties, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, as <note n="*" place="margin">XXX.

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays, he learns any Language what-ever better than Adult Men; though theſe be much more Rational, and without being taught by him, Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews us it: For we ſee if a <hi>Biſcayner</hi> of Thirty or Forty Years of Age comes to live at <hi>Caſtile,</hi> he will never learn the Language of the Country; but if he be very Young, in Two or Three Years he paſſes for a Native of <hi>Toledo.</hi> The ſame happens in the Latin, and all other Tongues, becauſe they are all of the ſame Nature: If then it be true, that in the Age wherein the Memory flouriſhes, and the Underſtanding and Imagination are low, the Tongues are ſooner learned than when the Memory is in the Decline, and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in its full Vigor, it is certain they are acquired by means of the Memory, and not at all by any other Faculty.</p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that the Tongues were not to be learn'd by Reaſon, as not depending upon Diſcourſe, and that therefore it was neceſſary to hear from another the Words, and their Meaning, and to bear them in mind. In purſuance of which, he proves, That if a Man be born Deaf, he would infallibly be Dumb, becauſe he can't hear from another the ſound of the Words, nor the meaning gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them by their firſt Inventers. That the Tongues are no other than an effect of the Humor and Caprice of Men, may be clearly inferred from this, that the Sciences may be equally taught in all Languages, and that in each, may be ſpoke and made known, what any one of them would ſay; Accordingly there are no grave Authors to be found, who have ſought for a Foreign Tongue, to make their Thoughts underſtood; but the <hi>Grecians have</hi> Writ in <hi>Greek</hi>; the <hi>Romans,</hi> in <hi>Latin</hi>; the <hi>Jews,</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi>; the <hi>Moors,</hi> in <hi>Arabic</hi>; and ſo do <hi>I</hi> in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> becauſe I underſtand that Language better than any other. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> (as being Lords of the World) finding it was expedient to have a common Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, by means of which all Nations might Communicate together, and themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to underſtand ſuch as came to ſue for Juſtice of them, and to treat of Matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Public Affairs of every Province, appointed Schools to be Erected in all Parts of their Empire, for teaching the <hi>Latin</hi>-Tongue,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:53763:114"/>
which by theſe means has flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the Univerſal Tongue even to this Day.</p>
               <p>As for School Divinity, it is certain that it refers to the Underſtanding, becauſe the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this Faculty are to Diſtinguiſh, to Infer, to Reaſon, to Judge, and to Chuſe, and that nothing is done in this Science, but to raiſe Doubts from Inconveniences, to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer with Diſtinction, to infer againſt the Anſwer what may be collected from good Conſequences, and ſo to reply again, till the Underſtanding be at eaſe, and reſt ſatisfied. But the beſt Proof that can be made of this Subject, is, to let you underſtand how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, and School Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, meet in one Perſon, and how it rarely happens that a Man be at the ſame time a good Latiniſt, and profound School-Divine. At which Effect ſome more Curious being ſurprized, in taking notice of it, have ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whence it might proceed, and have been of Opinion, that School-Divinity being Writ in a harſh and barbarous Language, and the Ears of good Latiniſts being inured to the pure and elegant Stile of <hi>Cicero,</hi> they could not ſettle to, nor take pleaſure in that Science. It would be well for theſe Gentlemen, that underſtand <hi>Latin</hi> ſo well, that this were the true cauſe, for then by conſtraint and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accuſtoming their Ears, they might at length find out a Remedy for this Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:53763:115"/>
but to be plain with them, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is not ſo much in their Ears as in their Capacities.</p>
               <p>They that are good Latiniſts, have moſt aſſuredly an Excellent Memory, for without that they could never prove ſo expert in a Language which is none of their own; and becauſe a great and happy Memory is as it were contrary to a great and elevated Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in the ſame Subject, one debaſes and depreſſes the other. From whence it comes, that he who has not ſo exquiſite and lofty an Underſtanding (the Faculty to which belongs to Diſtinguiſh, to Conclude, to Diſcourſe, to Judge, and to Chuſe) gains no great ground, nor makes any conſiderable Progreſs in School Divinity. Whoever is not ſatisfied with this Reaſon, let him read St. <hi>Thomas, Scotus, Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus,</hi> and <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who are the Leading Men in that Faculty and Profeſſion, and he will find great Subtilties in their Works, but writ, and deliver'd, in very courſe Church-<hi>Latin.</hi> For which there appears no other reaſon, but that theſe great Authors having in their Youth very mean Memories, prov'd not more Excellent in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, but applying themſelves to Logic, Metaphyſics, and School-Divinity, they mounted up to the higheſt Degree of the Sciences we admire, becauſe they were endued with a great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. At leaſt I can teſtify this of a School-Divine (well known to many more
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:53763:115"/>
that were acquainted and converſed with him) who was a Miracle in that Science, and yet not only could not reach the Elegances, nor the round Periods of <hi>Cicero,</hi> but when he read in the Chair, his Scholars took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice that his Latin was but very baſe and mean, inſomuch that they adviſed him (as thoſe that were unacquainted with our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin) that he ſhould ſecretly borrow a few hours from the Study of School-Divinity, and employ them in reading <hi>Cicero.</hi> And taking this as the Advice of good Friends, he not only endeavoured in private but publickly to remedy it; for after having treated of the Matter of the Trinity (and how the Divine Word was made Fleſh) he entred the Form amongſt the reſt to improve his <hi>Latin</hi>; and what was very remarkable, that during the long time he did thus, he not only learn'd not any thing new, but had almoſt forgot all the <hi>Latin,</hi> ſuch as it was, that he had learn'd before, ſo that in the end he was driven to read his Lecture in his Mother-Tongue. Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fourth enquiring what Divines were the Leading Men at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> was told particularly of a certain <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Divine,</hi> whoſe Reſolutions, Arguments, Diſtinctions, and Anſwers, were truly wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Admiration. The <hi>Pope</hi> being curious to ſee and know ſo ſingular a Man, diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Orders to him, to come to <hi>Rome,</hi> to give him an account of all the Proceedings in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:53763:116"/>
the ſame Council. Being arrived, he did him a great many Honours, amongſt others he bid him be cover'd, and taking him by the Hand, led him out to walk up to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>St. Angelo,</hi> and entertaining him in very elegant <hi>Latin</hi> about certain Works he intended to make, in Fortifying it better, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Opinion of each of his Deſigns. To which he anſwered with ſo much pain, as not being able to ſpeak good <hi>Latin,</hi> that the then <hi>Spaniſh Ambaſſador, Don Luys de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcens,</hi> Great Governor of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> took up the Diſcourſe for him, to relieve him with the favour of his <hi>Latin,</hi> and to divert the Pope to ſome other matter. In a word, his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſaid to ſome one of his Confidents, that it was utterly impoſſible for a Man that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſo meanly, to be ſo Excellent in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity as was reported; But whereas he tried him in this Language (which is a work of the Memory) and in Fortifications and Buildings (which things belong to a good Invention;) ſo had he but ſounded him in what relates to the Underſtanding, he might have heard Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things from him.</p>
               <p>In the Liſt of Sciences which refer to the Imagination, we have particularly plac'd <hi>Poetry,</hi> not at Random, nor without good Conſideration, but to let them know, how far they are from having Underſtanding, who have a good Vein in Verſifying. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we ſhall find, that the ſame difficulty the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:53763:116"/>
                  <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue has in uniting with School-Divinity, the ſame or greater beyond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon is obſerved betwixt that Science and the Art of Verſifying, this Art being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Underſtanding, that for the ſame Reaſon, he that would ſet up for a Topping Poet, muſt take leave of all the Sciences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to that Faculty, and even of the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue it ſelf, becauſe of the Contrariety there is between a good Imagination and a good Memory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could not find out the Reaſon of the firſt, yet he confirms my Opinion by an Experiment, when he ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">XXX Sect Prob. I.</note> Marcus <hi>a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of</hi> Syracuſe <hi>was a better Poet after he had loſt his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi> See here the Reaſon, it is becauſe the difference of the Imagination (to which <hi>Poetry</hi> belongs) requires three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat (and as we ſaid but now) ſuch an Exceſs of Heat entirely deſtroys the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. 'Tis what the ſame <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> noted, when he affirm'd, That the <hi>Syracuſian,</hi> as he came to be more Temperate, had a better Underſtanding, that he could not make ſo good Verſe becauſe of the defect of Heat, with which this difference of Imagination act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which Talent <hi>Cicero</hi> himſelf ſhew'd he wanted, when deſigning to deſcribe the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic Acts of his Conſulſhip in Verſe, and how his City had the good Fortune of a Second Birth, in having been under his Government, he exclaimed after this manner:
<q>
                     <pb n="192" facs="tcp:53763:117"/>
                     <l>O Fortunatam natam me Conſule Romam!</l>

                  <q>
                     <l>O <hi>Rome,</hi> how happy wert thou to be Born</l>
                     <l>What Time the Conſulſhip was <hi>Tullies</hi> turn!</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And becauſe <hi>Juvenal</hi> could not apprehend, that the Art of <hi>Poetry</hi> was contrary to ſuch a Wit as <hi>Cicero</hi>'s, he laſh'd him in his Satyrs, ſaying, Had you rehearſed your <hi>Philippics</hi> againſt <hi>Marc-Antony</hi> in ſuch delicate Verſe, it had never coſt you your Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">In So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſt.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> was yet more miſtaken, when he aſſerted <hi>Poetry</hi> to be no Human Science, but rather a Divine Inſpiration, becauſe the Poets not being beſide themſelves, or Inſpired by God, were not able to compoſe, nor ſpeak any Excellent thing; which he proves by this Reaſon, That Man having but his own Judgment free, cannot Verſify. But <note n="†" place="margin">XXX Sect Prob. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> blames him for ſaying, That <hi>Poetry</hi> is no Human Ability, but a Divine Inſpiration, and owns that a Man of good Senſe, and who enjoys the Freedom of his Underſtanding, can't be a Poet: And the Reaſon is, that where the Underſtanding is great, of courſe the Imagination (to which belongs the Art of making of Verſes) will be defective. Which appears yet plainer, if we reflect that <hi>Socrates</hi> after he had learn'd the Art of <hi>Poetry,</hi> yet with all his Rules and Precepts could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much as make a Verſe, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:53763:117"/>
by the Oracle of <hi>Apollo</hi> he was pronounc'd the Wiſeſt Man in the World. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I hold for certain, that a Young Man who has a good Vein in making Verſes, and who upon the firſt Eſſay, ſhall hit upon abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Rhimes, ordinarily runs a great Riſque never to attain in any eminent Degree the Latin Tongue, Logic, Philoſophy, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, School-Divinity, nor the other Arts and Sciences relating to the Underſtanding and Memory. Accordingly we ſee by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that if we give to any one of theſe Boys a Nominative to learn by Heart, he ſhall not do it in two or three Days, but give him a Sheet of Paper full of Verſes, or any Part to repreſent a Perſon in a Comedy, and in leſs than two or three times, that he caſts his Eyes upon it, he will fix it in his Head. Theſe think of nothing but reading Books of Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, as <hi>Orlando Furioſo,</hi> run deſperately in Love with <hi>Boſcan, Diana de monte Major,</hi> and other ſuch like Works, becauſe they are all full of Imagination. But what ſhall we ſay of the Organiſts, Choriſters, and Muſic-Maſters, whoſe Wit is improper for Latin, and all other Sciences pertaining to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Memory? The ſame holds in the Science of Inſtrumental, and other ſorts of Muſic.</p>
               <p>By theſe three Examples already produced of the Latin Tongue, of School-Divinity, and of Poetry, we may underſtand our Doctrin
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:53763:118"/>
is true, and that we have made our Diviſion right, though we have not given ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Proofs in the reſt of the Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>Writing alſo diſcovers the Imagination; Accordingly we ſee few Men of great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that Write a fair Hand, of which I have obſerved many Inſtances. Amongſt others, I knew a moſt learn'd School-Divine, who being aſham'd to ſee his ill hand, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured not to Write to any Body, nor Anſwer thoſe that Writ to him, inſomuch that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to cauſe a Maſter to come privately to his Houſe, to teach him to Write tolerably. And having labour'd ſeveral days at it, and loſt his time, he gave it over, leaving the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſurprized to ſee a Perſon ſo very able in his Profeſſion, ſo incapable of Writing. But I who am very ſure that fair Writing is a work of the Imagination, take it for a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Effect, and would any ſee, obſerve, and take the Pains to reflect on the poor Scholars, that get their livelihood in the Univerſities by Copying in fine Characters, they will find they underſtand but very little Grammar, as little Logic, and no more Philoſophy; and if they ſtudy Phyſic, or Divinity, they never ſound the depth of any Difficulty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Boy that can Draw with his Pen a neat limb'd Horſe, or a well-ſhaped Man, and make fine Floriſhes, and bold ſtrokes, ſhould not be ſet to the ſtudy of any Science,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53763:118"/>
but rather to a good Painter, who by his Art may improve his Natural Ability.</p>
               <p>To Read well, and with a good Grace, diſcovers alſo a certain kind of Imagination, and if it be to any great Degree of Excellence, he ſhould not loſe his time in Learning, but only think of getting his Livelihood by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Proceſſes. Now here is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Conſideration, which is, that the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Imagination which makes Men agreeable in Converſation, and good Rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leurs, is contrary to that which is neceſſary to a Man to read gracefully; ſo that none of thoſe who have the Qualifications but now mentioned, can read Volubly, but with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation, and miſtaking one Word for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>To underſtand how to Play at <note n="*" place="margin">A Game of Cards ſo called.</note> 
                  <hi>Primero,</hi> to make true or falſe Vie's, and to hold it, or not to hold it, as time and occaſion require, and by certain gueſſes to diſcover the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries Game, and readily to diſcard, is a work belonging to the Imagination. 'Tis the ſame thing in playing at <hi>Ciento,</hi> or at <hi>Trump,</hi> tho' not ſo much Imagination is required at this as at the German <hi>Primero,</hi> which not only demonſtrates this Difference of Wit, but alſo diſcovers the Virtues and Vices of Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every Moment occaſions are offer'd in that Play, in which a Man diſcovers what he would be at, in Accidents of greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:53763:119"/>The Game of <hi>Cheſs</hi> is one of the things that beſt diſcovers the Imagination. And therefore he who has the ſubtle Gambets in that Play, for Ten or Twelve moves altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is like to be Incapable of the Sciences, which appertain to the Underſtanding, and Memory; if he does not unite two or three Faculties together, as we have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. And if a certain very Learn'd School Divine, who I was acquainted with, had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood ſo much, he would have been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in a thing that gave him great Trouble. This Man playing often with his Domeſtics at <hi>Cheſs,</hi> and being beat as often, ſaid (in heat of Paſſion) what is the meaning of this! Thou that skilleſt neither Latin, Logic, nor Divinity (though thou haſt ſtudied them) and thou win of me, that am full of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and <hi>St. Thomas!</hi> Is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt have a better Wit than I? Truly I can't com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, except the Devil tells thee how to make thoſe Draughts thou playeſt. The whole Myſtery of this was, that the Maſter was a Man of great Underſtanding, by which means he attained the Subtilties of <hi>Scotus,</hi> and St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> but wanted the Difference of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, which is neceſſary to Cheſs Play, and his Play-fellow had a bad Underſtanding and Memory, but a very ſubtil Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Scholars that keep their Books in good order on the Shelves, their Chamber neat
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53763:119"/>
and clean, every thing in its proper place, and upon its own Pin, have a certain Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Imagination very contrary to the Underſtanding and Memory. Spruce and Beauiſh Sparks, who won't ſuffer the leaſt Hair or Wrinkle on their Clothes, have that ſame ſort of Wit. All this proceeds without doubt from the Imagination, and be it as it will, if a Man can't make a Verſe, and be awkward, but by chance becomes Amorous, ſaid <hi>Plato,</hi> he immediately turns Poet, and is very Spruce and Gallant, for Love inflames and drys the Brain, which are qualities that raiſe the Imagination. And <hi>Juvenal</hi> obſerves, that even Indignation (which is alſo a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that heats the Brain) produces the ſame Effect.

               </p>
               <p>Thoſe who converſe agreeably, who are Witty in Expreſſion, and know how to Droll well, have a certain difference of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very contrary to the Underſtanding and Memory. Therefore they are never good Grammarians, Logicians, School-Divines, Phyſicians, nor Lawyers. If they are Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in Buſineſs, and in the Intrigues of the World, dextrous in accompliſhing whatever
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53763:120"/>
they undertake, ready at every Turn to ſpeak, and to anſwer to the Point; they are fit for the Courts, and to be Solicitors and Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in Cauſes, for Merchants and Factors, to Buy and Sell, but not for Learning. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vulgar are deceived, who obſerving them ſo Practic'd in every thing, imagin ſtrait they would have prov'd ſingular Men, had they been brought up to Learning; when in truth, there are no <hi>Genius</hi>'s more Repugnant, and more Contrary to it than theirs.</p>
               <p>Children that arrive late at the uſe of Speech, have in their Tongue and Brain too much Moiſture, which as it wears off in tract of Time, they become very fluent, and great Talkers, becauſe of the great Memory they acquire, as their Moiſture is abated. Which, as we formerly noted, once happened to that Celebrated Orator <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi>, at whom (as we have ſaid) <hi>Cicero</hi> was ſurpriz'd, being of ſo rude a Speech in his Youth, and when a grown Man, ſo very Eloquent.</p>
               <p>Young Men alſo, who have a good Voice, and have by Exerciſe dilated the Paſſages of their Throat, are very unfit for all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, becauſe they are Cold and Moiſt, which two Qualities united together (as we have already affirm'd) deſtroy the Rational Part. The Scholars who punctually learn, and repeat the Leſſon Word for Word, as they have it from the Maſter, promiſe a good
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53763:120"/>
Memory, but at the Expence of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>In this Doctrin ariſe ſome Ploblems and Doubts, the Solution of which will, it may be, ſerve for a Light the better to clear the Truth of what we affirm.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, Whence it comes that the good Latiniſts are more Arrogant and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their Knowledge than Men very learn'd in the kind of Learning appertaining to the Underſtanding are, in ſuch ſort as to know the Grammarian, there is a Proverb which ſays, <hi>The Grammarian is nothing leſs than Arrogance it ſelf.</hi> The Second is, How it happens that the Latin Tongue is ſo contrary to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and ſo proper and natural to the <hi>French, Italians, Germans, Engliſh,</hi> and to all the other Northern People? As appears in their Works; for no ſooner do we ſee a Book writ in good Latin, but know the Author is a Foreigner, and when we meet one of Barbarous and Unpoliſhed Latin, we conclude it was Compoſed by a <hi>Spaniard.</hi> The Third Problem is, Why the things that are Writ, and Spoke in the Latin Tongue, ſound better, have more Force, more Grandure, and Eloquence, than in any other Tongue, though never ſo good? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as we have ſaid before) all Languages are owing to the Caprice and Humor of thoſe that invented them, without having any Foundation in Nature. The Fourth Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:53763:121"/>
is, How it can be reconciled, that all the Sciences belonging to the Underſtanding, being Writ in Latin, that even ſuch as want a good Memory, can Read and Study thoſe Books, the Latin Tongue being ſo repugnant to them, by reaſon of a defective Memory?</p>
               <p>We may ſolve the firſt Problem thus, There is no better Teſt to diſcover, if a Man wants Underſtanding, than to note if he be Haughty in Punctilio's of Honour, Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Elated, Ambitious, and Ceremonious. The reaſon is, that all theſe are the Effects of a Difference of Imagination, which requires no more than one Degree of Heat, with which the great Moiſture requiſite to Memory conſiſts well, becauſe this Degree of Heat is not of force ſufficient to reſolve it. On the contrary, an infallible ſign that a Man is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally humble, is, when he is obſerv'd to undervalue himſelf, and whatever comes from him, or relates to him, and that not only Vaunts not,<note place="margin">There is one that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with deſign, but his heart is full of deceit. <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. c. xix.</hi>

               <p>To the ſecond Problem may be anſwer'd, That <note n="*" place="margin">Lib quod animi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. cap. XIX.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> gathering the Wit of Men from the Temperament of the Region they inhabit, ſays, That all thoſe who dwell Northerly are defective in Underſtanding, and thoſe Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted between the North and the Torrid Zone, are moſt Prudent; which Poſition anſwers exactly to our Country, and without doubt it is ſo; for <hi>Spain</hi> is neither ſo Cold as the Northern Climes, nor ſo Hot as the Torrid Zone. <note n="*" place="margin">XIV Sect. Prob. XV.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſeems to be of the ſame Opinion, when he Enquires, Why thoſe that live in very cold Countries have not ſo good an Underſtanding, as thoſe Born in very hot? In his Anſwer he treats but courſly the <hi>Flem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, Germans, Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> ſaying, That the greater part of the Wits of thoſe Nations reſembled that of Drunkards, for which reaſon they could not ſearch into, or know the Nature of things: And the Cauſe of this is, the overflow of Moiſture in their Brains, and other Parts of their Body, which the fairneſs of their Complexions, and the flaxen Colour of their Hair denotes, and that it is a wonder to ſee a <hi>German</hi> bald; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they are all big, and of large Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, through the abundance of Moiſture, which is a dilater of the Body. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53763:122"/>
is diſcern'd in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who are a little Tawny, black Hair'd, of mean Stature, and for the moſt part Bald; which is a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition affirm'd by <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. Art. Med. cap. XIV, &amp; XV.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> proceeding from a hot and dry Brain. And if that be true, they muſt of neceſſity have an ill Memory, but a good Underſtanding; and the <hi>German</hi> a great Memory, and little Underſtanding; Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly one of them cannot learn Latin, and the other learns it readily. The reaſon given by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> to prove the little Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Northern People, is, that the great Ambient Cold of the Country forces the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat inward by an Antiperiſtaſis, and hinders it from being diſſipated, and ſo they have abundance of Moiſture, and Heat; it is therefore theſe People are at the ſame time furniſhed with a good Memory for the Tongues, and with a good Imagination, by means of which they make Clocks, bring the Water from the River to <hi>Toledo,</hi> invent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, and very curious Works, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot make, becauſe they want Imagination; but if they apply themſelves to any point of Logic, Philoſophy, School-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinty, Phyſic, and the Laws, a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> without Compariſon, will ſpeak more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and quainter things in his own Tongue, and in barbarous Terms than a Stranger can do with all his fine Latin; for take theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple out of their Elegant and Polite Road of Writing, and they perform nothing Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:53763:122"/>
nor have they any Invention. In Proof of this Doctrin, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. quod animi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, cap. X.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, <hi>In</hi> Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia, <hi>(which is a Northern Country) as a Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there aroſe one Philoſopher, whereas at</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <hi>they are all ſuch.</hi> But though Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and the other Sciences, by us named, are repugnant to theſe Northern People, yet the Mathematics and Aſtronomy are proper to them, becauſe they have an Excellent I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magination.</p>
               <p>The Anſwer to the third Problem depends on a much agitated Diſpute between <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> One affirms, that there are Words which naturally ſignify Things, and that much Wit is requir'd to invent them; which Opinion is favour'd by Holy Writ, telling us that <hi>Adam</hi> gave to each Creature God ſet before him the proper Name moſt ſuitable to it. But <note n="†" place="margin">Lib I. de interpret. cap II.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> would not yield that there was in any Tongue any Term or Figure of Speech that naturally ſignified the thing; but that all Words were by Inſtitution according to the Caprice and Fancy of Men. Accordingly it is known by Experience, that Wine has more than Threeſcore Names, and Bread as many, and each its own, in each Tongue; nor can it be affirm'd of one, that it is more proper and natural than all the reſt, for if it were, all the Men in the World would uſe that. However after all, <hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion is truer. For ſay, the firſt Inventers of Tongues impoſed Names according to their
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:53763:123"/>
Fancy, that Fancy was ſtill with Reaſon, as well in conſulting the Ear, as having regard to the Nature of the thing, and obſerving the Graces of Pronounciation, ſo as that the Words be not too long, or too ſhort, and that there be no need of diſtorting the Mouth in Speaking, giving the Accent in the proper place, and the like Conditions to be obſerv'd, that the Tongue be Eloquent, and not Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous. Of the Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> was a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Cavalier, who diverted himſelf with Writing Books of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> becauſe he was furniſhed with that difference of Imagination, which inclines a Man to ſuch Stories and Lyes. It is reported of him, that being to bring into his Romance a certain fierce Giant, he was for ſeveral days ſtudying what Name would be moſt anſwerable to his Exploits, but he could never chop upon it, till playing one day at Tables with a Friend of his, he heard the Maſter of the Houſe ſay, <hi>Ola Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chacho traquitantos a eſta meſa.</hi> That is to ſay, Holla Boy, bring hither ſome Dice for the Tables. The Gentleman no ſooner heard the Word <hi>Traquitantos,</hi> but weighing the well ſounding Name in his Ears, without any longer ſtay for good Fortune, roſe up, and ſaid, Gentlemen I play no longer, for I have been a long while Inventing a Name that ſhould agree well with a fierce Giant, whom I make uſe of in certain Fictions I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and could not for my Life light upon
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:53763:123"/>
it till I came to this Houſe, where I always received ſome Favours. The firſt Inventers of the Latin Tongue, had the ſame Care and Curioſity as this Gentleman, that call'd his Giant <hi>Traquitantos,</hi> therefore they found out a well-ſounding Language to pleaſe the Ear. Nor ought we to be ſurprized, if things ſpoke and Writ in Latin ſound ſo well, and in the other Tongues ſo ill, becauſe the firſt Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of theſe laſt were <hi>Barbarians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the laſt Doubt, I have been obliged to ſet it down for the ſake of many, who ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at it, tho' the Solution of it be very eaſy; for thoſe that have a great Underſtanding, are not wholly deprived of Memory, becauſe if they had none at all, their Underſtanding could never reaſon after the manner of the World, the Memory being the Faculty which Treaſures up the Matters and the Species, out of which the Speculations are formed: But whereas the Memory is ſo very weak in theſe Men, of three degrees of Perfection that are to be acquired in the Latin Tongue (which are to Underſtand, to Speak, and Write it well) they cannot proceed beyond the firſt, but very awkwardly, heſitating at every Word.</p>

For which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:53763:125"/>
reaſon they were call'd by the <hi>Jews, Gevanin,</hi> as much as to ſay, Sophiſters. <hi>Cato Major</hi> was of the ſame Sentiment, finding that it was dangerous to retain them at <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſtrength of that Empire was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Arms, and that thoſe Men already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to perſwade them that it would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the <hi>Roman</hi> Youth to quit them, and apply themſelves to the other Exerciſes, and Sciences. They were forthwith baniſhed <hi>Rome,</hi> never more to return thither.</p>
               <p>Say then, that God had made choice of an Eloquent Preacher, poſſeſſed of all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of Speech, who ſhould go to <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> and teach, that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> had Crucified a Man, who was the True <hi>God,</hi> and that he died of his own good Will and Pleaſure to redeem Sinners, and that he roſe again the third day, and aſcended into Heaven, where he now is; what would the Auditory think, but that this Propoſition was in the number of thoſe Vain and Fooliſh ones uſed by the Orators to perſwade by the Power of their Art? For thus much St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">I Cor. chap. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel; not with Wiſdom of Words, leſt the Croſs of Chriſt ſhould be made of none effect.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Wit was very proper for this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, becauſe he had a Capacious Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to defend and prove in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and amongſt the Gentiles, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promis'd in the Law, and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:53763:126"/>
that no other was to be expected; but with this he had but an indifferent Memory, ſo that he could not embeliſh his Diſcourſe with perſuaſive and moving Speeches; and this was the difference of Wit the Preaching of the Goſpel required. Nevertheleſs I ſhall not go about to infer from hence, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not the Gift of Tongues, for it is certain, that he ſpoke them all as readily as his own. Neither ſhall I maintain, that to defend the Name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the ſtrength of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was ſufficient of it ſelf, without the Gifts and particular Aſſiſtance that God gave him for that purpoſe. All that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, is, to affirm that Supernatural Gifts are much more efficacious when they meet with a ſuitable Diſpoſition, than when they fall upon a Sot and a Blockhead. To this alludes the Doctrin of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> in his Proem upon <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> demanding what is the reaſon,<note rend="inter">The Epiſtle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> though it be St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, yet by reaſon of the difference of Stile, was by ſome believed not to be his; but thoſe the Church has Condemned as Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics.</note> that though it was the ſame Holy Spirit which ſpoke in both their Mouths; <hi>Eſay</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered what he Writ with ſo much Elegance, and <hi>Jeremy</hi> hardly knew how to ſpeak? He anſwer'd, that the Holy Spirit accommodates it ſelf to the natural manner of Proceeding of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, unleſs Grace changes their Nature, or teaches them a new Language to deliver their Prophecies in. You muſt know then, that <hi>Eſay</hi> was a Nobleman, bred at Court, and in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:53763:126"/>
the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for which reaſon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was more Elegant and Polite; but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> was Born and brought up in a Village near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> call'd <hi>Anathoth,</hi> ſo that in his Stile he was Courſe and Rude as a Peaſant, and ſuch a Stile the Holy Ghoſt made uſe of in the Prophecy he Inſpired him with. The ſame may be ſaid of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, that the Truth of the Holy Spirit preſided in him when he writ them, to the end that he might not Err, but that the Language and Manner of Speech was no other than the Language and Manner of Speech natural to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> accommodated to the Doctrin he taught; becauſe the Truth of School-Divinity abhors a multiplicity of Words.</p>
               <p>The Knowledge of Tongues, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and Politeneſs of Speech accord ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably with Poſitive-Divinity, becauſe that Faculty belongs to the Memory, and is no other than a Maſs of Catholic Sayings, and Sentences, cull'd out of the Holy Fathers, and from Sacred Writ, and treaſured up in that Faculty, in like manner as a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian ſelects the fine Flowers of <hi>Virgil, Horace, Terence,</hi> and other Latin Poets he reads, and as occaſion preſents, ſets himſelf to deliver them, or pertinently cites ſome Paſſages from <hi>Cicero,</hi> or <hi>Quintilian,</hi> to make ſhow of his Reading to his Auditors.</p>
               <p>They that are furniſhed with this Union of Imagination and Memory, and diligently Collect whatever has been ſaid and Writ,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:53763:127"/>
that is conſiderable in the Science they profeſs, and quote them at due time, and place, with the Ornaments of good Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; as having already found in all the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſo many things, appear very profound in the Opinion of thoſe who are Ignorant of our Doctrin, though in effect, they are but ſuperficial, and will diſcover their defect as ſoon as they are ſifted to the bottom, of what they deliver with ſo much Aſſurance. And the reaſon is, that the Underſtanding, to which appertains the Knowlege of the Truth of things, from their Root, is not agreeable with the abundance of fine Speeches. 'Tis of theſe the Holy Scripture ſpeaks, <note n="*" place="margin">Proverbs XIV.</note>

Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Words of Holy Scripture, and its manner of ſpeaking have many other Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications more than <hi>Cicero</hi> knew in his Tongue. Secondly, Becauſe ſuch People want Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is the Faculty that diſcerns whether the Senſe be Catholic or not. 'Tis this Faculty which, with the Aſſiſtance of Supernatural Grace, of two or three ſeveral Meanings drawn from one Text, can make
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53763:127"/>
choice of that which is the Trueſt and moſt Catholic.</p>
               <p>It never happens, ſaid <hi>Plato,</hi> that Men are deceived in things that are very diſtinguiſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſo eaſily as when many of the like Nature preſent themſelves together; for if we ſet before the moſt clear-ſighted Eyes in the World a little Salt, Sugar, Meal and Chalk, all finely powder'd and ſifted, and each by it ſelf, what ſhould he do who wanted his Taſte, to be able to diſtinguiſh upon ſight each of theſe Powders, without any miſtake, ſo as to point in particular which is Salt, which Sugar, which Meal, and which Chalk. Without doubt no Man but would be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, becauſe of the great Affinity between theſe things. But were there a heap of Wheat, another of Oats, another of Chaff, another of Earth, and another of Stones, it is no leſs certain, becauſe of the great diverſity of each Object, this Man whoſe ſight was not very good, could never fail to name each heap. We ſee the ſame happen every day in the Senſe and Meaning the Divines give of the Holy Scripture; for you may obſerve two or three which at firſt ſight ſeem to be Catholic, and to agree well with the Letter; whereas in truth, they are not ſuch, nor does the Holy Spirit ſay ſo. To chuſe the beſt of all the Meanings, and reject that which is bad, it is certain that the Divine makes uſe of neither Memory nor Imagination, but of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53763:128"/>
the Underſtanding only. And accordingly I aſſert, that the Poſitive-Divine ought to conſult the Scholaſtic, and deſire him to chuſe which of all the meanings he ſhall find beſt, if he would not be ſent ſome fair Morning to the Inquiſition: For which reaſon the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies are in ſuch dread of School-Divinity, and would have it abſolutely rooted out of the World, becauſe by Diſtinguiſhing, Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Reaſoning, and Judging, the Truth at laſt comes to be diſtinguiſhed from Falhood.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XII. That the Theory of Divinity belongs to the Underſtanding, and Preaching (which is the Practic) to the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</head>
               <p>'TIS a Point much Controverted, not only amongſt the Wiſe and Learned, but even ſuch as has not eſcaped the very Vulgar, who daily ask the Reaſon, Whence it comes that a Divine who is a great School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſharp in Diſpute, ready in his Anſwers, Reads and Writes with admirable Learning; nevertheleſs when he gets once into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, he knows not how to Preach; and on the other hand, when a Man is an Excellent Preacher, Eloquent, Acceptable, drawing
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53763:128"/>
all the People after him, it is a great Miracle if he knows much of School-Divinity. And for this Reaſon, it is not admitted as a good Conſequence, ſuch a one is a good School-Divine, therefore he is a very good Preacher; neither on the other hand, muſt it be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that ſuch a one is a great Preacher, therefore he is not a great School-man; ſo that to deſtroy one and the other Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, there are more Inſtances offered of each than there are Hairs in our Head.</p>
               <p>No Man till now has been able to give any other Anſwer than that ordinarily returned, which is to attribute all this to God, and to the Diſtribution of his Gifts; and I own it is very well done, when they know not at leaſt the particular Cauſe. We have in a manner ſolv'd this doubt in the preceding Chapter, though not ſo exactly as it ought. For I have already ſaid, that School-Divinity pertained to the Underſtanding. Now I aſſert, and will prove, that Preaching (which is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic) is a Work of the Imagination. And accordingly as it is difficult to join in the ſame Brain a good Underſtanding with a great Imagination, ſo it cannot well be, that a Man ſhould at the ſame time be a great School-Divine and a famous Preacher. And that School-Divinity is a Work of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, we have elſewhere already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſhewing the Inconſiſtence between that and the Latin Tongue, therefore there is no
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:53763:129"/>
need to prove it again. Only I would have it underſtood, that the good Graces, by means of which good Preachers draw the People after them, and hold them Charm'd and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd, are all but a Work of an Excellent Imagination, and in part of a happy Memory. And to the end I may better explain my ſelf, and touch it as it were with my Finger, it muſt firſt be ſuppoſed, that a Man is a Rational Creature, ſociable and politic; and to the end his good Natural Parts might be improved by Art, the Antient Philoſophers found out Logic, to teach him how he was to Reaſon,<note place="margin">Humane Science con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in two things: in fine Speech, and in the diſtinction of things.

But leſt he ſhould deliver them without Order, or Rule, they have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented another Art call'd Rhetoric, which with its Rules and Precepts embeliſhes his Diſcourſe, with fine Words and elegant Phraſes, with Affections and Colours that are moving. In like manner as Logic teaches a Man to Diſcourſe and Reaſon, not only in one Science, but in All without diſtinction; ſo Rhetoric inſtructs how to ſpeak in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Phyſic, Law, the Art-Military, and all other Sciences and Modes of Converſation

among Men. So that if we would feign to our ſelves a perfect Logician, or compleat Orator, they cannot paſs for ſuch unleſs they are knowing in all Sciences, becauſe they are all within their Province, and in each of them without diſtinction he may Exerciſe his Art. 'Tis not ſo in Phyſic, Natural and Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, Metaphiſics, Aſtronomy, and the reſt, that are all limited in the Matter they treat of; which made <note n="*" place="margin">De per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſay, <hi>Wherever the Orator ſets Foot, it is his own Ground.</hi> And in another place, <hi>That in a compleat Orator all the Philoſophers knowledge was to be found.</hi> For which cauſe the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> affirmed, that there was no Artiſt found with ſuch difficulty, as a perfect Orator, which he might have ſaid with more Reaſon, had he known the Repugnance there is in Uniting all the Sciences in one particular Art.</p>
               <p>Antiently the Men of Law held the name and office of Orators, becauſe to make a compleat Advocate no leſs is required than the Knowledge and Skill of all the Arts in the World, becauſe the Laws Judge all indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; and to know the Rights and Pleas of each diſtinct Profeſſion, it becomes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to have the particular Knowledge of them all; and accordingly <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. de Orat.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>No Man is to be ranked in the Number of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors but he that is compleatly furniſhed with all the Arts.</hi> But ſeeng it was impoſſible to learn all the Sciences; firſt, becauſe of the brevity
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53763:130"/>
of Life, and next from the Wit of Man being ſo limited, they let them paſs; contenting themſelves in ſuch neceſſities to give credit to the Maſters in every Art, whoſe Cauſe they pleaded, without more ado. After this way of Pleading of Cauſes, immediately ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the Doctrin of the Goſpel, which might better have been perſuaded by the Art of Rhetoric than all the Sciences in the World, as being of greater Truth and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. But <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer charged St. <hi>Paul</hi> to Preach, not with Wiſdom of Words, leſt the Gentiles ſhould have thought what he taught was one of thoſe Well-contrived-Fables, which the Orators of thoſe Times made uſe of, to perſuade by force of their Art: But now that the Faith is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and eſtabliſhed many Years ſince, it is allowed to Preach with Rhetorical Topics, and to make uſe of Eloquence, ſince we need no longer apprehend the Inconveniencies that attended it in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Time. Beſides we obſerve the Preacher who has the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a compleat Orator, does more good, and has a greater Auditory, than he who is none. The reaſon of which is very clear, for if the Orators of Old made the people ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Falſities for Truths, (applying to that end the Rules and Precepts of their Art) the Chriſtian Auditors will be much better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd when they are perſuaded by the ſame Artifice of the things they already Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:53763:130"/>
and Believe: Beſides, that the Holy Scripture (in a ſort) is all things, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it well, there is occaſion for all the Sciences, according to that famous ſaying, <note n="*" place="margin">Proverbs Chap. IX.</note> 
                  <hi>She has ſent forth her Maidens, ſhe cryeth upon the higheſt places of the City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no need to recommend this to the Preachers of our Times, nor acquaint them how far it is allowed them; for beſides the particular benefit they pretend from their Doctrin, their principal Study is to ſeek out a fine Text, to which they may pertinently apply many thoughts, and fine paſſages drawn out of Sacred Writ, Holy Fathers, Poets, Hiſtorians, Phyſitians, and Lawyers, not leaving out any one Science, launching out copiouſly, with Eloquence and abundance of fine Words; By which means they ſpin out their Sermons for the ſpace of an hour, or two, if there be occaſion. <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. de. Orat.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, that this was proper to him, that made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the perfect Orator in his time. <hi>The Power and Profeſſion of an Orator in ſpeaking well ſeems to promiſe and undertake ſo much; that let the Matter handled be what it will, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of it fluently and amply.</hi> Now if we can prove that the Graces and Qualifications re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a compleat Orator belong all to the Imagination and Memory, We ſhall make it out, that the Divine who poſſeſſes them, ſhall be a very great Preacher; But if he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf to the Doctrin of <hi>Scotus</hi> and St.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53763:131"/>
                  <hi>Thomas,</hi> he will make little of it, becauſe this is a Science pertaining to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in which Faculty he is but very Weak.</p>
               <p>We have already elſewere declared what things belong to the Imagination, and by what Marks they are to be known; and now to refreſh the Memory, we are a going to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them. Whatever is ſpoke in good fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure cloſe to the purpoſe, and on a ſuddain, are Gifts of the Imagination, and ſo are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Jeſts, Alluſions, Sentences, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing a Perfect Orator ſhould do when he takes his Theme in hand, is to look out ſome Argument, ſome appoſite Sentences and Paſſages, with which he may amplify,<note rend="inter">To know how to make choice of a Theme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many that occur be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs no leſs to the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</note> and prove the ſame, and not to make uſe of any ſort of Words, but only of the well-Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Ears, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>I eſteem him truly an Orator who makes uſe of Words agreeable to the Ear, and of Sentences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Proof.</hi> 'Tis certain that this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains to the Imagination, ſeeing there is a Conſonance of agreeable Words and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence in the Sentences.</p>
               <p>The ſecond good quality of a perfect Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is to have an exuberant Invention, and a large ſtock of Reading; for if he be to ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy, and prove any ſubject given him, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Paſſages and Sentences cited to purpoſe,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:53763:131"/>
of courſe he ought to have a quick Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſhould be like a Setting-Dog, that hunts and brings the Game to hand, and when he is at a fault, he muſt feign ſo well, as if the thing were really true. For this reaſon we have ſaid before, that Heat is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which the Imagination acts; in as much as this quality raiſes the Figures in making them boyl as it were; ſo that we diſcover by this means all we would ſee, and if there be nothing more to conſider, the Imagination has power not only to compoſe Figures of things poſſible one with another, but alſo to join ſuch as are Impoſſible (after the order of Nature) and thence to frame Mountains of Gold and flying Calves.</p>
               <p>In lieu of Invention, Orators may help themſelves with much Reading, where the Imagination fails; but after all, Book-learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is bounded and limited, and the proper Invention runs free like a good Fountain, whence daily flows freſh and new Water. To retain what one has Read requires a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and glibly to repeat it in an Aſſembly is not to be done without the ſame Faculty; which occaſioned <hi>Cicero</hi> to ſay: <hi>That Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in my Opinion is worthy of ſo great a Name who can Diſcourſe upon any Subject that offers Diſcreetly, (which is to accommodate himſelf with reſpect to his Auditors to Time, Place, and Occaſions) Copiouſly, with the Ornaments of Language and without Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:53763:132"/>We have heretofore ſaid and prov'd, that Diſcretion belongs to the Imagination; the Stock of Words and Sentences to the Memory; the Beauty and Poliſh to the Imagination; how to recite ſo many things without any Rub or Heſitancy moſt certainly is due to the help of a good Memory. To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, that a good Orator ſhould ſpeak without Book, not from his Notes. For you muſt know that Maſter <hi>Anthony Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brixa</hi> came to be ſo defective in Memory, in his Age, that he read out of a Paper his Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toric-Lectures to his Scholars, and becauſe he was ſo eminent in his profeſſion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed with good Proofs the Points as they lay in order, and that they were no leſs ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied of his defect of Memory, it went off current: But that which was not to be endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was, that dying ſuddenly of an Apoplexy, the Univerſity of <hi>Alcula</hi> recommended his Funeral Oration to an eminent Preacher, who invented and diſpoſed what he had to ſay the beſt he could; but being ſo ſtraitned in Time, that he had not due ſpace to Con it without Book, he went up into the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit with his Notes in his Hand, and began after this manner. What this excellent Man (whoſe Obſequies we this day celebrate) us'd to do whilſt he read to his Scholars, I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved now to do in Imitation of him, for his Death was ſo ſuddain, and the Orders I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to make his Funeral Oration ſo late,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53763:132"/>
that I had neither Time nor Space to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for what was convenient for me to ſay, much leſs to get the ſame without Book: What I could draw up this Night is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my Notes, which I intreat your Worſhips to hear with patience, and to make allowance for my Defect of Memory.</p>
               <p>This way of Preaching or rather Reading of Notes was ſo ill reſented by the Auditory, as they could not hold all the while from Smiling and Murmuring: Therefore <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, well, that he muſt harangue without Book, and not from his Notes. This Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er really wanted Invention of his own, which he was obliged to ſupply from his Books, and that requires long Study and a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but thoſe who draw it out of their own Head, need no Study, Time nor Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe they readily find it in themſelves, and very often at the very Inſtant, all that they have to ſay; ſuch may Preach to the ſame Congregation all their Lives, without repeating any thing they have ſaid twenty Years before, whereas thoſe who want In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, in leſs than two Lents turn over all their Books, and run thro' their Manuſcripts and Common-places; ſo that the third Lent they muſt go and Preach to a new Pariſh, if they would not be upbraided with, <hi>this is no more than the Reception of what you Preached the laſt Year.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:53763:133"/>The third Property a good Orator ought to have, is to know how to diſpoſe what he has invented, and to reduce every thing to it's proper place: In ſuch ſort as one thing may bring in another, and the whole corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond in a juſt Proportion of all the Parts; And accordingly <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">Ad He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rennium.</note> 
                  <hi>That Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is no other than an Order and good Concert which ought be to obſerved in the Diſtribution of Sayings and Sentences to be made uſe of to the People, and that ſhews us in which Place which Things ought to be placed</hi>; To the end that there being a Correſpondence between the parts, there may ariſe a true Figure. Which Grace (when it is not Natural) is won't to give a great deal of Trouble, to the Preachers; for having found in Books many things to ſay, all have not the Skill to reduce them to their proper Place. It is certain, that this proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Ordering and Diſtributing, is a Work of the Imagination, becauſe it has the name of Figure and Correſpondence.</p>
               <p>The fourth Property good Orators ought to have, and moſt Important of them all, is Action; by which they give as it were a Life to what they ſay, moving the Auditors, and engaging them to believe that to be true, which they endeavour to perſuade Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de pref. Orat.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Action is governed by the turn of the Face, the geſtures of the Body, and different Tones of the Voice, requiſite to what is ſaid</hi>; as in raiſing or falling of the Voice, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritating,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:53763:133"/>
and all on a ſuddain Appeaſing, Speaking ſome times with a High-Voyce, ſometimes with a Low, now Chiding, and then Flattering, moving the Body ſometimes to one ſide, ſometimes to the other; now ſhutting the Hands, and then opening them; Laughing and Crying, and upon ſome Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions clapping the Hands together. Of ſo great Concern is this Gift to Preachers, that with it alone, without either Invention or Diſpoſition, they will make a Sermon of common Matters, and of ſmall Moment, that ſhall fill the People with Admiration, being animated with Action, which may be called in another Word, the Spirit and Life of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>There is in this one thing highly remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, which ſhews how much this Gift can do, which is, that the Sermons which appear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly well, as they are ſet off with all the Advantages of Action and Livelyneſs of the Orator, flag extreamely when they are committed to Writing, or come once to be Read: The Reaſon of which is, that it is impoſſible to repreſent with the Pen, the Actions and Geſtures which give it all the Advantages in the Pulpit. There are other Sermons go off better in Reading, and will not bear Preaching without Book, becauſe Action required by ſome Paſſages therein is wanting. Which Occaſioned <note n="*" place="margin">In Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> to ſay, that the Style to be obſerved in Speaking is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:53763:134"/>
very different from that in Writing well; and for this Reaſon we ſee abundance of Men, who Talk very well, Write ill; and others on the contrary Write very well, and Talk ill. All which is to be referred to Action, which without doubt is a Work of the Imagination, ſince all that we have ſaid of it carries with it Figure, Correſpondence, and good Conſonance.</p>
               <p>The fifth Property an Orator ought to have, is to know how to Apply well, and bring proper Inſtances, and good Alluſions, which takes with the Auditory more than any thing elſe; for what is Taught by a good Example is eaſily underſtood, and without that all flies over their Heads. Accordingly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <note n="*" place="margin">XVIII Sect. Prob. III.</note> 
                  <hi>Why thoſe that hear Orators take more Pleaſure in Examples and Fables brought to prove what they would perſuade, than in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Reaſons they produce?</hi> To which he Anſwers, that by Examples and Fables Men learn beſt, becauſe it is a Proof that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the Senſe, but it is not ſo with Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Reaſons, for to be capable of them requires a large Underſtanding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> our Redeemer made uſe of ſo many Parables and Compariſons in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſes, becauſe by their Means he made many Divine Secrets better underſtood. But this is certain, the Invention of Parables and Alluſions is the Work of the Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, becauſe as we have already often ſaid the ſame carries Figure, good Correſpondence and Similitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:53763:134"/>The ſixth Property of a good Orator is, that his Language be good, proper, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Affectation; that he uſe refined Terms, and many quaint and free Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without being dull; which Graces we have heretofore often treated of and prov'd them in part, to pertain to the Imagination, and in part to a good Memory.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Property that makes a good Orator, is contained in theſe Words of <hi>Cicero, That he ought to be furniſhed with a good Voice, a free Action, and a Natural Gracefulneſs</hi>; a Voice ſay I Clear and well-Sounding, tune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Auditory, not Harſh, Hoarſe, nor too Squeaking. And though it be true, that this proceeds from the Temperament of the Breaſt and Throat, and not from the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination; yet ſure it is, that from the ſame Temperament from which is derived a good Imagination (which is Heat) comes alſo a good Voice. Which falls out altogether to our Purpoſe, for the School-Divines being of a cold and dry Temperament, cannot have the Organ of the Voice good; which is a great Advantage in the Pulpit. <note n="*" place="margin">XI. Sect. Prob. XXXIV.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves this from the Inſtance of Old Men, who are cold and dry. For to have a clear and full Voice requires much Heat to dilate the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, and a moderate Moiſture to Supple and Soften them, Therefore the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">XI Sect. Prob. LXV.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> asks, <hi>Why thoſe who are of a hot Nature are all big Voiced?</hi> And we learn the ſame Truth by
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:53763:135"/>
experience of the contrary in Women and Eunuchs, which thro' the exceſſive coldneſs of their Conſtitution as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de Semine cap. XVI.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, have a very ſtrait Throat, and a very ſhril Voice: So that when we hear any good Voice, we may immediately affirm it Springs from the great Heat and Moiſture of the Breaſt, which two qualities when they mount up to the Brain deſtroy the Underſtanding, but improve the Memory and Imagination, which are the two Powers made uſe of by good Preachers to take with their Auditory.</p>
               <p>The eighth Property of a good Orator, as <note n="*" place="margin">De Orat.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid, is to have a Tongue well-hung, glib and well-practiſed, which is a Gift that cannot light on Men of great Underſtanding; for to be ſo ready there is required much Heat and a Moderate Dryneſs, which is not to be found among the Melancholic, whether Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally or by Aduſtion. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves it in ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Queſtion, <note n="*" place="margin">XI Sect. Prob. XXXVIII.</note> 
                  <hi>Why thoſe who have an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment in their Speech are held all to be of a Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Complexion?</hi> To which Problem he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my Opinion very ill, ſaying, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholic have a very ſtrong Imagination, and that their Tongue cannot Walk faſt enough for the things their Imagination Dictates, which occaſions them to Trip, in their Speech and Stammer. But this comes not from thence; but rather from this, that the Melancholic have always abundance of Froth and Spittle in their Mouths, thro' which diſpoſition they
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:53763:135"/>
have a moiſt Tongue and Slippery, a thing eaſie to be diſcerned, conſidering that ſuch are obſerved to be great Spitters. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelf gave this very Reaſon; when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. <note n="*" place="margin">I.

                  <hi>Why ſome Heſitate and Stammer in Speaking?</hi> To which he Anſwers, that they have a very cold and moiſt Tongue, which are two qualities that render it heavy, and as it were paralitic, ſo that it cannot follow the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination faſt enough. To remedy which, he ſays it is good to Drink a little Wine, or before they appear to diſcourſe in preſence of the Auditory, to clear the Voice by Hollowing, for thereby the Tongue gets Heat and Dries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms alſo that this defect of not Speaking Plain may ariſe from too much Heat and Dryneſs in the Tongue, which he proves by an Inſtance of the Choleric, who in the height of their Paſſion cannot Speak a Word, but when they are not vext or provok'd are very Eloquent; on the Contrary, ſome Fleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Men who can hardly Speak unprovok<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, when they are once heated deliver very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Diſcourſes. The Reaſon of this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, for tho' it be true, that the Heat ſpeeds the Imagination, and the Tongue alſo, yet this Heat may ſo exceed that it may deſtroy the Imagination, and hinder it from finding ſharp Words and ſubtil Anſwers, and cauſe the Tongue not to Articulate, from an over great Dryneſs, as we ſee from Drinking a litttle Water, a Man ſpeaks the better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:53763:136"/>The Choleric unmoved Speak Well and Readily, becauſe they then have the degree of Heat requiſite to the Tongue, and to a good Imagination; but being put into a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Heat riſes a degree higher than it ought, and perturbs the Imagination. The Flegmatic being unprovoked, have a very Cold and Moiſt Brain; whence nothing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to their Speech, and their Tongue is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed with too much Moiſture; but when they are Vext, and their Gall once ſtirred, the Heat gets a Degree, and quickens their Imagination, which occaſions much to offer to be ſaid, and their Tongue is freed from Impediment when once it is Heated. Such have no good Talent in Verſifying, for they are Cold of Brain; but when they are Heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they make better Verſes, and with more eaſe, againſt thoſe that nettle them: To which purpoſe <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſaid,

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thro' this defect of Tongue, Men of great Underſtanding, cannot be good Orators, nor good Preachers, and particularly inaſmuch as the Action requires they ſhould ſpeak ſometimes High, and ſometimes Low, and that ſuch as are ſlow Tongued, cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53763:136"/>
without Bawling with open Throat, which is one of the Things that tire the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors: Accordingly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> inquires, <note n="*" place="margin">XI. Sect. Prob. XXXV.</note> 
                  <hi>Why thoſe of ſlow Speech cannot ſpeak Low,</hi> To which he Anſwers very well, that the Tongue which is as it were Glued to the Palate by the great Moiſture, better diſengages it ſelf by Force, than if one ſhould gently endeavour it: even as he that would raiſe a heavy Launce, taking it by the end, would raiſe it better all at once, and by a Jerk, than in raiſing it by little and little.</p>
               <p>It ſeems to me I have well prov'd that the good Natural Qualities a perfect Orator ought to have, ariſe from the Imagination, for the moſt part, and ſome from the Memory: and if it be true that the great Preachers of our Times pleaſed the People becauſe they are furniſhed with the ſame qualities we have Spoke of, it follows then, that he who proves an Eminent Preacher, knows very little of School Divinity, and he that is a good School-Divine cannot Preach, thro' the great contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety that the Underſtanding carries with the Imagination.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew well by experience, that tho' the Orator Studies Natural and Moral Philoſophy, Phyſic, Metaphyſics, the Laws, the Mathematics, Aſtrology, and all the other Arts and Sciences, yet he knows no more of them than the Flowers, and retains only the moſt received Propoſitions, without fetching
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:53763:137"/>
from the Root the Reaſon and Cauſe of any of them; But he believed the not underſtanding Divinity, nor the true and eſſential reaſon of Things, aroſe from their not making Search and Enquiry into it. Accordingly he En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, <hi>Why, and in what we think the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher differs from the Orator,</hi> ſince they both Study Philoſophy. To which Problem he Anſwers, that the Philoſopher employs his whole Study to find out the Reaſon and the Cauſe of each Effect, and the Orator only to know the Effect, and no more. But indeed there is no other Reaſon of Difference than this; that Natural Philoſophy belongs to the Underſtanding, of which Faculty the Orators are in Want, and ſo pierce no deeper in Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy than a Superficial Knowledge of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Things. The ſame difference is found between the School-Divine, and the Poſitive, for own knows the Reaſon of that which concerns his Faculty; and the other the moſt received Propoſitions, and no more. The Caſe ſtanding thus, it proves a very danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing; that the Preacher ſhould have the Office and Authority of Teaching the Truth to Chriſtian people,<note place="margin">

               <p>The idle Talk and Prating of the <hi>German, Engliſh, Flemiſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Divines, and the reſt of the Northern Nations, has often hazarded the ruin of the Chriſtian Auditory, with all their Skill in Languages, and their Graces and Ornaments of Preaching; becauſe they had not that Underſtanding proper to find out the Truth. And that they are for the moſt part unfurniſhed of Underſtanding, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved from the Opinion of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,</hi> and from many Reaſons and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced to that purpoſe. But if the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Auditories would have regarded what St. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to the <hi>Romans,</hi> (who were ſurrounded and circumvented with falſe Teachers) it may be they would not ſo eaſily have been deceived, <note n="*" place="margin">Chap.

                  <hi>Now I beſeech ye Brethren mark them which cauſe Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Offences, contrary to the Doctrin which ye have Learned, and avoid them; for they that
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:53763:138"/>
are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies, and by good Words and fair Speeches deceive the Hearts of the Simple.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides this, we have already proved, that thoſe who are furniſhed with a good Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are Choleric, Subtil, Malitious, and Cavillers, who are ever inclined to Evil, and know as well how to compaſs it with great Dexterity and Craft.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> demands of the Orators of his time, <note n="*" place="margin">XVIII. Sect. Prob. IV.</note> 
                  <hi>Why do we call the Orator crafty and not the Minſtril nor Actors ſo?</hi> And the difficulty would have grown yet greater, had <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> known that Muſic and Acting are works of the Imagination. To which Problem he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, that the Minſtrils and Stage-Players have no other Aim more than to divert the Houſe, but that the Orator labours to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſomething for himſelf, therefore he has occaſion to uſe Wiles and Fetches, to the end the Audience may not diſcover his Drift and Deſign.</p>
               <p>Such Properties as theſe have thoſe falſe Preachers, of whom the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks, Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <note n="*" place="margin">II Chap. XI.</note> 
                  <hi>Corinthians. But I fear leſt by any means as the Serpent beguiled Eve through his Subtilty, ſo your Minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in</hi> CHRIST. <hi>For ſuch are falſe Apoſtles; deceitful workers transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of</hi> CHRIST; <hi>and no marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an Angel of Light, therefore it is no great thing if
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:53763:138"/>
his Miniſters alſo be transformed as Miniſters of Righteouſneſs, whoſe end ſhall be according to their Works.</hi> All which Properties are well known to be the Works of the Imagination, and that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid very well, that the Orators are Crafty, and Cunning, becauſe they always purſue their own Intereſt.</p>
               <p>We have already ſaid above, that thoſe who have a ſtrong and powerful Imagination are of Conſtitution very Hot, and from this Heat ſpring three principal Vices in Man, Pride, Gluttony, and Luxury; whereupon ſaid the Apoſtle, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. XVI.</note> 
                  <hi>For they that are ſuch, ſerve not our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own Bellies.</hi> And accordingly they Endeavour to Interpret the Holy Scriptures after ſuch a Manner as agrees beſt with their Natural Inclination, giving thoſe to underſtand who know little, that Prieſts may Marry, that there is no occaſion for Lent or Faſting Days, nor that the Sins we commit againſt God are to be diſcovered to a Confeſſor. And tricking them with a wrong Application of Scripture, they Colour their Vices and ill Actions with the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Virtues, to be by the People eſteemed for Saints.</p>
               <p>Now that from Heat proceed theſe three bad Inclinations, and from Cold the contrary Virtues, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves, ſaying thus, <note n="*" place="margin">XXX. Sect. Prob. I.</note> 
                  <hi>That from Heat and Cold proceed all the Conditions and Habits of Men, becauſe that theſe two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities alter our Natures more than any other:</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:53763:139"/>
Whence it comes that Men of great Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation are ordinarily Lewd and Vitious, for they give themſelves up to purſue the bent of their Natural Inclination, and want no Wit or Ability to be lewd. And therefore <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> asked, <note n="*" place="margin">XXIX. Sect. Prob. VII.</note> 
                  <hi>Why Man, who has the moſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is the moſt unjuſt of all the other Creatures?</hi> To which Problem he Anſwers that as Man has a good Wit, and a great Imagination, ſo he finds out more Ways to do Evil; and as he naturally deſires Pleaſure, and to be Superior to all, and happier than others, of neceſſity he muſt offend, for thoſe things cannot be purſued without doing Wrong to many. But <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> knew neither how to put this Problem, nor to anſwer it, as it ought. He might better have ask'd, Why ill Men ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily are of the greateſt Wit, and amongſt them, ſuch as have greater Abilities commit the lewdeſt Pranks, ſince it is more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that great Wit and Ability ſhould rather incline a Man to Virtue and Goodneſs than to Vices and Villanies. The Anſwer to this is, that thoſe who exceed in Heat, are People of great Imagination, and the ſame Heat that makes them ingenious, tends no leſs to make them Lewd and Vicious. But when the Underſtanding predominates, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily the Man inclines to Virtue, becauſe this Power is founded in Cold and Dry, from which two qualities proceed ſeveral Virtues, ſuch as Continence, Humility and Temperance,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:53763:139"/>
and from Heat the contrary. Which Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy if <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had underſtood, he would have known how to Anſwer this Problem, which demands, <note n="*" place="margin">XXX. Sect. Prob. IX.</note> 
                  <hi>What is the Reaſon that Strolling-Players, Sutlers, Inn-keepers, Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Cooks, Alehouſekeepers, Butchers, that is to ſay, all the Crafts-men of Bacchus, and merry-making, with the ſeveral Retainers to Ordinaries, and Gaming-houſes, are for the moſt part of a Lewd and proſtigate Life?</hi> To which he anſwers, that being imployed in thoſe Idle Trades they have no leiſure to be ſerious, and ſo they paſs away their time in Debauchery, to which their Poverty contributes, which of it ſelf is wont to lead to many Evils alone. But indeed this is not the true Reaſon; rather he might have ſaid, that to act Comedies, and to order Merry-makings, ſprings from a difference of Imagination, which invites to this manner of Living. And as this difference of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination conſiſts in Heat, all ſuch people have very keen Stomachs, and a ſharp Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to Eat and Drink; and if they ſhould give themſelves to Letters, they would make no Hand of it; Nay, tho' they were Rich, they would proſtitute themſelves to theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, were they Baſer than they are, for each Man's Genius and Diſpoſition runs to the Art that ſuits beſt with it. Whereupon <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> demanded, <note n="*" place="margin">XVIII. Sect. Prob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> VI.</note> 
                  <hi>Why Men are more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant in baſe Employments if they be their Choiſe, than in Honeſt ones, as for Inſtance to play
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53763:140"/>
the Jugler, Mimick, or Trumpeter, but take no pleaſure in being Orators or Aſtronomers?</hi> To which Problem he Anſwers very well, ſaying, that a Man ſoon finds to what Art his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſpoſition leads, becauſe he has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what within him that Teaches him; Nay, Nature goes ſo far with Incentives, that tho' the Art or Employment be ſo little agreeable, to the Dignity of him that learns it, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies himſelf ſtrait to it, and not to other Honorable Exerciſes.</p>
               <p>But ſince we have allowed this difference of Wit as improper for the Function of a Preacher, and that we are obliged to give and aſſign to each difference of Wit, the Science that ſutes beſt in particular with it; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to aſſign what difference of Wit he ought to have, to whom the Office of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is truſted, which is of ſo great importance to a Chriſtian State. You are to conceive, that tho' we have already proved, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a Natural Repugnance to aſſociate a great Underſtanding with a large Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Memory, yet is there no Rule ſo General in any Art but admits of ſome limits and exceptions. In the laſt Chapter but one of this Book, we ſhall prove at large, that when Nature is ſtrong with all her Forces, and meets no Obſtacle, ſhe makes ſo perfect a difference of Wit, that ſhe unites in one a great Underſtanding with a great Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Memory, as if thoſe Powers were
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53763:140"/>
not Contrary, or held any Natural Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>The ſame is the moſt proper and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent qualification for the Employment of a Preacher, if it could be found in many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but (as we ſhall declare in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited place) they are ſo few, that I have found but one of a hundred Wits under this Conſideration. And therefore we muſt look out another difference of Wit more familiar tho' leſs perfect than the former. For you are to underſtand that there is a great Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the Phyſitians <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Galen</hi> lib. I Simp. c. XV.</note> and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in reſolving the Temparament and qualities of Vinegar, of Choler aduſt, and of Aſhes; in as much as thoſe things at one time are the effect of Heat, and at another of Cold. And upon this they fell into different Opinions, but the Truth is, that all theſe things that ſuffer Aduſtion, and conſume and waſte by Fire, are of a various Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The greater part of the Subject is Cold and Dry, but there are other parts intermixt, ſo ſubtil and delicate, and of ſuch Order and Heat, that tho' they be little in Quantity, yet they Act with more Efficacy than all the other parts together. Accordingly we ſee Vinegar, and Melancholy through Aduſtion pierce and leaven the Earth with their Heat, and cloſe it not, tho' the moſt part of thoſe Humors are Cold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:53763:141"/>Whence we may gather that the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic by Aduſtion unite a great Underſtanding with a great Imagination; but they all are weak of Memory, becauſe the ſame Aduſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on dries and hardens the Brain. They make good Preachers, at leaſt they are the beſt to be found, next thoſe perfect ones we have ſpoke of; for tho' they are Weak of Memory, their own Invention is ſo large that their very Imagination ſerves them in lieu of Memory and Remembrance, ſupplying them with Figures, and furniſhing them wherewith to Speak, without ſtanding in need of any thing, which they have not, who Con their Sermons Word by Word; for if they make the leaſt Trip, they preſently loſe their Cue, without being provided with Matter enough to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves.</p>
               <p>Now that Melancholy by Aduſtion has this Variety of Temperament, of Cold and Dry, for the Underſtanding, and of Heat for the Imagination, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> declares in theſe Terms, <hi>That Melancholy Men are of Temper, various and unequal, becauſe the Aduſt Choler is a humor very various and unequal, it being equally capable of Hot and Cold in extreams by turns.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tokens by which this Temperament may be diſcerned, are very evident, their Complexion is of a dark Green or Olive, their Eyes very red, <hi>(for which Reaſon he is called a Bloody-Eyed-Man)</hi> the Head Black and Bald;

This is to be underſtood when Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly is kindled for if it be cooled, forthwith ariſe in them the contrary Virtues, Chaſtity, Humility, Fear, and Reverence of God, Charity, Mercy, and deep Acknowledgement of their Sins, with Sighs and Tears. By reaſon of which, they live in perpetual War and Strife, without ever enjoying Eaſe or Reſt. Now Vice prevails in them, and then Virtue; but with all theſe Faults, they are the moſt ingenious, and able, for the Service of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and for all ſorts of things wherein world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Wiſdom is required; becauſe they have a great Underſtanding to find the Truth, and a powerful Imagination to perſwade. In order to this, let us ſee what God did when he would faſhion a Child <hi>in his Mother's Womb,</hi> to the end he might be able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the World the coming of his Son, and have the Gift to prove and perſwade, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the Meſſiah promiſed under the Law; and we ſhall find, that making him of a great Underſtanding and Imagination, it fell of courſe;<note rend="inter">But when it pleaſed God to ſeparate me from my Mother's Womb, and to call me by his Grace, that he might reveal his Son to me. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Gal. c.

               <p>This alſo appears by the Reparties full of rational Choler with which he ſpoke and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Proconſuls and Judges that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him, defending his own Perſon, and the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, with ſuch Skill and Dexterity, as confounded them all.

ariſes from the diſorder Original Sin has raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the Fleſh and Spirit, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs being ſo fierce and conſtant, I am of Opinion it proceeded alſo from the ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality of the Black Choler that remained in his Natural Conſtitution. In effect the Royal Prophet <hi>David</hi> participated (equally) of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin, yet complained not ſo much of it, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but on the contrary affirmed, he found the Inferior Part in Conſent with Reaſon, when he would rejoice in God. <note n="*" place="margin">Pſalm lxxxiv.</note>

               <p>The Wits then that ſhould be made choice of for Preachers, in the firſt place are thoſe that unite a great Underſtanding with a great Imagination and Memory, whoſe Tokens we ſhall treat of in the laſt Chapter ſave one. For want of ſuch, there ſucceed in their room thoſe that are Melancholic by Aduſtion; who unite a great Underſtanding with a great Imagination, but are wanting in Memory, and accordingly have no ſtore of Words, nor flow with a full ſtream before the Auditory. In the third Rank are Men of a great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, without Imagination and Memory,

theſe Preach not gracefully, but Preach ſound Doctrin. The laſt (to whom I would not recommend the Preaching Function) are thoſe who join a happy Memory to a vaſt Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but want Underſtanding.

               <p>IT is not without a Myſtery, that in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tongue this Word <hi>Letrado,</hi> Letter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is a common Term denoting all ſorts of Lettered Men, as well Divines, as Lawyers, Phyſicians, Logicians, Philoſophers, Orators, Mathematicians, and Aſtrologers; neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs when it is ſaid, <hi>Fulano es letrado, ſuch a one is Letter'd,</hi> we all underſtand with one conſent, the Skill in the Laws is his Profeſſion, as if it were his proper and peculiar Style, and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53763:143"/>
of no others. Altho' to ſolve this Doubt be eaſy, nevertheleſs to do it ſatisfactorily, it is requiſite to know firſt, what the Law is, and what Obligations they are under who apply themſelves to the Study of this Profeſſion, to be afterwards made uſe of in the Employment of Judges or Advocates. The Law (to take it right) is nothing but the reaſonable Will of the Legiſlator, by which he ſets forth and declares in what manner ſuch Caſes ſhall be determined, as are ordinarily emergent in the Commonwealth, for conſerving the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Peace, and directing them how they are to live; and what they are to forbear. I ſaid <hi>a reaſonable Will,</hi> becauſe it is not ſufficient that a King or Emperor (who are the efficient Cauſe of the Law) declare their Will at any rate, that it may be Law; for if the ſame be not Juſt and Reaſonable, neither is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it nor can it be called a Law, no more than he is a Man, who wants a Reaſonable Soul. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it has been agreed, that Kings ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act their Laws with the Advice of very Wiſe and Underſtanding Men; to the end they ſhould be right, equal, and good, and the Subjects ſhould receive them willingly, and be the more oblig'd to keep and obſerve them. The material Cauſe of the Law, is what is done in ſuch Caſes as ordinarily happen in the Commonwealth, after the Order of Nature, and not of utter Impoſſibilities, or of rare Contingencies, The Final Cauſe is, to order
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53763:144"/>
the Life of Man, to teach him what to do, and what to forbear, that ſo being conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Reaſon, the Commonwealth may be preſerv'd in Peace. For which end the Laws are appointed to be Written in clear Words, not Equivocal, Obſcure, or of divers Senſes; without Cyphers, or Abbreviations, but ſo Obvious and Manifeſt, that whoever reads them may readily underſtand and bear them in mind. And becauſe none may plead Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, they are appointed to be openly Proclaim'd, that whoever breaks them may be Puniſhed.</p>
               <p>In reſpect therefore of the Care and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence obſerv'd by good Legiſlators, that their Laws ſhould be juſt and clear, Judges and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates had given them in Charge; <hi>That in Actions,</hi>

                  <hi>or Judgments, none of them ſhould abound in their own Senſe, but be directed by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Laws.</hi> That is to ſay, not to diſpute if the Law be Juſt, or Unjuſt, nor to give it any other Senſe than it naturally bears, according to the Letter. From which it follows, that the Lawyers are to keep cloſe to the Text of the Law, and take the meaning which is drawn from thence, and no other.</p>
               <p>This Doctrin being ſuppoſed, it is eaſie to underſtand whence the Lawyer is called <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trado,</hi> and other Lettered Men not ſo; which is to ſay, he is <hi>a letra dado, tied to the Letter,</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:53763:144"/>
a Man that is not left at liberty to judge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Underſtanding, but is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to follow the very Letter.</p>
               <p>Which having been ſo conſtrued by thoſe who are the beſt Practiſed in this Profeſſion, they dare neither Affirm nor Deny any thing concerning the Deciſion of any Caſe, if they have not before them the Law deciding it in expreſs Terms; and if at any time they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any thing of their own Head, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their own Authority and Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out founding it on the Law, they do it not without Doubting and Modeſty; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we have a common Proverb, <hi>Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſcimus dum ſine lege loquimur,</hi> importing, that we are aſham'd to judge and adviſe where we have not the Law before us, that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the matter. The Divines cannot be call'd (in this Senſe) <hi>Letrados,</hi> Learn'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in Holy Writ, <note n="*" place="margin">II. Cor. III.</note> 
                  <hi>The Letter kills, but the Spirit gives Life.</hi> That being full of Myſteries, and abounding with Figures, dark and not obvious to every Underſtanding: Its Terms and Manner of Speech, of a very remote Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, from that given by thoſe skilled in the three Vulgar Tongues. Therefore he that interprets it according to the Letter, and takes the Senſe that is drawn from the Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Conſtruction will fall into many Errors.</p>
               <p>Nor are the Phyſicians more obliged to ſubmit to the Letter, for if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> and other Grave Authors of that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:53763:145"/>
affirm a thing, and Experience and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhew the contrary, they are not bound to follow them, and the reaſon is, becauſe in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, Experience has more place than Reaſon, and Reaſon more than Authority: But in the Laws it happens quite otherwiſe, for there Authority, and the Decretals have more Power and Prevalence than all the Reaſons to the contrary. Which being ſo, we have a way open to aſſign the Wit proper for the Laws; for if the Lawyer is to have his Underſtanding and Imagination determined to follow blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whatever the Law ſays, without adding or diminiſhing, it is certain, this Faculty relates to the Memory, and all they have to do is, to know the number of the Laws, and the Rules of Right, and to bear in mind each in particular by Heart, to reduce to Heads every Caſe and its Determination; to the end that as any Caſe occurs, he may know what Law determines it, and in what manner. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeems to me, that the beſt Difference of Wit for a Lawyer, is, to have a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and a ſmall Underſtanding rather than much Underſtanding and little Memory; for if he is not to make uſe of his Wit and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but muſt have regard to the great number of Laws as they are ſo diſtinguiſh'd from each other, with ſo many Exceptions, Reſtrictions, and Enlargements, it is more to the purpoſe to have by Heart what is determined by the Law in each Caſe that occurs, than to Diſcourſe or
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53763:145"/>
Reaſon after what manner it ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; for one is neceſſary, and the other impertinent; no other Opinion being ſufficient to carry the Point but the deciſion of the Law. So that it is certain, that the Theory of the Law belongs to the Memory, and not to the Underſtanding or Imagination; for which reaſon the Laws are ſo entirely poſitive, and the Lawyers have their Underſtandings ſo determined by the Will of the Ligiſlator, that they cannot interpoſe their own Opinion, but where they are in doubt what the Law has declared, when their Clients conſult them, they are allow'd to ſay, I will look for the Caſe in my Books, which ſhould the Phyſician ſay when they come for Cure of any Diſeaſe, or a Divine in a Caſe of Conſcience, they would paſs for Men of ſmall Ability in their Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And the reaſon of it is, that theſe two laſt Sciences have their Definitions and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples Univerſal, under which particular Caſes are contain'd; but in the Faculty of the Law, each Law contains only one Caſe, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Law not depending on it, though they are placed both under one and the ſame Title. Wherefore it is neceſſary to have notice of all the Laws, to Study each in particular, and to lay them up all diſtinctly in the Memory.</p>
               <p>However againſt this Doctrin <hi>Plato</hi> obſerves a thing very conſiderable, which is, that in his time that Lawyer was ſuſpected that knew much Law by Heart (finding by Experience
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53763:146"/>
they never made ſuch good Judges and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as their Oſtentation promiſed) of which without doubt he reached not the Cauſe, ſince he ſaid nothing of it in ſo proper a place, only he ſaw by Experience, that the Lawyers of great Memory being to defend a Cauſe, or give their Opinion in it, applied not the Law ſo well as became them.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon or Cauſe of this Effect is not hard to aſſign from this Doctrin, ſuppoſing that the Memory be contrary to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and that the true Interpretation of the Laws, to Amplify, to Reſtrain, and to Analyſe them with their Contraries and their Contexts, is done by diſtinguiſhing, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, arguing, judging, and chuſing which Works, (as we have often ſaid already) are Acts of the Underſtanding; and for the Lawyer of a great Memory it is ſcarce poſſible he ſhould poſſeſs them.</p>
               <p>We have noted elſewhere, that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſeems to have no other Office in the Head, than the Truſt to preſerve the Figures and Ideas of things; and that the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Imagination are Powers that work with them. So as if the Lawyer have his whole Art in his Memory, and yet be wanting in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Imagination, he will no more be able to Judge or Plead a Cauſe than the <hi>Code,</hi> or <hi>Digeſt</hi> it ſelf, which though they contain all the Laws and Rules of Right, yet know not how to Write ever a Letter in the Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53763:146"/>Furthermore, though it be true, that the Law ought to be ſuch as its Definition im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, yet is it no leſs than a Miracle to find things with all the Perfections the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding feigns in them. That the Law be juſt and reaſonable, that it foreſee and provide againſt all that may happen; that it be Writ in clear Terms, void of Ambiguities, or Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and admit no different Senſes, is not always to be attain'd, becauſe in a word, it has been eſtabliſhed by Man's Council, which is not of ſufficient force to provide for all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies, as is ſeen by daily Experience; for after a Law has been Enacted, upon due Advice and Conſultation, in a ſhort time it comes to be Abrogated,<note place="margin">The Thoughts of Men are fearful, and their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. <hi>Wiſdom chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> IX.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe between its Promulgation and Execution a thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences diſcover themſelves, which were never dreamt of, in the Conſults of Making it. For which reaſon, the Law directs Kings and Emperors to think it no ſhame to mend and correct Laws; becauſe after all, they are Men, and no wonder that they Err. So much the rather, becauſe there is no Law that can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in Words or Sentences all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Caſe to be decided; becauſe the Wicked have more Fineneſs to find out Tricks, than the Good have Skill to try or give Judgment upon them. And therefore it was ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">L. nec leges F. d leg.</note> 
                  <hi>That it is impoſſible to write Laws or Ordinances of the Senate in ſuch a manner as they ſhall embrace all Caſes that may happen,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53763:147"/>
and therefore it is enough to determine thoſe that ordinarily fall out:</hi> For if there come any other which are not pointed to or decided in the expreſs Terms of any Law; the Law is not ſo lame in its Rules and Principles, but if the Pleader or Judge, have a good Underſtanding to know how to apply them, they may find out their true Determination and Defence, and whence to draw them.</p>
               <p>If it ſhould ſo prove that there are more Caſes than Laws, it is requiſite the Judge or Advocate ſhould have, a great deal of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to make new Laws, not any how, but ſuch as from their Conſonance to Reaſon may be received without contradiction. This the Lawyers of a great Memory cannot effect, for if the Caſes that Art has thrown into their Mouths are not minced and chew'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, they are at a loſs what to do. The Lawyer of large Memory is compared to a Sales-man; that has in his Shop abundance of Suits ready made, and to fit him that wants, lets him try'em all, and if none of them will do, he let his Cuſtomer go; but the Lawyer of good Underſtanding, is like a good Taylor, with his Sheers in his Hand, and his piece of Cloath on the Board, who having taken Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, cuts out the Suit according to his Size that is to have it. The Sheers of a good Pleader is his ſharp Underſtanding, with which he takes meaſure of the Caſe, and Cloaths it with a Law that decides it, and if he finds not one
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:53763:147"/>
all of-a-piece to decide it in expreſs Terms, he makes a Suit of the Remnants and Pieces of the Law wherewith to cover and piece it out.</p>
               <p>The Lawyers who are furniſh'd with ſuch a Wit and Ability, are not to be ſtiled <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trados,</hi> ſeeing they don't Conſtrue the Letter, nor are tied to the Terms of the Law; they ſeem to be rather Legiſlators, or Counſellors, of whom the Laws themſelves go a begging what they will have them to determine; for if they have Power and Authority to Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, to Reſtrain, to Amplify them, to draw Exceptions and Failures from them, if they may correct and amend them, it was well ſaid that they ſeem to be Legiſlators. Of ſuch a Skill as this it was ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">F. de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus &amp; ſen. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult. ſcire leges.</note> 
                  <hi>By the Knowledge of the Law is not meant to have by rote the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Terms in which they are Written, but to take notice of their full Force and Power.</hi> But to know the Laws, is duly to comprehend how far their force extends, what point they have power to determine; the Reaſon of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubject to many Alterations, upon the ſcore of Circumſtances of Time, Place, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Means, Matter, Cauſe, and the Thing it ſelf; all which Conſiderations diverſify the Determination of the Law. And if the Judge, or Pleader, have not Underſtanding ſufficient to conclude from the Law, or to take away, or add, what is in expreſs Words in the Law, he will commit many Errors in ſticking to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:53763:148"/>
the Letter. Upon which ground it is ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">Gloſſ. in 1. damni paſcis, ver. aliquas, de damno in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecto.</note> 
                  <hi>The Words of the Law are not to be taken in the Jewiſh manner</hi>; which is to Conſtrue the Letter, and take only the literal Senſe.</p>
               <p>From what has been ſaid we may conclude, that Pleading is a Work of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that if the Lawyer have a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, he is not in the leaſt able to Judge or Plead, becauſe of the Contrariety of theſe two Powers, and that is the reaſon why the Lawyers of great Memory, as <hi>Plato</hi> obſerv'd, defend not Cauſes well, nor apply the Laws as they ought. But here ariſes a Difficulty in this Doctrin, and that in appearance no ſlight one, That if it be true that the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is that which puts the Caſe in the Law, and determines the ſame by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, limiting, amplifying, inferring, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the Arguments of the contrary Part, how is it poſſible that the Underſtanding ſhould do all this, if the Memory preſent not all the Law to it; for as we have ſaid before, it is order'd, <hi>That in Actions and Judgments no Man is to follow his own Senſe, but is to be led by the Authority of the Laws.</hi> According to this, he muſt firſt know the whole Body of the Law, and all the Rules thereof, before he be able to meet with what is for the purpoſe in his Caſe, for though we have ſaid the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of good Underſtanding is Maſter of the Laws, yet all his Reaſons and Arguments muſt be built on, and drawn from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53763:148"/>
of that Faculty, without which they are of no force or validity. But to be able to do this there ought to be a vaſt Memory to keep and retain ſo great a number of Laws as are Writ in the Books. This Argument proves it neceſſary for an accompliſhed Pleader to have a great Underſtanding joined with a good Memory. All which is confeſſed, but what I would ſay, is, that ſince a great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with a good Memory is not to be met with (becauſe of the Repugnance there is between them) it is better that the Pleader be provided with a good Underſtanding, and an indifferent Memory, than to have a great Memory with a ſmall Underſtanding; ſeeing that to ſupply the Defect of Memory, there are many Remedies, ſuch as Books, Tables, Alphabets, and ſeveral other Inventions of Men; but if the Underſtanding be defective, there is no Remedy to be applied to that. Beſides, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that Men of great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, though they be deficient in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, have yet a great Remembrance, by means of which they retain confuſed Notices of all they have ſeen, heard, or read, revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon which; and running them over, they come to recollect themſelves: And tho' there be not ſo many Expedients to repreſent the whole Body of the Law to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, yet the Laws are ſo grounded upon right Reaſon, that the Antients, as <hi>Plato</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, called the Law it ſelf by the Name of
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:53763:149"/>
Prudence and Reaſon. So that the Judge or Pleader that is furniſhed with a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding when he is Judging or giving his Opinion, though he hath not the Law before him, ſhall yet commit fewer Errors, becauſe he hath with him the Inſtrument made uſe of by the Emperors in forming the Laws them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Accordingly we ſee it often happen, that a Judge being a Man of ready Wit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces a good Sentence without knowing the Deciſion of the Law, and afterwards finds the ſame ſo anſwered in his Books; and this we ſee happens alſo to Pleaders, when they give their Opinion in a Caſe without Study<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The Laws and the Rules of Right well conſidered, are the Spring and Source whence the Pleaders draw their Arguments and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prove what they pretend; which Work for certain is performed by the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of which Power if the Pleader be unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, or have it in a very low degree, he will never have Skill to form an Argument, though he knew all the Law by Rote. We ſee plainly that this befals thoſe that Study the Art of Rhetoric (wanting the Ability proper for it) that though they learn without Book the Topics of <hi>Cicero</hi> (which are the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains whence flow the Arguments that are to prove each Problem by the Affirmative and Negative) yet they never know how to raiſe an Argument: And others of greater Wit
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:53763:149"/>
and Ability there are, who without ſeeing a Book, or learning the Topics, raiſe a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Arguments accommodated to the Caſe in queſtion. The ſame comes to paſs in Lawyers of good Memory, who can recite the whole Text of the Law very faithfully, and yet out of the vaſt Body of Laws know not how to draw one Argument to ground their Opinion upon: On the other hand there are others who never Studied hard at <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi> and yet without poring on Books, or taking their Degrees, work Wonders when they come to plead a Cauſe. Hence we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how much it imports the Common-wealth, that there ſhould be a Choice and Trial of Wits fit for the Sciences, ſince there are ſome who without Art underſtand what ever they are to do, and others with a Cart-load of Precepts and Rules, commit a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Abſurdities, becauſe they have not the Diſpoſition which the Practice requires. So then if to Judge and Plead is to be performed by Diſtinguiſhing, Concluding, Arguing, and Chuſing, it ſtands with Reaſon, that he who applies himſelf to the Study of the Law, ſhould be furniſhed with a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſince theſe Works are the Effects of that Power, and not of the Memory or Imagination.</p>
               <p>How to find whether the Youth have this Difference of Wit, or no, is worth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but it will be fit before-hand to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:53763:150"/>
the Qualities poſſeſt by the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and how many Differences it Embraces, to the end we may know more diſtinctly, to which of theſe Differences the Study of the Law belongs.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt it is to be noted, That though the Underſtanding be the moſt Noble Faculty in Man, and of the greateſt Dignity, yet is there not any that is ſo eaſily led into Errors about Truth as that. <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de anima c. III.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attempted to prove it, affirming, That the Senſe is ever true, but that for the moſt part the Underſtanding reaſoned ill. Which is plainly ſeen by Experience, for were it not ſo amongſt the Divines, the Phyſicians, the Lawyers, and Philoſophers, there would not be ſo many Diſſentions, ſo Divers Opinions, ſuch Variety of Judgments and Conceits upon every Point, there being no more than one Truth.</p>
               <p>Whence it ariſes, that the Senſes have ſo great a Certainty in their Objects, and that the Underſtanding is ſo eaſie to be impoſed upon on its part, is not hard to conceive, if it be conſidered, that the Objects of the Five Senſes, and the Species by which the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are known, have a real, firm, and ſtable being by Nature, before they are known; but what Truth the Underſtanding has to Speculate, if the Underſtanding does not give it a Frame and Faſhion, has no formal Being of its own. All lies diſperſed and looſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53763:150"/>
in the Materials, like a Houſe reſolved into Stone, Earth, Timber and Tiles, with which ſo many Errors may be committed in Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as there are Men that undertake to Re-build it, with an ill Imagination. The ſame thing happens in the Building raiſed by the Underſtanding, in framing of a Truth: For all, except thoſe that have a good Wit, will commit a Thouſand Abſurdities, with the ſelf-ſame Principles. Hence comes that great Diverſity of Opinions found among Men, concerning the ſame thing; for every one gives it a Form and Figure, according to his Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>From theſe Errors and Opinions are the Five Senſes exempt, for neither the Eyes make the Colour, nor the Taſte the Savours, nor the Touch the Tangible Qualities, but the whole is ordered and compounded by Nature, before any one of the Senſes knows its Object.</p>
               <p>Becauſe Men are not well acquainted with this wretched Condition of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſo confidently give their Opinion, without knowing certainly what kind of Wit theirs is, whether it forms the Truth well or ill. And if it be not ſo, let us ask ſome Men of Letters, who after they have Writ down and Confirmed their Opinion with many Arguments and Reaſons, and have after changed their Sentiments and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions at another time, when or how they
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:53763:151"/>
can be aſſured that they have found out the Truth at laſt? The firſt time, as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confeſſed, they have failed, ſeeing they unſaid all that they ſaid before. And for the ſecond, I affirm, that they are to be yet more diſtruſtful of their Underſtandings, becauſe they are to ſuſpect that that Power, which already once ſo ill framed the Truth in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of its Arguments and Reaſons, may yet again ſlide into Error, when it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ſame Reaſon. More eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe it is often ſeen by Experience, that the firſt Opinion is more Probable, and the latter they take up with, is worſe and leſs Probable.</p>
               <p>They think it a ſufficient Token that their Underſtanding lights upon the Truth, when they perceive it enamoured of ſuch a Figure, and that there wants not Arguments and Motives to move it to conclude in that ſort; but in effect this is a Fallacy, becauſe there is the ſame Correſpondence between their Underſtandings and its falſe Notions, as there is in each of the other Inferior Powers, with regard to their Objects: For if we ask the Phyſicians, What Meat is beſt and moſt <note n="*" place="margin">Hiop de aliment.</note> ſavory of all in uſe among Men? I believe they would anſwer, There is not any (that for Diſtemper'd Men and weak Stomachs) that is abſolutely good or bad, but that it is ſuch as the Stomach that receives it: Since
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:53763:151"/>
there are Stomachs, according to <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. de alim. fa. cap. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi>'s Saying, that better brook Beef than Hens and Trouts; and others, that have an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Eggs and Milk; and ſome who love them to the Exceſs of hurting themſelves. And for the manner of dreſſing Meat, ſome affect Roaſt, others Boil'd; and in Roaſt, ſome like it with the Blood running: and others, dried and burnt to a Coal. But what is moſt conſiderable, is, that the ſame Meat eat to day with a great Guſto and Reliſh, to morrow will be Nauſeated, and a worſe longed-for. All this is to be underſtood, when the Stomach is good and ſound; for if it be out of order, and affected with the Green Sickneſs, which the Phyſicians call <hi>Pica,</hi> or <hi>Malacia,</hi> then the Appetite hunts for things which Humane Nature abhors, as Chalk, Earth, and Coals, which have a better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh with ſuch than Hens or Trouts.</p>
               <p>If we paſs to the Generative Faculty, we ſhall find therein as many Appetites and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties; for ſome Men there are who affect a Homely, and abhor a Handſom Woman; and others are better pleaſed with a Fool, than a Wiſe Woman; ſome who love a Lean, and hate a Fat one; even Silks and a gay Dreſs diſpleaſe thoſe, who run mad for one in Rags: This is to be underſtood when the Parts of Generation are ſound; for if they are attended with the Diſeaſe of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, called <hi>Malacia,</hi> or the Green-Sickneſs,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:53763:152"/>
they Luſt after Beſtial Uncleanneſſes. The ſame happens in the Senſitive Faculty, for of the tangible Qualities, Hard and Soft, Rough and Smooth, Hot and Cold, Moiſt and Dry, there is none of them all that equally pleaſes the Touch of every Man; becauſe there are ſome who ſleep better on a hard Bed than a ſoft, and others again better on a ſoft than a hard.</p>
               <p>The ſame Varieties of Guſts and ſtrange Appetites are found in the Compoſitions of the Underſtanding; for if we aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a Hundred Men of Letters, to whom we propoſe ſome Doubt, each of them will give a ſeveral Judgment, and Reaſon upon it in a particular manner; One and the ſame Argument will appear to one Sophiſtic, and to another highly probable, and to a third as concluding as if it were a Demonſtration. And this not only holds true in ſeveral Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings, but we ſee by Experience, that one and the ſame Reaſon concludes the ſame Underſtanding at one time, and not at another. Inſomuch, that Men change their Opinions every day, ſome gaining in proceſs of Time a more delicate Wit, come to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Defects of their Reaſon, by which they were led before; and others loſing their good Temperament of Brain, abhor the Truth, and embrace falſe Notions.</p>
               <p>But if the Brain happens to be tainted with the Evil called <hi>Malacia,</hi> then we ſhall
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:53763:152"/>
ſee ſtrange Judgments and Compoſitions, falſe and weak Arguments will prevail more than the ſtrongeſt and moſt probable; to a good Argument they will find an Anſwer, and ſubmit to a bad; from the Premiſes whence a right Concluſion might be drawn, they will collect a wrong; and by ſtrange Arguments and extravagant Reaſons ſupport their ill-grounded Fancies. Though this Doctrin be moſt certain and true, yet we may give it a greater and ſtronger Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; if we draw ſome Inſtances out of Holy Writ, which will at firſt ſight ſhew us the good and the bad Arguments of each, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from good or bad Underſtandings. And becauſe the moſt ordinary Defect is, when from good Premiſes they draw an ill Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion (which is the greateſt Abſurdity that can be committed) I ſhall report that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> which tells us, That a certain Man undertaking a Journey into a far Country, called his Servants, and delivered to them his Goods, to one he gave Five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, to another Two, and to another One. Then he that had received the Five Talents was ſo induſtrious as to double them; the like did the ſecond; but the third went and digged in the Earth, and hid his Lord's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. After a long time the Lord of thoſe Servants cometh and reckoneth with them. And ſo he that had received Five Talents, came and brought other Five Talents, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:53763:153"/>
Lord thou deliveredſt me Five Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, and behold I have gained beſides them Five Talents; he alſo that had received the Two Talents ſaid the ſame; but he that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved One, came and ſaid, Lord, I knew thee that thou wer't an hard Man, reaping where thou haſt not ſown, and gathering where thou haſt not ſtrowed, and I was afraid, and went and hid thy Talent in the Earth; Lo here thou haſt that is thine. The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter diſpleaſed with this Account, thus ſeems to Expoſtulate the Matter with him: For the ſelf ſame Reaſons you make uſe of, you ought to have taken care to have doubled your Talent; for if I am a hard Man, and reap where I ſow not, and gather where I ſtrow not, it will follow rather of courſe, you were to labour with the more diligence to improve your Talent, to pleaſe and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify me as the others have done, and not to ſleep away thy time, as if I were an eaſie Man, and minded nothing leſs than making the beſt of my Own. Accordingly, ſays the Text, <hi>I will judge thee out of thy own Mouth, thou wicked and ſlothful Servant; thou knew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that I reap where I ſowed not, and gather where I have not ſtrowed, thou oughteſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to have put my Money to the Exchangers, and then at my coming I ſhould have received mine own with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury.</hi> 'Tis a thing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among Men of little Underſtanding, to draw a falſe and contrary Concluſion from
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53763:153"/>
ſound and true Premiſes, that there is nothing more Ordinary.</p>
               <p>There are other Underſtandings no leſs awkward than theſe: For when they are to defend their Aſſertions, and prove any thing they offer, they alledge Reaſons that make againſt them, not knowing what they do: Of this ſort are thoſe who ſhall ſay to God at the Day of Judgment, in excuſe of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they are to be Condemned, <hi>Lord, Lord, have we not Propheſied in thy Name? Have we not caſt out Devils in thy Name? Have we not wrought Miracles in thy Name?</hi> Which is even as if a Gentleman that had committed High Treaſon againſt his Prince and his Crown, for his Defence ſhould alledge, that he had received a Thouſand Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from his Hands, and that from a low Degree, he had made him one of the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees of his Kingdom, and Governor of many Cities and ſtrong Places; which Reaſon, as there is nothing more abſurd, ſerves only the more to exaſperate him, and to haſten his Execution. Which appears plainly from theſe Words, <hi>If my Enemy had done this, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I would bear with him, but thou that eateſt like a Friend at my Table,</hi> &amp;c. Such Perſons are accuſtomed to inſiſt on Reaſons, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Excuſes, that are nothing to the purpoſe, but only becauſe they come firſt to hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="266" facs="tcp:53763:154"/>There is another ſort of Underſtanding amongſt Men of as ill a Make as that before ſpoke of; for although they have before their Eyes the true Premiſes, they know not how to draw a Concluſion from them. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel recounts, that the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> wanting Bread, and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of being fed, our Lord ſaid to them, <hi>What reaſon you among your ſelves, becauſe you have brought no Bread? Do you not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, neither remember when I brake the five Loaves among five thouſand, how many Baskets full of Fragments took ye up? They ſay unto him twelve. And when the ſeven among four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, how many Baskets full of Fragments took ye up? And they ſaid ſeven. And he ſaid unto them, How is it that ye do not underſtand?</hi> The Centurion had a much better Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to draw Concluſions, ſince he knowing the Omnipotence of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> would not ſuffer him to take the Pains to go to his Houſe to heal one of his Servants; but begged him to do it in the very Place where he was, though ſo diſtant. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen the Earthquake, and all that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened upon JESUS CHRIST's dying on the Croſs, from theſe things that ſerved him in the Nature of Premiſes, he ſtrait drew this Concluſion; <hi>Truly this was the Son of God:</hi> From whence others, for want of his Underſtanding, would draw a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Abſurdities. But what is moſt ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53763:154"/>
in this Caſe, is, that the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> being of a good Capacity, and ſo well acquainted with Holy Writ as they were, and the ſigns proving <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſiah</hi> promiſed in the Law, being ſo clear and evident, they could not draw the ſame Concluſions the Centurion did, nor know their Lord, <hi>For if they had known him,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul, they would not have Crucified the Lord of Glory.</hi> Of which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> gives the reaſon in plain terms; <hi>Make the Heart of this People</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>fat, and make their Ears heavy, and ſhut their Eyes.</hi> From which Words the Prophet gives us to underſtand, that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had before a very exquiſite and nice Underſtanding, and that it was dulled by their Sins; that they had had a good Sight, but that it was darkned; that they once heard very well, but were become deaf: So that it was no wonder that from ſo ſtrong Premiſes before their Eyes, they drew not the ſame Conſequence as the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion; for though he ſaw, they ſaw not; though he heard, they heard not; and tho' he underſtood, they underſtood not.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another kind of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which draws the true Concluſion; but very ſlowly, which is a kind of after-Wit, when the Opportunity is loſt, or as ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diſpute is over, would fain begin the ſame again; in order to make uſe of a perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Reply that came after into their mind,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:53763:155"/>
and of which they never thought in the heat of their Diſpute: The ſame happened to the two Diſciples that were paſſing with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> towards the Village of <hi>Emaus,</hi> when he ſaid to them; <hi>O fools and ſlow of Heart to believe all that the Prophets have ſpoken.</hi> There are others on the contrary, ſo quick in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Concluſion from ſo few Premiſes, and thoſe ſo weak, that all are ſurprized at it: Such was <hi>Nathaniel,</hi> of whom our Lord ſaid, <hi>Behold an Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</hi> Which <hi>Nathaniel</hi> hearing, ask'd him, Whence knoweſt thou me? To which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> anſwered, <hi>Before that Philip call'd thee, when thou was't under the Fig-tree, I ſaw thee. Nathaniel</hi> replied, <hi>Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Iſrael. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> anſwered and ſaid to him, <hi>Becauſe I ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, I ſaw thee under the Figtree, believeſt thou? thou ſhall ſee greater things than theſe.</hi> To which Grave and Learned Men having regard, endeavour to give their Opinion, without ſhewing the Reaſons upon which they were grounded, becauſe it is well known that Authority has no more force than the Reaſon upon which it is raiſed; and as the Arguments conclude indifferently on the one ſide and the other, becauſe of the Difference of Underſtandings each Man frames a Judgment of the Reaſon, according to the Underſtanding he has: Whereupon it paſſes for more gravity to ſay, ſuch is my
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53763:155"/>
Opinion for certain Reaſons which have mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, than to produce the Arguments on which he relied.</p>
               <p>But if they are driven to render Reaſons for their Opinions, they forget none of them, how ſlight ſoever, inſomuch that that which they little thought of, has ſometimes better effect, and convinces more ſtrongly, than that which they took to be the beſt. In which appears the Wretchedneſs of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, that Compoſes, Divides, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and Reaſons, and at laſt, when it is near the Concluſion, is without Proof, or Light, to know if its Opinion be true or no.</p>
               <p>This Uncertainty Divines are under in matters that are not of Faith, for when they have reaſoned well, they have no infallible Proof, or any evident ſucceſs that diſcovers which Reaſons are beſt; ſo that each Divine gives his Opinion as well grounded as he can. And provided he anſwer in appearance the Contrary Arguments, he comes off with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and there is no more to be hoped for from him. But unhappy are the Phyſicians, and Generals of Armies! For after they have concluded well, and overthrown with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Arguments the Foundations of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions, they wait the Succeſs; if it be good, they paſs for able and approved, but if bad, all the World cries out, that they built upon falſe Grounds.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:53763:156"/>In Matters of Faith, which the Church propoſes to us, there can be no Error, becauſe God who knows how uncertain the Reaſons of Men are, and how eaſily they are deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, has not permitted that things ſo high and of ſo great importance ſhould depend on our only Determination; but where Two or Three are gathered together in his Name, with the Solemnities of the Church, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the midſt of them to preſide in the Act, where he approves what they ſay well, and rejects their Errors, and reveals what can't be diſcover'd by the reach of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. The Proof of the Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in Matters of Faith, is to conſider, if that which they infer, and conclude, be the ſame thing that the Catholic Church teaches and declares; for if they can gather any thing to the contrary, it is an infallible Sign that theſe Reaſons are naught: But in all other Queſtions where the Underſtanding has the liberty to Judge, they have not yet found the means to know what Reaſons are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding, nor when the Underſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the Truth well. We only depend on the good Conſonance they have; which is an Argument very liable to Err, becauſe there are abundance of Falſe things, that have a fair Appearance of Truth, and prove ſtronger than the trueſt.</p>
               <p>Phyſicians and Generals have Succeſs and Experience for Proof of their Reaſons: For
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:53763:156"/>
if Ten Captains prove by Reaſons that it is beſt to give Battel, and as many on the other ſide defend the Contrary; the Succeſs will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify the one, and ſet aſide the other Opinion: And if Two Doctors diſpute whether the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will live or die, it will appear by his Death or Recovery which had the beſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Two. Nevertheleſs for all that, the Succeſs is not yet a Proof ſufficient; for whereas the ſame Effect hath many Cauſes, the Succeſs may well be by means of one Cauſe, and yet the Reaſons be grounded upon a Contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. Top.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays alſo, That to know what Reaſons conclude, it is good to follow the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion; for when many Wiſe and Conſidering Men affirm the ſame thing, and conclude all from the ſame Reaſons; it is an Argument, though it be but Topical, that they are concluding, and that they compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend well the Truth. But if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, this Proof is ſtill very Fallacious and Deceitful; for in the Force of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, weight avails more than number, for it fares not here, as in bodily Forces, where many Hands joined, can do much to lift up a Weight, and a few but little. But to diſcover a hidden Truth, one piercing Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding alone, ſhall do more than a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand, that are not: And the reaſon of it is, becauſe the Underſtandings help not one another, neither of many make one, as
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:53763:157"/>
it fares in Bodily Forces. Therefore well ſaid the Wiſe Man, <hi>Provide thy ſelf with many Peace-makers, but with one Counſellor of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> According to which Opinion, <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> ſpoke pertinently when he ſaid, <hi>One to me is as good as a Thouſand.</hi> As for Cauſes and Pleadings each Advocate gives his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the beſt grounded upon Law he can; but after having well diſcourſed, he cannot know certainly by any Art if his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has compoſed ſuch a Judgment as true Juſtice requires; for if one Lawyer proves in form of Law, that the Plantiff is in the right, and the other denies it alſo by way of Law; by what Expedient ſhall it appear, which of the two Advocates Reaſons better? The Sentence of the Judge makes no Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of true Juſtice, nor can it be called Succeſs, becauſe his Sentence amounts to no more than an Opinion, and he does no other than fall in with one of the Council. And to increaſe the number of Learned Men in the ſame Opinion, is not an Argument to believe that their Sentiment is the Truth; for we have already ſaid and proved, that many weak Capacities (though they join together to diſcover ſome dark and hidden Truth) ſhall never arrive at the point, or degree of Strength, as a ſingle one that is of a deeper Reach.</p>
               <p>And that the Sentence of the Judge makes not Demonſtration of the Truth, is clearly
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53763:157"/>
ſeen, in that it is reverſed in a Higher Court, where they very often Judge after another manner; and what is yet worſe, it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that the Inferior Judge may have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Underſtanding than he before whom the Appeal lies, and his Opinion may chance to be more conformable to Reaſon. That the Sentence of the Superior Judge is no more a ſufficient Proof of Juſtice is a thing yet more manifeſt; for we ſee every day that in the ſame Caſes (without adding or diminiſhing any thing) and from the ſame Judges quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Sentences iſſue. And he who has already been once miſtaken, in confidence of his own Reaſons, may very well be miſtaken again; ſo that his Opinion is the leſs to be depended upon, becauſe, <hi>He that is Once in the Wrong, is ever preſumed in the Wrong,</hi> ſays the Wiſe Man. Pleaders obſerving the Diverſity of Opinions amongſt the Judges, and how each is ſway'd by the Reaſon that ſeems moſt to prevail with him, and that ſometimes they are concluded by one Argument, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by another quite contrary, thereupon they boldly undertake to defend any Cauſe indifferently in the Negative or Affirmative; the rather, becauſe they ſee by Experience that on one ſide and the other they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Sentence in their Favour. And ſo it comes to be Verified, what Wiſdom has ſaid, <hi>That the Thoughts of Men are full of Fear, and their Foreſight <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertain.</hi> The Remedy then
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:53763:158"/>
for this, ſince the Reaſons of the Law remain without Proof and Experience, is to make choice of Men of great Abilities to be Judges and Pleaders, inaſmuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays the Reaſons and Arguments of ſuch are as firm and riveted as Experience it ſelf. And by ſuch a Choice it ſeems that the Common-wealth may be better ſecured, that her Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers ſhall adminiſter Juſtice. Whereas if (as it has been uſed) the Door be open for all without diſtinction to enter and poſſeſs thoſe Poſts, without making Trial of their Wit, the Inconveniences we have noted will hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen every day.</p>
               <p>By what Signs it may be known, that he who would apply himſelf to the Study of the Laws, has the Difference of Wit required for this Science, we have heretofore in a manner explained; but to refreſh the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and prove it more at large, we muſt know, that when the Child who learns to Read ſhall know well his Letters, and ſhall readily give the ſound to each, after the order of the Alphabet, it is an Indication of a good Memory; for it is certain, that ſuch a Work as this, is neither performed by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding nor Imagination; and that it is alone the Office of the Memory, to preſerve the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of things, and to report the Name of each, as there is Occaſion: And if he has a great Memory, we have already prov'd, that by conſequence he wants Underſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:53763:158"/>To Write a running fair Hand, as we have noted, diſcovers the Imagination; ſo much that the Child who in a few Days knows how to hold his Hand upon his Paper, to draw his Lines ſtrait, and to cut all his Letters even, and in good Form and Figure, gives Proof of a mean Underſtanding, becauſe this is the Work of the Imagination, and theſe two Powers have a great Contrariety be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, as we before noted.</p>
               <p>And if being ſet to Grammar, he learn the ſame with eaſe, and in a ſhort time he makes good Latin, and Writes Epiſtles Elegantly, with the round Cadences of <hi>Cicero,</hi> he will never prove either a good Judge of Pleader, becauſe it is an indication he has a good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and without a Miracle he will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in his Underſtanding: But if he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied in Plodding on the Laws, and ſtay a long time in the Inns of Court, he will not fail to be a famous Reader, and to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by abundance of Hearers; for the Latin Tongue is very agreeable in the Chair, and to Read publickly with great Applauſe, there will be occaſion of many Allegations, and to muſter up in every Law, all that has been Written upon it; to which purpoſe the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory is of much more uſe than the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for though it be true, that in the Chair he is to Diſtinguiſh, Infer, Argue, Judge, and Chuſe; to gather the true Senſe of the Law; yet in the end, he puts the Caſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:53763:159"/>
as beſt likes him, raiſes what Objections, and ſolves them how he pleaſes, and gives his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as he will, without any gain-ſaying; for which things a mean Underſtanding is ſufficient. But when one Pleader ſpeaks for the Plantiff, and another for the Defendant, and a third Lawyer fills the Place of a Judge, this is like a Fight with drawn Sword, and where they cannot ſpeak ſo at random as when they fight in the Air without an Enemy.</p>
               <p>If the Child advance not much in Grammar, it is to be ſuſpected that he has a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and therefore I ſay ſuſpected, becauſe it does not neceſſarily follow, that he who can't learn Latin, hath a great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. Seeing we have proved before, that Children furniſhed with a ſtrong Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſhall never attain any Perfection in that Tongue. But that which may beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this, is, Logic, for this Science bears the ſame proportion with the Underſtanding, as the Touchſtone does with Gold. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it is moſt certain, that if he who makes his Courſe in Philoſophy, does not begin in a Month or two, to Reaſon, and raiſe ſome Objections, and if there come not to his mind Arguments and Anſwers upon the matter treated of, he has no Underſtanding at all; but if he prove towardly in this Science, it is an infallible ſign, that he has the right Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding for the Law, ſo that he may out of Hand apply himſelf to it, without the
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:53763:159"/>
leaſt ſcruple. Though I ſhould think it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter firſt to run through the Art; for Logic is no more to the Underſtanding, as we have already ſaid, than the Clogs which are clapt on the Feet of an untrained Mule, going with which ſome time, he takes to a more ſteady and agreeable Pace. The ſame march our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding makes in Diſputes, being bound up by the Rules and Precepts of Logic.</p>
               <p>But if the Child which we have examined ſpeeds not well in the Latin Tongue, nor in Logic, as he ought, it muſt be conſidered, if he be not provided with a good Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before we take him from the Study of the Laws, for herein is found a great Myſtery, and it is good that the Republic know it; it is that there are ſome Lawyers, who being in the Chair, work Wonders, in Interpreting the Laws, and others in Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but if you put the Staff of Office in their Hands, you ſhall find them no more able to Govern, than if the Laws had never been made for any ſuch thing. On the Contrary, there are others, who with two or three miſunderſtood-Laws, which they learn'd at <hi>Salamanca,</hi> if they ſhould be put into any Command, would acquit themſelves to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. At which effect ſome Curious Wits are Surprized, becauſe they dive not into the Cauſe from whence it ſprings. For the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, that to Govern belongs to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and not to the Underſtanding, or
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:53763:160"/>
Memory. And that this is the Caſe, may be plainly proved, conſidering that the Common-wealth is to be maintained by Order and Conſent of Parts, every thing being in its due Place, ſo that all joined together falls into a good Figure and Correſpondence. This we have proved many times before is a Work of the Imagination, nor is it much more to the purpoſe to make a great Lawyer a Magiſtrate, than to make a Deaf Man a Judge of Muſic. This is to be underſtood ordinarily, and not to be taken for a General Rule. For we have already proved, that Nature may join a great Underſtanding with a great Imagination, ſo that in ſuch a Caſe, it would not be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, but that the ſame Perſon might prove an Excellent Pleader, and a famous Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and we heretofore diſcovered that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being found ſtrong with all the Powers ſhe can have, and labouring in a well diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Matter, may produce a Man of great Memory, Underſtanding, and Imagination, who Studying the Laws, may prove a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Reader, an Accompliſhed Pleader, and no leſs Admirable a Governor. But Nature makes ſo few ſuch, as this cannot well paſs for a General Rule.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. That the Theory of Phyſic belongs part to the Memory, and part to the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; and the Practice, to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</head>
               <p>AT the time that <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſic flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, there was a Phyſician high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Celebrated, as well for his Reading, as Writing, Arguing, Diſtinguiſhing, Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Concluding; of whom it was thought, in reſpect of his great Skill, that he was able to Raiſe the Dead, and Cure all kinds of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. And yet the contrary came to paſs, for he never took the Cure of any in Hand, but they Miſcarried; at which being vexed and aſhamed, he turned Friar, complaining of his ill Fortune, without being able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the true Spring and Cauſe of it. And becauſe the freſheſt Examples ſtronglier prove, and make moſt Impreſſion on the Senſes, it is the Opinion of many Grave Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that <hi>John Argentier,</hi> a Modern Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of our Time, has much excelled <hi>Galen</hi> in reducing the Art of Phyſic to a better Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod; and yet notwithſtanding 'tis reported of him, that he was ſo unſucceſsful in his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that not one Patient of all his Country, or Acquaintance, durſt venture to take Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:53763:161"/>
from him, ſo much they apprehended his ill-Succeſs. Hereat the People have reaſon to be ſurprized, being taught by Experience, not only in thoſe whom we have juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but in many others alſo, which they ſee every day, that every Phyſician, that is a great Clerk, is not the ableſt Practitioner. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> attemped to give the Reaſon of it, but in my Opinion he has failed. He thought the Reaſon that Phyſicians of his time, were not ſo Succeſsful in their Practice, ſprung from their General Notice of Man in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and their Ignorance of the Nature of each Particular Conſtitution; contrary to the Emperics, whoſe Care and Study was to know the Idioſyncracies of particular Men, paſſing over the General Knowledge: But he was without Reaſon; for both the one and the other exerciſed themſelves in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Cures, and laboured what they could to find out the Nature of each Conſtitution in Particular. The Difficulty then is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, why the moſt Learned Doctors, though they employ all their Lives in the Working of Cures, never become Excellent in the Practice; whereas others who are but Ignoramus's, with three or four Rules of Phyſic, learnt in the Schools, can do greater Cures in leſs time.</p>
               <p>The true Anſwer to this Doubt is not ſo eaſy to be found, ſeeing that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> failed in it, though he ſpoke in a manner ſomething
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:53763:161"/>
to it: But we, keeping to the Principles of our Doctrin, ſhall deliver the ſame more fully.</p>
               <p>You are to know then, that the Perfection of a Phyſician conſiſts in two things,<note place="margin">Gal. lib. IX. Meth. cap. IX.</note> which are as neceſſary to carry him on to the end of his Art, as two Legs to go without Halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The firſt is to know from a right Method the Precepts and Rules of Curing Man in common, without deſcending to Particulars. The ſecond is, to be long Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the Practice of Phyſic, and to have Viſited a great Number of Patients; for neither do Men differ ſo far from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that in many things they agree, nor are they ſo like neither, but there are in them certain Idioſyncracies, of ſuch a Nature, that they cannot be told, nor writ, nor taught, nor gathered, ſo as to be reduced to Art; but to know them is only granted to him that hath often ſeen and had them in hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Which may be eaſily conceived, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that Man's Face being compoſed of ſo ſmall a number of Parts, as are two Eyes, a Noſe, two Cheeks, a Mouth, and a Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, which yet Nature hath diverſified in ſo many Compoſitions and Combinations, that were a Hundred thouſand Men aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together, each one has a Countenance, ſo peculiar and proper to him, that it is a great Wonder, if there appear two that whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reſemble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:53763:162"/>It fares the ſame with the Four Elements, and the four Firſt Qualities, Hot, Cold, Moiſt, and Dry, from the Harmony of which ſprings the Life and Health of Man, and of ſo ſmall a Number of Parts, Nature makes ſo many diſagreeing Proportions, that if a Hundred thouſand Perſons were begot, each would have his State of Health ſo proper and peculiar, that if God miraculouſly ſhould on a ſudden change the Proportion of theſe four Firſt Qualities, they would all remain Sick, except it may be two or three, who by great Chance would have the ſame Harmony of Temperament. From whence two Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences may be neceſſarily inferred; the firſt, that every Man who ſhall fall Sick, is to be Cured conformably to his particular Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that if the Phyſician reſtore him not to his firſt Proportion of Humours and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he ſhall never be well Cured. The other is, to perform this as it ought, there is need that the Phyſician ſhould have ſeen and dealt with the Patient ſeveral times in his Health, by feeling his Pulſe, inſpecting his Urine, the Colour of his Viſage, and Complexion, to the end that when he falls Sick, he may judge how far he is off from Health, and to what Point he is to reſtore him by his Remedies.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt Point, which is to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and know the Theory and Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Art, <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, it is neceſſary to
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:53763:162"/>
have a great Underſtanding, and good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; becauſe Phyſic partly conſiſts of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and partly of Experience, and Hiſtory; for one he muſt have Underſtanding; and for the other, Memory; and becauſe it is very difficult to join theſe two Powers in a Predominant Degree, of Neceſſity the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt be defective in the Theory; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we ſee a great many Phyſicians very learned in <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> great Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts, and Botaniſts (which are Works of the Memory) that being put to Argue, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and Search out the Reaſon, and Cauſe of each Effect (all which belong to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding) cannot Skill thereof. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary happeneth in others, who ſhew abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Wit and Capacity in the Logic and Philoſophy of this Art, and if they be put to <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> to Plants, and Anatomy, never come off with Credit; becauſe they are deſtitute of a good Memory. For this reaſon <note n="*" place="margin">De Ord. lib. ſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, That it is no matter of Wonder, that in ſo great a number of Men that Study Phyſic, there are ſo few good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians; and giving the Reaſon of it, he ſays, That a Wit requiſite to this Science is hardly to be found, neither a Maſter that can teach it in Perfection, nor a Scholar that Studies it with ſufficient Care and Exactneſs. But with all theſe Reaſons, <hi>Galen</hi> goes groping, becauſe he did not punctually know wherein it lay, that no Man is Maſter of Phyſic in Perfection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:53763:163"/>Yet in ſaying that hardly is found among Men the Wit this Science requires, he ſaid true; but he has not ſpecified wherein the Difficulty lies, as we will do; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo difficult to unite a great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding with a good Memory, no Man is conſummate in the Theory of Phyſic. And becauſe there is a Repugnance between the Underſtanding and Imagination (to which, as we ſhall prove, the Practice and Skill of Curing with Certainty belong) rarely is found a Phyſician that is an able Theoriſt, and a great Practitioner, at once; nor on the contrary, one that is an able Practiſer, and expert in the Theory. But that the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and not Underſtanding, is the Power of which the Phyſician makes uſe, in the Knowledge of the Cauſe and Cure of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Diſeaſes, is very eaſy to prove, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Doctrin of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>; who ſays, That the Underſtanding cannot know Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, nor diſtinguiſh one from the other, nor diſcern the Time and Place, nor other Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities, which make Men diſagree amongſt themſelves, and that each one is to be Cured after a different manner, and the reaſon of it is, (according to what Vulgar Philoſophers deliver) that the Underſtanding is a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Faculty, which cannot be affected by Singulars, as being material. For this cauſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, That the Senſe is of Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and the Underſtanding of Univerſals.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:53763:163"/>
If then Cures are of Particular Perſons, and not of Univerſals (which are both Ingene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and Incorruptible) the Underſtanding will appear to be a Power very impertinent in working of Cures.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty lies in diſcerning, why Men of great Underſtanding cannot have good outward Senſes for Particulars, theſe two Powers being ſo contrary one to the other; and the Reaſon is very clear, which is this, that the Exterior Senſes cannot act well, if not aſſiſted by a good Imagination. Which we may prove from the Opinion of <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. III. de anima.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who being to declare what the Imagination is, ſays it is an Impreſſion ſtruck from the Exterior Senſe; in the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as Colour (multiplying with the thing colour'd) affects the Eye: For ſo it fares that the ſame Colour which is in the Chriſtallin Humour tinctures the Imagination, and there impreſſes the ſame Figure that was in the Eye: And if you demand, of which of theſe two kinds the Notice of Particulars is made? All Philoſophers anſwer, and very well, that it is the ſecond Figure which affects the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and by both the Notice is made, according to the common Saying, <hi>From the Objects and the Senſory ariſe the Notice.</hi> But from the firſt, which is in the Chriſtallin Humour, and the Viſive Faculty, ſprings no Notice, if the Imagination be not intent. Which the Phyſicians prove plainly, ſaying,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53763:164"/>
That whenever the Fleſh of a Sick Man be Lanced, or Cauterized, and he apprehends no pain, it is a ſign, that the Imagination is engaged in ſome deep Speculation: We ſee the ſame by Experience in thoſe that are found, for if they are deep plunged in ſome Speculation, they ſee nothing before them, nor hear, though they are call'd, nor taſte Meat ſavory, or unſavory, though in their mouths. Wherefore it is certain, that the Imagination forms the Judgment, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Particulars, and not the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or outward Senſes. Then it follows well, that the Phyſician, who is very expert in the Theory, becauſe he has a great Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or a good Memory; of neceſſity will prove an ill Practitioner, inaſmuch as his Imagination will be lame. As on the contrary, he that ſhall be a very able Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, undoubtedly will be but a mean The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oriſt; for a great Imagination cannot be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a good Underſtanding and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And this is the reaſon why none are ſo conſummate in Phyſic, as never to fail in their Cures; for not to fail in their Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, there is need to know the whole Art, and to have a good Imagination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame to Practice; but theſe two things, as we have proved, are Incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
               <p>The Phyſician never attempts the Cauſe and Cure of any Diſeaſe, but that he ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:53763:164"/>
frames to himſelf a Syllogiſm in <hi>Darii,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be but an Emperic: And the Proof of the firſt Poſition of his Premiſes belongs to the Underſtanding, and the ſecond to the Imagination. For which reaſon, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Theoriſts, ordinarily Err in the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and the expert Practitioners in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor</hi>; as if we ſhould ſpeak in this manner; All Fevers that depend on cold and moiſt Humours are to be Cured with Medicines, hot and dry (in taking the Indications from the Cauſe.) But the Fever which affects this Man, depends on cold and moiſt Humours, therefore it muſt be Cured with Medicines hot and dry. The Truth of the <hi>Major</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the Underſtanding, becauſe it is an Univerſal Propoſition, affirming, that Cold and Moiſture require Heat and Drineſs to moderate them; for that every Quality is abated by its Contrary: But when we come to the Proof of the <hi>Minor,</hi> the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing avails not, becauſe it is Particular, and ſo is out of its Juriſdiction, and its Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance pertains to the Imagination, which draws from the Five Exterior Senſes, the proper and particular Symptoms of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>But if the Indication be to be taken from the Fever, or its Cauſe, it is that which the Underſtanding cannot reach, only it teaches to take the Indication from that we appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend moſt danger: But which of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:53763:165"/>
is greateſt, the Imagination only can comprehend in weighing the Evils the Fever does, with thoſe that proceed from the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms or Cauſe, the little forces, or great ſtrength. To learn this Notice the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation has certain ineffable Proprieties, by means of which it reaches ſome things, which it can neither tell, nor comprehend, and for which no Arts are of uſe. Inſomuch that we ſee a Phyſician coming to Viſit the Sick, who by the Sight, Hearing, Smell, and Touch, arrives at the Knowledge of what ſeemed Impoſſible; ſo that ſhould we ask him by himſelf, how he was able to arrive at ſuch nice Notions, he could not tell, becauſe it is a Gift that proceeds from a Fruitfulneſs of Imagination, which may be otherwiſe called Sagacity, and which by ſome common Signs, incertain Conjectures, and where there is but ſlender footing, in the twinkling of an Eye, learns a Thouſand different things, wherein the Virtue of Curing and Prognoſticating with aſſurance conſiſts.</p>
               <p>Of this ſort of Sagacity the Men of great Underſtanding are unprovided, becauſe it makes a Part of the Imagination: Inſomuch, that having before their Eyes the ſame Signs that diſcover to others the Secret of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; yet they make no Impreſſion upon their Senſes, becauſe theſe very Men are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of Imagination. A Phyſician took me aſide, to ask me, whence it was, that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:53763:165"/>
having ſtudied with very great Curioſity all the Rules and Obſervations of the Semejo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics of the Art of Phyſic, and being very well verſed in them, yet he could never hit the Truth, ſo much as from any one Prognoſtic? To which I remember I anſwered, That the Art of Phyſic was learn'd by one Power, and put in Practice by another. He had an Excellent Underſtanding, but a very bad Imagination.</p>
               <p>But a great Doubt ariſes in this Doctrin, which is to know how the Phyſicians fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a great Imagination, learn the Art of Phyſic, ſince they are defective in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding? For if it be true that theſe cure the Sick better than the moſt Learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, to what end do theſe loſe time to Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the Schools? To this the Anſwer is, That it is a matter of great Importance firſt to know the Art of Phyſic, for in two or three Years a Man may learn all that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients were gathering in Two thouſand: And if a Man ſhould acquire it by Experience, he ought to live at leaſt Three thouſand Years; and in Experimenting Medicines, he would kill an infinite number of People before he underſtood all their Virtues, from which he is freed by Reading the Books of Rational and Experimental Phyſicians, who adviſe us in their Writings of what they have found out in the whole Courſe of their Lives, to the end that the Doctors that come after
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:53763:166"/>
them may boldly make uſe of thoſe that are ſafe, and forbear thoſe that are Poiſonous. Beſides which, we are to know, that the Common and Vulgar things in all Arts are obvious and eaſy to learn, and yet the moſt Important in the Work; and that on the contrary, the moſt Curious and Subtile are the moſt obſcure and leaſt neceſſary in Curing. And ſo it is that the Men of great Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not wholly deſtitute of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Memory, ſo that in the remiſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which they poſſeſs theſe two Powers, they may be able to learn the moſt neceſſary Points of Phyſic, for that they are plaineſt, and with the good Imagination they have, they may better know the Diſeaſe and its Cauſe, than the moſt Rational in the Science, ſince it is the Imagination that finds occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Remedy they ought to apply; in this Grace conſiſts almoſt the whole Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. Therefore <note n="*" place="margin">Epid pa. V. com. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, That the true Name of a Phyſician was to be the <hi>Inventor of the Occaſion,</hi> but to learn to know Time, Place, and Occaſion, without doubt are Works of the Imagination, becauſe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it Figure and Correſpondence.</p>
               <p>The Difficulty is now to know to which of ſo many differences of Imagination the Practice of Phyſic belongs; for it is cettain, that all theſe Differences agree not in the ſame particular Reaſon; which Speculation has more employed my Thoughts than all
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:53763:166"/>
the reſt: And nevertheleſs I have not been able yet to give it the Name it ought to have, unleſs it ſprings from a degree of leſs Heat than that difference of Imagination, with which Verſes and Songs are made. But this I determine not poſitively, becauſe all the Reaſon upon which I build, is, that all thoſe that I have known to have practiſed Phyſic well, are little Dablers in Poetry: But neither are their Thoughts very elevate, nor their Verſe very excellent: Which may alſo come to paſs, becauſe the Heat in a point exceeds that required by Poetry, and if it be ſo, it muſt be becauſe the Heat is ſo great, that it ſomewhat dries the Subſtance of the Brain, without reſolving much of the Natural Heat; though if it proceed further, it makes no ill Difference of Wit for Phyſic; inaſmuch as by Aduſtion it unites the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding with the Imagination. But this ſort of Imagination is not ſo good for Curing, as that I look for, and which diſpoſes a Man to be a Wizard, Superſtitious, a Magician, Enchanter, Chiromancer, addicted to Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary Aſtrology, and to Divine; becauſe in effect the Diſeaſes of Men are ſo occult, and have their Motions ſo ſecret, that there is almoſt daily Occaſion to Divine what is in them.</p>
               <p>This Difference of Imagination is hard to be found in <hi>Spain</hi>; for as we have already proved, the Inhabitants of that Country
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:53763:167"/>
want Memory and Imagination, but are provided with a good Underſtanding. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the Imagination of thoſe that live in the Northern Parts more available in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, becauſe it is very ſlow, and remiſs, it is good only to make Clocks, Paintings, Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, and other Toys, impertinent to the uſe of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <note rend="inter">All the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are Phyſicians, and to make them all agree, it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered among them, that none ſhall pretend to Cure more than one Diſeaſe.</note>
                  <hi>Egypt</hi> alone is the Country that produces in its Inhabitants this Difference of Imagination, and of this all the Hiſtorians are full, how the <hi>Egyptians</hi> are great Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards, and how ready to ſupply all Wants, and to find out, and miniſter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for all Neceſſities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Joſephus</hi> therefore to exaggerate the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Solomon,</hi> hath theſe Words, <hi>The Skill and Cunning which</hi> Solomon <hi>received from God was ſo great, that he ſurpaſs'd all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, and even the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>who were eſteemed the Wiſeſt of all. Plato</hi> ſaid alſo, That the <hi>Egyptians</hi> excelled all Men in the World in the Skill how to get their Living, which is a Craft that belongs to the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>And that this is true, appears plainly in that all the Sciences which pertain to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, were found out in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſuch as are the Mathematics, Judicial-Aſtrology, Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metic, Perſpective, and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:53763:167"/>But the moſt powerful Argument in my Opinion to this Purpoſe, is, that when <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis de Valois</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> was ſeized with a very tedious Sickneſs, and that the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of his Houſe and Court could give him no Eaſe, he ſaid every time the Fever return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not poſſible for any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Phyſician to Cure him, and that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them no Relief. Inſomuch that one time being Impatient to find himſelf every day worſe with his Fever, he ordered a Courrier to be diſpatch'd to <hi>Spain,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, to ſend him a <hi>Jew</hi> Doctor, the beſt of all his Court, from whom he hoped to receive a Remedy for his Diſtemper, if there were any in the Art. There was no little Laughing in <hi>Spain</hi> at this Requeſt, and all concluded that it was no other than the Conceit of a Man in a Fever. But for all this the Emperor was not wanting to give Order that ſuch a Phyſician as was required, ſhould be ſought after, if he were to be found, though he were out of the Kingdom, and when none could be met withal, they ſent him a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician newly turned Chriſtian, hoping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to comply with the King's Curioſity. But the Phyſician being arrived in <hi>France,</hi> and brought to the King's Preſence, there paſt between them a moſt agreeable Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, wherein was diſcover'd, that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:53763:168"/>
was a Chriſtian, and therefore the King would take no Phyſic at his Hands. The King from the Opinion he had conceived of the Phyſician's being a <hi>Jew,</hi> asked him by way of paſſing the time, if he was not as yet weary of expecting the Meſſiah promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Law? The Phyſician anſwered, Sir, I expect not the Meſſiah promiſed in the Judaic-Law. You are the wiſer for that replied the King, for the Signs ſet down in the Scripture to know his Coming are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready accompliſhed a great while ago. The number of days (rejoined the Phyſician) we Chriſtians keep well the Account of, for there are now a Thouſand five hundred fourty and two Years determined ſince he came; he abode in the World Thirty three Years, at the end of which, he died on the Croſs, and roſe again the third Day, after which he aſcended into Heaven, where he now Reigns. Why, ſaith the King, you are a Chriſtian! Yes, Sir, by the Grace of God, anſwered the Phyſician. Then, ſaid the King, be gone to your own Country in good time, for I have Chriſtian Phyſicians enough in my own Court and Houſe, I took you to be a Jew, who in my Opinion are thoſe that have a Natural Ability for Cures. And ſo he took leave of him without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to feel his Pulſe, or examine his Urine, or mingle the leaſt word concerning
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:53763:168"/>
his Diſtemper. And forthwith ſent to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> for a Jew, who recovered him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with Aſſes-Milk.</p>
               <p>This Conceit of King <hi>Francis,</hi> as I take it, was moſt reaſonable, and I conceive it ſo to be, becauſe I have already proved, that in the great diſtempered Heats of the Brain, the Imagination makes ſuch Diſcoveries, as no Man knows any thing of in Health. And becauſe it may not ſeem that I have ſpoken in Jeſt, and without any ground in Nature; you are to know, that the Variety of Men, as well in Make of Body, as in Wit, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conditions of the Soul, ariſe from their inhabiting Countries of different Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from drinking divers Waters, and not making uſe of one kind of Diet. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de Natura.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Men differ from others in Make and Manners, from the Changes of Winds, and Heats, or the Diverſity of Waters, or Fruits, of the Earth, all which tend to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great difference, as well in the Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as Bodies of Men.</hi> If I prove then that the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after living many Years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> at their going from thence, eat and drank ſuch Fruits and Waters, as are proper to make this difference of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I ſhall confirm and juſtify the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and by the by diſcover, what Wits we are to chuſe in <hi>Spain,</hi> to make Phyſicians of.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:53763:169"/>As to the firſt point, you are to know, that <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. xv.</note>

               <p>Which Prophecy was fulfilled, though God for certain reſpects added Thirty Years more, as Sacred Writ declares, <note n="†" place="margin">Exod xii.</note> 
                  <hi>Now the ſojourning of the Children of Iſrael, who dwelt in Egypt, was Four hundred and thirty Years; and it came to paſs at the end of the Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty Years, even the ſame day it came to paſs, that all the Hoſt of the Lord went out from the Land of Egypt.</hi> But though the Text ſays manifeſtly, that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in <hi>Egypt</hi> Four hundred and thirty Years, there is a Gloſs which makes it appear, that this number of Years was the whole time that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were in Pilgrimage, till they came to their own Country, but in <hi>Egypt</hi> their ſtay was but Two hundred and ten Years; which Gloſs agrees not well with St. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Proto-Martyr, in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe he had with the <hi>Jews,</hi> that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael</hi> abode Four hundred and thirty Years in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:53763:169"/>And though the Abode of Two hundred and ten Years were ſufficient to tincture the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with the Qualities of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> yet the time they lived Abroad was not loſt, in what related to their Wit, inaſmuch as thoſe that live under the Yoke of Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in Preſſures, in Afflictions, and in a ſtrange Land, contract a great deal of Aduſt Choler, in being barred Liberty of Speech, and of Revenging their Injuries, and the ſame Humour being Aduſt, is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Craft, of Cunning, and of Malice. As we ſee by Experience, that there are no Manners or Conditions worſe than thoſe of Slaves, whoſe Imagination is ever buſied in contriving to do ſome Damage to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and free themſelves from Slavery.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the Country through which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> marched, was not not much alienated, nor far remote from <hi>Egypt,</hi> no more than from its Qualities; for, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to its Miſery and Barrenneſs, God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would give him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, more Rich and Fruitful. Now it is a thing verified as well in good Natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, as Experience; that barren and poor Countries, which bear neither Grain, nor Fruit in abundance, produce Men of very ſharp Wit; and on the contrary, Fat and Fertile Lands, produce Men that are big Limb'd, Stout and Robuſt of Body, but ſlow of Wit.</p>

                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:53763:170"/>Touching <hi>Greece,</hi> Hiſtorians never make an end of telling us, That it is a Country proper to produce Men of great Abilities, and <note n="*" place="margin">In Orat. Suaſor.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> particularly ſays, That it was a Wonder to ſee a Blockhead born at <hi>Athens,</hi> (and note, that this was the pooreſt and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſt Land of all <hi>Greece.</hi>) So that from thence may be gathered, that at leaſt ſome Qualities of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the other Provinces, through which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſt, gave them a very ſharp Wit: But you are to know how the Temperament of <hi>Egypt</hi> produced this Difference of Imagination: Which is very clear, conſidering that in this Country the Sun is very burning, for which Reaſon, the Inhabitants Brains are boiling, and have much Aduſt Choler, which is the Inſtrument of Craft and Cunning: This made <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> enquire, <hi>Whence comes it, that the Negroes of</hi> Aethiopia, <hi>and the Native</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, <hi>are ſplay Footed, curl Pated, and flat Noſed?</hi> To which Problem he Anſwers, That the extream Heat of the Country burns the Subſtance of theſe Parts, and ſhrievels them like Leather before the Fire; from the ſame Reaſon their Hair curls in Rings, and frizels.

<pb n="299" facs="tcp:53763:170"/>
Anſwer this Problem, nor to diſtinguiſh of Wiſdom; for as we have elſewhere proved, there are two kinds of Wiſdom in Man, one of which <hi>Plato</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>That Knowledge which is Void of Honeſty, ought rather to be called Craft than Wiſdom</hi>; another, that is attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Honeſty and Simplicity, without Double-dealing, or Tricks, and this more properly is to be called Wiſdom, becauſe it goes always on the ſide of Juſtice, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.

               </p>
               <p>Now let us ſee, when the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, what kind of Water they drank, and of what Temperament the Air was where they Travelled, that we may know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, on this Occaſion, the Wit that iſſued with them out of Bondage, was impaired, or more confirmed in them. Fourty Years (ſays the Text) God ſuſtained his People with Manna, a Meat as delicate and ſavory as ever Men eat in the World; to ſuch a degree, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeeing the delicacy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof, charged his Brother <hi>Aaron</hi> to fill a Pot with it, and lay it up in the <hi>Ark</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> to the end the Children of this People (being ſetled in the <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Promiſe</hi>) ſhould ſee the Bread with which God had fed their Fathers in their paſſing through the Deſart, and how ill Returns they made for
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:53763:171"/>
ſuch a Regale. And that we who never ſaw this Meat, may know what it was, it will not be amiſs to give a Deſcription of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Manna, that by making allowance for the greater Delicacy, we may entirely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what was the goodneſs of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Manna.</p>
               <p>The material Cauſe then of which Manna is made, is a very delicate Vapor, raiſed by the force of the Sun's Heat from the Earth, which being in the height of the Region of the Air is digeſted and brought to Perfection, and by the Cold of the approaching Night condenſes, and being congealed, falls upon Trees and Stones, from whence it is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and preſerved in certain Veſſels to eat. 'Tis called Dewy and Airy Honey, becauſe of the ſemblance it has with Dew, and its being formed of Air; its Colour is white, its Taſte ſweet as Honey, and its Form like that of Coriander; which are the Marks which Sacred Writ gave alſo of the Manna eat by the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>; ſo that there wants not Reaſon to ſuſpect that they both held the ſame Nature. And if that which God made was of a more delicate Subſtance, ſo much the better we ſhall confirm our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: But I was ever of Opinion, that God accommodated himſelf to Natural Means, when he would work with them what he meant, and where Nature was wanting, his Omnipotence ſupplied. This I ſay, becauſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:53763:171"/>
in giving the People Manna to eat in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart, (beſides what God would ſignifie by it) to my thinking, was founded in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Earth, which to this very day produces the beſt Manna in the World; therefore <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid, That in <hi>Mount-Libanus</hi> (which is not far diſtant from this Place) it is produced in a great quantity, and of the greateſt Excellence, even to that degree, that the Country Labourers are wont to ſing in their Paſtimes, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> rained down Honey upon their Land. And though it be true, that God miraculouſly created that Manna in the Wilderneſs, in ſuch a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, at ſuch an Hour, and ſuch ſet Days, it might nevertheleſs partake of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with our Manna; in like manner as the Water which <hi>Moſes</hi> made ſpring out of the Rock, and the Fire that <hi>Eliah</hi> made come down from Heaven, at his Word, were natural Things, though Miraculouſly derived.</p>
               <p>The Manna deſcribed to us in Scripture, was like a Dew, <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. xvi.</note> 
                  <hi>It was like Coriander-ſeed, white, and the Taſte of it like Wafers made with Honey</hi>; all which Properties meet in Natural Manna.</p>
               <p>The Temperament thereof, as Phyſicians ſay, <note n="†" place="margin">Meſue lib. II. c. XVI.</note> is Hot, and conſiſting of ſubtile and very delicate Parts, as alſo was the Manna eat by the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> Accordingly they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at its Deliciouſneſs, <hi>Our Soul</hi> (ſaid
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:53763:172"/>
they) <hi>loaths this light Food</hi>; and the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of this was, That they had ſtrong Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, that were inured to Garlic, Leaks, and Onions, and when they fed upon Meat of ſo ſlight Reſiſtance, it turned all into Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Therefore <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. de aliment. facul. c. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> forbid thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in Natural Heat, to eat Honey, or any other ſuch ſlight Food, leſt it ſhould corrupt, and inſtead of Digeſting, broil in the Stomach like Fat. Even ſo it befel the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with the Manna; for it converted all into Choler Aduſt: So that they became wholly Dry, and Withered, becauſe this Meat was not ſubſtantial enough to ſtuff them. <note n="‖" place="margin">Num. xi.</note> 
                  <hi>Our Soul is dried away, and there is nothing at all beſides this Manna before our Eyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Water they drank after this Meat was ſuch as they deſired, and if they had not found it as they wiſhed, God ſhewed <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. xv.</note> 
                  <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> a piece of Wood, which had ſo Divine a Virtue, that being caſt into Groſs and Salt Water, it made them become delicate and ſavory, and when they had no Water, <note n="†" place="margin">Ib. c. xvi.</note> 
                  <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> took the Rod, with which he opened a dozen Ways in the Red-Sea, and ſtriking therewith the Rock, there iſſued Springs of Water, as delicate and ſavory as their Taſte could wiſh. Which gave Occaſion to St. <note n="*" place="margin">I Cor. x.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>That the Rock followed them.</hi> That is to ſay, that the Water ſtreamed out of the Rock according to their Wiſhes, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53763:172"/>
ſweet, and ſavory. And they had their Stomachs ſuited to the drinking of Groſs and Briny Waters; for in <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſays <note n="*" place="margin">VI. Epid com. X.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> they boiled them to prepare them for Drink, being putrid, and corrupt, ſo that drinking ſuch delicate Waters, they could not avoid their turning to Choler, becauſe of their ſmall reſiſtance. The ſame Qualities, ſays <note n="†" place="margin">V. Aph. XXVIII.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> Water requires to digeſt well in our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and not Corrupt as the ſolid Meats we eat. If the Stomach be ſtrong, it ought to have ſtrong Aliments, to correſpond with it, in proportion; but if the ſame be weak, and delicate, ſuch the Meat ought alſo to be: The ſame is to be obſerved in Water; for we ſee by Experience, if a Man be accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to drink Groſs Waters, he never quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his Thirſt with the Purer, nor feels them hardly in his Stomach; nay, he ſhall be more Thirſty after them, inaſmuch as the Extream Heat of the Stomach burns, and reſolves them as ſoon as they are down, becauſe they can make no Reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Air they breathed in the Deſart was, as we may ſay, ſubtil and delicate; for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling over Mountains, and through vaſt Solitudes, it Fanned them every moment freſh and clear, and without the leaſt Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, becauſe they made no long ſtay in any Place. It was alſo ever very Temperate, for by Day a Cloud was drawn before the Sun,<note place="margin">Exod. XIII</note> that reſtrained it from ſcorching; and by
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:53763:173"/>
Night aroſe a Pillar of Fire that moderated it; and qualified it for ſuch an Air as<note n="*" place="margin">XIV. Sect. Prob. c. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> affirms, much ſharpens the Wit.</p>
               <p>Let us now conſider how delicate and well digeſted the Seed of the Males of this <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> People might be, being nouriſhed by ſuch Food as Manna, drinking the Waters we have ſpoke of, and breathing an Air ſo pure and delicate, and withal how delicate, and fine the Flowers of their Women might be; and let us call to mind what <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. II. de Part. Animal.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, That the Flowers being ſubtile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate, the Child bred of them ſhall be a Man of great Capacity.</p>
               <p>How much it imports, that the Father ſhould eat delicate Meats, to beget very able Children, we ſhall prove at large in the laſt Chapter of this Book. And whereas all the <hi>Jews</hi> eat of the ſame delicate, and ſpirituous Meat, and drank of the ſame Water; all their Children and Poſterity proved ſharp and of great Wit for the Matters of this World.</p>
               <p>From the Time the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were arrived at, and ſetled in the Land of Promiſe with a ſharp Wit, as we have ſaid, they had ſo many Travels, Dearths, Sieges of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, Subjections, and Bondages, and other ill Uſages, that if they had not brought from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Wilderneſs, the Hot, Dry, and Aduſt Temperament (before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) they would have Contracted the ſame
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:53763:173"/>
from their uncomfortable Courſe of Life. For continual Sadneſs and Toil unite the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Spirits and Arterial Blood in the Brain, Liver, and Heart, where ſticking one about the other, they come to heat and burn. And ſo very often they raiſe a Fever, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily produce Choler aduſt (of which moſt of that Nation partake even to this day) as <note n="*" place="margin">VI. Aph. XXIII.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid, <hi>That Fear and Sorrow which hold long are ſigns of Melancholy.</hi> We have already affirmed, That this Burnt Choler was the Inſtrument of Craft, Cunning, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triguing, and Malice; and that Humour is accommodated to the Conjectures in Phyſic, and by the ſame the Notice of the Cauſe and Cure of Diſeaſes is attained. So King <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> admirably hit upon it, and what he ſaid was not a Delirium, much leſs a Suggeſtion of the Devil; but it ought rather to be thought, that by the means of a high Fever, of ſo long Continuance, and through the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation he was in to ſee himſelf Sick with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Relief, his Brain was fired, and his Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination raiſed to that degree, of which we have proved before, that (if it reaches the Temperament it ought) forthwith it makes a Man ſpeak what he never learn'd.</p>
               <p>But againſt all that we have ſaid, a very great Difficulty ariſes, which is, that if the Sons or Grandchildren of thoſe that were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and had taſted Manna, the Waters, and delicate Air of the Deſart, had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:53763:174"/>
for Phyſicians, it might ſeem that the Opinion of King <hi>Francis</hi> was ſomewhat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, for the Reaſons recounted: But that their Poſterity ſhould retain even to this day the Diſpoſitions of the Manna, the Water, the Air, the Afflictions and the Toils their Anceſtors endured in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Captivity, is a thing not eaſy to conceive: For if in Four Hundred and thirty Years, which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſpent in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Fourty in the Deſart, their Seed could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire thoſe Diſpoſitions of Ability, they might better, and with more probability loſe it again, in the Two thouſand Years ſince they came out of the Deſart, more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for thoſe that ſetled in <hi>Spain,</hi> a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo contrary to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and where they have fed on ſuch contrary Meats, and drank Waters not of ſo good a Temperament, nor Subſtance, as in that Land. For ſuch is the Nature of Man, (and ſo of any Plant, or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal, whatever) that he partakes of the Conditions of the Country he is tranſplant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into, and loſes thoſe he brought from other Places. And in any Inſtance to be alledged, the like will befal it, in a few days without Contradiction.</p>
               <p>A certain Race of Men, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere, locis &amp; aquis.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> notes, to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the Vulgar, choſe as a Mark of their Nobility, to have their Heads like a Sugar-Loaf, and to Shape this Figure by Art, the Midwives
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:53763:174"/>
had a Charge to roll up their Heads with certain Bands and Fillets, till they took that Shape. This Artifice really gained ſuch Power, that it grew into Nature; for in tract of time all the Noble Children that were Born, were Born with Pointed Heads; ſo that the Art and Diligence of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives was at an end: But when they left Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at liberty, without reſtraint any longer by Art, by little and little ſhe received the ſame Figure ſhe had before.</p>
               <p>The ſame might have befallen the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for ſay that the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the Manna, the delicate Waters, and their Affliction, ſtamped in their Seed thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Wit, yet theſe Reaſons once cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and others quite contrary taking Place, it is certain, that the Qualities of the Manna would wear out by degrees, and would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire others very different, and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the Country they inhabited, to the Meats they fed on, to the Waters they drank, and to the Air they breathed. This Doubt in Natural Philoſophy holds little difficulty; for there are ſome Accidents to be found that are introduced in a moment, and afterward indure for ever in the ſubject, without poſſibility of Corrupting. Others there are that are as long wearing out as they take in Engendring, ſometimes more, ſometimes leſs, in proportion to the Activity
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:53763:175"/>
of the Agent, and the Diſpoſition of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. For Inſtance of the Firſt, you are to know, that from a great Fear a certain Man was poſſeſſed with, he remained ſo diſfigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and pale, that he had all the Appearances of one Dead; nor was this all, his Paleneſs did not only ſtick to him all his Life long, but was tranſmitted alſo to the Children he had, without any Means found to remove it.</p>
               <p>Conformably to this, it might well be, that in the Four hundred and thirty Years the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the Fourty in the Deſart, and the Sixty in the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Captity, there needed more than Three thouſand Years, for the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> to loſe utterly the Diſpoſitions for Wit, which the Manna had imprinted; ſince that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move an evil Colour, which a Fright raiſed in a moment, more than a Hundred Years were requiſite. But to pierce to the Root of the Truth of this Doctrin, I muſt reſolve two Doubts incident to the purpoſe, and as yet not cleared.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, Whence it comes that Meats how much the more delicate and ſavory they are (as Hens and Partridges) ſo much the ſooner the Stomach does Nauſeate and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor them? And that on the contrary, we ſee a Man eat Beef, all the Year round, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Diſtaſt; whereas if he eat Hens
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53763:175"/>
three or four days together, on the fifth, he can hardly endure the Smell of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Stomach riſing againſt them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Doubt, is, Why Wheaten Bread and Mutton not being of Subſtance ſo good nor ſavory, as Hen, or Partridge, yet the Stomach never loaths them, though we eat them all our Life long. But wanting Bread, we cannot eat other Meats, or if we do, they loſe their Reliſh.</p>
               <p>He that Skills how to reſolve theſe two Doubts, will eaſily comprehend why the Deſcendents of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> have not yet loſt the Diſpoſitions, nor the Qualities, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Manna, into their Seed, and why the Subtilty and Sharpneſs of Wit, of which they were poſſeſſed, cannot be ſo ſoon Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. Two very certain and true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples there are in Natural Philoſophy, on which the Anſwer and Reſolution of theſe Doubts depends. The firſt, is, That all the governing Powers in Man are naked, dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the Conditions and Qualities that are veſted in their Objects, to the end they may know and judge of all their Differences. The Eyes hold this Property, which being to receive all Figures and Colours, have need to be totally diveſted thereof, for if they were Yellow, as in ſuch as have the Jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, all things they ſee would appear to them of that Colour. So the Tongue (which is
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:53763:176"/>
the Inſtrument of Taſte) ought to be void of all Savour; and if the ſame be Sweet or Bitter, we ſee by Experience, that all we Eat, or Drink, has the ſame Taſte: It is the very ſame in Hearing, Smelling and Touching.</p>
               <p>The other Principle is, that all Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the World are naturally Adapted to their own Preſervation, labouring to Endure for ever; and that that, Being which they have received from God, and Nature, may never have end; though afterwards they are to poſſeſs a better Nature. By this Principle all Natural Things which are provided with Knowledge and Senſe, abhor whatever changes and corrupts their Natural Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               <p>The Stomach is naked, and diveſted of the Subſtance and Qualities of all the Meats in the World, as the Eye of Colours and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; and when we Eat oft, though the Stomach overcome it, yet the Meat turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Stomach, becauſe the ſame is of a contrary Principle, and alters and corrupts its Temperament and Subſtance; for there is no Agent ſo powerful, that ſuffers not in Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Meats very delicate and ſavory, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly alter the Stomach; Firſt, becauſe it receives and diſſolves them with ſo great Greedineſs and Reliſh. Secondly, as being of ſo ſubtile Parts, and without Excrements,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:53763:176"/>
they pierce into the Subſtance of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, from which they cannot part again. The Stomach feeling that this Meat alters its Nature, and takes away that Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence it has with other Meats, begins to loath it,<note rend="inter">Thoſe who are uſed to eat Hens, and Partridge, never loath them, becauſe their Stomach is turned into their Subſtance.</note> and if it be forced to feed on it, ſeveral Sawſes and Seaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are prepared to Cheat it. All this the Manna had from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; for though it was a Meat ſo delicate and ſavory, in the end the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> nauſeated it; wherefore they ſaid, <hi>Our Soul loaths that ſlight Meat.</hi> A Complaint unworthy a People ſo highly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by God, who had provided a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for this, in making the Manna have thoſe Taſtes and Reliſhes, which beſt agreed with them, that it might go down the better; <hi>Thou gaveſt them Bread from Heaven, which had in it all ſorts of Pleaſantneſs.</hi> For which cauſe many among them fed thereon with a good Appetite, for they had Bones, Nerves, and Fleſh, ſo Aſſimilated with the Manna, and its Qualities, that by reaſon of the great Reſemblance, they longed for nothing elſe. 'Tis the ſame in Wheaten Bread, and Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, of which we ordinarily eat. Groſs Meats, and of good Subſtance, as Beef, are full of Excrements, and the Stomach receives them not with ſuch deſire as thoſe that are delicate and ſavory, and ſo they take more
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53763:177"/>
time to be Aſſimilated. Hence it follows, That to Corrupt the Alteration which the Manna made in a day, there will be need of a whole month of contrary Meats; and after this Account to extinguiſh the Qualities that Manna had introduced in the Seed in the ſpace of Fourty Years, there needs Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Years, and more. But if you think not, let us ſuppoſe that as God call'd out of <hi>Egypt</hi> the Twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he had drawn Twelve <hi>Blacks,</hi> and as many <hi>She-Negroes,</hi> from the fartheſt part of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and had brought them into <hi>Spain</hi>; how many Years would it have taken to have made theſe <hi>Moors,</hi> and their Deſcendents, loſe their black Colour, not mixing at all with the <hi>Whites?</hi> To me it ſeems it would have taken a great number of Years, ſince it is now more than Two hundred Years ſince the firſt <hi>Gypſies</hi> came from <hi>Egypt</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and yet their Children have degenerated but a little from the nimble Wit and Cunning which their Anceſtors brought out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> no more than from their Tawney-Colour; ſuch is the force of Human Seed, when it has received any well-rooted Quality. And in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> tranſmit their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to their Deſcendents, by means of their Seed, though they be out of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> ſo likewiſe the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> may communicate to their Deſcendents their Sharpneſs of Wit:

Without being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> or eating Manna: For to be Knowing, or Ignorant, are as well Accidents in Men, as to be White or Black. True it is, that they are not now ſo quick and ſharp, as they were a Thouſand Years ago; for from the time they left off to eat Manna, their Deſcendents came by degrees to degenerate from the uſe of Contrary Meats, and from inhabiting a different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and drinking no ſuch deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate Waters as in the Deſart, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have mingled with Women of the Gentile Race, who wanted this Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Wit: But this is not to be denied them, that as yet they have not utterly loſt it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XV. To what Difference of Wit the Art-Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary belongs, and by what Marks the Man may be known, who has it.</head>
               <p>WHAT is the cauſe, ſays <note n="*" place="margin">XXVII. Sect. Prob. V.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> ſince Fortitude is not Eſteemed the chief of all Virtues, but Juſtice and Prudence greater than it; yet the Commonwealth, and all Men in a manner, with one Conſent, more Eſteem a Valiant Man, and have more Honour for him in their Hearts, than for the Juſt and Prudent, although raiſed to great Place and Dignity? To this Problem he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, ſaying, That there is no King in the World, but is engaged in War, either Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive or Defenſive; and as it is to the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, that they owe Glory, Empire, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon their Enemies, and the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Dominions; they give more Honour, not to the Chief Virtue, which is Juſtice, but to that which is moſt Uſeful and Advantagious; for if the Valiant were not treated thus, at what a loſs would Kings be to find Captains and Soldiers ſo frankly to venture their Lives in Defence of their Crowns and Countries?</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Aſiatics</hi> it is reported, that there was a part of them who armed themſelves
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:53763:178"/>
very Couragiouſly, and being ask'd, Why they had neither King nor Laws? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That Laws made them Cowards; and ſince a Neceſſity appeared for them to expoſe themſelves to all the Hazards of War, to drive others out of their State, they choſe rather to fight for themſelves, and reap the Fruit of their own Victories; but this was an Anſwer of Barbarians rather than of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable People, who know full well, that without a King, without a Commonwealth, and without Laws, it is not poſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Men in Peace.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid was cloſe to the Point, though there be yet a better Anſwer; which is this, that when <hi>Rome</hi> Honoured her Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, with thoſe Triumphs and Solemnities, ſhe did not only recompence the Bravery of the Conqueror, but alſo his Juſtice (by means of which, he kept his Army in Peace and Concord) his Conduct which he had made uſe of in his Exploits, and their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance obſerved in abſtaining from Wine, Women, and Gluttony, which are apt to diſorder the Judgment, and produce fatal Miſtakes in Councils. Yea Prudence is more to be deſired in a General, and ought rather to be rewarded than Courage, or Bravery; for as <hi>Vegetius</hi> ſaid, There are few over-Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Captains, that luckily accompliſh great Actions; and the Reaſon is, that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is more neceſſary in War than Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:53763:179"/>
in Encountring. But what this Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is, which is neceſſary, <hi>Vegetius</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could never find out, nor ſpecify the Difference of Wit he ought to have, who Commanded in Chief; and no marvel, becauſe the manner of Philoſophizing on which this Knowledge depends, was not then found out. True it is, that Enquiry falls not within our firſt Intention, which was to make choice of Wits fit for Letters; but War is a thing ſo peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and depending on ſuch deep Councils, and it is of ſuch importance for a King to know whom to truſt his Power and Eſtate with, that we ſhall do no meaner ſervice to the Commonwealth in Teaching this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Wit, and its Marks, than in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Differences of Wit we have deſcribed. You are to know then, that <hi>Malitia,</hi> and <hi>Militia,</hi> as they have one Name, ſo likewiſe one Definition; for by the change only of one Letter, each reciprocally paſſes into the other. What are the Properties and Nature of Malice, <note n="*" place="margin">De natur. Deor.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> recounts, when he ſays, That Malice is nothing elſe but a ſly and wary Proceeding in Miſchief, and ſo it is in War, no other thing is, acted, but how to offend the Enemy, and to defend our ſelves from his Stratagems; ſo that the beſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a General is to be Malicious to his Enemy, and not to interpret any of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in good part, but all in the worſt Senſe that can be taken, and ever to ſtand upon
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:53763:179"/>
his Guard. <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. xii.</note> 
                  <hi>Believe not thy Enemy, with his Lips he ſweetneth, and his Heart betrayeth thee, to make thee fall into the Pit; he weepeth with his Eyes, and if he light upon a fit occaſion, he will not be ſatisfied with thy Blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fair inſtance of this we have in <note n="†" place="margin">Judith x.</note> Holy Writ; for when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Beſieged in <hi>Bethulia,</hi> and Fatigued with Hunger and Thirſt, that famous Lady <hi>Judith</hi> iſſued out in a deſign to kill <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and in her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Army, ſhe was ſtopt by the Centinels and Guards, who asking her whether, ſhe was bound? She anſwered with ambiguous Wit; I am a Daughter of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom you have Beſieged, and I fled, becauſe I know full well that they will fall into your Hands, and that you would treat them ill, becauſe they will not ſubmit themſelves to Mercy. Therefore I reſolved to wait upon <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and to diſcover to him the Secrets of this obſtinate People, and to ſhew him which way he may enter the City, without the loſs of a Man. <hi>Judith</hi> being brought into <hi>Holofernes</hi>'s Preſence, threw her ſelf at his Feet, and with cloſed Hands began to Worſhip him, and to ſpeak to him the faireſt Words that were ever ſpoke to Man in the World: Inſomuch that <hi>Holofernes,</hi> and his whole Council, made no ſcruple to believe all that ſhe ſaid to be true. But ſhe not unmindful of the Deſign ſhe had formed in her Heart, ſtaid only till a
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:53763:180"/>
convenient Occaſion offered, and cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>A Friend has quite contrary Qualities, and therefore, ought always to be credited. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly <hi>Holofernes</hi> might better have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved <hi>Achior,</hi> ſeeing he was his Friend, who from a Zeal that he ſhould not diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leave the Siege, ſaid to him, Sir, firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your ſelf, whether this People have Sinned againſt God; for if it be ſo, he will deliver them into your Hands, without any Efforts of yours to Conquer them; but if they be in his Favour, be aſſured that he will defend them, and we ſhall not be able to vanquiſh them. <hi>Holofernes</hi> was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle diſpleaſed with this Advice, being a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Man as he was, given to Women and Wine, three things which diſturb the Judgment, and are directly oppoſite to the Councils that ought to be taken in the Art-Military. Therefore <note n="*" place="margin">De Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> with Reaſon approved of that Law the <hi>Carthagenians</hi> had, which forbids the General to drink Wine du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Campaign, becauſe this Liquor, to uſe the Words of <note n="†" place="margin">XIV Sect. Prob. XV.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> makes Men of a Turbulent Wit, and raiſes their Courage too high, as was evident in <hi>Holofernes,</hi> from thoſe angry Words which he Vented againſt <hi>Achior,</hi> The Wit that is neceſſary as well to project Ambuſhes and Stratagems, as alſo to evade them, <hi>Cicero</hi> has pointed to us, in deriving the Etymology of this word, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſutia,</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:53763:180"/>
which comes, as he ſays, from the Verb <hi>Verſor,</hi> foraſmuch as thoſe who are Winding, Wily, Double, and Cavillers, in a moment play their Tricks, and change their Meaſures with eaſe. The ſame <note n="*" place="margin">De Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. Deor.</note> 
                  <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> gives us an Inſtance, when he ſaid, That Chryſippus <hi>was without doubt a Winding and and Crafty Fellow:</hi> Verſutus &amp; Calidus, <hi>ſo I call thoſe whoſe Wit readily veers, and ſhifts upon Occaſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Property readily to nick the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is a certain Induſtry and Sagacity, (as we have already noted) which belongs to the Imagination; for the Powers which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Heat, perform their Works with ſpeed, by reaſon of which Men of great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding avail nothing in War; becauſe this Faculty is but ſlow in its proceedings, being a Friend of Uprightneſs, Plainneſs, Simplicity, and Mercy: All which occaſion great Inconveniences in War. Men of theſe Qualities are not only unacquainted with the Tricks and Stratagems of War, but alſo eaſily Cheated, becauſe they truſt every Body. Theſe Men are good to treat with Friends, with whom there is no need of the Wiſdom of the Imagination, but only of the Integrity and Simpleneſs of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which endures no Tricks, nor to do Wrong to any; but they are of no Uſe to conteſt with Enemies, who are over-reaching with their Wiles, and therefore
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:53763:181"/>
there is always occaſion for the ſame Wit, to be on our Guard againſt them. And for this Reaſon <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer gave in Charge to his Diſciples, <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. x.</note> 
                  <hi>Behold, I ſend you forth as Sheep in the midſt of Wolves, be ye therefore Wiſe as Serpents, and Innocent as Doves.</hi> Warineſs muſt be practiſed with an Enemy, Frankneſs and Simplicity only with a Friend.</p>
               <p>If then the General is not in the leaſt to truſt his Enemy, but ever to ſuſpect that he may over-reach him, he muſt neceſſarily have a Difference of Imagination, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts, is wary, and can skill how to diſcover the Deſigns which are covered under fair Pretences. For the ſame Power that finds them out, can only apply alſo a Remedy. It ſeems that this alſo is another Difference of Imagination, that deviſes Inſtruments and Machines, by means of which, Fortreſſes are gained, though impregnable; Camps are pitched, and each Squadron Marſhalled in due place; the fit Opportunities are known of Attacks and Retreats; as alſo the ſeveral ſteps in Treaties and Capitulations, with an Enemy; for all which the Underſtanding is no leſs impertinent than the Ears are to ſee withal. Therefore I doubt not in the leaſt but that the Art-Military belongs to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, ſince all that a good Captain ought to do, carries with it Conſonance, Figure, and Correſpondence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:53763:181"/>The Difficulty is to know what difference of Imagination in particular is required in War. Which I cannot reſolve with Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, becauſe it is a very nice Enquiry. Yet I conjecture that the Art-Military re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a degree more of Heat than the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſic, and that the Choler be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what allayed, but not utterly quenched. Which is plainly ſeen in this, that the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt intriguing Captains are not the moſt Couragious, nor deſirous of coming to Blows, or giving Battel, but rather by Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhes and ſecret Stratagems gain their ends, without hazarding a broken Pate; a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty that <hi>Vegetius</hi> was more pleaſed with than any other. <hi>For good Generals,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>are not thoſe that fight in a plain Field, with equal Danger, but rather ſuch as make uſe of ſecret Surprizes, and without loſs of Men, ever cut off the Enemies Force, or at leaſt hold them in Awe.</hi> The advantage of this manner of Wit, the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate knew; for though they had many Famous Captains, which won abundance of Battels, yet at their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive the Triumph and Glory, due to their Enterprizes, the Wailings of the Fathers made for their Dead Children, the Children for their Dead Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, the Wives for their Husbands, and the Brothers for their Brethren, were ſo great, that they could not taſte the Solemn
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:53763:182"/>
Games and Paſtimes, through the pitiful Cries for thoſe that were killed upon the Spot. Inſomuch, that the Senate reſolved no more to chuſe ſo Valiant Captains, that took ſuch Pleaſure in Fighting, but rather Men a little Timorous, but very deſigning; ſuch as was <hi>Quintus Fabius,</hi> of whom it is Writ, that it was a Miracle to ſee him offer a pitch'd Battel in open Field, eſpecially when he was far from <hi>Rome,</hi> whence he could not readily draw Succours, if he were Worſted. All he did, was to dally with the Enemy, and make uſe of Stratagems and Tricks of War, by which means he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed great things, and gained many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories, without the loſs of one Soldier: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he was received at <hi>Rome</hi> with U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Applauſe, becauſe if he led Abroad a Hundred thouſand Soldiers, he returned Home with as many, except thoſe that were loſt by Sickneſs. The Public Acclamations the People gave him was what <note n="*" place="margin">Cicero Dial. de Sen.</note> 
                  <hi>Ennius</hi> has reported.
<q>
                     <l>Vnus homo nobis cunctando reſtituit rem.</l>

                     <l>One Man alone for us has done the Feat,</l>
                     <l>Who without Fighting has preſerv'd the State.</l>
                  </q>
As if he had ſaid, A Man that beats the Enemy without Blows, or Effuſion of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:53763:182"/>
Blood, and returns Home without Loſs of Men.</p>
               <p>Some Captains ſince have endeavoured to imitate him: But becauſe they wanted his Wit, and his Deſigns, they have often ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped fair Opportunities of Fighting, whence have proceeded, more Inconveniences, and greater Loſſes, than if they had given Battel out of hand.</p>
               <p>We may alſo draw into Example that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Carthaginian</hi> Captain, of whom <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> Writes thus. <hi>Hanibal</hi> upon gaining that Signal Victory, commanded many <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Priſoners to be ſet at Liberty, without Ranſom, that the Fame of his Mercy and Clemency might ſpread it ſelf among the People, though in his own Diſpoſition he was far enough from theſe Virtues. For he was Naturally Fierce and Barbarous, and ſo trained from his tender Years, that he had learned no Laws, or Civil Conduct what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, but only Wars, Slaughters, and Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panings of his Enemies: So that he became a very Cruel Captain, moſt Malicious, in circumventing Men, and always plotting how to Enſnare the Enemy: And where he could not Overcome by open Force, he had recourſe to Stratagems, as he plainly ſhew'd in the Battel above-mentioned, and in that which he gave before to <hi>Sempronius</hi> near the River of <hi>Trebia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:53763:183"/>The Marks by which he may be known, that hath this Difference of Wit, are very uncommon, and well worthy Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de Scientia.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, That he who would be skilled in this kind of Talent here treated of, can neither be Valiant, nor good Natured, becauſe Prudence (as <note n="†" place="margin">XIV Sect. Prob. VI.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> has told us) conſiſts in Coldneſs, but Courage and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in Heat. Now as theſe two Qualities are inconſiſtent, and contrary to each other, in like manner it is impoſſible that the ſame Man ſhould be very Valiant and Prudent at once. Therefore it is neceſſary that his Choler ſhould burn to ſuch a degree, as to become black Choler, that he may be Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;<note rend="inter">
                     <hi>If Children are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly Timerous, it is a ſign that they will prove very Wiſe</hi>; Becauſe the Seed they were raiſed from was much burnt, and of the Nature of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Bilis.</note> but where this kind of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy reigns, by reaſon of its Coldneſs are ingendered alſo Fear and Cowardice. In ſuch ſort that Skill and Cunning require ſome Heat, becauſe they are Works of the Imagination, but not in ſo high a degree as Courage, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly are different in the Intention of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. But there falls out a thing very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that of the Four Moral Virtues, (Prudence, Juſtice, Fortitude, and Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) the two Firſt require Wit and a good Temperament, to be put in Practice; for if a Judge has not Underſtanding ſufficient enough to find out the Point of Juſtice, it
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:53763:183"/>
will be of little uſe to him, to have a Will diſpoſed to render to each his due; with all his good Meaning he may ſtray, and wrong the true Proprietor.</p>
               <p>The ſame is to be underſtood of Prudence; for if only the Will ſufficed, to keep all things in good Order, Men would never miſcarry in their Actions, good or bad; there is no Thief, who aims not to Rob in ſuch a manner as not to be Diſcovered; and there is no Captain, that does not deſire ſo much Prudence as to Conquer his Enemy: But the Thief that is not his Crafts-maſter in Robbing, is ſoon Diſcovered; and the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that wants Imagination, is preſently worſted.</p>
               <p>Fortitude and Temperance are Virtues which a Man carries in his own Hands, though he wants a Natural Diſpoſition to them; for if he makes but ſmall account of his Life, and ſhow Courage, he may well do it; but if he be Stout by Natural Diſpoſition, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> ſay very well, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to be Wiſe, though he would. After this manner then there is no Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but that Prudence may be joined with Courage and Fortitude; for a Wiſe and Prudent Man has the Underſtanding to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard his Honour for his Soul, his Life for his Honour, and his Fortune for his Life; as it daily happens. From whence it comes, that
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53763:184"/>
Gentlemen being more Honourable, ſhow themſelves ſo Valiant, and that there are none fatigue, or ſuffer more, in War than they; though they have been bred in the midſt of Pleaſures; and all for fear of being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed Cowards. Whence came that Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>God keep me from a Gentleman by day, and from a Thief by night</hi>; for one to be ſeen, and the other not to be known, fight with double Courage.</p>
               <p>On this very reaſon the Inſtitution of the Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> was Founded; for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how much it imports a Noble Man, to be a Man of Courage, it is provided by a Conſtitution, that all of their Order ſhould be Noble by Fathers and Mothers ſide, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that each of them in Combate, muſt ſhow himſelf worth two Plebeians. But if a Gentleman had it in charge to Encamp an Army, and were to give Orders to Surprize the Enemy, if he had not a Wit proper for it, he would commit and utter a thouſand Blunders; becauſe Prudence is not in the hand of Man. But if he had Orders to Guard a Paſs, he might well be depended upon, even though he were naturally a great Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard. The Sentence of <hi>Plato</hi> is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, when a Prudent Man follows his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination, and corrects not the ſame by Reaſon. And ſo is it true, that the very Wiſe, cannot be Couragious by a Natural
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:53763:184"/>
Diſpoſition; for aduſt Choler, which makes him Prudent, the ſame, ſays <note n="*" place="margin">VI. Aph. XXIII.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> makes him Timerous and a Coward.</p>
               <p>The Second Property the Man ought to have that hath this Difference of Wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat, is to be mild, and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditioned; becauſe he foreſees a Thouſand Things in his Imagination, and allowing that the leaſt Slip and Miſcarriage may prove the loſs of an Army, he ever has an Eye to the main Chance. But thoſe that know little, call Carefulneſs, a Toil; Chaſtiſement, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; Mercy, Softneſs; Suffering and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling, of lewd Parts, Good-Nature: Which proceeds only from the Dulneſs of Men, who diſtinguiſh not the Worth of Things, nor which way they are to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged; but the Prudent and Wiſe are out of all Patience, nor can they bear to ſee things ill managed, though they have no Intereſt in them; therefore they live but a little while, and with much uneaſineſs of Mind. And therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <note n="†" place="margin">Eccleſ. I.</note> 
                  <hi>I gave my heart to know Wiſdom, and to know Madneſs and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perceived that this alſo is but Vexation of Spirit; for in much Wiſdom is much Grief; and he that increaſeth Knowledge, increaſeth Sorrow.</hi> As if he had ſaid, I have been a Fool, and I have been Wiſe, and I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Trouble in every thing: For he that fills his Underſtanding with abundance
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:53763:185"/>
of Knowledge, reaps no other Advantage, but to be more Penſive and Moroſe. By which it ſeems that <hi>Solomon</hi> would have us underſtand, that he lived more Contentedly in Ignorance, than after he had received Wiſdom. And ſo in truth it is, the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant live moſt careleſs, they are in pain for nothing, and they think no Body in the World has more Wit than themſelves: The Vulgar call ſuch <hi>Angels of Heaven,</hi> obſerving that they reſent nothing to put them out of Humour, nor find fault with any thing ill done, but let all paſs. But did they well conſider the Wiſdom and Qualities of an Angel, they would find it was a word of ill Sound, and a Caſe for the Inquiſition-Houſe; for from the inſtant of our receiving the uſe of Reaſon, to the hour of our Death, they do nothing elſe but check us for the evil we do, and are our Monitors for what we ought to do. And if, as they ſpeak to us in their ſpiritual Language,<note place="margin">St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was an Angel in Office.</note> moving our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they ſhould deliver their Admonitions in material Words, we might hold them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and preſſing. And he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not this, let him mark that the Angel of whom <note n="*" place="margin">Matth. xi.</note> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks, ſeem'd no leſs to <hi>Herod</hi> and his Brother <hi>Philip</hi>'s Wife, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that to be rid of his finding Faults, they fairly cut off his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:53763:185"/>It would have been much more to the Purpoſe to have ſtiled theſe Men,<note place="margin">Obſerve how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Memory and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe are even among the very brute Beaſts</note> whom the Vulgar fondly call <hi>Angels of Heaven, The Aſſes of the Earth</hi>; for amongſt Brute Beaſts, ſays <note n="*" place="margin">II.

                  <hi>Galen,</hi> there is none more blunt or of leſs Wit than the Aſs, though in Memory he ſurpaſſes all the reſt; he refuſes no Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, he goes as he is guided, without turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this way or that; he neither Winces nor Bites; he never runs away, nor is Skittiſh, and full of Tricks. If he be laboured with a Cudgel, he turns not again; he ſeems to be made wholly for the Will and Service of his Maſter. The ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty have theſe Men the Vulgar call <hi>Angels of Heaven,</hi> and their Tameneſs proceeds but from their being half Witted, and of a ſhort Imagination, and the Iraſcible Faculties being remiſs, which is a great defect in Man, and ſhews he is ill Conſtituted.</p>
               <p>There never was Angel or Man in the World of a better Nature than Chriſt our Redeemer, who one day entring the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whipt out the Sellers of Merchandizes; and the Reaſon of it was, that the Iraſcible Faculty is as the Rod or Sword of Reaſon, and the Man who blames not what is ill done, either ſhows himſelf a Fool, or is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in the Iraſcible Faculty. So that it is a Wonder to ſee a Wiſe Man that is Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and of this Humour, which ill Men
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53763:186"/>
would have him. And ſo thoſe who Writ the Hiſtory of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> admire how the Soldiers could bear a Man ſo rough and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, which proceeded from his having a Wit fit for War.</p>
               <p>The Third Property of thoſe who have this Difference of Wit, is, that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of their Dreſs; they are almoſt all homely, ſlovenly, their Stockings looſe about their Heels, ſetting full of Wrinkles, their Cap ſlouching on one ſide, fond of old Cloaths, never caring for change of Suits.</p>
               <p>Of this Humour, (ſays <hi>Florus)</hi> was the famous Captain <hi>Viriatus,</hi> a <hi>Portugueze,</hi> of whom (enlarging on his great Humility) he ſpeaks, and affirms, that he ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd tricking up himſelf, as the pooreſt Common Soldier in all his Army went not ſo meanly clad as he. Though, in truth, this was no Virtue, nor did he do it with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, it being a Natural defect of thoſe who have this difference of Imagination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat. The Negligence of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> much deceived <hi>Cicero,</hi> for being asked (after the Battel) the reaſon that moved him to take <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Part, <hi>Macrobius</hi> tells us, that his Anſwer was, <hi>His Girding deceived me</hi>; as if he had ſaid, I was deceived in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in ſuch an Undreſs, never having his Girdle tight, (whom the Soldiers in way of a By-word, call'd Dangle-Coat:)
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:53763:186"/>
Though this ſhould rather have induced him to have believed, that he had the Wit fit for a Council of War; as <hi>Sylla</hi> could remark, ſo <hi>Suetonius</hi> has told us, who ſeeing this great Captain, when a Boy, and ſo careleſly Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, bid the <hi>Romans, Beware of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngirt Boy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Hiſtorians are much employed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting <hi>Hanibal</hi>'s Regardleſneſs of his Cloaths, and his Sandals, and how little he cared to go trim and neat.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> deſirous to ſhew the Marks by which the Wit and Ability of a Phyſician might appear, amongſt many others he found to that purpoſe, has ſet down as the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, the Dreſs and Equipage of his Perſon. He that is cleanly about his Hands, often pares his Nails, has abundance of Rings on his Fingers, wears perfumed Gloves, his Stockings very tite, his Collar ſtiff, and without a Wrinkle; his Cloak new bruſh'd, and without a Hair upon it; he, I ſay, that is very nice in every thing, one may very well ſay, is a Man of ſmall Underſtanding. <hi>You may know,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>Men by their Cloaths for the oftner you ſee them Curious in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Modiſh, and Smug, the more you are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them, and hate to meet them</hi>; for theſe Perſons are good for nothing. <hi>Horace</hi> was ſurprized to ſee Men of Wit, and ſuch as were always engaged in ſome deep Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:53763:187"/>
with long Nails, the Knuckles and Joints of their Fingers full of Dirt, and naſty; a dangling Cloak; a Collar always unbutton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a foul Shirt, and untied Slip-Shooes, Stockings down at Heels, and all in wrinkles; Upon which he ſaid, <hi>The greateſt part of theſe Men never think of paring their Nails, nor ſhaving their Beards, nor waſhing and combing themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Reaſon of it is, that the great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and the great Imagination ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule all things in the World, as finding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there, that Merits their Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or that is ſolid. Nought but Sublime and Divine Speculations take with them, upon theſe they bend all their Thoughts, and their whole Study, deſpiſing the reſt. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, That before we grow Intimate with any, or engage in Friendſhip with them, we ought to eat a Buſhel of Salt together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Mens Manners and Humous are ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that no one Body in a little time can diſcover them; Experience only, and the Converſation of many days can give us a certain knowledge of them: But if he had taken notice of the Marks the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings have left us, in leſs time than there ought be in eating a ſmall handful of Salt, he might have penetrated into all their Crafts and Ways of working, without the attendance of ſo many days. Three things
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53763:187"/>
(ſaid the Wiſe-man) diſcover the Man let him be never ſo reſerved and cloſe; the firſt is, <hi>his Laughter</hi>; the ſecond, <hi>his Dreſs</hi>; and the third, <hi>his Gate.</hi> As to Laughter, we have already ſaid elſewhere, that when they Laugh diſorderly, and upon all occaſions, clapping and ſtricking the Hands, with other Grimaces, that ſhew them to be great Gig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers, it is a ſign they want Imagination and Underſtanding. As to the Nicety of Cloaths, and to be always a bruſhing off the Hairs, hunting as it were after every Hair upon the Coat, we but now ſufficiently ſpoke to. Only I would inform the Reader, that my deſign here is not to condemn Neatneſs and Spruceneſs in Cloaths, nor to approve Slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlineſs and Ungenteelneſs, becauſe the one and the other are Vitious, and there is need in both of a <hi>Medium.</hi> Which occaſioned <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> to ſpeak after this manner: <hi>There ought to be obſerved ſuch a Neatneſs that is neither Odious nor too Affected, but that ſhows only, that we avoid ruſtic and rude Careleſneſs; the ſame ſhould be obſerved in Cloaths,</hi> in which, Indifference is laudable. As to what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the Gate, <hi>Cicero</hi> has obſerved two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, both which he has condemned as Vitious; the firſt is, to go too faſt; and the ſecond, too ſlowly: Accordingly he ſays, <hi>We are to take care, that our Gate be not too ſlow, that it looks as if we went always in State and Proceſſion, with all the Pomp and Show of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:53763:188"/>
and when we are in haſte to go, we ſhould not run Poſt, to put our ſelves out of Breath, to alter our Colour, make wry Mouths, grin with the Teeth, and other Grimaces, which too much betray to thoſe that obſerve us, that we have empty Skulls, and are very Silly.</hi> After all, theſe are not the kinds of Gates that diſcover what Wit a Man has, but ſome other far dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, which conſiſt in certain Geſtures and Motions, that are not to be noted with a Pen, nor expreſt with a Tongue; wherefore the ſame <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, that they are eaſy to comprehend when ſeen, but very difficult to tell, or write down.</p>
               <p>To be in pain for the leaſt Mote on the Cape, and to be ſolicitous about drawing up the Stockings very ſtrait, and that the Cloak ſet dexterouſly upon the Shoulders, without the leaſt Rumple; all this is a part of a baſe Difference of the Imagination, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Underſtanding, and to that other Difference of Imagination required in War.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Mark and Property, is, to have a bald Pate; and the Reaſon of it is plain, inaſmuch as this Difference of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as alſo all the reſt, have place in the fore-part of the Head; and exceſſive Heat burns the Skin of the Head, and cloſes the Pores through which the Hair is to paſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that the Matter whereof the Hair is made, is, (as the Phyſicians ſay) the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements which the Brain ſends forth in time
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53763:188"/>
of its Nouriſhment; and by the great Fire there, all theſe Excrements are waſted and conſume, and ſo the Matter fails whereof they are produced.</p>
               <p>Which Philoſophy had <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, he would not have been aſhamed of his bald Head, ſince to cover this Defect, he turned over his Forehead the hinder part of his Hair. And <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us, That nothing was more pleaſing to him than what the Senate enacted, that he might always wear a Laurel on his Head, on no other ground than to cover his Baldneſs. Another ſort of Baldneſs proceeds from a Brain hard, earthy, and of groſs Parts; but this is a ſign of a Man defective in Underſtanding, Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and Memory.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Mark by which they are known who have this Difference of Imagination, is, that they are Men ſparing in Words, but full of Sentences; and the reaſon of it is, that their Brain being hard and dry, they muſt of neceſſity fail in Memory, to which belongs choice of Words. To find many things to ſay, ariſes from a reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Memory and Imagination, in the firſt degree of Heat. Thoſe in whom theſe two Powers meet, are ordinarily very great Lyars, and never want Words and Stories, if we liſten all our life time to them.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Property obſerved in thoſe who have this Difference of Imagination, is,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53763:189"/>
to be ſhame-faced, and to take offence at ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcene and filthy Talk. And ſo <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. II. de Offic.</note> 
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> ſays, That Men who are very Rational, imitate the Modeſty of Nature, who has hid the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly and indecent Parts, which ſhe made to provide for the Neceſſities of Mankind, and not for Beauty, upon which Parts ſhe would not have us caſt our Eyes, or lend an Ear to their Names. This Effect we might well attribute to the Imagination, and ſay, that it is offended by the ill Figure of theſe Parts: But in the laſt Chapter we aſſigned the Cauſe of this Effect, and reduced it to the Underſtanding, and judged them defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in this Power, who are not offended with Immodeſty. And becauſe with the Difference of Imagination required for the Art-Military, the Underſtanding is aſſociated; therefore the great Captains are very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. And ſo in the Hiſtory of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> we meet with an Act of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty that was ever practiſed by any Man in the World; that is, while he was to be Stab'd with Ponyards in the Senate (ſeeing that there was no poſſibility of eſcaping Death) he fell down on the Floor, wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping himſelf up in his Imperial Robes, that after his Death he appeared ſtretched out very decently, with his Legs and other Parts covered, which might be offenſive to the Sight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="337" facs="tcp:53763:189"/>The ſeventh Property, and the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of all, is, that the General be Fortunate and Lucky, by which Sign we ſhall know certainly, that he has the Wit and Ability requiſite to the Art Military; for in truth and reality, there is nothing more ordinarily makes a Man Unfortunate, and hinders things from ſucceeding according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, than to want Prudence, and not to uſe the Means convenient for his Undertakings. For as <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> made uſe of ſo great Prudence in all that he deſigned, he was the happieſt General of all that ever were in the World; and in great Perils he animated his Soldiers in theſe Words; <hi>Fear not, for Caeſar and his Fortune attends you.</hi> The <hi>Stoicks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; that as there was a firſt Cauſe, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Omnipotent, and of infinite Wiſdom, known by the Order and Conſent of it's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Works; ſo there was another, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and unconcerted, whoſe Works moved without Order, without Reaſon, and were void of Diſcretion, for with a blind affection it gives to, or takes from Men, Riches, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and Honors. They call'd it by the Name of <hi>Fortune,</hi> becauſe that it favoured thoſe who did the feat at hap-hazard, that is to ſay, by chance, without thinking, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt, or the Guidance of Reaſon. They paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her, (to repreſent her Manners) in the ſhape of a Woman, in her Hand a Royal Scepter, her Eyes veil'd, her Feet on a round
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53763:190"/>
Ball, attended by a Mob of Sots and Fellows of no Trade or Employment: By the form of a Woman, they ſet forth her great Levity, and little Diſcretion: By her Royal Scepter, they acknowledged her the Miſtreſs of Riches and Honours: Her Eyes veil'd, ſhow'd the ill Choice ſhe made in diſtributing her Gifts: Her Feet fix'd on a round Ball, ſignified the ſlippery Nature of the Favours ſhe does, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe takes them away with as little Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration as ſhe gives them, without holding a ſteady Hand in any thing. But what is worſt in her, is, that ſhe favours the Wicked, and perſecutes the Good; dotes on Fools, and abhors the Wiſe; degrades the Nobles, and raiſes Raſcals; is gracious to the Foul, and plagues the Fair: Many Men place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confidence in theſe Properties, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their own good Fortune, dare venture on head-ſtrong and raſh Enterpriſes, which nevertheleſs ſucceed well: as others on the contrary, very Wiſe and Diſcerning, dare not put in Practice thoſe things which they dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with great Diſcretion, finding by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that for the moſt part they ſucceed but ill. How great a Friend Fortune is to the Bad, <note n="*" place="margin">XXIX. Sect. Prob. VIII.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſhews, when he asks, <hi>Why Riches are in the Poſſeſſion of the Wicked oftener than of the Good?</hi> To which Problem he Anſwers, <hi>Is it not becauſe Fortune is blind, and not able to chooſe, or diſcern, which it Beſt.</hi> But this is an Anſwer unworthy ſo great a
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:53763:190"/>
Philoſopher, for it is not Fortune that gives Riches to Men, and tho' it were, yet he gives no Reaſon, why ſhe always favours the Wicked, and abandons the Good.</p>
               <p>The true Solution of this Problem is, that Knaves are very Witty, and have a ſtrong Imagination, to over-reach in Buying and Selling, and to make all Advantages of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaining, and laying out their Stock: But the Honeſt want this Imagination, many of whom, to follow the faſhion of the Lewd, in turning and winding of their Penny, in a few days have loſt their whole Stock.</p>

XVI.</note> in the Manage of the unjuſt Steward, whom his Maſter call'd to Accompt, for tho' he reſerved a good part of his Goods to his own Uſe, yet he carried his Cup ſo even, as to get a Diſcharge; and tho' this Wiſdom was naughty, Yet our Saviour commends it, and ſays, <hi>The Children of this World are Wiſer in their Generation than the Children of Light.</hi> For theſe laſt have for the moſt part a great Underſtanding, by means of which, they affect his Law; and want Imagination, to which the skill to live in the World belongs; Accordingly many are morally Good, who have not Wit enough to be Naught. This way of Anſwering is more plain, and ſenſible, than the other. For the Natural Philoſophers, becauſe they could not penetrate ſo far, have framed ſo frivolous and abſurd a Cauſe as Fortune, to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53763:191"/>
whom they might attribute good or bad ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and not to the Indiſcretion, or unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Men.</p>
               <p>Four differences of Men are to be found in every Nation, (if any pleaſe to mark them) ſome are Wiſe, but ſeem not ſo; others ſeem ſo, and are not; others neither are, nor ſeem; and others again, both are, and ſeem.</p>
               <p>Some Men there are, reſerved, ſlow of ſpeech, ſtayed in anſwering, not curious, nor copious of Words; and who neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have hidden within themſelves a Natural Power pertaining to the Imagination, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they know the Time, and can embrace the opportunity of Buſineſs, and how they are to manage themſelves in the point, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Communicating, or Imparting their Mind to any other. Theſe the Vulgar call fortunate, and happy, imagining that with a little Skill and Diſcretion every thing falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Lap.</p>
               <p>Others on the contrary, are Eloquent in Words, and Diſcourſe, great Talkers, Men that take upon them to Govern the World, and that contrive how to make a little Money go a great way; ſo that in the Opinion of the Vulgar, none paſs for more Able than they, yet when it comes to the Point, every thing lies on their hands undone. Theſe complain of Fortune, calling her Blind, Senſeleſs, and Brutiſh; becauſe Matters which they project and Execute with great Diſcretion, ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:53763:191"/>
not to ripen, to any good Effect. But if Fortune were able to plead for her ſelf, ſhe would tell them; You your ſelves are Blind, Senſeleſs, and Brutiſh, who being indiſcreet, eſteem your ſelves Wiſe; and in the uſe of undue Means, promiſe your ſelves good ſucceſſes. This ſort of Men have a difference of Imagination that gives a Gloſs and Paint to their Words and Reaſons, making them ſeem to be what they are not.</p>
               <p>Whence I conclude, that the General, who has the Wit requiſite for the Art-Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and does duly forecaſt what he is to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, will be fortunate and happy; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be in vain to think he ſhall ever gain a Victory, unleſs God fight for him, as he did for the <hi>Iſraelite</hi>-Armies: And yet for all that they choſe the Wiſeſt and Skilfulleſt Commanders they had, for it is not reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to leave all to God, nor for Man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide too-much in his own Wit and Ability; it is better to joyn both together, for there is no other Fortune ſave God and our own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.</p>
               <p>He that invented the Game of Cheſs, left a Model of the Military-Art, repreſenting therein all the Steps and Contingences of War, without omitting any. And in like manner as in this play, Fortune has no ſhare, nor ought the Winner to be call'd fortunate, nor the Loſer unfortunate; ſo the Captain who is the Vanquiſher, ſhould be call'd Wiſe,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:53763:192"/>
and the Vanquiſh'd Ignorant; and not the one Fortunate, or the other Unfortunate. The firſt Order in the Game was, that in mating the King, the Game is won; to ſhow us, that all the ſtrength of an Army lay in the good Head of the Leader, or General. And to demonſtrate, that there are allotted as many Men to one, as the other; to the end whoever is the Loſer, may be aſſured, he wanted Skill rather than Fortune. Which yet appears more plain, if we conſider that a good Gameſter may give half the Men to a worſe Gameſter, and yet for all that get the Game. Which is what <hi>Vegetius</hi> has noted, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. III. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>That it often happens, that the Few and the Weaker, Vanquiſh the Many and the Stronger, if led on by a General well skilled in Ambuſhes and Stratagems.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another Order is, that the Pawns are not to move backwards, to adviſe the General duly to forecaſt all Chances before he ſends forth his Soldiers to the Service; for if they miſcarry, 'tis better to be cut off upon the Spot, than to turn Tayl: becauſe the Soldier is not to know when Time is to Fly or Fight, ſave by Direction of his Captain; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as long as he lives, he is to keep his Poſt under pain of Diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Another Rule is, that the Pawn which has made ſeven Draughts without being taken, is made a Queen, and may make any Draught at pleaſure, and takes place next the King, as
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53763:192"/>
one ſet at Liberty, and made Noble. From which we are to underſtand, that it highly imports in War, in order to make the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Valiant, to proclaim Donatives, free Camps, and Preferments due to them that ſignalize themſelves; eſpecially if the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and Honour are to deſcend to their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity; for then they will behave themſelves with greater Courage and Gallantry. And ſo ſays <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that a Man values more the Greatneſs of his Family than of himſelf. This <hi>Saul</hi> well perceived, when he cauſed it to be Proclaimed in his Army, what ſhould be done to the Man that kill'd <hi>Goliah,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">I Kings xvii.</note> 
                  <hi>That the King ſhould enrich him with great Riches, and give him his Daughter; and make his Fathers Houſe free in Iſrael.</hi> Agreeable to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, there is a Law in <hi>Spain,</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, that every Soldier, who for his good Services deſerved to receive Five Hundred Shillings in Pay, (which was the greateſt Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend allowed in War) ſhould himſelf and his Poſterity be ever Tax-free.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Moors</hi> (as they are great players at Cheſs) have in their Pay ſeven degrees, in imitation of the ſeven draughts the Pawn makes to be a Queen; and ſo they advance the Pay from one to two, from two to three, up to ſeven, in proportion to the ſeveral Steps made by the Soldier in the Field. And if he proves ſo gallant to merit ſeven pays, they are given him; which gives occaſion to their
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:53763:193"/>
being called <hi>Septenarios,</hi> Septenary's or <hi>Mata-Siete,</hi> ſeven times Maters; theſe enjoy as great Privileges and Immunities, as Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men do in <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this is very clear in Natural Philoſophy; for there is no Faculty of all thoſe that govern Man, which will willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Work, unleſs there be ſome Advantage to move it. Which <note n="*" place="margin">IV Sect. Prob. xvi.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves in the Generative Power; and the ſame reaſon holds as much in the reſt. The Object of the Iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Faculty, (as we have above ſpecified) is Honour and Advantage, which failing, fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Courage and Bravery. From all which may be gathered, the importance of making the Pawn a Queen, which has made ſeven Moves without being taken; for how many Noble Men ſoever there are, or have been in the World, have ſprung, and will ſpring from Pawns, and private Men; who by their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage have done ſuch Exploits, as they have merited for themſelves and their Poſterity, the Titles of Gentlemen, Knights, Lords, Earls, Marquiſes, Dukes, and Kings. It is true, that there are ſome ſo Unthinking and Inconſiderate, as they will not allow that their Nobility had a beginning, but that the ſame was Eternal, and fixt in their Blood, not by the particular favour of any King, but as the Creation of a Supernatural and Divine Grace.</p>

No my Lord, anſwered the Doctor. See it then, reply'd the Prince; for it is a very fine one; and where I have been informed they beſt learn the Sciences. It is true, that for a ſingle and particular Colledge, ſaid the Doctor, it is in great Eſteem, and ſhould be in effect, no leſs than your Highneſs ſpeaks it. Where did you Study? ſays the Prince; At <hi>Salamanca,</hi> my Lord, anſwered the Doctor. And did you proceed Doctor too in <hi>Salamanca?</hi> ſaid the Prince. No my Lord, replied the Doctor. I think it was ill done, added the Prince, to Study in one Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, and take your Degrees in another. Your Highneſs may pleaſe to know, replied the Doctor, that the Charges of taking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees at <hi>Salamanca</hi> are Extraordinary; which is the reaſon that we poor Men decline it, and chooſe rather another Univerſity, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſible, that Learning and Abilities are
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53763:194"/>
not entailed on Degrees, but on Study, and taking pains; tho' my Parents were not ſo Poor, but that if they pleaſed, they might have defrayed the Charge of taking my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees at <hi>Salamanca</hi>; but your Highneſs is very ſenſible, that the Doctors of the Univerſity enjoy the ſame Privileges as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have; and to us that are already ſo by Nature, this exemption would do harm, or at leaſt to our Poſterity. Which King of all my Predeceſſors (ſays the Prince) enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled your Family? None, anſwered the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; for your Highneſs may pleaſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that there are two ſorts of Gentlemen of <hi>Spain,</hi> one by Blood, the other by Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege: They that are by Blood, as I am, take not their Nobility from the hand of any King, as thoſe by Priviledge do. This is hard for me to conceive, ſaid the Prince, and you would oblige me to explain it in clearer Terms; for if my Royal Blood (reckoning from my ſelf to my Father, from him to my Grandfather, and ſo on in the Line to the reſt in order) at laſt terminate in <hi>Pelagio,</hi> who only upon the Death of King <hi>Roderigo</hi> was made King, and not before. If we reckon after this manner your Pedigree, ſhould we not come in the end to one that was no Gentleman. This Diſcourſe is not to be denied, reply'd the Doctor; for all things here muſt have a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. I ask you then (added the Prince) whence he had his Nobility, that laid the
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:53763:194"/>
foundation of yours? He could not Enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe himſelf, nor Exempt himſelf from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Taxes, which your Predeceſſors to this day have paid the King; for that would be a ſort of Robbery to enrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the expence of the Royal Revenues:<note rend="inter">Doctor <hi>Suarez</hi> was in the right when he ſaid, <hi>True Nobility,</hi> becauſe much of it ſince in <hi>Spain</hi> has been obtained by the Skill and Addreſs of him they call a Gentleman; of whom it may be very truly ſaid, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Nobility from the hands of Witneſſes, and of Court-Officers, rather than from the King.</note> Nor does it ſtand with reaſon, that thoſe that are Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by Blood, ſhould have ſo bad an Original as this; it follows then, it was the King that enfranchiſed them, and did them the favour to ennoble them, or elſe you ought to tell me how they could take their Nobility. Your Highneſs concludes excellently well, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Doctor) for it is certain, there is no true Nobility, which was not of ſome King's Grant; but we call thoſe Noble by Blood, that have been Noble time out of Mind; and of whom we cannot tell, nor prove by Writing when they began to be ſo, nor from what King they took that Favour. And this Obſcurity goes for more Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than diſtinctly to know the firſt Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>The Common-wealth alſo makes Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; for when there is one of great Valour, of extraordinary Virtue, and Rich, he is no longer rated as a Citizen, nor ranked in the ſame Tax-Roll, as if that Treatment would not be reſpect enough; becauſe ſuch a Man
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53763:195"/>
deſerves to live enfranchiſed, and not to be treated as an ordinary Man. This Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſſing from them to the Children, and Grand Children, became Nobility, and ſets up for a Title, without a King. Theſe are not of thoſe Gentlemen of whom we have ſpoke of five hundred Shillings Pay, but when there is no proof of the contrary, go for ſuch.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Spaniard</hi> who invented the Name of <hi>Hijodalgo,</hi> or Gentleman, gave us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Doctrine we have delivered; for according to his Opinion, Men have two ſorts of Birth; one Natural, in which all are equal; and the other Spiritual. When a Man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms ſome Heroic Action, or gives proof of any admirable Virtue, or extraordinary Work, then is he New Born, and procures for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf new Parents, and loſes that Being which he had before. Yeſterday he was called the Son of <hi>Peter,</hi> and Nephew of <hi>Sancho,</hi> to day he is called the Son of his own Actions, whence aroſe this Caſtellan Proverb, <hi>Cada uno es hijo de ſus obras.</hi> Every one is the Son of his own Actions: And whereas Holy Writ terms good and virtuous things, <hi>Some thing</hi>; (as much as to ſay <hi>algo</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>) and Vices and Sins, <hi>nothing.</hi> This <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the word <hi>Hijodalgo,</hi> is made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which is as much as to ſay, a Perſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from one that has done ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary thing; for which he merited ſome Recompence from the King, or Common-Wealth,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:53763:195"/>
together with all his Poſterity for ever.</p>
               <p>The Law of the <note n="*" place="margin">L. 2. p. 2. tit. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Partita</hi> ſays, this word <hi>Hijo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalgo</hi> ſignifies the Son of Goods; but if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſame of Temporal Goods, it is not with Reaſon; for there are a Number of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Poor; and as many Rich, that are not Gentlemen: But if by the Son of Goods, we mean good Qualities; (which we call Virtues) it will have the ſame ſignification we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. The ſecond Birth that Men ought to have beſides the Natural, we have a clear In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the Sacred Scriptures, where our Lord blames <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that being a Doctor of the Law, he knew not that it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that a Man ſhould be <hi>born again,</hi> to have a better Being, and more Honorable Parents than his Natural. For which reaſon, all the time a Man performs no Heroic Actions, he is called in this ſenſe <hi>Hijo de nada,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the Son of nothing</hi>; tho' from his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors he be call'd <hi>Hijodalgo,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the Son of ſome thing,</hi> or a Gentleman. To this purpoſe I will recount here a ſhort Diſcourſe between a Captain of great Honour, and a Cavalier, who ſtood much upon his Gentility: By which may be ſeen in what true Honour conſiſts; and every Man may perceive what is meant by being Born again. The Captain being in Company with a knot of Cavaliers, and ſpeaking of the Largeſſes and Liberties which Soldiers enjoy in <hi>Italy,</hi> in a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:53763:196"/>
which one of them made him, he ſaid to him, <hi>you,</hi> in reſpect of the Meanneſs of his Birth, being a Native of that Country, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Parents of a ſlender Fortune, and Born in a Village of a few Houſes. The Captain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted at that term, anſwered, ſaying, <hi>Seno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r,</hi> your Signory may know that the Soldiers who enjoy ſo great Liberty in <hi>Italy,</hi> cannot find themſelves ſo well in <hi>Spain,</hi> becauſe of the many Laws in this Country againſt thoſe that draw their Swords. The other Gentlemen obſerving him to uſe this Word <hi>Signo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ria,</hi> could not forbear laughing. Upon which the Gentleman bluſhing, beſpoke them after this manner: Be it known to you Gentlemen, that in <hi>Italy, Signo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ria,</hi> is as much as to ſay in <hi>Spain, Merced,</hi> (Your Worſhip) and the Captain being uſed to the Manner and Cuſtom of his Country, he uſes this Term, <hi>Signoria,</hi> where he ſhould do that of <hi>Merced.</hi> To which the Captain replied, Surely <hi>Seno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r,</hi> you do not take me to be ſo ignorant, but that I know when I am in <hi>Italy</hi> how to apply my ſelf to the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue, and to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> when I am in <hi>Spain:</hi> But he that in <hi>Spain</hi> in Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gives me the <hi>Vos, You,</hi> muſt at leaſt have a <hi>Signo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ria</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi>; tho' it goes againſt the Grain. The Gentleman being almoſt Non-pluſt, anſwered him, What then <hi>Seno<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> Are you not Native of ſuch a Place, and the Son of ſuch an one, and don't you know alſo who I am, and who my Anceſtors were?
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:53763:196"/>
                  <hi>Signor</hi> anſwered the Captain, I know right well that your <hi>Signiory</hi> is a good <hi>Cavallero,</hi> and ſuch have been your Anceſtors, yet I and my Right Hand (which I now acknowledge for my Father) are better Gentlemen than you and all your Family.</p>
               <p>This Captain alluded to the ſecond Birth Men have, when he ſaid, <hi>I and my Right Hand which I now acknowledge for my Father.</hi> And not without Reaſon, For with his Right Hand, and with his Sword, he had performed ſuch Actions as the worth of his Perſon might be equal to the Nobility of that Cavallero.</p>
               <p>For the moſt part (ſays <note n="*" place="margin">In Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi>) the Law and Nature are contrary, for ſometimes a Man comes out of Nature's hands with a Mind very Wiſe, Excellent, Generous, and Frank, and with a Wit made to Command the whole World, and becauſe his Lot was to be born in the Houſe of <hi>Amicla,</hi> (which was a very poor Cottage) he remained by Law deprived of the Honour and Liberty wherein Nature had placed him. On the contrary, we ſee others, whoſe Wit and Manners ſhew plainly they were deſtin'd to be Slaves and Vaſſals, yet becauſe they are born of Illuſtrious Houſes, the Law ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points them for our Maſters. But one thing hath been noted long ſince, and that well merits Conſideration; which is, that many Men more ſufficient and of greater Wit for
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53763:197"/>
Sciences and Arms, are born in Villages and in thatch'd Houſes, than in Great Cities. Nevertheleſs the Vulgar are ſo Ignorant, as to take it for an Argument of the contrary, to be Born in mean Places. Of this we have a clear Inſtance in Holy Writ, for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Aſtoniſhment at the great things <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer did, cryed out, <hi>Is it poſſible any Good ſhould come out of Nazareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return to the Wit of the Captain, of whom we treat, he ought to be furniſhed with much Underſtanding, and with the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Imagination, which is required by the Military-Art. Accordingly there is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that ſhort Conference, much Learning, from whence we may gather, in what conſiſts mens Courage, that gives them Reputation in the Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>I am of Opinion that a Man ought to have ſix things, that he may be ſaid to be Honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and if he want any one, his Being is thereby impaired. Yet all of them are not placed in the ſame degree, nor are they of equal value, or the ſame qualities.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt principal is, his Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Merit, in Prudence, Juſtice, Spirit, and Courage. 'Tis this that makes Riches and Birthright; from hence grow Titles of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. From this beginning all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the World draws its Origine. And if not, let us go to the great Houſes in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:53763:197"/>
and we ſhall find, that they almoſt all ſprung from private Men, who by their Perſonal Courage have acquired what their Poſterity now enjoys</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing that honors a Man (next his own Merit) is Riches, without which, we ſee no Man eſteemed in a Common-Wealth.</p>
               <p>The third is, the Nobility and Antiquity of his Anceſtors. To be well Born, and of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Blood is a Jewel of great Value; but not without a great Defect, for of it ſelf alone is of ſmall Advantage, as well to the Noble, as to others, when reduced to neceſſity: for a Man can neither Eat nor Drink the ſame, nor will it Cloath, nor Shoe him, nor can he Give, or Pawn, or make Sale of it, but it makes him live as a dying Man, in depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him of the Means he might otherwiſe procure to ſupply his Neceſſities: But joyned with Riches, no point of Honour is it's Equal. Some reſemble Nobility to a Cypher in Arithmetic, which is nothing of it ſelf alone, but added to any Number, encreaſes it.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing that makes a Man eſteemed, is to have ſome Poſt or honourable Office, as on the contrary, there is nothing that Debaſes a Man ſo much, as to get his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood by any Mechanic-Trade.</p>
               <p>The fifth thing that renders a Man Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable is to have a good Sir name, that is acceptable, and that ſounds well in the Ears,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:53763:198"/>
and not to be call'd by ridiculous Names, as I have known ſome. We read in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory of <hi>Spain,</hi> that two Ambaſſadors being arrived from <hi>France,</hi> to demand of King <hi>Alfonſus</hi> the <hi>Ninth,</hi> one of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Marriage, for King <hi>Philip</hi> their Maſter, (one was very handſom and call'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca,</hi> and the other not ſo agreeable, whoſe Name was <hi>Blanca,</hi>) The two Ladies being both together in the Ambaſſadors Preſence, every one looked that they would chuſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raca,</hi> becauſe ſhe was the Elder, handſomer, and richer dreſt; but the Ambaſſadors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring their Names, Stumbled at the Name of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rraca,</hi> and cloſe <hi>Blanca,</hi> ſaying that Name would be more welcome in <hi>France</hi> than the other.</p>
               <p>The ſixth thing that honours a Man, is the Ornaments of his Perſon, to go well dreſs'd, and have a good train of Followers.</p>
               <p>The good Deſcent of the Nobility of <hi>Spain,</hi> is, from ſuch, as by their Perſonal Courage, and many Exploits atchiev'd, received in the War, the Pay of five hundred Shillings: The Original whereof our Modern Writers have not been able to make out, for if they have not matter Written, or Expres'd by others, no one of them has any Invention of his own to ſupply it. The difference <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. de memor. &amp; reminiſc.</note> 
                  <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> puts between Memory and Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, is, that if the Memory has loſt any thing it knew before, there is no way to
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:53763:198"/>
retrieve it without learning it a-new; but the Remembrance has this peculiar quality, that if it happens to loſe any thing, by the little which remains in ruminating ſome time, at length it recovers what it had forgot. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the Ordinance that ſpoke in favour of good Soldiers, is loſt, both out of the Books and Memory of Men: But theſe words remain in the Nature of Reliques <note n="*" rend="inter">A Gentleman is ſo call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from having five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Shillings of Pay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom in <hi>Spain</hi> and being of a known Houſe.</note> 
                  <hi>Hijodalgo de devengar quinientos ſueldos Segun fuero de</hi> Eſpana, y <hi>de ſolar conocido.</hi> From which, by Arguing, and Diſcourſe, it is eaſy to find out their Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Antony de Lebrixa</hi> ſeeking the ſignification of this Verb <hi>Vindico,</hi> ſaid that it was to Challenge ſomething, as if he had ſaid to lay Claim to Pay, or any other Dues belonging; or (according to the newer Mode of Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to claim Penſions and Salaries from the King. And it is ſo cuſtomary in the old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillan</hi> ſpeech to ſay, <hi>Fulano bien ha devengado ſu trabajo,</hi> ſuch a one is well appaied for his Pains, (when he is well paid) that amongſt the civiler ſort, there is no manner of ſpeech more Currant. From thence the Origin of this Word <hi>Vengar</hi> is fetched, when any one finds a Recompence for the Injury another does him: for Injury Metaphorically is call'd a Debt. If this be ſuppoſed, theſe words, <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lano es Hijodalgo de devengar quinientos ſueldos,</hi>
                  <pb n="356" facs="tcp:53763:199"/>
import nothing elſe but ſuch a one is deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſo Valiant a Soldier as Merited ſo large a Pay as that of five hundred Shillings for his Services. For which, by the Cuſtom and Conſtitution of <hi>Spain, Segun fuero de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpana,</hi> he, and all his Iſſues were enfranchiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from paying any Subſidies or Impoſitions to the King. As for theſe words <hi>Solar Cono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cido,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>a known Houſe,</hi> it has no more in it than this, that when a Soldier was regiſtred in the Roll of thoſe that had five hundred Shillings Salary, they entred in the Kings Books the Name of the Soldier, the place of his Birth or Abode, who were his Parents and Progenitors, for the more certainty to him, that received the Penſion; as appears to this day in the Book of <hi>Bezerro</hi> at <hi>Simanca,</hi> wherein are to be found the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degrees of almoſt all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Nobility.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> made uſe of the ſame Diligence when <hi>David</hi> ſlew <hi>Goliah,</hi> for he forthwith Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Abner,</hi> one of his Captains, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <note n="*" place="margin">I Kings XVIII.</note> 
                  <hi>Of what Race this Young Man was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended,</hi> that is to ſay, who were his Parents and Progenitors, and from what Houſe in <hi>Iſrael</hi> he deſcended. Antiently <hi>Solar</hi> denoted as well the Houſe of a Peaſant, as of a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>But after having made this Digreſſion, it is now time to return to our firſt Deſign and to enquire, whence it comes, that in the Game of Cheſs, (ſince that as we have ſaid
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:53763:199"/>
is a Counterfeit of War) they are more angry at Loſing than at any other Game, where they have more Intereſt, for in this they play not deep, for Mony? and how it chances, that ſtanders-by ſee more Draughts than the Gameſters, tho' they know the Game leſs. And what ſeems yet ſtranger, is, that there are ſome Gameſters who play better Faſting, and ſome better after Meat.</p>
               <p>The firſt Doubt holds little Difficulty, for we have already ſaid, that Fortune has no ſhare in War, nor in the Game of Cheſs, and that it is not allowed to ſay, <hi>Who would have thought it?</hi> for all is Ignorance and Careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Loſer, and Care and Manage in the Winner. And when a Man is baffled in a point of Wit, and Sufficience, and no pretence or excuſe is left him, but only his Ignorance, he cannot avoid being aſhamed, becauſe he is Reaſonable, and a friend to his Reputation, and cannot bear, that in the Works of his Power another ſhould bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Bell. Therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> demands, whence it comes that the Antients would not that there ſhould be any ſpecial Prizes for thoſe that excelled others in the Sciences; and yet ordain'd ſome for the beſt Leaper, Racer, Pitcher of the Barr, and Wreſtler? To which he Anſwers, that in Wreſtling, and other Exerciſes of the Body, there are Judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to determin the Advantages one Man has over another, that the Prize may
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:53763:200"/>
be fairly awarded to the Conqueror; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is very eaſy to Meaſure with the Eye, who Leaps moſt ground, or has better Heels in Running.</p>
               <p>But in the Sciences it is not ſo eaſy to Meaſure by the Underſtanding, who exceeds the other, for it is a very nice Speculation, and if the Judge award the Prize with Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, it is not every one can penetrate into it, becauſe the Judgment is ſecret, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the ſenſe of the Beholders.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Anſwer, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is better, which is, that Men mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not that others have the Advantage over them in throwing the Barr, Wreſtling, Racing, and Leaping, becauſe theſe are Gifts, in which Brute-beaſts bear the Prize from us; but that which goes much againſt the grain, is, to ſee another thought Wiſer, and more knowing than our ſelves; accordingly we hate the Judges, and Endeavour to be reveng'd on them, from an Opinion that they give it againſt us out of meer Malice. To avoid then theſe Inconveniencies, by their good Wills, none would have either Judges, or Prizes, for Exerciſes that regard the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable part. Whence it may be concluded, that the Univerſities do ill, in appointing Judges and Rewards, of the firſt, ſecond, and third place, in degrees in licenſing thoſe that prove beſt in Examinations. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that there happen every day the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53763:200"/>
mentioned by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> it ſeems no leſs againſt the Doctrin of the Goſpel, that Men ſhould contend who ſhould be Chief, and that this is true, we ſee plainly, in that the Diſciples of our Redeemer <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> travelling one day together, treated among themſelves who ſhould be the greateſt? And being arrived at the Inn, their Maſter askt them what Diſcourſe they had by the Way; and they, as dull as they were, ſoon under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the Queſtion ill became them: And ſo the Text ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">Mark ix.</note> 
                  <hi>that they held their peace</hi>; but as nothing is hid from God, he ſpoke to them after this manner: <hi>If any man deſire to be Firſt, the ſame ſhall be Laſt of all; and Servant of all.</hi> The <hi>Phariſees</hi> were hated by our Lord, becauſe <note n="†" place="margin">Matth. ix.</note> 
                  <hi>they affected the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Seats at Table, and the Chief Places in the Synagogues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The principal Reaſon whereon they rely who beſtow Degrees after this manner, is, that when Scholars are ſenſible that each of them ſhall be Rewarded, according to the Trial they ſhall give of themſelves, they will ſcarce ſpare time from their Study, to Sleep, or Eat. Which would ceaſe, were there no Recompence for him that takes Pains, or Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement for him that miſ-ſpends his time in Lazineſs and Loytering. But this is a ſlender reaſon, and a Colour; for it preſuppoſes a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Falſhood, which is, that Science is attained by poring much on Books, by being
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:53763:201"/>
taught by the beſt Maſters, and never miſſing a Leſſon: But they obſerve not, that if the Scholar has not Wit, and a Genius requiſite to the Science he applies to, it is in vain he beats his Brains Day and Night amongſt his Books. And the miſtake is ſuch, that if theſe two differences of Wit ſo oppoſite to each other, are in Competition; one man becauſe he is very quick, without Study or ſeeing a Book, gains Learning in a moment; and the other, being dull and heavy, labours all his Life long, without attaining the leaſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And the Judges (as Men) proceed to give the firſt place to him whom Nature has qualified, and who took no pains; and the loweſt degree to him that was Born with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wit, and who ſtudied hard: As if one had become Learned by turning over Books, and the other continued Ignorant thro' his own Careleſneſs. And it fares as if a Prize were propos'd to two Runners, of whom, one had ſound and nimble Heels, and the other limped with one Leg. If the Univerſities admitted to the Study of the Sciences none but ſuch as have proper Genius's for them; and if all the Students were equal, it would be very well done to Eſtabliſh Rewards and Puniſhments; for in this caſe there would be no doubt at all, but he who was moſt Learned, had taken moſt Pains; and he that was leaſt, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with his Eaſe. To the ſecond Doubt we anſwer, that as the Eyes ſtand in need of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:53763:201"/>
clearneſs to ſee Figures and Colours, even ſo the Imagination has need of Light in the Brain to ſee the Ideas in the Memory. It is a Light which neither the Sun, nor Tapers give, but only the Vital Spirits breed in the Heart, and diſperſe throughout the Body. Beſides this, you muſt know, that Fear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the Spirits about the Heart, and ſo leaves the Brain dark, and all the other Parts of the Body chill'd. And therefore <note n="*" place="margin">Sect. 27. Prob. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> asks, <hi>Why thoſe that are afraid Stammer in their Speech, and Tremble with their Hands and Lips.</hi> To which he Anſwers, that in Fear, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat flies to the Heart, leaving all other Parts of the Body chill'd. But we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prov'd, that Cold according to <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. quod Animi c. vii.</note> 
                  <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Opinion benums all the Faculties and Powers of the Soul, and hinders them from the free Exerciſe of their Functions. This being ſo, it is eaſie to anſwer the ſecond Doubt; and it is that thoſe who play at Cheſs are in fear of loſing, becauſe it is a Game in which there is a Point of Honour; and in which, as we have ſaid, Fortune has no Part. The Vital Spirits then flying to the Heart, the Imagination is nummed with the Cold, and the Images are obſcured; and for theſe two Reaſons the Gameſter plays but very Awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. But the Lookers-on, as they run no Riſque, are in no fear of loſing thro' want of Skill, and therefore ſee many Draughts that eſcape the Gameſters; becauſe their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53763:202"/>
retains its Heat, and the Figures il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated by the Light of the Vital Spirits. True it is, that too much Light blinds the Imagination; which happens, when he that Plays is aſhamed, and out of Countenance, to ſee his Adverſary beat him. Then through very Indignation, Natural Heat increaſes, and illuminates more than it ſhould, of which the Standers-by are free, as being unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. From this ſprings an Effect very common in the World, which is, that when a Man would muſter up all his Forces, and make his Knowledge and Ability more Conſpicuous, then it is that he quits himſelf worſt of all. There are others on the contrary, who being put to it, make a great ſhow; and with this great Flouriſh know Nothing. Of all which the Reaſon is very plain; for he that has abundance of Natural Heat in his Head, if he be ſet for a Task an Exerciſe; for inſtance, the Diſputation he is to get in twenty four hours time (as is done in <hi>Spain</hi> to all thoſe who Diſpute for a Vacant Place) a part of the Exceſs of Natural Heat retires to his Heart; ſo that the Brain remains Temperate. In this Diſpoſition (as we ſhall prove in the following Chapter) many things offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a Man to ſay. But he that is very knowing, and of a good Underſtanding, when he is hard put to it through Fear, retains not the Natural Heat in his Head; ſo that for want of Light he has nothing in his Memory left to ſay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:53763:202"/>If this were duly conſidered by them that Cenſure the Actions of Generals of Armies, blaming their Steps, and the Orders they give in their Camp, they would ſee what difference there is between looking on a Fight out of a Window, and breaking a Launce before it, and the Apprehenſion of the Loſs of an Army upon the Spot.</p>
               <p>No leſs inconvenience, Fear in the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans produces in Curing; for his Practice (as we have proved elſewhere) belongs to the Imagination; which is prejudiced by Cold more than any other Power; in as much as it's Operation conſiſts altogether in Heat. And ſo we ſee by experience, that the Phyſitians Cure the Common People better than Princes and great Lords.</p>
               <p>A Lawyer ask't me one day (knowing well that I treated of Invention) why in the Cauſe he was well feed, Law Caſes, and Points of Law, come readily into his Thoughts, but where the Cauſe was ſtarved, it ſeemed that all his Law was loſt? To which I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that matters of Intereſt belonged to the iraſcible Faculty which reſides in the Heart, and which if it be not ſatisfied, does not ſo chearfully furniſh Vital Spirits, by whoſe Light the Figures that are in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory may appear; but when the ſame is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, it liberally affords that Natural Heat by which the Rational Soul has ſufficient clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to read all that is Written in the Head.
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:53763:203"/>
This defect attends Men of great Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who are intereſſed and ſelfiſh, and in ſuch may be diſcerned that Property of the Lawyer. But when all is well-weighed, it ſeems no leſs than an Act of Juſtice, that he be well Rewarded who labours in another Man's Vineyard. The ſame reaſon holds for Phyſitians, who being well gratified, want no Store of Medicines; otherwiſe their Art is ſtarved, as well as that of the Lawyer.</p>
               <p>But here a matter of great Importance is to be noted, namely, that the good Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phyſitian in the Critical Minute hits upon what is proper to be done; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on taking more time and further conſideration, there occur to his mind a thouſand Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies that hold him in ſuſpence ſo long, till the occaſion for the Remedy is ſlipt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it never adviſable to beſpeak a good Phyſitian to conſider well what he is to do, but rather to preſcribe what comes firſt to hand. For we have already prov'd, that too nice Speculation raiſes the Natural Heat to a degree ſo great, that it confounds the Imagination. But the Phyſitian, who has it remiſs, will not do ill to uſe more Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe the Heat riſing to the Brain, may come to reach the Pitch which this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er needs.</p>
               <p>To the third Doubt the Anſwer is very clear, inaſmuch as the Difference of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination with which they play at Cheſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:53763:203"/>
a Certain Point of Heat to diſcover the Draughts; and he that plays well Faſting hath this degree of Heat which is requiſite; but by the heat of the Meat, it riſes a point higher than it ſhould, and ſo he comes to play worſe. It fares quite contrary with thoſe that play well after Meals; for the Heat ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing together with the Meat and Wine, reaches the Pitch they wanted when they were Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therefore it is fit to correct a place in <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de Natura.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> where he ſays, that it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly done of Nature, to ſeparate the Liver from the Brain, leſt the Meat with its Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, ſhould diſorder the Speculations of the Rational Soul. If he intends the Operations belonging to the Underſtanding, he ſays very well; but this has no place in any difference of the Imagination. Which is clearly ſeen by Experience in Feaſts and Entertainments, where about mid-dinner the Gueſts are flip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant with Repartees, merry Jeſts and Alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who at the beginning were tyed by the Teeth, and at the end of the Feaſt have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a wiſe word; becauſe the Heat exceeds the degree required by the Imagination. Such as need to Eat and Drink a little to raiſe their Imagination, are Melancholic by Aduſtion, their Brain being like unſlack'd Lime, which taken into the Hand, is cold and dry to the Touch; but if any Liquor be caſt on it, the Heat that comes from it is not to be endured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:53763:204"/>We muſt alſo correct that Law of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians,</hi> remembered by <note n="*" place="margin">II de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> which forbad their Captains to drink Wine during the Campaign, and the Governors of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces during the year of their Magiſtracy. For tho' <hi>Plato</hi> held the ſame for a very juſt Law and never makes an end of commending it; yet ought it not to be received without Diſtinction. The Work of Judging, as we ſaid elſewhere, belongs to the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that that Power abhors Heat, and therefore is much incommoded by Wine. But to govern a Common-Wealth (which is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct thing from taking in hand a Proceſs, and giving ſentence thereon) belongs to the Imagination, which requires Heat. And the Governour not arriving to the Point which is requiſite, may well drink a little Wine to attain it. The ſame is to be underſtood of a General of an Army, whoſe Counſel depends alſo on the Imagination. And if the Natural Heat be by any hot thing to be raiſed, nought can better do it than Wine: But it ought to be taken moderately, becauſe there is no Nouriſhment that gives or takes away Man's Wit, ſo much as this Liquor. So that it is fit the General ſhould know the difference of his Imagination, whether it be of thoſe that need Meat and Drink to ſupply the Heat that is wanting, or of thoſe that ſhould keep Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for on this the Skill of managing his Affairs well or ill depends.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI. To what difference of Ability the Office of a King belongs, and what Marks he ought to have that has this Kind of Wit.</head>
               <p>WHen <hi>Solomon</hi> was Elected King and Head of ſo great and numerous a People as <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Text ſays,<note place="margin">III Kings 3.</note> that for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning and ruling them he begg'd Wiſdom from above, and nothing more. This Requeſt was ſo acceptable to God, that to Reward him for having ſo well hit the Mark, he made him the Wiſeſt Prince in the World; and not contented with this, he gave him great Riches and Honour; as the fair Returns of ſo great a Petition. Whence is plainly gathered, that the greateſt Prudence and Wiſdom, of which Man is capable, is, that whereon is founded, and wherein conſiſts the Office of a King; which is ſo true, that there is no need to loſe time to prove it. Only it is convenient to ſhew to what difference of Wit the Art of a King, and of ſuch an one as the Common-Wealth ſtands in need of, belongs, and to trace the Marks whereby he may be known, that is furniſhed with ſuch a Wit and Ability. 'Tis alſo moſt certain, that as the Office of a King goes beyond all other Arts in the World, even ſo it requires the higheſt difference of
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:53763:205"/>
Wit that Nature can produce. What this difference of Wit is, we have not as yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, as having been taken up in allotting to ſeveral Arts their Differences and Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But ſeeing we are now come to it, you may know, that of nine Temperaments found amongſt Men, there is but one (as <hi>Galen</hi> affirms) that makes a perſon as Wiſe as Nature can her ſelf: In which Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the firſt qualities are ſo juſtly balanced, and ſo well proportioned, that neither the Heat exceeds the Cold, nor the Moiſt the Dry, but all is found Equal and Harmonious, as if really they were not Contraries, nor had any natural Oppoſition: Out of which ariſes an Inſtrument ſo well fitted and turned for the Operations of the Rational Soul; that the Man is provided with a perfect Memory for things paſt, and a ſtrong Imagination to ſee what is to come, and a great Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Diſtinguiſh, Infer, Argue, Judge, and make Choice. Of the other differences of Wit, (by us recounted) not one is entirely perfect; for if a Man has a good Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, (becauſe of much dryneſs) he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn the Sciences belonging to the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Memory; and if he be furniſhed with an Excellent Imagination, (thro' much Heat) he will be diſabled for the Sciences re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Underſtanding and Memory; and if he has a happy Memory, (becauſe of much moiſture) we have already made it
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:53763:205"/>
appear, how great Memories are incapable of all the Sciences. Only this difference of Wit we are now in ſearch of, is that which anſwers all the Arts in Proportion.</p>
               <p>How inconvenient it is for one Science not to be able to unite the reſt, <hi>Plato</hi> notes, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the perfection of each in particular depends on the Notice and Knowledge of them all in general. There is no ſort of Knowledge at what diſtance ſoever it may be from an other, that ſerves not to render it more perfect when it is fully known. But what ſhall we do if upon diligent ſearch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this difference of Wit there is but one to be found in <hi>Spain?</hi> Which makes me of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid excellently well, that out of <hi>Greece,</hi> Nature not ſo much as in a Dream makes a Man Temperate, or with a Wit requiſite for all the Sciences. And the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">Lib II. de Sanit. tuen.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> gives the reaſon of it, ſaying, that <hi>Greece</hi> is the moſt temperate Country in the World, where the Heat of the Air exceeds not the Cold, nor the Moiſt the Dry. Which Temperament makes the Men very Wiſe, and capable of all the Sciences, as may be proved, conſidering the great number of illuſtrious Perſons that appeared there; <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Hippocrates, Galen, Theophraſtus, Demoſthenes, Homer, Thales</hi> the Mileſian, <hi>Diogenes</hi> the Cynic, <hi>Solon,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite other wiſe Men, of whom the Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans make mention, and whoſe works we
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:53763:206"/>
find repleniſhed with all Sciences. Not as the Writers of other Countries; who if they treat of Phyſic, or any Science, it is a wonder if they make uſe of any other ſort of Science in their Aid or Favour. All of them are beggarly, unadorned, as wanting a Wit capable of all the Arts.</p>
               <p>But what is moſt ſurpriſing in <hi>Greece,</hi> is, that notwithſtanding Women's Wit is ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to Learning, (as we ſhall hereafter prove;) there have been ſo many <hi>Grecian</hi> Ladies ſo illuſtrious in the Sciences that they have come in competition with the moſt rational Men; even ſo we read of <hi>Leontia</hi> (a very learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Woman) who writ againſt <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> the greateſt Philoſopher of his time, taking notice of ſeveral errors of his in Philoſophy. And if we reflect on all other Countries in the World, we ſhall hardly find any Wit ariſe ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable there. The reaſon whereof is, they live in Intemperate places, which makes the Men dull, of a ſlow Wit, and ill Diſpoſitions. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> asks, <note n="*" place="margin">XIV. Sect. Prob. I.</note> 
                  <hi>Whence it comes, that the Inhabitants of over-Hot or over-Cold Countries are for the moſt part fierce in Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Conditions?</hi> To which Problem he Anſwers very well, ſaying, that the good Temperament, not only gives the good Grace of the Body, but alſo Conduces to the Wit and Ability: and in like manner as the Exceſſes of Heat and Cold hinder Nature from producing Men fair and well figured,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53763:206"/>
even ſo they renvers the harmony of the Soul, and blunt a Mans Wit. Of this the <hi>Greeks</hi> were well aware, who call'd all other Nations in the World Barbarians, in regard of their Incapacity and ſlender Knowledge. And ſo we ſee of ſo many as are Born and Study out of <hi>Greece,</hi> if they are Philoſophers, not one of them Approaches near to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi>; if Phyſitians, to <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> or <hi>Galen</hi>; if Orators, to <hi>Demoſthenes</hi>; if Poets, to <hi>Homer</hi>; and ſo in the other Arts and Sciences, the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ever held the firſt Rank, without any contradiction. At leaſt <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>'s Problem may be very well verified in the <hi>Greeks,</hi> becauſe in reality they are the goodlieſt Men in the World, and of the moſt excellent Wit, were it not for their living in Diſgrace and Servitude, being oppreſes'd by Arms, and ill treated by coming under the <hi>Turks</hi>; who hath baniſhed all Learning from among them, driving the Univerſity of <hi>Athens</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> where it remains to this day. And ſo for want of cultivating, theſe excellent Wits, (whereof we ſpoke,) come to be loſt.</p>
               <p>In other Countries out of <hi>Greece,</hi> though Schools and Exerciſes of Learning are not wanting, yet no eminent Man has appeared among them. The Phyſitian thinks he has gone far enough if he knows what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> have delivered, and the Natural Philoſopher thinks there is no more Knowledg but what is had from Underſtanding <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:53763:207"/>Notwithſtanding this, it is no general Rule that all who are born in <hi>Greece</hi> muſt of neceſſity be Wiſe, and well tempered, and the reſt diſtempered and Fools. For the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">In Orat. ſuaſor.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> reports of <hi>Anacharſis,</hi> who was a <hi>Scythian,</hi> that he appeared of an admirable Wit among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> (tho' he was a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barian) with whom a Philoſopher that was a Native of <hi>Athens,</hi> contending, ſaid, Go thou Barbarian; To which <hi>Anacharſis</hi> anſwered, <hi>My Country is a diſgrace to me, and thou art a diſgrace to thy Country.</hi> From intemperate <hi>Scythia</hi> the Country of ſo many Fools, I alone am come Wiſe, and thou who wert born at <hi>Athens</hi> (the Nurſery of Wit and Knowledge) wer't never other than an Aſs<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> So that we need not deſpair of meeting this good Temperament, nor reckon it impoſſible to find it out of <hi>Greece,</hi> particularly in <hi>Spain</hi>; (which is not ſo Intemperate a Country:) for by the ſame Reaſon that I have found one of theſe there; there may be many more that never came to Knowledge, and which I have not been able to find out. It may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient then to ſhew the Signs, by which a well tempered Man is known, to the end where ſuch a one is, he may not be Hidden.</p>
               <p>Many Signs have the Phyſitians ſet down to diſcover this difference of Wit, but the principal, and thoſe that beſt give Notice of it are the following. The firſt, in the words of <note n="*" place="margin">Lib artis med. <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53763:207"/>
between fair and red, which proceeding from Age to Age comes to ſhow more Golden. And the reaſon of it is clear, for the Material Cauſe of Hair, is as Phyſitians hold, a groſs vapour, riſing from the digeſtion performed by the Brain at the inſtant of it's Nouriſhment. For ſuch as this Member is ſuch is the colour of the Excrements; if there enter much Flegm in the compoſition of the Brain, the Hair will be fair; if much Choler, yellow as Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron; but when theſe two Humors are found equally mixt, the Brain remains temperate, in hot, cold, moiſt, and dry; and the Hair brown, and participating or two Extreams. It is true, that <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. de aere, locis, &amp; aquis.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that, that colour in thoſe who live in the North, (as the <hi>Engliſh, Flemmings,</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi>) iſſues from a Whiteneſs dryed with over much Cold, and not from the Reaſon we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned: So that this ſign is very deceitful.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Mark, that he ought to have who has this difference of Wit, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de opt. corp. conſt. c ix. &amp; Lib. I. de ſan. tuen.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, is, to be well-ſhaped, airy, agreeable, and pleaſant, ſo as the Sight takes pleaſure in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding him, as a Figure of rare Perfection. And the Reaſon of it is clear, for if Nature be ſtrong, and have a Seed well tempered, ſhe duly makes (of all things capable) the Beſt and moſt Accompliſhed in the Kind: but being ſomewhat diſabled, ſhe employs moſt of her Labour in the formation of the Brain, becauſe that is the chief reſidence of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:53763:208"/>
Soul, rather than any other part of the Body. Accordingly we ſee many Men vaſt and deformed, but yet of excellent Wits.</p>
               <p>The bulk of Body which a Temperate Man ought to have, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib de opt. corp. conſt. c. iv.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, is not a thing preciſely determined by Nature, becauſe he may be tall, ſhort, or of a middle Stature, (in proportion to the quantity of temperate Seed, he had in time of his formation.) But for what regards the Wit, the Middle-ſize is bettet amongſt Temperate Men than over-tall or ſhort: And if it ſhould incline to either Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, it is better too Short, than Tall, for Bones and Fleſh as we have proved before, from the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> much incommode the Wit. Agreeable here unto the natural Philoſophers are wont to ask. <note n="*" place="margin">Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Aph. lib. i. prob. xxv.</note> 
                  <hi>Why thoſe of little Stature are Wiſer for the moſt part than thoſe of a tall Stature?</hi> And for proof hereof, they cite <hi>Homer,</hi> whoſe ſays <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> was very Wiſe, and of a low Stature; and on the contrary, <hi>Ajax</hi> a very Blockhead, and of a high Stature. To this Queſtion they Anſwer very ill, in ſaying that the Rational Soul being ſhut up in a little room acts with more force, according to the received ſaying, <hi>Virtue is more powerful <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited than Diſperſed:</hi> And that on the contrary, being in a large Body, and of great Dimenſions, ſhe wants power ſufficient to move, and animate the ſame, as it ought. But this is not the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof, it is rather becauſe Big-men have
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:53763:208"/>
much Moiſture in their Compoſition, which dilates the Fleſh, and makes it more plyant to receive the Augmentation, which the natural Heat procures. It fares quite contrary in little Bodies, for through their over-dryneſs,<note place="margin">Galen lib. de opt. corp. conſt. c. iv.</note> the Fleſh cannot take it's Courſe, nor the natural Heat enlarge or ſtretch it out; and therefore they remain of a low Stature. But amongſt the firſt qualities, we have prov'd before, there is none ſo prejudicial to the Operations of the Rational Soul, as much Moiſture, nor that ſo quickens the Underſtanding as Dryneſs.</p>
               <p>The third Mark by which the temperate Man may be known, is, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de ſanit. tuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that he be Virtuous, and of good Conditions; for if he be lewd, and Vitious, <note n="†" place="margin">Dial. de Natura.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, it proceeds from ſome Intemperate Quality that is in him, and that incites him to Sin; and if ſuch a one would practiſe what is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Virtue, he muſt firſt renounce his own natural Inclinations. But whoever is of an exact Temperament, ſo long as he continues in that State, ſtands in no need of any ſuch diligence; for the Inferior Powers require nothing from him that is contrary to Reaſon. Therefore <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. ii de ſan. tuen.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays that to one that has this Temperament, we need not preſcribe a Dyet, what he ſhould Eat, or drink, for he rarely or never exceeds the quantity or mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that Phyſic would ſet him. And <hi>Galen</hi> contents not himſelf with calling them moſt Temperate, but adds further, that it is not

ſo much as neceſſary to moderate the Paſſions of their Soul, for their Anger, their Grief, their Joy, and their Mirth, are meaſured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by Reaſon. Whence it follows, that they are always Healthful, and never Sickly, which is the fourth Mark.</p>
               <p>But in this <hi>Galen</hi> has no reaſon, for it is impoſſible to frame a Man that ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all his Faculties, thereafter as the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is tempered; ſo as the Iraſcible and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible Powers ſhould not be ſuperior to Reaſon, and incite him to Sin. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not convenient to ſuffer any Man how Temperate ſoever, always to follow his own natural Inclinations, without taking him by the Hand, and guiding him by Reaſon. Which is eaſily underſtood conſidering what Temperament the Brain ought to have, to be an Inſtrument fit for the Rational Faculty, and what the Heart ought to have to the end the Iraſcible may aim at Glory, Empire, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and Superiority over all; and what the Liver ought to have for digeſting the Food, and what the Teſticles ought to have for conſerving and perpetuating the ſpecies.</p>
               <p>As to the Brain, we have already often ſaid, that it ought to have Moiſture for the Memory, Dryneſs for the Underſtanding, and Heat for the Imagination. But for all this, its natural Temperament is Cold and Moiſt; and becauſe of the intenſe or remiſs degrees of theſe two qualities, one time we call it
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53763:209"/>
Hot, and another Cold; ſometimes Moiſt, and ſometimes Dry; but ſtill ſo as the Cold and Moiſt are predominant.</p>
               <p>The Liver (where the Concupiſcible Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is ſeated) has for its Natural Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a predominant Heat and Moiſture; which Temperament never leaves the Man ſo long as he lives. And if we ſay ſometimes that it is Cold, it is becauſe it has not then all the Degrees of Heat requiſite for its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>Touching the Heart (which is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Iraſcible Faculty) <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de uſu pulſu.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that it is ſo Hot of its own Nature, that while the Creature lives, if we put our Finger in its Cavity, we cannot ſuffer it there a moment without burning. And tho' we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid, that the Heart is Cold, yet muſt it never be underſtood, that the Cold predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates there, (for it is impoſſible) but only that it has not all the Degrees of Heat which its Operations need.</p>
               <p>For what relates to the Teſticles, (where the other part of the concupiſcible Faculty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides) the ſame reaſon has place; becauſe their Natural Temperament is hot and dry in predominance. And if we ſometimes ſay of a man, that he has theſe Parts cold, it is not to be underſtood abſolutely, or in predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance, but only that the intenſe degrees of Heat required for the generative Faculty are wanting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:53763:210"/>From which may be clearly gathered, that if a Man be well-compounded and organized, he muſt neceſſarily have the force of an exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Heat in his Heart,<note place="margin">The Heart ſends the heat to the Brain by the Arteries; the Liver thro' the Veins; and the Teſticles the ſame way.</note> or elſe the Iraſcible Faculty will remain too weak; and if the Liver be not exceeding Hot, it cannot digeſt the Food, nor make Blood for Nouriſhment; and if the Teſticles are not more Hot than Cold, the Man will prove impotent, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Generation.</p>
               <p>So that theſe Members being of ſuch force, as we have ſaid, it follows of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity,<note rend="inter">Altho' a Man be ſtirred up by his bad compoſition, yet withall, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains free to do what he pleaſes. He hath ſet Fire and Water before thee, ſtretch out thy hand unto which thou wilt, <hi>Eccleſ. c. xv.</hi>
                  </note> that the Brain comes to be altered thro' much Heat, (which is one of the qualities that moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends Reaſon) and which is worſe, the Will being free, is irritated, and inclines to condeſcend to the Inferiour Appetites. By this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it appears, that Nature cannot make a Man perfect in all his Faculties, nor produce him altogether inclined to Virtue.</p>
               <p>How repugnant it is to the Nature of Man to be produced wholly inclined to Virtue, may be plainly diſcovered in conſidering the Compoſition of the Firſt Man; for tho' it was the moſt perfect that was ever found among Mankind (except that of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour) and framed by the Hand of ſo great a Workman, nevertheleſs if God had not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into him a ſupernatural Quality to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due his Inferiour Part, it was impoſſible, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:53763:210"/>
upon the Principles of Nature, that he ſhould not be inclined to Evil. And that God had made <hi>Adam</hi> with perfect Iraſcible and Concupiſcible Powers, is evidently ſeen in this, that when he ſpoke to, and commanded him <hi>to increaſe and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth,</hi> it is certain, he gave them an able Power for Procreation, and framed them not cold, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he enjoyn'd them to People the Earth with Men: A Work not to be perform'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Heat.</p>
               <p>No leſs Heat beſtowed he on the Nutritive Faculty, which was to repair their loſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and to renew another in its place; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſaid to them, <hi>Behold I have given unto you every Herb bearing Seed which is upon the Face of the Earth; and every Tree in which is the Fruit of a Tree yielding Seed, to you it ſhall be for Meat.</hi> For if God had given them a Liver and Stomach Cold and of little Heat, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they would not have been able to digeſt Meats, nor to preſerve themſelves nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years alive in the World:</p>
               <p>He fortified alſo his Heart, and gave him an Iraſcible Faculty, becoming ſuch a King, and a Maſter, as was to govern all the World. And ſaid, <hi>Subdue the Earth, and have Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Foul of the Air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth.</hi> But if he had not given him abundance of heat, he would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have had Spirit nor Authority to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:53763:211"/>
him Empire, Command, Glory, Majeſty, and Honour. What diſadvantage it is to a Prince to have the Iraſcible Power weak, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enough be expreſs'd, ſeeing through this alone, he comes to be neither feared nor obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor reſpected by his Subjects.</p>
               <p>Having thus fortified the Iraſcible and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcible Powers, in giving to the Members we have mentioned, ſo great a Heat, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Rational Faculty, and made a Brain Cold and Moiſt, to ſuch a Point, and of ſo delicate a Subſtance; by which means the Soul might Reaſon and Diſcourſe, and make uſe of its infuſed Knowledge. For we have ſaid and prov'd before, when God had a deſign to give Men any ſupernatural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he firſt prepar'd the Wit, and made them Capable with the Natural Diſpoſitions which he planted with his own Hand, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Knowledge: And therefore Holy Writ ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. xvii.</note> 
                  <hi>That he gave them a Heart to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and repleniſhed them with the Diſcipline of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Iraſcible and Concupiſcible Faculty being ſo very powerful, becauſe of the great Heat; and the Rational ſo weak, and of ſuch ſmall reſiſtance; God armed them with a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Faculty, which the Divines call <hi>Original Righteouſneſs,</hi> to repreſs the Motions of the Inferiour Part, that the rational Part might remain Superiour, and the Man incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Virtue. But when our firſt Parents
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53763:211"/>
ſinned, they loſt this quality; and the Iraſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Concupiſcible Faculty held their own, and were Superiour to Reaſon, (through the Prevalence of the three Members we ſpoke of) and the Man Prone to Evil, even from his Youth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was Created in the Age of Manhood, which according to Phyſitians, <note n="*" place="margin">Galen li. 6. de San. tuen.</note> is the moſt Temperate of all; and from that Age was inclined to Evil, except the ſmall time he ſtay'd in Innocence, by means of Original Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>From this Doctrin we may gather in good Natural Philoſophy, that if a Man is to do an Act of Virtue with Reluctance of the Fleſh, it is impoſſible for him to practiſe the ſame, without the Aſſiſtance of Grace, becauſe the qualities by which the Inferiour Faculty ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates are of greater Efficacy. I ſaid with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance of the Fleſh, in as much as there are found many Virtues in Man, which proceed from the Iraſcible and Concupiſcible Faculties being low, as is Chaſtity in a Man that is Cold; but this is an Impotence in Working, rather than a Virtue.</p>
               <p>For which reaſon had the Catholic Church never taught us, that we are not able to overcome our Inclinations, but by the ſpecial Aſſiſtance of God, Natural Philoſophy would teach us no leſs this Truth, That Grace forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies our Will. What <hi>Galen</hi> would have ſaid, was, that the Temperate Man excels in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53763:212"/>
others who have not this good Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe the ſame is leſs ſolicited by the Inferiour Part.</p>
               <p>The fifth Property of thoſe who enjoy this good Temperament, is, to be very Long-liv'd, as being very powerful to reſiſt the Cauſes and Occaſions of Diſeaſes. And this is what the Royal Prophet meant, when he ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 89.</note> 
                  <hi>The days of our years are threeſcore and ten; and if by reaſon of Strength they be fourſcore years, yet is their Strength Labour and Sorrow.</hi> He calls thoſe Strong who are of this Temperament, becauſe they reſiſt better than others the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of diminiſhing Life.</p>
               <p>The laſt Mark is given by <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. de temp. c. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> ſaying, That they are very Wiſe, of great Memory for the paſt, of great Imagination to gueſs at the future, and of great Underſtanding to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the truth in all things. They are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malicious, crafty, nor Cavillers; for theſe ſpring from a Vicious Temperament.</p>
               <p>Such a Wit as this is, aſſuredly was not fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Nature to learn the Latin Tongue, Logic, Philoſophy, Phyſic, Divinity, or the Laws; for put the caſe he might eaſily attain theſe Sciences, yet not one of them can fill all his Capacity. Only the Office of a King an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers in proportion to it, and in Ruling and Governing, the ſame is only to be employed.</p>
               <p>This is eaſily underſtood in running thro' all the Marks and Properties we have recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Temperate Men; and conſidering how
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:53763:212"/>
each of them agrees with the Royal Scepter, and ill correſponds with other Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>That a King be Beautiful and Agreeable, is one of the things that beſt engages Subjects to Love and Honour him, becauſe as <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de pulchro.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, the object of Love is Beauty, and good Proportion; and if the King be hard-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and miſ-ſhapen, it is impoſſible to gain the People's Affection; in ſo much that they will highly reſent it, that an unfiniſhed Man, who has not ſo much as good Natural Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould come to Rule and Govern them.</p>
               <p>To be Virtuous, and of good Conditions, is ſoon underſtood how much it imports; for he who is to Order the Lives of his Subjects, and give them Laws and Rules to live accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Reaſon; it is convenient that he do the ſame in Perſon; for ſuch as the King is, ſuch are the Grandees, the Middle, and the Lower Sort. Moreover, by this means he will make his Commands more Authentic, and with a better right proceed to Puniſh thoſe that fail to obſerve them.</p>
               <p>To hold a Perfection in all the Ruling Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of a Man, (the Generative, Nutritive, Iraſcible and Rational) is more becoming a King than any Artiſt whatever. For as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, in a well-ordered-State, there ought to be Over-ſeers of Families, who may with Skill diſcover the qualities of Perſons that are
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53763:213"/>
to Marry, in order to give to each Man the Woman beſt proportion'd to him; and to each Woman the Man deſtin'd for her. Were this duly obſerved, they would never be fruſtrated of the principal end of Marriage. For we ſee by Experience, that a Woman who could have no Children by her firſt Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as ſoon as ſhe is married to another, has; and many Men that could have no Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by their firſt Wives, have had them as ſoon as ever they married to another. More eſpecially ſays <hi>Plato,</hi> this Art is of uſe in the Marriages of Kings: For as it is a thing of the greateſt Importance to the Peace and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of a Kingdom, that the King ſhould have a lawful Iſſue to Succeed him, ſo it may well happen that a King marrying at random may light on a barren Wife, that will keep him all his Life without hope of Iſſue; and ſo dying without Heirs, he bequeaths to his People Civil Wars, for filling of a Vacant Throne.</p>
               <p>But this Art, ſays <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, but for Men of ill Conſtitutions, and not for thoſe that have the perfect Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have deſcribed: Theſe need no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Choice of a Wife, nor look for one that is proportionable to them; for as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, whatever Wife they Marry, they will not fail forthwith to have Children: This is to be underſtood, if the Woman be Sound, and at the Age (according to the Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:53763:213"/>
that Women are wont to Conceive and bring forth. In ſuch ſort as Fruitfulneſs is more to be deſired by a King than any Artiſt whatſoever, for the reaſons we have given.</p>
               <p>If the Nutritive Faculty be ſo voracious, gluttonous, and greedy of Drink, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de ſan. tuen.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> has told us, that it proceeds from the Stomach and the Liver's wanting the Temperament agreeable to their Operations: Which makes Men Voluptuous, Infirm and of very ſhort Life: But if theſe Parts poſſeſs their due Temper and Compoſition, the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that they deſire no more Meat nor Drink than is neceſſary to ſuſtain Life. Which quality is ſo important to a King, that God declares that Land thrice happy that meets with ſuch a Prince, <note n="*" place="margin">Eccleſ. x.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is the Land whoſe King is Noble, and whoſe Princes feed in due time, for Refreſhment, and not for Riotouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the Iraſcible Faculty, if it be Intenſe, or Remiſs <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. art. med. c. xxix. &amp; xxxvi. &amp; lib. i. de ſan. tuen.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> pronounces it is an Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Heart is not well compoſed, and has not the Temperament required to act perfectly; from which two Extreams the King ought to be further diſtant than any other Artiſt, for to arm Paſſion with Power is a thing in no wiſe convenient for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Nor is it any better for the King to have that Iraſcible Faculty remiſs, becauſe in ſlightly paſſing by things ill done, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:53763:214"/>
in this Kingdom, he comes to be Deſpiſed, and loſe the Reverence of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; which ordinarily produces great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in a State, and remedileſs Miſchiefs. But the Man who is Temperate, is moved when there is Reaſon, and unmoved when there is None; which quality is as neceſſary for a King, as all the other we have ſpoke of.</p>
               <p>How much it imports that the Rational Faculty (the Imagination, Memory, and Underſtanding) ſhould be perfect in a King more than in any other, is eaſily prov'd; for the other Arts and Sciences as it ſhould ſeem are to be acquired and practiſed by the force of Man's Wit; but to govern a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to conſerve it in Peace and Concord, not only requires, that the King be endued with natural Prudence for it, but it is alſo neceſſary that God particularly aſſiſt him with Underſtanding, and Aid him in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning; the Sacred Scripture has noted no leſs, where it ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. xxi.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Heart of the King is in the Hand of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To live many Years alſo, and enjoy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Health, is a property more convenient for a good King than any other Artiſt; for his Care and Travel is laid out for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Good, and if he fails to hold out in Health, the Common-Wealth runs to Decay.</p>
               <p>All this Doctrin which we have deliver'd will be better confirm'd if we find in any true Hiſtory, that at any time there has been
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:53763:214"/>
any diſtinguiſhable Man choſen for King, in whom were not wanting any of the Marks and qualifications we have mentioned. For Truth has this Advantage, that it never wants a Proof.</p>
               <p>Holy Writ recounts <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. xvi.</note> that God being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with <hi>Saul,</hi> (for ſparing <hi>Agag</hi>'s life) ordered <hi>Samuel</hi> to go to <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and anoint for King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> one of the Eight Sons of <hi>Jeſſe.</hi> Now the holy Man preſuming that God would be pleaſed with <hi>Eliab,</hi> becauſe he was tall of Stature, ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord's Anointed is before him!</hi> But the Lord ſaid to <hi>Samuel, Look not on his Countenance or on the height of his Stature, for I have refuſed him,</hi> (for this he had tryed before in <hi>Saul) for the Lord ſees not as Man ſeees, for Man looketh on the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance, but the Lord looketh on the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Samuel</hi> diſtruſting his own skill in chooſing, paſſed on further to what he had in Charge, ſtill enquiring of God of one and the other before him, which he would pleaſe to have anointed King, and God approving of none of them; ſaid he to <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> it may be thou haſt more Children than theſe that ſtand before us, and <hi>Jeſſe</hi> ſaid there remaineth yet the Youngeſt, and behold he keepeth the Sheep, but he is little of Stature, imagining belike, that that was no ſmall matter in a King. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel</hi> who had already learned by Experience, that a great Stature was not always a good
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:53763:215"/>
Preſage, ſent for him. And it is a thing worthy Obſervation, what Sacred Scripture recounts, e're yet he was anointed King, <hi>Now he was Ruddy, and withal of a Beautiful Countenance, and goodly to look to, and the Lord ſaid, Ariſe and anoint him, for this is he.</hi> So as <hi>David</hi> had the two firſt Marks we have laid down, he was Ruddy, well-Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctioned, and of mean Stature.</p>
               <p>That he was Virtuous, and good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (which is our third Sign) is eaſie to be found, ſeeing God ſaid, of him. <note n="*" place="margin">Act. xiii.</note>

<pb n="389" facs="tcp:53763:215"/>
all this becauſe he was Temperate, and of good Conſtitution, and avoided the Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ordinarily breed Diſeaſes, and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Man's Life.</p>
               <p>His great Wiſdom and Knowledge were noted by <hi>Saul</hi>'s Servant, when he ſaid, <note place="margin">1 King xvi.</note>

               <p>But here ariſes a great Difficulty againſt this Doctrin, namely, ſeeing God knew all the Wits and Ability in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and was well aware, that the Temperate Men are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of that Prudence and Wiſdom of which the Royal Office ſtands in need; for what cauſe in the firſt Election that was made, God ſought not out ſuch a Man as this? For even the Text ſays, that <hi>Saul</hi> was ſo tall of Stature as he exceeded all the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the Head and Shoulders.

               <p>It looks as if we had ſufficiently confirmed our Opinion in this inſtance of King <hi>David</hi>; but there aroſe alſo another King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of whom it was ſaid, <note n="†" place="margin">Mat. ii.</note> 
                  <hi>Where is he that is born King of the Jews?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if we can prove that he was red-Hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well faſhioned, of middle Stature, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Sound, and of great Wiſdom and Knowledge, it will be no diſadvantage to our Cauſe.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſts buſy not themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Compoſition of our Lord, becauſe it no way conduced to the ſubject they treated of, but the ſame is a matter very eaſy to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſuppoſing that an exact Temperament is all the Perfection a Man can naturally have; and ſeeing it was the Holy Ghoſt that formed and Organized him, it is certain, that as
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:53763:216"/>
touching the material Cauſe of which he form'd him, it was not the Ill Temperament of <hi>Nazareth</hi> that could reſiſt him, nor cauſe him to erre in his work, (as it fares with Natural Agents) but that he did what beſt pleaſed him, becauſe he wanted neither Power, Knowledge nor Will, to frame a Man moſt Perfect, and without any Defect. And the rather, for that his Coming (as he himſelf <note n="†" place="margin">Ioh. xviii. Mat. xx.</note> affirms) was to endure Travels for Man, and to teach him the Truth. But this Temperament (as we have prov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) was the beſt Natural Inſtrument to effect theſe two things. And therefore I hold for true, the Relation, that <hi>Publius Len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi> the Proconſul writ from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the Senate at <hi>Rome,</hi> after this manner.</p>
               <p>There has been ſeen in our Time a Man who yet lives, of great Virtue, call'd <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> is termed the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> of <hi>Truth</hi>; and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſay, that he is the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> He raiſes the Dead, and heals the Sick; He is a Man of a middle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable Stature, and of a very fair Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; His Look carries ſuch Majeſty, as procures at once, both Love and Reſpect from all his Beholders: His Hair down to his Ears is of the Colour of a Nut full ripe; and from his Ears to his Shoulders, of the Colour of Wax, but brighter: He has in the middle of his Forehead a little Lock, after the manner of the <hi>Nazarens:</hi> His Forehead is Plain, but very
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53763:217"/>
Serene: His Face without Spot or Wrinkle, and of a moderate Colour. His Noſe and Mouth are not with any reaſon to be blamed. His Beard thick, and reſembling his Hair; not long but forked. His Aſpect is Gracious and Grave, and his Eyes graceful and clear: He is Awful in his Reproofs, and Charming in his Admonitions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He forces Love; He is chearful with Gravity; He is never ſeen to Laugh, but Weep often: He has elegant Hands and Arms: In Converſation he is very pleaſing; but is ſeldom in Company; and when he is, very Modeſt. In his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and Mien, the lovelieſt Man that can be imagined.</p>
               <p>In this Relation are compriſed three or four Marks of a Temperate Man. The firſt, that he had his Hair and Beard of the Colour of a Nut full ripe; which if well conſidered is a brown Abourn; which Colour <note n="*" place="margin">Num. x.xix.</note> God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Heifer ſhould have, that was to be ſacrificed in Figure of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And when he Aſcended up into Heaven, with the Triumph and Majeſty due to ſuch a Prince, ſome of the Angels that knew nothing of his Incarnation, ask'd, <note n="†" place="margin">Eſai. lxiii.</note> 
                  <hi>Who is this that comes from Edom, with his Garments died Red from Boſra?</hi> As if they had ſaid, Who is this that comes from the Red-Land, with his Garments died Red? (with regard to his Hair, and Beard, and to the Blood he was ſtained with) The Letter alſo reports him the faireſt Man
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:53763:217"/>
that ever was ſeen, (which is the ſecond Mark of a temperate Man.) Accordingly by this Mark Holy Scripture has diſtinguiſh'd him, <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. xliv.</note> 
                  <hi>Goodly of Beauty among the Sons of Men</hi>; and elſewhere it is ſaid, <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. xlix.</note> 
                  <hi>That his Eyes ſhall be Red with Wine, and his Teeth White with Milk.</hi> Which Beauty and Comely Shape of Body was of no ſmall importance to engage the whole World to Love him; becauſe there was nothing Terrible about him. And ſo the Letter ſays, That every one was enclined to Love him: It reports alſo, That he was of middle Stature; not that the Holy Ghoſt wanted Matter to make him greater, if he had ſo pleaſed, but becauſe in over-charging the Rational Soul with Bones and Fleſh, the Wit is oppreſſed; as we have prov'd before from the Opinion of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Mark (namely to be Virtuous and of good Conditions) is confirmed alſo from the ſame Relation, and the <hi>Jews</hi> with all their falſe Witneſſes, could never prove the contrary, nor anſwer him, when he ask'd them, <hi>Which of you can reprove me of Sin?</hi> And <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. xviii. de anti. ix<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Joſephus,</hi> from the credit of his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, aſſures us, that he ſeemed to be more than Man, conſidering his great Goodneſs and Wiſdom. There is only long Life that is not verified of our Saviour <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they put him to Death ſo Young; But if the Courſe of Nature had not been interruptted, he might have lived above fourſcore Years.
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:53763:218"/>
For it is very probable, that he who could live in a Deſart fourty Days, and fourty Nights,<note place="margin">Mat. iv.</note> without Eating or Drinking, and neither be Sick, nor Die, with it, might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have preſerv'd himſelf free from other ſlighter Accidents, that might alter and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair his Temperament. Howbeit this Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was reputed a Miracle, and a thing that could not happen in the Compaſs of Nature.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Examples of Kings which we have alledged, are ſufficient to give to Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that the Royal Scepter is due to Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Men, and that they have the Wit and Wiſdom which is required for that Station: But there was alſo another Man made by God's own hand, with deſign that he ſhould be King and Lord of all things Created, and he made him alſo red, well-faſhioned, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, Sound, of exceeding long Life, and very Wiſe. The Proof of which is no Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to our Cauſe.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de Natura.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> held it for a thing impoſſible for God or Nature to form a Man Temperate in an Intemperate Region; and therefore he ſaid, that to make the firſt Man very Wiſe, and Temperate, God ſought out a place where the Heat of the Air excceeded not the Cold, nor the Moiſt the Dry; And Holy Writ (whence he drew this Opinion) ſays not that God created <hi>Adam</hi> in the Terreſtrial Paradiſe, (which is the moſt Temperate Place mentioned by <hi>Plato</hi>) but that he plac'd
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53763:218"/>
him there after he had made him. <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. ii.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Lord God took the Man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dreſs it, and to keep it.</hi> For as the Power of God is infinite, and his Knowledge above meaſure, and his Will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to give all the Natural Perfection to Man he was capable of in his Kind; it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that neither the Piece of Earth of which he was fram'd, nor the Intemperance of the Country of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> (where he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) could hinder his coming Temperate out of Gods Hands. The Opinion of <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> hath place in the Works of Nature, and yet even in Intemperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions Nature ſometimes chances to produce a Temperate Man.</p>
               <p>Now that <hi>Adam</hi> had Red Hair, and Beard, (which is the firſt Mark of a Temperate Man) is a thing very clear; for in reſpect of this ſo notorious a Sign the Name of <hi>Adam</hi> was given him, which is as much as to ſay, as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> interprets it, <hi>a red Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor can it be deny'd but he was Beautiful, and well Faſhioned, (which is the ſecond Mark) ſeeing that after God created him, the Text ſays, <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. i.</note> 
                  <hi>That he ſaw every thing which he had made, and behold it was very good!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain then, that he iſſued not out of the Hands of God, Foul, or ill Shap'd, <note n="†" place="margin">Deut. xii</note> 
                  <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all his Works are perfect.</hi> Inſomuch as the Text affirms, that the very Trees were fair to Behold: What then think you of
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:53763:219"/>
                  <hi>Adam,</hi> whom God created for the principal end, and to be Lord and Maſter of the whole World.</p>
               <p>That he was Virtuous, Wiſe and well-Conditioned, (which are the third and ſixth Marks) may be collected from theſe, words, <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. iii·</note> 
                  <hi>Let us make Man after our Image and Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> becauſe according to the Antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, the foundation of the Reſemblance of Man to God was no other than Virtue and Wiſdom. Which made <note n="†" place="margin">De lege.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato</hi> ſay, that the greateſt pleaſure God took above in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was to hear a Wiſe and Virtuous Man praiſed and admir'd on Earth; in as much as ſuch a Man is his moſt lively Portraiture. On the contrary, he is diſpleaſed, when the Fooliſh and Wicked are in Honour and Eſteem, becauſe of the Diſparity between them and himſelf.</p>
               <p>That he liv'd Sound, and a long while, (which are the fourth and fifth Marks) is not hard to prove, ſeeing that he lived nine hundred and thirty Years compleat. So that I may now conclude, that he that is Red, well-Faſhioned, of middle Stature, Virtuous, Sound and of long Life, muſt neceſſarily be exceeding Wiſe, and have the Wit requiſite for the Royal Scepter. We have alſo by the by made out, after what manner a great Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding may be joyn'd with a large Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Memory; tho' this may come to paſs without the Man's being Temperate.
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:53763:219"/>
But Nature makes ſo few after this Model, that amongſt all the Wits I have examined, I have not met above two.</p>
               <p>But how a large Underſtanding, a vaſt Imagination, and a good Memory may meet together (in a Man, not being Temperate) is a thing eaſy to comprehend, if we admit the Opinion of ſome Phyſitians, who affirm, that the Imagination lies in the fore-part of the Brain, the Memory in the hinder part; and the Underſtanding in the middle: which may alſo be ſuppoſed by our Apprehenſion, but it is a work of great labour that the Brain being no bigger than a Pepper-corn, at the time Nature begins to form it, ſhould have one of the Ventricles of Seed very Hot; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of very Moiſt; and that in the middle, of very dry; tho' after all, this is no Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Caſe.</p>

               <p>'TIS a thing worthy of great Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Nature being ſuch as we all know, Wiſe, Skilful, of great Art, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and Power; and Man a Work in

which ſhe has ſhew'd ſo much skill: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, for one perſon that is Wiſe and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſhe produces an infinite Number of half-Witted. Of which effect, (ſearching into the reaſon, and Natural Cauſes) I have found at length, that the fault lay in Parents not applying themſelves to the Act of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in that Order, and with that Concert, which Nature has eſtabliſhed, not knowing the Conditions which are to be obſerv'd in the begetting Wiſe and Prudent Children. For by the ſame Reaſon, that in whatever Country it be, either Temperate, or Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, there is born a Man of great Wit, (with regard to the ſame Order of Cauſes) there are a thouſand begot of a ſlender Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: If we can then by Art procure a Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for this, there will accrue to the Common-Wealth the greateſt Benefit it can receive. But the Difficulty of this Matter is, that we cannot treat of it in Terms ſo decent, and ſeemly, as becomes that Modeſty which is ſo Natural to Men. And if for this reaſon I ſhould ſpare the mention of any Part or Action, that is neceſſary, it is certain, the whole matter will be marred; inſomuch as it is the Opinion of many grave Philoſophers, that wiſe Men ordinarily beget Blockheads, becauſe for Modeſties ſake, they abſtain in the act of Copulation from ſome Careſſes, which are of importance, that the Child par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Fathers Wit. Of the Natural
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:53763:220"/>
Modeſty conceived in the Eyes when the parts of Generation are expoſed to view, and of the Offence which their Names give to our Ears, ſome antient Philoſopers have attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to find the Reaſon; being ſurprized to ſee that Nature had framed theſe Parts with ſuch Care and Diligence, for a Deſign ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant as that of Immortalizing Mankind; and yet nevertheleſs the Wiſer and Prudenter a Man is, the more he is aſhamed to ſee them, or hear them Named.</p>
               <p>Shame and Modeſty as <note n="*" place="margin">iii. De ani. &amp; iv. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic.</note>

               <p>By this very Token <hi>Cato</hi> the Elder diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered <hi>Manilius,</hi> a perſon of Honour, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Underſtanding, when they told him he Kiſſed his Wife in preſence of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for which he loſt his Place in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and could never after prevail to be Readmitted in the number of the Senators.</p>
               <p>From this Speculation <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> drew a Problem demanding, <note n="†" place="margin">iv. Sect. Prob. xxiii.</note> 
                  <hi>What is the Reaſon that Men who are deſirous of the Act of Venery, are yet aſhamed to confeſs it; but if they have an appetite to Eat or Drink, or the like, they
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:53763:221"/>
are not aſhamed to own it?</hi> To which Problem he Anſwers very poorly, ſaying, <hi>Perhaps it comes, becauſe the deſires of many things are Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and ſome of them if they fail to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, deſtroy; but the Act of Venery is rather in the nature of an Exceſs, and an Argument of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' in truth the Problem is falſe, and the Anſwer to it no better: for a Man is not only Aſhamed to diſcover the Deſire he has to enjoy a Woman, but alſo to Eat to Drink and to Sleep: And if he have Occaſion to Void any Excrements, he makes no noiſe of it, and voids it not but in Pain and with Shame, for which reaſon he turns aſide into ſome ſecret place out of Sight. Yea, ſome Men we find ſo Baſhful, that having a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to make Water, they cannot do it if any look on: But as ſoon as they are left alone, the Urine iſſues freely. And yet theſe are Deſires of voiding the ſuperfluities of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, of which if a Man be not eaſed, he muſt expire, and much ſooner too than if he neither Eat nor Drank. And if any one ſpeaks of it, or does it in the preſence of another, ſays <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi> he is not in his right Wits.</p>
               <p>The ſame proportion ſays, <note n="†" place="margin">vi. De lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis affic. vi.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> the Seed bears to the Spermatic Veſſels as the Urine does to the Bladder; for in the ſame manner as the Urine provokes the Bladder, much Seed pains the Spermatic Veſſels. True it is, <hi>Ariſtotle thought</hi> that a Man or Woman
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:53763:221"/>
could not fall Sick and Die by a too-great Retention of Seed, tho' this is againſt the Opinion of all Phyſitians, and particularly of <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen,</hi> who affirms that many Women, being left young Widows, have happen'd to loſe their Senſe and Motion, their Pulſe and Breath, and after all, their Lives. Nay <note n="†" place="margin">iv. Sec. Prob. xxx.</note> 
                  <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> himſelf recounts many Maladies that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict Continent Men from the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>The true Anſwer to this Problem is not to be expected from Natural Philoſophy; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not under it's Juriſdiction. And therefore we muſt have recourſe to a Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Science, call'd Metaphyſics, wherein <note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. xii. Meta.</note> 
                  <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> ſays, that the Rational Soul is the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all the Intelligences; and becauſe it's Nature is of the ſame kind with Angels, ſhe is out of Countenance to ſee her ſelf placed in a Body, in common with Brute Beaſts.</p>
               <p>Therefore Holy Writ notes it as a thing not without ſome Myſtery, that the firſt Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Naked was not Aſhamed; but as ſoon as he ſaw himſelf to be ſo, forthwith he got a Covering. At which time he knew that thro' his own Fault he had loſt Immortality, and that his Body was made ſubject to Change and Corruption, and that thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments and Parts were given him, becauſe he muſt of neceſſity Die, and leave another in his room; and to preſerve himſelf in Life the little time that remained, he muſt needs
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53763:222"/>
Eat and Drink, and diſcharge thoſe noiſom and corrupt Excrements. His ſhame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the more when he ſaw the Angels (with whom he ſtood in Competition) were Immortal, not needing to Eat, Drink, or Sleep, to ſuſtain their Being, nor had they the Parts of Generation, being Created all at once, without Matter, and without fear of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting: Of all which things, the Eyes and Ears, are I know not how naturally well aware, ſo that the Rational Soul is in Pain, and Aſhamed, as often as ſhe calls to Mind the things that are given to Man as a Mortal and Corruptible Creature.</p>
               <p>And that this is a convenient Anſwer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plain in this, that God to ſatisfy the Soul after the Univerſal Judgment, and to crown it with entire Glory, will cauſe the Body to partake all the Qualities of an Angel, beſtowing on it Clarity, Subtilty, Agility, and Immortality; by reaſon of which we ſhall have no occaſion to Eat, or Drink as Bruit Beaſts. And when they are in Heaven in that State, they will have no more ſhame to be Naked than our Saviour or his Bleſſed Mother. But rather it will turn to an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental Glory, to ſee that the uſe of theſe Parts is at an end, that were wont to be Offenſive to the Sight and Hearing.</p>
               <p>With regard then to the Natural Modeſty of the Ear, I ſhall endeavour to ſpare what are harſh and grating Terms in this matter,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53763:222"/>
and give them the ſofteſt Turn I may; and where I cannot avoid it, the Candid Reader will pleaſe to excuſe me, for to reduce to a perfect Art, the Method to be Obſerved, that Men may prove of the moſt delicate Wit, is one of the things moſt requiſite for the Common-Wealth. Beſides, that by the ſame reaſon, they ſhall prove Virtuous, well-faſhioned, Sound and Long-lived.</p>
               <p>I have thought good to divide the Matter of this Chapter into four principal Parts, to give the more light to what I ſhall ſay, and to prevent the Readers being at a loſs. The firſt is to ſhow the Qualities, and Natural Temperament a Man and a Woman are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to have for Generation. The ſecond what care Parents are to obſerve to get Males and not Females. The third how they may become Wiſe and not Fools. The fourth how to educate them after their Birth, for Preſervation of their Wit,</p>
               <p>To come to the firſt Point then, we have already ſaid from <note n="*" place="margin">In Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reto.</note> 
                  <hi>Plato,</hi> that in a well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd State, there ought to be certain Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of Marriages, who by Art might skill to diſcern the Qualities of the Perſons that are to Marry, in order to give to every Man the moſt proportionable Woman, and to every Wife her convenient Husband.</p>
               <p>In which Matter <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to take ſome Pains, and to lay down ſome Precepts and Rules to know which Woman
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:53763:223"/>
was fruitful, and which not; which Man was impotent, and which able and prolific; but touching all this they have ſaid very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and not ſo diſtinctly as is convenient, (at leaſt for the purpoſe I have occaſion for.) And therefore it will be requiſite to trace the Art from it's Principles, and briefly to put it in a due Method, that ſo we may clearly know, from what Conjunction of Parents, Wiſe Children proceed, and from what, Fools and Blockheads.</p>
               <p>To attain which, you are firſt to know a particular point of Philoſophy, which tho' it be moſt manifeſt and true to thoſe that are Skilful in the Art, yet it is overlook'd by the Vulgar; though what we advance touching the firſt Point, depends upon its Notice; And that is, that Man, tho he appears fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned as we ſee him, differs not from Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de diſſec. vul vae. &amp; lib. ii. de ſem. cap. v.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, but only in having the Genitals outward. For if a Woman be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſected, we ſhall find that ſhe has within her two Teſticles, two Spermatic Veſſels, and one Matrix, together with the figure of the Maſculine Member, without miſſing the leaſt Repreſentation. Which is ſo true, that if Nature making a perfect Man, had a mind to turn him into a Woman, ſhe has no more to do, than to turn the Parts of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration inward. And if after ſhe has made a Woman, ſhe had a mind to convert her into Man, ſhe need no more than turn out her Genitals.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:53763:223"/>This has chanced many times in Nature, as well to the Foetus in the Womb, as to the Child after the Birth. Of which Hiſtories are full, though ſome have held them only for Fables (as coming from the Hands of Poets) yet the thing carries much of Truth. For divers times has Nature made a Female that has continued ſuch in the Mothers Womb a Month or two afterwards, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Heat upon Occaſion falling on the Genitals, they have ſtruck out, and ſhe ſteps forth a Male. To whom this change of Sex has happened in the Mothers Womb, is afterwards made known by certain Motions unbecoming a Man, being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Womaniſh and Effeminate, their Voice Shrill and Squeaking: Such perſons are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to Woman's works, and fall ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into awkard Offences.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, Nature has often made a Boy with his Genitals outwards, and ſome Cold ſupervening, ſhe has inverted them, and the Boy has turned into a Girl. This appears after ſhe is Born, in that ſhe has a Maſculine Air, as well in her Speech, as in all her Motions and Geſtures. This ſeems difficult to prove, but eaſy to believe, if we reflect on what we are aſſured by many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic Hiſtories. And that Women have been turned into Men, after they were Born, the Vulgar are not ſurpriſed to hear of, for beſides, what many Antient Authors have
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:53763:224"/>
delivered for truth, 'tis a thing that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Spain,</hi> but few Years ſince, and what Experience teaches admits no Diſpute or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>What the Cauſe or Reaſon may be that the Genitals are engendred within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and they come forth Male or Female, is a plain Caſe, if we recollect that Heat dilates and extends all things, and Cold contracts and cloſes them. And therefore it is the Concluſion of all the Philoſophers and Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. lib ii. de ſemine, c. v. Ariſ. iv. Sect. prob. xxix.</note> that if the Seed be Cold and Moiſt, a Girle is produced, and not a Boy; and if it be Hot and Dry, a Boy is produced, and not a Girle. Whence may be clearly inferr'd, that there is no Man can be call'd cold in reſpect of a Woman, nor any Woman hot in reſpect of a Man.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid, that the Woman ſhould be cold and moiſt to be fruitful, and if ſhe were not ſo, it were impoſſible ſhe ſhould have her Terms, or Milk, to preſerve the <hi>Foetus</hi> nine whole Months in her Womb, and two Years after the Birth, but the ſame would be diſſipated and waſted.</p>
               <p>All the Philoſophers and Phyſitians aſſert, that the Womb bears the ſame Proportion to humane Seed, as the Earth does to Wheat, or any other Grain; But we ſee if the Earth be not cold and moiſt, the Husbandman dares not Sow it, and though he ſhould, it comes to nothing, Alſo among Lands, thoſe
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:53763:224"/>
are moſt fertile, and fructify moſt, <note n="*" place="margin">Gal. v. aph. com. lxii.</note> that have moſt Cold and Moiſture, as appears by experience conſidering the Northern Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (<hi>England, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>) where the abundance of all Fruits ſurpriſes thoſe that know not the reaſon of it; and in ſuch Countries, a Married Woman rarely fails of Children, neither do they know what 'tis to be Barren, all the Women there are fruitful and prolific, becauſe of the great Cold and Moiſture. But though it be true that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhould be cold and moiſt for Concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nevertheleſs that may be in ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that the Seed may be choaked; as we ſee the Grain is oppreſt with too-much Rain, and cannot thrive when it is over-cold. Which ſhews us that theſe two qualities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a certain Mediocrity, which if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, or come ſhort of, Fertility is in danger to be loſt. <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>Hippocrates</hi> held that Woman fruitful, whoſe Matrix was temperate in ſuch ſort as the Heat exceeded not the Cold, nor the Moiſture the Dryneſs; therefore he ſaid, that Women who have a cold Womb, could not conceive, no more than thoſe that have a very moiſt, or a very hot, and dry one; ſo for the ſame reaſon that a Woman and her parts of Generation ſhould be Temperate, it were impoſſible for her to conceive, or be a Woman: For if the Seed of which ſhe firſt was formed, had been Temperate the Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals had iſſued forth, and ſhe had been a
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53763:225"/>
Man. So would a Beard grow on her Chin, and her Courſes have ſtopt, and ſhe become as perfect a Male as Nature could produce.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the Womb in a Woman ſhould not have a predominant Heat; for if the Seed whereof ſhe was formed, had had this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, ſhe had been born a Man and not a Woman.</p>
               <p>'Tis a thing then abſolutely certain, that the two Qualities which render a Woman fruitful, are Cold and Moiſture, inaſmuch as the Nature of a Man requires much Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his Production and Conſervation. Accordingly we ſee that of all the Females of Brute-Animals none have their Courſes as Women. Therefore it was no leſs than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, to make her altogether cold and moiſt; and to ſuch a degree, that ſhe might breed abundance of Flegmatic Blood, and be able neither to diſſipate nor conſume it. I ſaid <hi>Flegmatic Blood,</hi> becauſe the ſame is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to breed Milk, With which as <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> and <note n="*" place="margin">v. Sect. Prob. lii.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> are of Opinion the <hi>Foetús</hi> is nouriſhed all the time it is in the Womb; but if the ſame ſhould be Temperate, it would make much Blood, which would be very unfit to breed Milk, and which would wholly reſolve, as it does in a Temperate Man; and ſo nothing be left to nouriſh the <hi>Foetus.</hi> Therefore I hold for certain, that it is impoſſible any Woman be either Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate or Hot, they are all both cold and moiſt.
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53763:225"/>
If this be not ſo, let Phyſitians and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers tell me, why all Women are Beardleſs, and yet have their Terms if in Health? Or for what cauſe if the Seed of which ſhe is form'd was Temperate or Hot, ſhe was born a Female and not a Male? But though it be true that all Women are cold and moiſt, yet they are not ſo in the ſame Degree; ſome are in the Firſt, others in the Second, and the reſt in the Third: And in each degree they may conceive, if the Man anſwer them in the proportion of Heat, which we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after explain. By what Marks theſe three Degrees of Cold and Moiſture in Women may be known, and how we may diſcern which is in the Firſt, which in the Second, and which in the Third, no Philoſophy, or Phyſic has yet declar'd. But conſidering the Effects theſe Qualities produce in Women, we may diſtinguiſh them more or leſs, and thus it will be eaſy to underſtand the ſame. Firſt by the Wit and Ability of the Woman. Secondly by her Manners and Conditions. Thirdly by the Shrillneſs or Harſhneſs of her Voice. In the fourth place by her being Fat or Lean. In the fifth place by her Colour. In the ſixth by her Hair. And laſtly by her Fairneſs or Foulneſs.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt, you are to know, that though it be true (as we have elſewhere prov'd) that Woman's Wit and Ability fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Temperament of the Brain, and no
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:53763:226"/>
other part; nevertheleſs the Matrix and the Teſticles are of that force and vigor to alter the Body, that if they are hot and dry, or cold and moiſt, or any other Temperament whatever, <note n="*" place="margin">v. Aph. com. lxii. Hipp. vi. Epid. p. i. com. ii.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> affirms all the other Parts will obſerve the ſame Temper. But the Part that depends moſt upon the alterations of the Womb, according the Opinion of all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, is the Brain, though they diſcover not the reaſon upon which they ground ſo great a Correſpondence. True it is that <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. i. de ſem. c. xv.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> proves by experience, that if a Sow be Splay'd, ſhe immediately becomes ſweet and fat, her Fleſh tender and ſavoury; But if ſhe be not Splay'd, her Fleſh is like that of a Dog. Whence may be known, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix and Teſticles are of great efficacy to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Temperament to all other parts of the Body, eſpecially to the Brain, which is cold and moiſt, as they are; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which becauſe of the Reſemblance, the Communication is the eaſier.</p>
               <p>Now if we agree that Cold and Moiſt are the Qualities that impair the Rational Soul, as their Contraries (Hot and Dry) render it more perfect and improve it; we ſhall find that a Woman that ſhews much Wit and Ability, will be cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree; and if ſhe be very ſilly ſhe is in the third Degree; but if ſhe participates equally of the two Extreams, it ſhews ſhe is in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree: For to imagin that a Woman
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:53763:226"/>
may be hot and dry, and not have the Wit and Ability attending theſe two Qualities, is a groſs Miſtake; For if the Seed of which ſhe is formed, had been hot and dry in predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minance, ſhe would have been born a Man and not a Woman; but becauſe the Seed was cold and moiſt, ſhe was born a Woman and not a Man.</p>
               <p>The Truth of this Doctrin will clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider, the Wit of the firſt Woman that lived in the World, for though God made her with his own Hands, and the moſt perfect and accompliſhed of her Sex, yet it is concluded for certain, that ſhe was much leſs knowing than <hi>Adam.</hi> Of which the Devil being ſenſible, ſet himſelf to tempt her, not daring to attempt the Man, being apprehenſive of his great Wit and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for to ſay that for her Offence, that was taken from <hi>Eve</hi> what ſhe wanted in Knowledge to equal <hi>Adam,</hi> cannot be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, becauſe as yet ſhe had not offended. The reaſon then why the firſt Woman had not ſo much Wit, is, becauſe ſhe was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God cold and moiſt, which is the neceſſary Temperament to be fruitful and to have Children, and that which is oppoſite to Knowledge: For if ſhe had been Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhe had been very Wiſe, but could not have had Children, nor her Terms, but by ſome preternatural way. Upon this Conſtitution of the Woman, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:53763:227"/>
when he orders, <hi>Let the Woman learn in ſilence with all ſubjection. But I ſuffer not a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to teach, nor to uſurp Authority over the Man, but to be in Silence.</hi> This is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood when a Woman has not the Spirit, or greater Grace than her Natural Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if it comes to her from Heaven, ſhe may boldly Speak and Teach. For we know that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> being oppreſſed and beſieged by the <hi>Aſſyrians, Judith</hi> (a very wiſe Woman) ſent for the Prieſts of <hi>Chabry</hi> and <hi>Charmy,</hi> and blamed them in theſe words. How can it be endured that <hi>Ozias</hi> ſhould ſay if Succour comes not within five days, he will deliver the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into the Hands of the <hi>Aſſyrians?</hi> See you not that ſuch words provoke God to Anger, and not to Mercy? How dare Men be ſo bold to ſet a Term to the Goodneſs of God, and to aſſign according to their Fancy, the Day in which he is to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and Deliver them? And in the cloſe of her Reproof, ſhe ſhewed them after what manner they ſhould appeaſe God, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from him what they Deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Debora</hi> (a Woman no leſs wiſe) taught the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> how they ſhould give Thanks to God, for the great Victories gained over their Enemies. But when a Woman ſtays within the limits of her Natural Diſpoſition, all ſort of Sciences and Letters are repugnant to her Wit: Therefore the Catholic Church with great reaſon has forbid any Woman to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:53763:227"/>
Preach, Confeſs, or Teach; inaſmuch as their Sex admits not Wiſdom or Diſcipline.</p>
               <p>By the Manners of a Woman, and her Conditions, we may diſcover in what degrees of Cold and Moiſt her Temperament conſiſts, for if with a ſharp Wit, ſhe appears Touchy, Pettiſh, and Diſagreeable, 'tis a ſign ſhe is Cold and Moiſt in the firſt Degree;<note place="margin">Their Wombs are Hot and Dry, which Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Galen</hi> thought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them to Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> it being true that we have before proved, that a bad Humour is always attended with a good Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination. She that obtains this Degree of cold and moiſt, will let nothing paſs, finds fault with every thing, and ſo becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable. Such are good Company, and are not ſhy to be among Men, nor do they account him an ill-lover that talks to them of Gallantries.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, when a Woman is of a good Humour, and takes nothing to Heart, but Laughs at a Feather, lets things paſs as they come, and ſleeps ſoundly, it ſhews ſhe is cold and moiſt in the third Degree; inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as an eaſy Humour is uſually attended with little Wit. She who participates of the two Extreams is in the ſecond Degree.</p>
               <p>A Voice ſtrong, groſs, and harſh,<note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. art. med</note> in the Opinion of <hi>Galen</hi> is a Mark of great Heat and Dryneſs; <note n="*" place="margin">Hipp. vi. Epid.</note> which we have alſo prov'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from the Opinion of <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> From whence we conclude, that if a Woman has a Maſculine Voice, ſhe is cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree; and if it be very ſhrill, in
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:53763:228"/>
the third Degree; And if ſhe partakes of the two Extreams, ſhe will have an Effeminate Voice; and be in the ſecond Degree. How much the Voice depends on the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Teſticles, ſhall hereafter be prov'd, where we treat of the Marks of a Man.</p>
               <p>Much Fleſh alſo in Women is an indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of much Cold and Moiſture; inaſmuch as the Phyſitians hold that 'tis from thence that other Creatures are Fat and Fleſhy. On the contrary to be Lean and Meager, is a mark of little Cold and Moiſture; and to be in moderate plight, not over-fat, nor over-lean, is an evident Sign that the Woman is cold and moiſt in the ſecond Degree. The hardneſs and ſoftneſs of the Fleſh ſhew alſo the Degrees of theſe two Qualities. Great Moiſture makes the Fleſh ſoft and ſmooth; and little, renders it harſh and hard; and the Mean, gives the true Temper. The Colour of the Face, and of the other parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, betoken alſo more or leſs the degrees of theſe two Qualities. When a Woman is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry White, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de ſang. miſ.</note> 
                  <hi>Galen</hi> ſays it is a Sign of much Cold and Moiſture; and on the contrary, ſhe that is Tawny and Swarthy, is cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree, of which two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams ariſes the ſecond Degree; and is known by an Union of White and Red.</p>
               <p>To have much Hair, and little of a Beard, is an evident Sign to diſcover the firſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Degree
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53763:228"/>
of Cold and Moiſture; for to know whence the Hair and Beard proceed, all the Phyſitians affirm them to come from Heat and Dryneſs; and if they are Black, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes abundance of Heat and Dryneſs. The contrary Temperament is betokened, when a Woman is very ſmooth, without Down or Hair. She that is cold and moiſt in the ſe;<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree, has ſome Hair, but the ſame is Red or Flaxen.</p>
               <p>Fairneſs and Foulneſs ſerve alſo to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the Degrees of Cold and Moiſt in a Woman. In the firſt Degree it is a Marvel if a Woman prove fair, for the Seed whereof ſhe was form'd being Dry, hindred her from being fair. The Clay muſt be moiſt for the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to frame well Veſſels for uſe; for if it be Hard and Dry, the Veſſels will be foul and ill figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms further, that overmuch Cold and Moiſt makes Women by Nature foul; for if the Seed be Cold and very Wateriſh, it takes no good Figure, becauſe it wants conſiſtence, as we ſee of Clay over-ſoft, ugly and ill-ſhaped Veſſels are faſhioned. In the ſecond Degree of Cold and Moiſt the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is very fair, becauſe the matter is well-ſeaſoned, and pliant to Nature; which Sign alone is a clear proof of a Woman's Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it being a certainty that Nature has hit well, and done her Part. It is then to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that ſhe has given her the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and neceſſary Compoſition, to have
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:53763:229"/>
Children, ſo that ſhe'l be fit for any Man and deſireable to all.</p>
               <p>There is no Faculty in Man that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not ſome ſigns or tokens to diſcover the Goodneſs or Malignity of its Object. The Stomach is led to diſcern the quality of the Food by the Taſt, the Smell, and the Sight; Whereupon the Holy Text ſaid, that <hi>Eve</hi> ſaw that the forbidden Fruit was good for Food, and that it was pleaſant to the Eye. The generative Faculty holds for a Sign of fruitfulneſs a Womans Beauty; and if ſhe be ugly, abhors her; conceiving by this Sign, that Nature made a falſe ſtep, and gave her not a fit Temperament for bearing Children.</p>

                  <p>MAN hath not his Temperament ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited as Woman: For he may be hot and dry, (which Temperament <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> are of Opinion is that which beſt agrees with his Sex) as alſo hot and moiſt, and temperate; but cold and moiſt, and cold and dry, will not be admitted, ſo long as the Man is in Health, and not ſome way amiſs, ſo that for the ſame reaſon, as there is no Woman hot and dry, nor hot and moiſt,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:53763:229"/>
nor temperate; even ſo, there is no Man cold and moiſt, nor cold and dry, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of Women, unleſs in a Caſe as I ſhall preſently ſhew. A Man hot and dry, or hot and moiſt, or temperate, has as many Degrees in his Temperament, as a Woman has of Cold and Moiſt; inſomuch that we have need of Tokens to diſcern what Man is, in what Degree, to aſſign him a Wife an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to him in Proportion. You are to know then, that from the Principles from which we have collected the Woman's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, and her Degrees of Cold and Moiſt, the ſame we ſhall make uſe of to know which Man is Hot and Dry, and in what Degree: And becauſe we ſaid that from the Wit and Manners of a Man the Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of the Teſticles may be conjectured, we muſt take notice of an obſervable Point, mentioned by <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de Sem. c. xv.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen,</hi> namely, to make us underſtand the great Virtue in the Teſticles of Man, to give Solidity and Temperament to all the Parts of the Body, he affirms, that they are of more Importance than the Heart, for which he renders this Reaſon, that the Heart is the Principle of Life and no more; but the Genitals are the Principles of living well, and without Infirmities.</p>
                  <p>What damage it is to Man to be deprived of thoſe Parts though ſmall, there need not many Reaſons to prove, ſeeing we ſee by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that forthwith the Hair and the
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:53763:230"/>
Beard fall off, that his groſs and ſtrong Voice grows ſhril, and with theſe he loſes his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Natural Heat, and remains in a far worſe and more miſerable Condition, than if he had been a Woman. But what is moſt obſervable is, that if a Man before caſtrating had much Wit and Ability, from the time he loſes his Teſticles, he loſes it all, even as if he had received in the Brain ſome conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hurt.<note place="margin">Gal. lib. i. de Sem. c. xvi.</note> Which evidently ſhews, that the Genitals both give and take away Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all parts of the Body. If it be otherwiſe, let us conſider, (as I have often done) that of a thouſand Eunuchs that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to Learning, not one ſucceeds in it; and even in Muſic, which is their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Profeſſion, we ſee plainly how block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh they are, and the reaſon of it is, that Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic is a work of the Imagination, which power requires much Heat, whereas they are cold and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>It is certain then, that from the Wit and Ability we may conjecture the Temperament of the Teſticles. For which cauſe the Man that appears towardly in the works of the Imagination, will be hot and dry in the third Degree. And if a Man be not very Deep, it is a Sign that Heat is joyned with much Moiſture; which ever deſtroys the Rational part; and this is the more confirmed, if the Man have a great Memory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="419" facs="tcp:53763:230"/>The ordinary Conditions of Men Hot and Dry in the third Degree, are Courage, Pride, Liberality, Audacity, Chearfulneſs and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantneſs: and in what relates to Women they obſerve no rule or moderation. The Men who are hot and moiſt are Pleaſant, Merry, fond of Diverſions, fair Conditioned, Affable, Modeſt, and not much given to Women.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Hipp. lib. ii. Epid. p. i. &amp; Ariſ. xi. Sect. pro. xliii.</note> The Voice and Speech diſcovers much the Temperament of the Teſticles. That which is ſtrong and ſomewhat harſh, ſhews the Man hot and dry in the third Degree; but that which is ſoft, amorous, and very delicate, is a Sign of little Heat, and much Moiſture, as appears in Eunuchs. The Man in whom Heat is joyned with Moiſture, will have a ſtrong Voice, yet tunable and loud.</p>
                  <p>He that is hot and dry in the third De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree has little Fleſh, and the ſame is hard and rough, full of Sinews and Arteries, and has big Veins; on the contrary, to abound with Fleſh, very ſoft, and ſmooth, is an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of much Moiſture; by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Natural Heat is dilated and extended throughout.</p>
                  <p>The Colour of the Skin likewiſe if it be Brown, Tawny, Olive-coloured, and Dark, is a Mark that the Man is hot and dry in the third Degree; and if the Fleſh be clear, and well-coloured, it is a Sign of little Heat and more Moiſture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="420" facs="tcp:53763:231"/>The Hair and Beard are Signs to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for theſe two approach very near to the Temperament of the Teſticles. If the Hair be much, very black and large, eſpecially from the Hanches to the Navel, 'tis an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Token that the Genitals partake much of Hot and Dry. Which is yet more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed if there grow Hair upon the Shoulders. But when the Hair, the Beard, and the Down are Cheſnut coloured, ſoft, delicate, and thin, 'tis a ſign the Teſticles are not ſo hot nor dry.</p>
                  <p>Men very hot and dry are rarely very Handſom, but rather hard-favoured, and ill ſhaped, becauſe Heat and Dryneſs (as <note n="*" place="margin">xiv. Sect. Prob. iv.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of the Ethiophians) wryth the proportions of the Face, and ſo they become disfigured. Quite contrary, to be well ſhaped and comely, ſhews a moderate Heat and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which renders the Matter ſupple and pliant to what Nature deſigned; whence it is manifeſt, that great Beauty in a Man is no Sign of much Heat.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Signs of a Temperate Man we have diſcourſed at large in the foregoing Chapter, ſo that there is no need of Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>It ſuffices only to note that as the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans place in each Degree of Heat, three De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Intention, ſo alſo in a Temperate Man are to be allowed the extent and lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of three others. For he that ſtands in
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53763:231"/>
the third Degree next to cold and moiſt, is to be reputed cold and moiſt: For when a Degree has exceeded the Mean, it reſembles the Degree it approaches, And that this is true, appears clearly in that the Signs given by <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. art. med.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> to know a Man cold and moiſt, are the ſame with thoſe of a Temperate Man, only a little more remiſs, ſo he is Wiſe, good-Conditioned, and Virtuous, has his Voice clear and ſweet, is fair and of good Fleſh, ſmooth and without Hair, and if he have any, the ſame is little, and yellow. Such are rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of beautiful Faces, but their Seed, as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, is wateriſh and unfit for Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Theſe are no great Friends to Women; nor Women to them.</hi>

                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> orders two Applications to be made uſe of, to diſcover if the Fault be hers, or her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands. The firſt is, to fume her with Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſence or Storax, her Garments cloſe wrapt, and trailing on the Ground, that no Fume or Vapour iſſue out, and if after ſome time ſhe feels in her Mouth the ſavour of the Incence, it is a ſure Sign that the Fault lies not at her
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:53763:232"/>
Door, ſince the Fume found the Paſſages of the Womb open, from which it pierced even to the Noſe and Mouth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Hipp. lib. de ſterili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</note>The other is to take a Head of Garlic clean pill'd, and put it into the Womb, when the Woman goes to Bed, and if the next day ſhe have the ſcent of the Garlic in her Mouth, ſhe is of her ſelf aſſuredly fruitful, without any Defect. But though theſe two Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produce the Effects <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſpeaks of, (namely that the Vapour pierces from the lower Parts up to the Mouth) yet the ſame concludes not that the Husband is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impotent, nor the Wife entirely fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but only an ill Correſpondence between both, ſo that in this caſe, ſhe proves as bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren for him, as he for her. Which we ſee by daily Experience, for the ſame Man tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another Wife, begets Children; and which encreaſes the Wonder in ſuch as are ignorant of this point of natural Philoſophy, is, that theſe two ſeparating upon pretence of Impotence, and he taking an other Wife, and ſhe another Husband, they both come to have Children; and the reaſon of it is, there are ſome Men whoſe Generative facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is not fit for, nor active on one Woman, yet for an other is potent and prolific. As we ſee by Experience in the Stomach, that a Man has a better Appetite to one Diſh, and to another (though better) it is as dead.</p>

                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:53763:232"/>What Correſpondence there ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Wife to have Iſſue, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de nat. hum. com. xi.</note> 
                     <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> notes thus; <hi>

Therefore if the Man's Seed be hot, and the Woman's ſo likewiſe, there will be no Iſſue.</p>
                  <p>This being ſuppos'd, let us conſider by way of Example, a Woman cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree, of whom we have aſſerted the Signs to be that ſhe is witty, Ill-humour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrong Voiced, ſpare of Fleſh, ſwarthy in Complection, Hairy, and Ill-favoured. She will ſoon conceive by a Fool, that is good-natured, of Voice ſweet and well-ſounding, very Fleſhy, Fair, and Plump, little Hair, well Coloured, and fair Faced. The ſame may alſo be Married to a temperate Man, whoſe Seed we ſaid, after the Opinion of <note n="†" place="margin">Aph. lxii.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> is moſt fruitful, and anſwerable to whatever Woman, provided ſhe be ſound, and of Age convenient. But yet withal, it is very difficult for her to conceive, and if ſhe conceives, <note n="*" place="margin">Aph. xliv.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, that within two Months ſhe will Miſcarry, not having Blood ſufficient to nouriſh her ſelf and the <hi>Foetus</hi> in her Womb nine Months. Yet this may find an eaſy Remedy, by often repeating
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53763:233"/>
the Bath, before ſhe keep company with her Husband, and the Bath ought to be of ſweet and hot Water, which the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">v. Aph. xvi.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays, gives the true Temperament the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ought to have, relaxing and moiſtening her Fleſh, which is alſo the diſpoſition the Earth ought to have, that the Grain may take root and ſpread. It produces yet a greater effect, it encreaſes the Appetite, abates the Reſolution, and cauſes a greater quantity of natural Heat, by which means abundance of flegmatic Blood is bred, wherewith to nouriſh the <hi>Foetus</hi> during the nine Months.</p>
                  <p>The Marks of a Woman cold and moiſt in the third Degree are theſe; To be Dull, Good-natured, to have a very delicate Voice, much Fleſh, and the ſame White and Soft, to want Hair and Down, and not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handſom. Such a one ſhould Marry with a Man hot and dry in the third Degree, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Man's Seed is of ſuch fury and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, that it ought of neceſſity to fall into a place very cold and moiſt, that it may hold and take root, like Watercreſſes, that wont grow but in Water. But if it were leſs not and dry, it would fall into a Womb ſo cold and moiſt, with the like effect as Wheat ſowed in a Lake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">v. Aph. xlvi.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> adviſes ſuch a Woman to leſſen her ſelf, and take down her Fat and her Fleſh before ſhe Marry; but then ſhe need not take a Husband hot and dry; for
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53763:233"/>
ſuch a Temperament would not do, nor can ſhe conceive.</p>
                  <p>A Woman cold and moiſt in the ſecond Degree, retains a Mean in all the Marks we have mentioned, Beauty excepted, which ſhe has in exceſs; which is an evident Sign that ſhe will be fruitful, and bear Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and prove gay and of a good Grace. Such a Woman anſwers in proportion well near to all Men; firſt to the hot and dry in the ſecond Degree; next to the Temperate, and then to thoſe that are hot and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>Of all theſe Combinations and Matches of Men and Women which we have noted, wiſe Children may proceed, but more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily from the firſt; for put caſe that the Man's Seed incline to cold and moiſt yet the continual Dryneſs of the Mother, and giving her little nouriſhment, corrects and amends the defect of the Father.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe this kind of Philoſophy has not yet come to light, all the natural Philoſophers have not been able to anſwer the Problem that demands, <note n="*" place="margin">Alex. Aphro. lib. iii. prob. xxvi.</note> 
                     <hi>Why many Fools have got wiſe Children?</hi> To which they Anſwer, That thoſe unthinking Fellows apply themſelves paſſionately to the Venereal Act without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in any other conſideration; but that wiſe Men on the contrary, in the very Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces are muſing upon Matters impertinent to the preſent Point.

as well in what reſpects the rational Powers, as in thoſe that are purely Natural. But this Anſwer proceeds from People little skill'd in natural Philoſophy. In the other Unions care ſhould be taken, that the Woman loſe her Fat, and grow ſparer by a ripe Age, and Marry not too young; for thence ariſe half Witted and Fooliſh Children: The Seed of young Parents is very moiſt for it is but a while ſince they were Born, and if a Man be formed of Matter moiſt in Exceſs he will of courſe be a Blockhead.</p>

                  <p>THE Parents that are in queſt of the Joy of Wiſe Children, and towardly for Learning, ſhould endeavour to have Boys; for Girls in reſpect of the Coldneſs and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of their Sex, can never arrive at a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Judgment; On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>y we ſee they ſpeak with a ſhow of Ability in ſlight and eaſy Matters, with ordinary Terms, though ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died: But being ſet to Learning they learn no farther than a little Latin; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a work of the Memory: Which Incapacity is not to be charged on them, but on the Cold and Moiſt that made them Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, being the Qualities (as we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:53763:234"/>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Solomon</hi> in Conſideration of the great Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of wiſe Men, and that there was not ſo much as one Woman furniſhed with Wit and Knowledge, ſpeaks thus: <hi>One Man</hi> ſays he <hi>among a Thouſand have I found, but a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man among all thoſe, have I not found.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are to ſhun them, and apply our Endeavours to get Males, ſince in theſe alone appears a Wit capable of Learning. In which we are firſt of all to conſider what Inſtruments are ordained by Nature in Man's Body, to this End, and what Order of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is to be obſerv'd to attain the End we propoſe.</p>
                  <p>You are to know then that amongſt many Excrements and Humours that are in a Man's Body, <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that Nature makes uſe but of One, to prevent the Species of Men being loſt. Which is a certain Excrement called <hi>Serum,</hi> or <hi>Serous Blood,</hi> generated in the Liver and Veins, at the Inſtant the four Humours, Blood, Flegm, Choler, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, receive what Form and Subſtance they ought to have.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> ſtiles the Vehicle of Meats.</note> Of ſuch a Juice as this, Nature makes uſe for a Vehicle of Food, and to tranſmit it thro' the Veins and narrow Paſſages, to carry Nouriſhment to all Parts of the Body; which Work being done, the ſame Nature has given to us two Reins, which have no
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:53763:235"/>
other Office than to attract to themſelves this <hi>Serous</hi> Humour, and make it deſcend thro' their Paſſages down into the Bladder, and thence out of the Body, and this to free Man from the Anoyance that Excrements give him. But in Conſideration of certain Qualities he has convenient for Generation, ſhe has provided us with two Veins, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part to the Teſticles and Spermatic Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, with a little Blood, whence ſhe frames the Seed,<note rend="inter">She has not planted it but in the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> joined to the Right Rein, that the Serum might be hotter and properer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Boy.</note> ſuch as is convenient for our Species; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſhe has planted one Vein on the Right Rein ſide, which terminates in the Rim of the right Teſticle; and of that ſame, the right Spermatic Veſſel is framed. The other Vein iſſues out of the left Rein, and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in the left Teſticle, and of that is fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the left Spermatic Vein. What Qualities this Excrement has to make convenient Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for generating of Seed, the ſame <hi>Galen</hi> has noted, that they are certain Acrids and Acids that ſpring from a Salt, which irritates the Spermatic Veſſels, and ſtrongly moves the Animal without delay to the Work of Generation; and therefore laſcivious Men are termed in Latin, <hi>Salaces,</hi> as much as to ſay, <hi>Men that have much Salt in their Seed,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this, Nature has done another thing worthy of Conſideration, namely; that to the right Vein and Teſticle ſhe has given much
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:53763:235"/>
Heat and Dryneſs, and to the left Rein and Teſticle much Cold and Moiſture; ſo that the Seed prepared by the right Teſticle, is very hot and dry; and that by the left, cold and moiſt.</p>
                  <p>What Nature pretends to in this Diverſity of Temperaments, as well in the Reins, as Teſticles and Spermatic Veſſels, is very clear, ſince we are informed by very credible Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, that at the beginning of the World, and many Years after, the Women were brought to Bed of two Children at a Birth, one a Boy, and the other a Girl, to the end that each Man might have a Wife, and each Woman a Husband, for the ſpeedier En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Mankind. For this Reaſon then has Nature provided, that the right Rein ſhould furniſh matter hot and dry to the right Teſticle,<note place="margin">If the left Teſticle were tied up, a Boy would be begot, if the right, a Girl. <hi>Hippocrat.</hi>
                     </note> and that the ſame with its great Heat and Dryneſs might produce hot and dry Seed for the generating a Male. And the contrary ſhe has ordered for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Female, that the left Rein ſhould ſend forth cold and moiſt Seed, to the left Teſticle, that the ſame with its Coldneſs and Moiſture might make cold and moiſt Seed, from which a Girl would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be got, and not a Boy.</p>
                  <p>But after the World was once well Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, it ſeems as if Nature had broke off this Order, of this double Child-bearing; and what is worſe, for one Boy there are no leſs
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:53763:236"/>
than ſix or ſeven Girls ordinarily Born; from which it may be underſtood, either that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is tired out, or that ſome Errour hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders her from acting as ſhe would. What the ſame is, we may hereafter declare, when we lay down the Conditions to be obſerved, that a Boy without failing may begot.</p>
                  <p>I ſay then that Fathers in order to attain this End, muſt carefully obſerve ſix Things. The firſt is to eat Meats hot and dry. The ſecond to procure good Digeſtion in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach. The third to uſe much Exerciſe. The fourth not to apply to the Act of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery till the Seed be well ripened and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned. The fifth to Company with the Wife four or five Days before her Menſes. The ſixth to procure that the Seed may fall on the right ſide of the Womb. Which Points being obſerved as we have directed, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to get a Girl.</p>
                  <p>For the Firſt Condition you are to know, that tho' a good Stomach digeſts and alters the Meat, diveſting it of the Qualities it had before, yet it does not entirely deſtroy them. For if we eat Lettuce, (whoſe Nature is cold and moiſt) the Blood it produces will be cold and moiſt, and the Serum cold and moiſt, and the Seed alſo cold and moiſt; and if we eat Honey, (which is hot and dry) the Blood it breeds will be hot and dry, the Serum hot and dry, and the Blood likewiſe hot and dry, becauſe 'tis
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:53763:236"/>
impoſſible as <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de ſang. miſs.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that the Humours ſhould not partake of the Subſtance and Qualities which the Food had before it was eaten. If it be true then that the producing of Males depends on the Seed's being, hot and dry, in the time of the Formation, it is certain that Fathers ought to eat Meats hot and dry to get a Boy. However it muſt be confeſs'd, that there is a very dangerous thing in this Procedure, and it is from the Seed's being very Hot and Dry, as we have often already ſaid, of Courſe there will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a malicious, crafty, deceitful Man, and inclined to all kind of Vices and Ills. And ſuch Men as theſe if they are not curbed, are very dangerous to the State; therefore it were better that they ſhould not be Born. But for all this there will not be wanting ſome that will ſay with the Proverb, <hi>Naſca me hijo varon y ſea Ladron.</hi> Let me have a Boy, and let him be a Thief; becauſe, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> c. 20. <hi>The Iniquity of a Man is more allowable than the well-doing of a Woman.</hi> Tho' this may be eaſily remedied by the uſe of temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Meats, and which partake a little of Hot and Dry, or by the Preparation, as adding Spice thereto.</p>

                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſhould be eat roſted, to heat and dry up the Seed.</p>

                     <pb n="432" facs="tcp:53763:237"/>The Bread they eat ſhould be White, of the fineſt Flower, kneeded with Salt and Aniſeeds, becauſe the Brown is cold and moiſt, (as we ſhall prove hereafter) and very prejudicial to Wit. Let their Drink be Whitewine mixt with Water, in ſuch quantity as the Stomach can bear; and the Water that is mixt ſhould be freſh and pure.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Care we have propoſed to be obſerved is, to eat theſe Meats in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantity, that the Stomach may digeſt them; for tho' by Nature they are hot and dry, yet they become cold and moiſt, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the natural Heat cannot digeſt them; therefore tho' Fathers do eat Honey, and drink White-wine, they'l make their Seed cold by theſe Meats, and ſo get Girls, and not Boys.</p>
                  <p>'Tis for this Reaſon the greateſt part of the Nobility and Gentry, undergo this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune and diſcontent, to have more Girls than poor People; becauſe they Eat and Drink more than their Stomach can bear or digeſt; and tho' their Meats be hot and dry, Sauced with Sugar, Spice, and Honey, through being eaten on too great a quantity, they become crude, and not to be digeſted. But the Crudity more prejudicial to Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is that of Wine; becauſe this Liquor, being ſo vaporous and fumous, cauſes the other Aliments with it ſelf, to paſs wholly undigeſted to the Spermatic Veſſels, and ſo the Seed falſely provokes a Man, e're yet it
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:53763:237"/>
be digeſted and ſeaſoned. Which made <note n="*" place="margin">II. de le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibus.</note> 
                     <hi>Plato</hi> commend ſo highly a Law he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Commonwealth of <hi>Carthage,</hi> by which it was provided that the New-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried-Couple ſhould drink no Wine on the Day they deſigned to lie together; import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this Liquor much incommoded the Child's Health, and that it was Cauſe ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make it Vitious, and of ill Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but if the ſame be moderately taken, there is no Suſtenance affords ſo good Seed, (to the end we propos'd) as White-wine; eſpecially to give Wit and Ability, which is that to which we moſt pretend.</p>
                  <p>The third Caution we preſcribed, was to uſe more than moderate Exerciſe, for this waſts and conſumes the ſuperfluous Moiſture of the Seed, and heats and dries the ſame; by which a Man is rendered prolific, and more able for Generation; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to give our ſelves to Eaſe, and not to Exerciſe of the Body, is one of the ways moſt to cool and moiſten the Seed.

                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> recounts, that the Principal among the <hi>Scythians</hi> were very ſoft and effeminate, and addicted to Women's Works, to Sweep, to Scower, and to Bake, and by this means were impotent in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and if they ever begot a Male Child, it proved an Eunuch, or Hermaphrodite; at
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:53763:238"/>
which being aſhamed, and diſguſted, they reſolved to offer Sacrifices and Gifts to their God, with Prayers not to treat them ſo, or to afford them a Remedy for this Defect, ſince it lay in his Power. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> jeered them, ſaying, that no Effect befalls us but what is Wonderful and Divine, if it be rightly conſidered; for reſolving them all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Natural Cauſes, the laſt terminates in God, by whoſe Power all worldly Agents operate; but that there are ſome Effects that refer immediately to God, (as thoſe out of the Order of Nature) and others, that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately refer to him, running through all the intermediate Cauſes leading to the End.</p>
                  <p>The Country inhabited by the <hi>Scythians</hi> is as <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>Hipporcates</hi> ſaid, Northerly, extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Cold and Moiſt, where through the abundance of Clouds, the Sun is rarely ſeen. Rich Men ſit there always on Horſe-back, never exerciſing; eating and drinking more than their Natural Heat is able to digeſt; all which occaſions the Seed to be cold and moiſt. For which cauſe they get abundance of Girls, and if they happen to have a Boy, 'tis ſuch a one, as we have deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Know, ſaid <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to them, that the Remedy for this is not to offer Sacrifices to God, and no more, but to walk on Foot, Eat little, and Drink leſs, and not ſit always at your Eaſe; and the better to diſcern this, caſt your Eyes on the Poor of your Country,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53763:238"/>
and on your Slaves, who not only make no Sacrifices, nor offer Gifts to God, (not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wherewith) but even Blaſpheme his Bleſſed Name, and ſpeak injuriouſly of him, for placing them in ſo mean a State; and yet tho' ſo Lewd and Blaſphemous, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs moſt potent in Generation, and the greateſt part of their Children, Males, and ſturdy ones, not effeminate Eunuchs, or Hermaphrodites like yours.

For by theſe means they would have had moiſt and cold Seed, whence would have proceeded more Girls than Boys; and in a little time their Lives have been ſhortened, if they had deſired it.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of which, in giving them boyl'd Fleſh to eat, with abundance of Garlic, Leeks, and Onyons, and obliging them to Labour hard, as they did; it produced hot and dry Seed, by which Qualities they were more incited to Generation, and got always Male Children. In Confirmation of this Truth, <note n="*" place="margin">V Sect. pro. XXX</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> asks in one of his Problems, <hi>Whence it comes that thoſe who Labour hard, or thoſe that are Hectic, commit nocturnal Pollutions?</hi> To which in earneſt he knew not what to ſay; for tho' he alledges many Reaſons, yet none of them reach the Mark. The right Reaſon is, that Bodily Labour, and the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctic Fever, heat and dry the Seed; and theſe two Qualities, render it ſharp and pricking, and becauſe all the Natural Powers are fortified in Sleep, this happens, which
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:53763:239"/>
the Problem ſpeaks of. How fruitful and pricking hot and dry Seed is, <hi>Galen</hi> notes in theſe Words, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. art. med c XI.</note> 
                     <hi>It is the moſt fruitful, and briskly excites the Animal from the beginning, even to coition; it is Laſcivious, and prone to Luſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth Condition, is not to engage in the Act of Generation, till the Seed be ſetled, digeſted, and well ſeaſoned; for tho' the three preceeding Cautions be duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, we cannot know thereby, if it have acquired all the Perfection it ought to have. Eſpecially it is convenient to uſe this Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſeven or eight Days before the Meats we have preſcribed, to give time to the Teſticles to convert into their Nouriſhment the Seed, which at that time was made from the other Aliments, and that this which we are deſcribing may Succeed.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Care is to be taken to render human Seed fruitful and prolific as Gardiners take with the Seed they would preſerve; they wait till they ripen, cleanſe and dry; for if they gather them before the proper Seaſon, and point of Maturity, tho' they lie in the Ground a whole Year, they will not grow at all. For this reaſon I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in places where Venus is much uſed, fewer Children are got than where there is more Continence. And light Women prove rarely with Child; becauſe they ſtay not till their Seed be digeſted and ripe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="438" facs="tcp:53763:240"/>It is convenient then to wait ſome Days that the Seed may ſettle, concoct, and ripen, and be duly ſeaſoned: For by this means it will duly gain Heat and Dryneſs and the good Subſtance it has loſt. But how ſhall we know the Seed to be ſuch as it ought to be, ſince the Matter is of ſo great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance? This may be eaſily known, if there be an Interval of a few Days from the Man's denying to Company with his Wife, by the continual irritation, and great Deſire he will have. All which ariſes from the Seed's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fruitful and prolific.</p>
                  <p>The fifth Condition we have directed, was, that the Man ſhould engage with his Wife ſix or ſeven Days before her Courſes, becauſe a Boy has ſoon occaſion for much Aliment to Nouriſh him. And the Reaſon of it is, that the Heat and Dryneſs of his Temperament ſpends and conſumes not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the good Blood of his Mother, but her very Excrements.

                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid, that the Woman that conceives a Boy is well Coloured and Fair, which comes from this, that the Child through his great Heat ſpends for his Nouriſhment, all the Excrements, that were wont to make her Thin and Wan. And being ſo greedy, it is but fit he ſhould be ſupplied with Blood for his Nouriſhment. And this Experience clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proves, for ſeldom is a Boy begot but to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the laſt Days of the Month: It fares
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:53763:240"/>
quite contrary when ſhe conceives a Girl, for through the great coldneſs and moiſture of her Sex, ſhe Eats little, and makes abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Excrements. Accordingly a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child of a Girl looks Yellow and Green, and long's for a Thouſand naſty Things, and in her lying in muſt have longer time to cleanſe than if ſhe brought forth a Boy.

                     <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that brought forth a Male, being unclean ſeven Days, ſhould not come into the Sanctuary till after thirty three Days; but if ſhe bear a Maid-Child, ſhe ſhould be Unclean two Weeks; and ſhould not come into the Sanctuary till ſhe had accompliſh'd threeſcore and ſix Days. So that the time of her Purification was doubled for the Birth of a Female, and the cauſe of it is, that during her Nine Months ſtay in her Mothers Womb, through the much cold and moiſt of her Temperament, ſhe doubled the Excrements of a Boy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that the ſame were of a much worſe Subſtance and Quality. Whereupon <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> obſerved, that 'tis extream Dangerous to ſtop the Purgation of a Woman delivered of a Girl.</p>
                  <p>All this is ſpoke to the Purpoſe, that it is convenient to ſtay to the end of the Month, to the end the Seed may be ſupplied with

Nouriſhment ſufficient. If they couple im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Purgation is over, that Seed will not take, thro' defect of Blood. But I muſt adviſe Parents, that if their Seed meet not together, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. I. de ſemine. c. VI.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> ſaid it would come to nothing; tho' the Man's Seed were never ſo apt for Procreation. The Reaſon of this we will give hereafter on another Subject. It is alike certain, that all we have offered muſt alſo be obſerved by the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, elſe her Seed being ill tempered, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes Generation. Therefore it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that they ſhould both wait, that both their Seeds may meet and mingle. Which is of great importance for the firſt Effort; becauſe the right Teſticle, and it's Sperma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Veſſel, in the Opinion of <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. de ſem. c. V.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> is, that which firſt provokes, and emits it's Seed ſooner than the Left; and if the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be not the firſt Time, it is odds the ſecond may give a Girl and not a Boy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Seeds are known: Firſt by the Heat and Cold; Secondly by the great or little Quantity; Thirdly in this, that one iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues readier than to'ther. The Seed of the right Teſticle paſſes very tickling, and is ſo Hot that it burns the Woman's Matrix, is not much in Quantity, and paſſes in haſt. On the contrary the Seed of the left Teſticle is more temperate, in greater Quantity, and longer in Iſſuing, being Cold and Thick.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="441" facs="tcp:53763:241"/>The laſt Condition, was to procure that the Seed of both ſhould fall on the right ſide of the Matrix, becauſe in that place ſays <note n="*" place="margin">iv. Sect. aph. xlviii.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> the Males are form'd, as the Females on the left. <hi>Galen</hi> aſſigns the Reaſon hereof, ſaying, that the right ſide of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix is very hot, becauſe of its neighbourhood to the Liver, Reigns and ſpermatic Veſſels, that are on the right ſide, which parts we have affirmed, and prov'd to be very hot. And ſince all the reaſon to order that a Boy may be begot, conſiſts in this, that it have a great deal of heat in the time of its conception, it is certain, it much imports, that the Seed fall in this place. Which the Woman can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do, lying upon her right ſide, (after her Husbands embraces) with her Head low, and her Feet raiſed. But ſhe muſt keep her Bed a day or two, becauſe the Matrix em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces not the Seed, but after ſome time. The Signs of knowing whether a Woman be with Child or no, are clear and manifeſt to all; for if when ſhe ſtands up, the Seed fall preſently down, <hi>Galen</hi> ſays ſhe has not conceived. Therefore in this there is one thing to be conſidered, that all the Seed is not fruitful and prolific; for part thereof is wateriſh, whoſe office is to dilute the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Seed, that it may pierce the narrow Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages: And this is that which Nature emits, and it remains after conception with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific part. It is known when it is like Water,
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:53763:242"/>
and in little quantity. To ſtand upon her Legs (immediately after Coupling) is very dangerous. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> adviſes that ſhe beforehand evacuate her Excrements and Urine; that ſhe may have no need to Riſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Mark to diſcover if a Woman be with Child, is, if the day after ſhe feels her Belly empty, and eſpecially about the Navel. And the Reaſon of it, is, that when the Matrix will conceive,<note place="margin">A Boy is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty days, and a Girl fourty two days a forming.</note> it ſtretches and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends extremely; becauſe in a manner it is apt to ſwell and ſtiffen upon this Occaſion, after the ſame faſhion as a Mans Yard, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out after this manner it takes up more room; but at the inſtant it conceives, <note n="*" place="margin">Hippocr. v. aph. li.</note> 
                     <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> ſays, that it cloſes, and draws into the form of a little Egg, to draw the Seed to it, and let nothing out; by which means it leaves a great Vacuity: Which the Women explain, ſaying, that they have no ſlack Guts left, ſoon after they grow big.

                     <hi>Article IV.</hi> What is to be obſerved that the Children may prove Witty and Wiſe.</head>
                  <p>IF the Reaſon and Cauſe be not known beforehand, whence it proceeds, that a Man of great Wit and Capacity is begotten; it is impoſſible to reduce the ſame to an Art; ſince we attain the End by no other Means but by connecting and ordering the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Cauſes. The Aſtrologers hold, that the Child being born under ſuch an Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Stars will be Wiſe, Witty, Well or Ill-condition'd, happy or unhappy, with a thouſand other qualities, and properties, which we ſee and obſerve every day among Men. But if this were true, we could not here preſcribe any Rules; for all would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon Chance, and not be in our Choice.</p>
                  <p>The natural Philoſophers (as <hi>Hippocrates, Plato, Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi>) were of Opinon, that a Man receives the conditions of his Soul at the time of his Formation, and not of his Birth: The Stars only cauſing a ſuperficial Alteration in the Babe, communicating to to him Heat, Cold, Moiſture, Dryneſs, and not his Subſtance whereon his Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; as do the four Elements, (Fire, Earth, Air, Water,) which not only add to the Compoſition, heat, cold, moiſture, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53763:243"/>
but alſo a ſubſtance that unites and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves theſe Qualities during the courſe of Life. So that what is of greateſt Importance in begetting Children, is to endeavour that the Elements from which they are formed, ſhould have the Qualities requiſite to Wit; becauſe that in the ſame Weight and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Elements enter into the Compoſition, in the ſame they remain for ever in the Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; which is not ſo in the Mutations and Influences of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>What theſe Elements are, and after what manner they enter the Woman's Womb to form the Child? <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de Sanit. tuen.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> tells, when he teaches us, that they are the ſame which compound all other natural things, but that the Earth is concealed in the ſolid Meats we Eat, (ſuch as Bread, Fleſh, Fiſh, and Fruits,) the Water under the Liquors we Drink, and for the Air and Fire he ſays, that they are mingled by order of Nature, and enter into the Body by way of the Pulſe and Reſpiration. Of theſe four Elements, (mingled and digeſted by our Natural Heat) are made the two neceſſary Principles, of the Infants Generation, which are the Seed and the Menſtruous Blood.</p>
                  <p>But that whereof we make the greateſt Account (for the Mark we aim at) are the ſolid Meats that are Eaten: For they include within themſelves all the four Elements, and from them the Seed draws more Corpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Quality, than from the Water
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:53763:243"/>
which we drink, or the Fire and Air which we breath. Wherefore <note n="‖" place="margin">Lib. quod ani. c. x.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that the Parents who would beget wiſe Children ſhould read the three Books he writ, <hi>Of the Properties of Aliments,</hi> for there they ſhould find the Meats by which they ſhould effect the ſame. He makes no mention at all of Water nor of the other Elements, as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſmall Conſequence. But he had no Reaſon for this; for Water alters the Body much more than the Air and no leſs than the ſolid Meats we uſe; and as to what regards the Generation of the Seed, the Water alone is of as great Importance, as all the other Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together. The reaſon of it is, as the ſame <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de ſem. c xvi.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that the Teſticles draw from the Veins for their Nouriſhment, the ſerous portion of Blood, and the greateſt part of this ſerous Humour which the Veins receive is from the Water we Drink.</p>
                  <p>And that the Water cauſes a greater Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Body than the Air, <note n="*" place="margin">i Sec. prob. xiii.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> proves, where he demands: Why the change of Water makes ſo great a Change in our Health, and if we breath a contrary Air we are not ſenſible of it? To which he Anſwers, That Water gives Nouriſhment to our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but Air not. But he had no reaſon to Anſwer after this manner, for the Air (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>) yields Nouriſhment and Subſtance as well as Water. And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> deviſed a better An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:53763:244"/>
when he ſaid, That no Place or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try has its peculiar Air, for that which is now in <hi>Flanders</hi> (upon a North Wind riſing) will travel in two or three days to <hi>Africa,</hi> and that which is there, (if the South Wind blows) will veer about to the North, and that which is to day in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> will be carried by an Eaſterly Wind even to the <hi>Weſt Indies.</hi> Which fares not ſo in Waters, for they ſpring not all out of the ſame Earth, and ſo each People have their particular Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, agreeable to the Mineral whence it ſprings, and through which it paſſes. And a Man us'd to one ſort of Water, drinking another is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered more than by new Meats or Air. So that Fathers who deſire to get very wiſe Children, ſhould drink delicate, ſweet and well temper'd Waters, elſe they will loſe their Aim.</p>

<pb n="447" facs="tcp:53763:244"/>
requiſite for Wit, for of theſe Meats is made the Blood, and of the Blood the Seed, and of the Seed the Child. And if the Meat be delicate and of good Temperament, ſuch alſo is the Blood, and of ſuch Blood ſuch Seed, and of ſuch Seed ſuch Brains. And if they be Temperate, and compos'd of a delicate and ſubtil Subſtance, <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. art. med. c.xii.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that the Wit will be the ſame; becauſe the Rational Soul, though it be incorruptible ever ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizes with the Diſpoſitions of the Brain, which not being ſuch as are requiſite for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Diſcourſe, it ſays and does a thou-Impertinences.

I ſaid <hi>ſeaſoned with Salt,</hi> becauſe of all the Meats in uſe among Men, none makes the Underſtanding ſo good as this Foſſile. It is cold, and of more Dryneſs than any thing elſe; and if we remember <hi>Heraclitus</hi>'s ſaying, he ſays as much, <hi>A dry Light is the Wiſe Mind.</hi> By which he would give us to underſtand, that the Dryneſs of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:53763:245"/>
the Body makes the wiſeſt Soul: And ſince Salt is ſo dry and ſo appropriate to Wit, it is not without reaſon Holy Writ gives it the Appellation of Prudence and Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>But you muſt chuſe Salt that is extreamly white, and that ſalts not much, becauſe that is compos'd of ſubtil and very delicate Parts; and on the contrary, the black is very Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and Ill-temper'd, and ſalts more in ſmall quantity. What important effects Salt cauſes being caſt upon Meats, not only thoſe taken by Men and Beaſts, but alſo by Plants, <hi>Plato</hi> noted when he ſaid, That Salt not only gives reliſh and pleaſure to the Palate, but gives a formal Being to Meats to the end they may Nouriſh: There is but one fault, and that is a great one; it is, upon the failing of that, there is nothing left in the World to ſupply it's Place. All other things made uſe of by Man in this Life, have their Deputy, if we may ſo call it, when they chance to fail; Salt alone ſtands for the end it was ordained. For if we want Wheaten-Bread, there, is Barly-Bread, Rye, Oaten and other Kinds; and if Wine fails us, there is Water, Beer, Milk, Cyder, and Perry; and if we have no Cloth to cover us, there are Beaſts Skins, (with which God cloathed our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> when he drove them out of the Earthly <hi>Paradiſe)</hi> nay alſo Cloth of Linnen, Silk, Canvas and other Matters; And ſo if they ſhould run through other things, we ſhall find that they
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:53763:245"/>
all have a ſupply for their Defect, Salt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, which was made for that uſe alone to which we put it. To which property our Lord alludes in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> when he ſaid to his Diſciples, <hi>Ye are the Salt of the Earth, but if the Salt have loſt it's Savour, wherewith ſhall it be Salted?</hi> or, as <hi>another Goſpel</hi> ſays, <hi>Wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſoned?</hi> To give them to underſtand, that if they who are the Salt are corrupted or unſavoury, there is no other thing can Seaſon them, as if it had ſaid, <hi>Who can find a Remedy for an Enchanter?</hi> The <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> might have ſaid, ye are the Wheaten Bread of my Church, to diſpenſe and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Spiritual Food, and Doctrin to the Faithful, and if you caſt your ſelves away, with what other thing ſhall I ſuſtain my Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? They might have anſwered him with Barly-Bread, (as you did in the Deſart?) But becauſe nothing can Supply the Place of Salt, God took it and choſe it to let the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles underſtand what was their Duty. Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians ſay, <hi>That Salt ordinarily heats, diſſolves, penetrates, dries, collects and ſeparates the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bodies to which it is Applied.</hi> Which Properties he is to have that is the Salt of the Church, and ſuch effects ought he to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in the Chriſtian Auditory that is a good Preacher: If not, let him that has a little Wit run through theſe properties and he will ſee how much it is to the purpoſe, that God calls Preachers by the name of Salt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="450" facs="tcp:53763:246"/>But neither the natural Philoſophers nor others that have ſearched into the properties of this Foſſile, have obſerved one thing, which is, that if we would Unſalt in a little time that which is very Salt, throwing Salt thereon to a certain degree and quantity, and for a certain time, it abates of its Saltneſs, and if it exceeds, it all turns to Brine. Of which if any one would try the Experiment, he ſhall find that ſalt Fiſh put to freſhen in Sea-Water for a certain time, ſhall ſooner freſhen than in Freſh-Water. And if two pieces of Fiſh equally Salt, are put in two Veſſels of Freſh-Water to freſhen, that on which a handful of Salt is thrown, will freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſooner than the other. A Preacher of good Wit and full of Invention drew from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty a gentile Meditation for Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eliſha</hi> may have grounded on the Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe natural Properties mentioned by us, or at leaſt in good part, when with a Veſſel of Salt he cured the poyſonous and deadly Waters of a certain Country, making the Earth fruitful, which was barren before. Which is eaſy to prove if we firſt agree upon the three Natural Principles, ſo true that no Man can deny them.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, that of four Unions or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations that may be made of the firſt Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, (hot and moiſt, hot and dry, cold and moiſt, cold and dry) all the Phyſitians and Philoſophers ſay of the firſt Combination,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:53763:246"/>
that it is the utter Ruin and total Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Natural Things, becauſe the Ambient Heat joyned with Moiſture, relaxes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables the Elements that enter the Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mixture, and rends them from their Union, ſo far that each (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſays) divides a ſeveral Way.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Principle is, that all Earths have not the ſame Quality; ſince (as <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> ſaid) ſome are moiſt, others dry; ſome hot, others cold; ſome ſweet, others bitter; ſome inſipid and wateriſh, and others ſalt; ſome crude, and others eaſy of digeſtion; ſome rude and rough, and others ſoft. Which Nature did not without Deſign, nor by Chance; but with great Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, having regard to the great Diverſity of Plants and Seeds nouriſhed by the Earth, for all uſe not the ſame ſort of Aliment. If in two Feet of Earth (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſays) Onyons, Lettice, Peaſe and Lupins, are Planted, Onyons draw of the Earth for their Nouriſhment that which is Acrid and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Lettice that which is Sweet, Peaſe that which is Salt, and Lupins that which is Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And thus there is neither Herb nor Plant, that draws not from the Earth the Aliment which is moſt friendly and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling it, quitting the reſt, which it finds neither Reliſhable nor Familiar; but after ſuch a faſhion, that it fails not to make its uſe and advantage of other Differences of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:53763:247"/>
Earth, in as much as Nature has made of all together a certain Preparative and Seaſoning which has in it ſelf, Sweet, Salt, Acrid, or I know not what that bites, like Pepper and Spice, after the manner of ſome <hi>Salmigondis</hi>; for after another manner Experience teaches us, that many Herbs blended together (tho' they be of different Natures) draw away the Virtue from one another. What <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> meant is, that Lettuce draws from ſweet Earth, four Ounces, and a Drachm of the reſt; and Peaſe from that which is Salt, two Ounces, and very little from other Earth; and the like of the other Differences. But if the Earth be inſipid, and without any Salt, it can ſuſtain no Plant, in as much as the Formal Being of Aliments, and what ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders them apt to Nouriſh, proceeds (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſays) from Salt, and is not like other forc'd Meats or Junkets, that awaken the Appetite to recreate it, and no more; From whence it is certain, that the Aliments and Fruits that Nature has made Delicious in Guſt, are not ſo for any other Reaſon, but that Nature forming them, gave them what they wanted, of Salt.</p>
                  <p>The third Principle, is, that the Plants have a Senſe and Notice of Nouriſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their Nature, and though diſtant, they draw it to them, as well as fly their Contraries. Which <hi>Plato</hi> fairly confeſſes, when it ſeems impoſſible to him, that three
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:53763:247"/>
or four different Aliments lying near their Roots, ſhould chooſe that which is not Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, and Convenient for them, and leave the other as diſagreeable and Forreign; and of thoſe they digeſt and alter, they want not the Senſe to draw that which is moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and receive it, refuſing the reſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſing it, even to the baniſhing it at ſome Diſtance from their Branches; Which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wonderfully pleaſed <hi>Galen,</hi> ſo that he ſaid, <hi>I commend</hi> Plato <hi>for having call'd the Plants by the name of Animals; for we canot ſay but they attract the Juices fit for them, turning them into their Subſtance, which not without a kind of Satisfaction and Complacence they receive:</hi> In which words <hi>Galen</hi> frankly owns with <hi>Plato</hi> that Plants have a Senſe, and that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain themſelves with Aliments of a good Savour and agreeable to their Appetite, and abhor thoſe of an ill Guſt, as if they acted the part of real Animals.</p>
                  <p>From theſe Principles, we may ſomewhat ſolve the Miracle of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> for if the Earth corrected and cured (by caſting Salt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was poor and wateriſh, by means of Salt it became ſavoury and fit to bear; and if through the Heat and Moiſture of the Air, (that is in the Caverns of the Earth) the Waters were found ſtinking and corrupt; the ſame was naturally remedied by the Qualities of Salt which we have mentioned; and if the Earth was barren through the
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:53763:248"/>
too great quantity of Salt, by means of the ſame Salt ſowed therein, it came to be freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The Miracle was, that <hi>Eliſha</hi> with one only Veſſel full of Salt, cured, if I may ſay ſo, and meliorated ſo great a quantity of Earth and Water; as it fared in the Miracle of the Wilderneſs, where with five Barley Loaves and two Fiſhes, God fed five thouſand Men, and twelve Basketsful remained, to which Act, Nature ſerved the Bread and the Fiſh, (whoſe property was to Support and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh) and God beſtowed on it the Quantity neceſſary for Refreſhment.</p>
                  <p>Partridges and Woodcocks have the ſame Subſtance and Temperament with Wheaten Bread; and Kid, and Muſcatel Wine; and if Fathers uſe theſe Meats as we have above ſpecified, they will beget Children of good Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>And if they would have a Child of a great Memory, let them eat eight or nine days before the Act of Copulation, Trouts, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, Lampreys, Barbels and Eels; which Meats produce a moiſt and clammy Seed. Theſe two Qualities, as we have ſaid before,<note rend="inter">Note, that Man is free, and Lord of his own works; <hi>God from the beginning made Man, and left him to his own Conduct;</hi> though he be ſeduced by his own bad Temperament.</note> make the Memory eaſy to receive and very tenacious to keep the Figures long. By Pidgeons, Kid, Onyons, Garlic, Leeks, Radiſhes, Pepper, Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, White-Wine, Honey, and all ſorts of Spice, the Seed is made hot and
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:53763:248"/>
dry, and of very delicate Parts. The Boy that is engendred from this Food, will be of a great Imagination, but not of like Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, by means of much Heat; and of little Memory, from great Dryneſs. Such are very dangerous to a State, becauſe their Heat inclines them to many Vices and Evils, and gives them Wit and Spirit to put them in practice. But if they be kept under, the Common-Wealth will receive more Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from their Imaginations, than from their Underſtandings or Memories.</p>
                  <p>The Phyſitians finding by Experience the great Power the Temperament of the Brain has, to make a Man Wiſe and Conſiderate, have invented a certain Medicine, compoſed after ſuch a manner, and provided with ſuch qualities that being taken in a due Meaſure and Quantity, makes a Man reaſon much better than before. They call it the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Wiſe Men,</hi> or rather <hi>Confectio Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardina,</hi> in which (as may be learn'd from the Receipt) is put freſh Butter of Cows, and Honey, from which two Ingredients the <hi>Greeks</hi> have ſaid, that they who uſe it, ſhall have their Underſtandings much ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; but if the other Drugs that compoſe it, be conſidered, without doubt they are very hot and dry, utterly deſtroying the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Memory; though it cannot be denyed but that they render them more brisk to ſpeak and anſwer to the purpoſe,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53763:249"/>
with ſharp Repartees and pretty Simile's, to Redicule and Banter, and that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the moſt part of thoſe that uſe them, to make Verſes, and to other Talents, which elevate the Wit of Man into Raptures. Now as the People know not how to diſtinguiſh, nor to make a Difference between the Works of the Underſtanding, and thoſe of the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, when they obſerve thoſe that have taken this <hi>Confection,</hi> ſpeak more ſubtilly than they us'd, they ſay they have acquired more Underſtanding; which is not ſo in Effect, but on the contrary, they have loſt what they had, and have only got a kind of Knack, that is not good for a Man to have, which <hi>Cicero</hi> called <hi>Fineneſs,</hi> which is a Skill contrary to Honeſty.</p>
                  <p>As often as I fell upon this paſſage in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis,</hi> that ſays, <hi>Who told thee that thou waſt Naked, haſt thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat?</hi> It came to my Mind, that the Fruit of the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> had a natural Property to give more Knowledge and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection to him that eat of it; but that that Knowledge was not ſo convenient for Man, and God would not that he ſhould poſſeſs it, becauſe it was of that kind of Knowledge of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke, <hi>The Carnal Mind is En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God.</hi> But conſidering the ſacred Scripture has ſo deep a Senſe, and thoſe that know little, often deceive themſelves much
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53763:249"/>
in ſticking to the Letter, I many times wave that Thought, till in the end the ſame Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty returning ſo often to my Mind, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to read what I could meet with in the <hi>Commentators</hi> upon the <hi>Place,</hi> to ſee if ſome One of them was not of my Opinion; and ſoon after reading in the Antiquities of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> I found that he ſaid, <hi>that the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil,</hi> quicken'd the uſe of Reaſon, and ſharpen'd the Underſtanding, and in regard of this Property, it had this Name, as the other, that <hi>of the Tree of Life,</hi> becauſe it made the Man Immortal that eat of its Fruit. This Expoſition and Opinion nevertheleſs is not at all received by <hi>Nicholas de Lyra,</hi> for he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited that the Fruit of a Tree that was Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, could not affect the Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, which is wholly Spiritual. <hi>Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenſis</hi> do's not abſolutely admit the Inſtance of <hi>Nicholas de Lyra,</hi> but with Diſtinction: Tho' ſaid he, the Human Underſtanding be a Spiritual Power that acts not with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Inſtruments, yet for all that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding cannot apprehend any thing, but by making uſe of ſome other Organic Powers, which if they have a good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, much aſſiſt the Underſtanding; if not, they only ſerve to Deceive it. But ſo it is that the Fruit of that Tree was able to introduce ſuch a Temperament in the Brain, that the Man might come to be
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:53763:250"/>
more Knowing. But that the good or bad Temperament of the Food, could aſſiſt or hurt his Wiſdom, he proves from this place in Holy Writ, <hi>I framed a deſign in my Heart to wean my Fleſh from Wine, to the end my Wit might bend with more diſpoſition to Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> He quotes <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> alſo in his Books of <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> where he ſaies that the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations the Body ſuffers by reaſon of the Meats a Man receives, and the Temperament of the Region where he dwells, like as other things which are us'd to change and alter the Body, paſs even to the Rational Soul; and therefore he ſaies that Men inhabiting in an extreme hot Country, are wiſer than thoſe that live in very cold Regions; and <hi>Vegetius</hi> affirms that thoſe who live under the fith Climate, (as the <hi>Spaniards, Italians</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi>) are Men of great Wit and of great Spirit. According to which Doctrin, it may well be that the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> had ſuch Efficacy to alter the Organic Powers of the Body, which ſerve to better Reaſoning. And becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was very Wiſe and had no need of any other Science, God eſtabliſht a Law, and laid a Command touching this <hi>Fruit,</hi> to preſerve it for his Succeſſors, who in their Infancy eating of the ſame, might quicken the uſe of their Reaſon. But the Words of the Text bear not all this laſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, for take them right, and conſider them as they lie, the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> by it's
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53763:250"/>
Virtue and Efficacy had opened their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Eyes, and had taught them what they knew not. <hi>And the Eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> Which is yet more clearly proved, if we weigh well the Words ſpoke by God, to the Man, when he found him Aſhamed to ſee his Nakedneſs. <hi>Who told thee that thou wer't Naked, haſt thou eaten of that Tree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I commanded thee that thou ſhould'ſt not eat?</hi> Biſhop <hi>Nemeſius</hi> in the Book he writ of <hi>the Nature of Man,</hi> fairly confeſſes, <hi>that the Fruit of that Tree had a Natural Property to give Wiſdom, and that it really taught Adam what he knew not at all, and that this was not only found out at the Beginning of the World, when the Aliments had ſo much Virtue to alter the Body of Man: But even at this Hour, tho' they are corrupted by ſo long a Courſe of Time, there is abundance of Fruit can do it; and becauſe it was not to the purpoſe that our Firſt Parents ſhould entirely know their Nature, nor what things they ſtood in need of, God laid his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Tree, whoſe property was to caſt Man upon the care of the Body, and to draw him from the Contemplation of the Soul.</hi> This Expoſition is agreeable to Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of which we treat, for there is no Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (eſpecially among Fruits that are for Food which have a Medicinal Virtue) which affect not the Brain, according to the ſaying of <hi>Hippocrates, that the Faculty of Food
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53763:251"/>
reaches the Brain,</hi> and introduces in Man the Ability that bears the Temperament which it produces in the Head, as it happens in Wine, which when it is drank, to a certain quantity, makes a Man Witty, but if in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it makes him a Fool and Mad. But it is not to be imagined that the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Forbidden-Tree,</hi> gave immediately Habits of Knowledge, (as <hi>Lyranus</hi> thought) it gave only a Temperament accomodated to ſuch a kind of Knowledge; by means of which Man came ſo ſoon to know ſome things he never dreamt of. But that the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Tree</hi> had the property to open the Eyes, is not to be denied, ſeeing the Text ſays, that eating of the Fruit, <hi>their Eyes were opened, and they knew that they were Naked,</hi> I ſaid, that it had the property, <hi>to open the Eyes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as we have elſewhere prov'd, if the Imagination lend not it's Aſſiſtance to the Exterior Senſes, not one of them can act, which is what <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſaid, <hi>that let a grievous Pain be inflicted on any by Cautery or Amputation of a Hand, and if he preceives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it,</hi> it is an infallible ſign that his Imagination is diſtracted in ſome profound Amuſement or Madneſs, for as we have ſaid, if the Imagination contribute not it's Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the Touch, and other Exterior Senſes, no Senſation can be perform'd, of which we can alledge abundance of Inſtances, in things that happen every Day among us;
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:53763:251"/>
but that which <hi>Plutarch</hi> reports of <hi>Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> will render it ſufficiently intellegible. This <hi>Archimedes</hi> was a Man endu'd with ſo ſtrong an Imagination to invent and make War-like Engines, that for this Reaſon he was more formidable alone to the Enemies than a whole Army, and his Wit was in ſo high eſteem among the <hi>Romans,</hi> that <hi>Marcellus</hi> holding the City of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> beſieged, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Archimedes</hi> was) before he made his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, publiſh'd throughout the Camp that no Soldier ſhould preſume to kill <hi>Archimedes,</hi> upon pain of Death, imagining that he could not ſhow <hi>Rome</hi> a more noble Spoil, than in bringing thither ſo Great a Man. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of him, that he was ſo employed about his Engins, and had his Eyes ſo fixt on the Earth, (where he had drawn ſome Schemes of his own Invention) that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw nor heard as others did what paſt in the City, in the time of Battel: For a <hi>Roman Soldier</hi> being come up to him, askt him if he were not <hi>Archimedes,</hi> and after asking him the ſame ſeveral times, the other making him no Anſwer, (his Thoughts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing otherwiſe deeply engaged) this Soldier affronted to ſee a Man ſo Stupid in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſlew him. According to this it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that our Firſt Parents (before they Sinn'd) were wholly engaged in the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Contemplation of Divine Things, loſing all thought of thoſe of the World:
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53763:252"/>
And tho' they went Naked, they were ſcarce Senſible of it; and we may ſay that their Eyes were cloſed, becauſe tho' it was true that they were open, and the Viſive Faculty very ſound and intire; nevertheleſs becauſe the Imagination was diverted elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where and abſent, they remain'd as it were Blind, (ſince they had no uſe of their Eyes.) Now this <hi>Fruit</hi> was of ſuch Virtue that it drew the Imagination out of it's deep Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation and brought it down and fixt it on the Sight. Which theſe words plainly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify that God ſpoke to them (as ſoon as they eat of the <hi>Fruit) Who told thee that thou waſt Naked? haſt thou eaten of the Tree whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat?</hi> Which I did, (we may add) for thy Good and Satisfaction, and becauſe it was more convenient that thou ſhouldſt not know what thou now knoweſt.</p>
                  <p>We have obſerv'd in the other part (if I remember well) two kinds of Wiſdom, one belonging to the Underſtanding, under which are contain'd all the things Man does with Uprightneſs and Simplicity, without Error, without Lying or Deceit. Which Wiſdom <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> prais'd to the Judges in an <hi>Oration</hi> he made againſt <hi>Eſchines,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the beſt Title he could give them, to gain their Good-will, was to call them, <hi>juſt and ſimple.</hi> Thus the holy Writ has term'd a Man wiſe and vertuous, as <hi>Job</hi>
                     <pb n="461" facs="tcp:53763:252"/>
was a <hi>juſt Man and upright,</hi> becauſe double and deceitful Hearts are not at all Friends of God, <hi>A double-minded Man is unſtable in all his ways.</hi> There is another kind of Wiſdom in Man belonging to the Imagination, of which <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid, <hi>That what Men compaſs with Wiles and Tricks, and againſt which Reaſon and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice dictate, merits not to be called by the Name of Wiſdom, but rather of Fineneſs and of Craft.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Diſcourſe the <hi>unjuſt Steward</hi> made to himſelf, of whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks when he ſaid, <hi>There was a certain Rich Man that had a Steward, and the ſame was accuſed to him, that he had waſted his Goods; and he call'd him, and ſaid unto him, how is it that I hear this of thee? Give an Account of thy Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſhip, for thou mayeſt be no longer Steward. Then the Steward ſaid within himſelf, what ſhall I do, for my Lord has taken away from me the Stewardſhip; I cannot dig, to beg I am aſhamed, I am reſolved what to do! that when I am put out of the Stewardſhip, they may receive me into their Houſes,</hi> &amp;c. By which means he ſo ordered Matters, that the ſacred Text ſaies, <hi>The Lord commended the unjuſt Steward, for he had done wiſely, for the Children of this World, are wiſer in their Generation than the Children of Light.</hi> In which words two dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Wiſdom and Prudence are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, one, ſaies the Text, belongs to the <hi>Children of Light:</hi> which is attended <hi>with
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:53763:253"/>
Juſtice and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi>: and the other to the <hi>Children of this World,</hi> which is only <hi>Craft and Deceit.</hi> Now the <hi>Children of Light</hi> are very little skill'd in Worldly Wiſdom, and the <hi>Children of this World</hi> yet leſs in the Wiſdom of Light. Whilſt <hi>Adam</hi> was in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he was a Child of Light, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſe in this firſt kind of Wiſdom; and for his greater Perfection, God had made him ignorant as to the ſecond kind of Wiſdom, in as much as it was leſs Convenient for him. Now the <hi>Tree</hi> had ſo much Power to give the Wiſdom of this World, that there was occaſion to forbid him the Uſe of it's <hi>Fruit,</hi> to the end he might live without care of the Neceſſities or the Body, (as ſaid <hi>Nemeſius)</hi> and that he might be wholly engaged in the Contemplations of the Rational Soul.</p>
                  <p>The Difficulty is to know why this <hi>Tree</hi> was called <hi>the Tree of Knowledge of Good,</hi> ſince the Prudence and Wiſdom it commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated more regarded Evil than Good. To this is anſwer'd, that both the two Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are for Good, (when they are uſed in due Time and Place) and thus <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> recommended them to his Diſciples, when he ſent them to Preach throughout the World, <hi>Behold I ſend you as Sheep amongſt Wolves, be ye Wiſe as Serpents, and Innocent as Doves.</hi> We ought to make uſe of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as a Defence againſt Evils that may be done us, but not to Offend any. Beſides
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:53763:253"/>
this the Moral Philoſophers ſay, that the ſelf-ſame thing may be called Good or Bad,<note place="margin">Bonum Honeſtum Utile, aut Jucun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</note> in one of theſe three Reſpects: either as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt,</hi> or <hi>Profitable,</hi> or <hi>Pleaſant</hi>; For Example, the ſlight of the <hi>unjust Steward,</hi> which we mention'd, was good, in regard of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, ſeeing he remain'd with his Maſters Money; and ill, in as much as it was againſt Honeſty; in taking to himſelf what belong'd to his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Adam</hi>'s care of covering himſelf, and being Aſham'd to ſee himſelf Naked before God, after having violated his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, we underſtand that the <hi>Forbiden-Fruit</hi> made his Imagination more lively (after the manner we have mention'd) and then it repreſented to him the Nature and Uſe of the ſhameful Parts. But yet that this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may be veritable enough, as we ſee the common Opinion is, that the <hi>Tree</hi> of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> received not this Name from it's Nature, but only by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the Conſequence that attended it, Which ſeems to me moſt Probable.</p>
                  <p>Hens, Capons, Veal, and <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, are Meats of a moderate Subſtance, for theſe are neither Delicate nor Groſs. I ſaid <hi>Spaniſh Weathers,</hi> becauſe <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. III. de alim. fac. c. II.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Diſtinction, ſaid, That their Fleſh is of evil and groſs Subſtance, for which there is no Reaſon. For tho' in <hi>Italy</hi> where he writ, this is the worſt Fleſh of all,

                  <p>In my Opinion, to ſay that a Man's Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren are born of ſo different Figures, becauſe of the Diverſe Imagination of the Fathers, is even as if one ſhould ſay, that of Grains ſome are big, others little, becauſe the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-man

                     <hi>Whence it comes that the Excrements of Brute Beaſts are not ſo fetid as Man's?</hi> For ſay they, theſe Brute Animals always uſe the ſame Meats, and abundance of Exerciſe; whereas Man eating a great many, and of ſo diverſe Subſtance, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not maſter them, and ſo they come to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.

                  <p>As touching the Variety of Meats Man eats it cannot be denied, but muſt be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that of every Aliment is produced a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and particular Seed; and it is no leſs certain, that the ſame day a Man eats Beef or Black Pudding, it makes the Seed groſs and of bad Temperament; therefore the Child begot thereof, will be hard-Favored, Fooliſh, Swarthy, and of ill-Conditions: And if he eats the Breaſt of a Capon or Hen, it will make his Seed white, delicate, and of good Temperament; and the Boy thence
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:53763:257"/>
begot, will be Graceful, Wiſe, and of very affable Diſpoſition. Hence I collect, that there is no Child born but he contracts the Qualities and Temperament of the Meats his Parents eat the Day before they got him. And if any deſire to know of what Meats he is form'd, he has no more to do, than to conſider what Meat is moſt familiar to his Stomach, and that is it, without doubt.</p>

                  <p>True it is, that to render a Convenient Anſwer, it is no leſs than neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe and prove certain Points, one of which is, that the Rational Faculty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Iraſcible and Concupiſcible: In ſuch ſort, that if a Man be very Wiſe, he cannot be very Couragious, of great Bodily Strength, a great Eater, nor very able for

Procreation; for the Natural Diſpoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the Acting of the Rational faculty, are directly contrary to thoſe requiſite to the Iraſcible and Concupiſcible.</p>
                  <p>Courage and Natural Strength, ſays <note n="*" place="margin">xiv Sect. pro. xv.</note> 
                     <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> (and it is true) conſiſt in Heat; and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Wiſdom in Cold and Dryneſs. And we ſee by plain Experience that the moſt Valiant are void of Reaſon, ſpare of Speech, impatient of Jeſts, and are ſoon baulk'd. To remedy which, they preſently clap their Hands on their Swords, being able to give no other Anſwer. But Men of Wit are provided with Reaſons, ſharp Anſwers and Repartees, with which they take up time, to avoid coming to Blows. Such a manner of Wit <hi>Saluſt</hi> noted in <hi>Cicero,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him his Tongue was well hung, and he had a nimble pair of Heels; and not without reaſon, for ſo great a Wiſdom could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear without Cowardiſe in Arms. From whence aroſe that biting Sarcaſm, that ſays, <hi>He is as Valiant as Cicero, and as Wiſe as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,</hi> to Stigmatize a Fool, or a Coward. No leſs does the Animal Faculty contradict the Underſtanding: For a Man of much Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Strength, cannot have a delicate Wit: And the reaſon is, that the force of the Arms and Legs ariſe from having a hard and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Brain; and though it be true, that from the cold and dry of the Earth he might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a good Underſtanding, yet being of ſo
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:53763:258"/>
groſs a Subſtance, it is deſtroyed; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out loſs by the way, for through his Coldneſs his Skill and Courage is extinguiſhed. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we have ſome Men of great Strength, very Cowards.</p>
                  <p>The Contrariety the Vegetative Soul has with the Rational is moſt notorious of all: becauſe its Operations (which are to nouriſh and engender) are better perform'd with Heat and Moiſture, than with the contrary Qualities: which Experience clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts, conſidering how powerful it is in the Age of Childhood, and how weak and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs it is in old Age: and in Youth the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul cannot act, but in Declining Age (which is void of heat and moiſture) it works wonderfully. So that how much the more a Man is enabled for Procreation, and for Digeſtion of Food, ſo much the more he loſes of the Rational Faculty. To this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes the Saying of <note n="*" place="margin">Dialo. de natura.</note> 
                     <hi>Plato,</hi> that there is no Humour in Man that ſo much diſturbs the Rational Faculty as fruitful Seed; only ſays he, the ſame helps the Art of Verſifying, which we ſee by daily Experience, that as ſoon as a Man falls into Amours, he forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with becomes a Poet; and if he were before ſlovenly and ungentile, he will not bear the leaſt Wrinkle in his Shoes, or Hair upon his Coat. And the Reaſon is, becauſe thoſe Works belong to the Imagination, which encreaſes and riſes to a pitch, through the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:53763:259"/>
great heat raiſed from the paſſion of Love. And that Love is a hot Paſſion is plainly ſeen in the Courage and Hardineſs Lovers are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd with, to bear the loſs of Appetite, and even of Sleep it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>If the State had an Eye to theſe Marks, they would expel from the Univerſities luſty Scholars, and great Fighters, the Amorous, the Poets and the Beaux, becauſe theſe have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wit nor Capacity for any kind of Study. <note n="*" place="margin">iv Sect. pro. xxxi.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> excepts from this Rule the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholick by Aduſtion; whoſe Seed (though fruitful) hurts not their Wit.</p>
                  <p>Finally, all the ruling Faculties in Man, if they be very potent, diſturb the Rational Faculty. Hence it proceeds, that if a Man be very Wiſe, he proves a Coward, of ſmall Strength of Body, a ſpare Eater, and not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry able for Procreation. And the cauſe is, the qualities that render him Wiſe, (which are Coldneſs and Dryneſs) are the ſame that debilitate the other Powers: As appears in Old Men, who beſides their Council and Wiſdom have neither Strength nor Courage.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrin being ſuppos'd, <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de ſem. c viii.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi>'s opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that to have the Generation of any Animal whatever perfectly take effect, both Seeds are neceſſary; one of which is to be the Agent and the Form-giver, and another which ſerves for Nouriſhment; for a matter ſo delicate as Generation, cannot ſtrait over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come what is ſo groſs as Blood, till the work
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53763:259"/>
be accompliſhed. But that the Seed is the right Aliment of the Spermatic Veſſels is a point duly received by <hi>Hippocrates, Plato</hi> and <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>: For by their Opinion, if the Blood be not converted into Seed, it is impoſſible that the Nerves, Veins and Arteries can be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd. And ſo ſays <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. i. de ſem. c. xv.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen,</hi> that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Veins and Teſticles, is, that the Teſticles make abundance of Seed immediately, and the Veins little, in longer time. So that Nature has provided for the ſame an Aliment ſo ſimilar that with a ſlight Alteration and without making Excrements, may maintain another Seed. Which could not be effected, if the Nouriſhment thereof had been made of the Blood.<note n="*" place="margin">Lib. ii. de ſem. c. xvi.</note> The ſame Proviſion ſays <hi>Galen</hi> is made by Nature in the Generation of Man, as in the Production of a Chicken, and ſuch other Birds as come of Eggs, in which we obſerve two Subſtances; one of the White and another of the Yolk; of one of which the Chicken is form'd, and by the other nouriſhed, all the time of its formation. For the ſame reaſon are two Seeds no leſs neceſſary in the Generation of Man; of one of which the Child may be Made, and the other for it's Nouriſhment, during the time of it's formation. But <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de genitura.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> mentions a thing worthy of great Conſideration, which is, that it is not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Nature, which of the two Seeds is to be the Agent and the Form-giver, nor
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:53763:260"/>
which is to ſerve for Nouriſhment; For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the Woman's Seed is of more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than the Man's: and when it ſo happens, Hers makes the Generation, and the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's ſerves for the Aliment. At other times the Man's is more powerful and prolific, and the Woman's ſerves only for Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>This was a Doctrin not underſtood by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who could not comprehend, what the Woman's Seed ſerved for, which made him vent a thouſand Impertinencies, as that the ſame was but a little Water, without any Generative Virtue or Power. If this were ſo, the Woman would never covet the Converſation of the Man, or conſent thereto, but would ſhun the Carnal Act, as being her ſelf naturally Honeſt, and the Sport Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and Filthy. And ſo in a ſhort time Mankind would be extinguiſhed, and the World remain depriv'd of the moſt beautiful Creature, that ever Nature form'd.</p>
                  <p>And therefore <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> demands, what is the reaſon that Copulation is the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pleaſure of all thoſe Nature has invented for the Procreation of Animals? To which Problem he anſwers, that Nature having ſo great a deſire to procure the Perpetuating of Mankind, placed ſo much Pleaſure in this Work, to the end that they being moved by ſuch an Intereſt, might gladly apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Buſineſs of Generation; for if theſe Incentives were wanting, no Man or
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:53763:260"/>
Woman would Marry (the Woman reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little other Advantage than that of bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Burden nine Months in her Belly, with ſo much Pain and Trouble, and at the time of her Delivery of running the hazard of her Life) ſo that it would oblige the State to force Women to Marry, to prevent the Extirpation of Mankind.</p>
                  <p>But as Nature makes every thing with Sweetneſs, ſhe gave to the Woman all the neceſſary Inſtruments to make her Seed prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and prolific, that ſhe might take Pleaſure in Man, and covet his Company. Though were it of that quality <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> pretends, ſhe would rather ſhun and abhor him, than ever love him. This <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. i. de ſem. cap. xxv.</note> 
                     <hi>Galen</hi> proves by an inſtance drawn from Brute Beaſts; affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that after a Sow is Splay'd, ſhe never deſires the Boar, nor will ſhe yield to his Approaches. It is the ſame thing in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that is of a colder Conſtitution, than ſhe ought, nothing ſounds more diſagreeable to her Ear than the name of Marriage to her. The ſame thing attends a Man of a cold Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and all for want of fruitful Seed.</p>
                  <p>Moreover if a Woman's Seed were ſuch as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, it would not ſerve for Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſince to obtain the laſt Qualities of actual Nutriment, it ought to be entirely Similar, to what it is to Nouriſh. And if the Seed be not well wrought and aſſimilated, it would not afterwards attain it: For if the
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:53763:261"/>
Seed of Man wanted Inſtruments and Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, (ſuch as the Stomach, the Liver and Teſticles) how or where ſhould it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct or aſſimilate? For which reaſon Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has ordered it ſo that there ſhould be two Seeds in the Generation of the Creature, which being incorporated, the moſt Potent ſhould make the Formation, and the other ſerve for Nouriſhment. And that this is true, appears plain in this, that if a Negro get a White Woman with Child, and a White-Man a Negro-Woman, from both will be born a Mulatta Child.</p>
                  <p>From this Doctrin I gather that to be true which many Authentic Hiſtories affirm, that a Dog companying with a Woman, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the like did a Bear with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maid he found alone in the Fields; and an Ape likewiſe had two young ones by another: We read of another who walking by a River ſide was impregnated by a Fiſh that leaped out of the Water; what is moſt Difficult in this for the Vulgar to conceive, is how it may be, that theſe Women ſhould be delivered of perfect Children, and with the uſe of Reaſon, ſeeing they were engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by Brute-Beaſts.</p>
                  <p>To which is Anſwered, that the Seed of every of theſe Women was the Agent and Form-giver of the Child, as being the more Powerful, and therefore it figured them with the Lineaments of Human kind: And

the Beaſts Seed, (not being of that Strength) ſerved only for Nouriſhment, and no more. And that the Seed of theſe Irrational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures might yield Nouriſhment to Human Seed, is a matter eaſy to be conceived; for if each of theſe Women had eat a piece of the Bears Fleſh or Dogs boiled or roſted, ſhe would thereby have been Nouriſhed, though not ſo well as if ſhe had eaten Lamb or Partridge. The like happens to Human Seed, whoſe real Nutriment in the formation of the Child is a Man's Seed: though that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Seed of Brute Beaſts might well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply its Place. But one thing theſe Hiſtories ſpecify, is, that the young ones born from ſuch Copulation, gave proof (by their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Conditions) that they were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the ordinary courſe of Nature.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid, (though we have digreſs'd a little too far) we may now draw an Anſwer to the principal Problem; which is, that wiſe Mens Children are in a manner always form'd of the Mothers Seed, becauſe that of the Fathers, (for reaſons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready alledged) is not fruitful for Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſerving only in Generation for the Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Child that is formed of the Womans Seed, cannot be Witty or Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous by reaſon of the great coldneſs and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the Sex, whence it is certain, that a Child proving wiſe and diſcreet, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible indication, was form'd of the Fathers
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:53763:262"/>
Seed: But if he be a Blockhead or Fool, it may be concluded that he was made of the Mothers Seed. To which the <hi>Wiſeman</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded ſaying, <note n="*" place="margin">Prov. v.x.</note> 
                     <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but a fooliſh Son is the heavineſs of his Mother.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may alſo happen (by ſome Accident) that the Wiſe Man's Seed may be the Agent and Form-giver, and that of the Mother ſerve for Aliment. But the Child thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got will prove of ſlender Capacity; for though cold and dry are two Qualities requiſite to the Underſtanding, yet they ought to keep a certain Meaſure and Quantity: which once exceeded, they do rather harm than good. As appears in very old Men, who through the abundance of Coldneſs and Dryneſs doat and fall into many Follies. Put caſe then that there yet remain ten years for a Wiſe Man to live with a Coldneſs and Dryneſs ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Reaſoning, yet that being expired, he will doat. If of ſuch a ones Seed a Child be got, he will be till ten years old of great Ability (having drawn a conveninet coldneſs and dryneſs from the Father) but at eleven years he will preſently begin to fail, having paſt the Pitch thoſe two Qualities hold. Which we ſee by daily Experience in Children got in old Age, who when Young are very Witty, but grown Men, are Fools, and ſhort liv'd. The Reaſon is, they were formed of the cold and dry Seed of a Man that had liv'd about half his Race.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:53763:262"/>Likewiſe if the Father skill in the works of the Imagination (through much Heat and Dryneſs) and be married, to a Woman cold and moiſt in the third Degree, the Child born from ſuch a Conjunction, will be an errant Blockhead, if he be form'd of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Seed; having layn in ſo cold and moiſt a Womb, and having been fed with ſuch Diſtemper'd Blood.</p>
                  <p>The contrary happens, the Father being a Fool, whoſe Seed ordinarily is hot and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding moiſt. The Child then begot will be dull till fifteen years, ſo long as he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of the ſuperfluous moiſture of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that being ſpent by the Courſe of Age it comes to a Conſiſtence, (when the Fool's Seed becomes more Temperate, and leſs Moiſt.) It alſo helps the Wit to have been nine Months in a Womb ſo little cold and moiſt, as is that of a Woman cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree, whence proceeds ſuch ſcarcity and want of Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>All this ordinarily happens for the Reaſons we have ſpecified; but there is a certain Race of Men, whoſe Genitals are of ſuch force and vigor, as they utterly ſpoil their Aliments of their good Qualities, converting them into their evil and groſs Subſtance. Whence all the Children that are begot (though they have eat delicate Meats) are dull and rude. There are others on the contrary, feeding on Meats of groſs and evil Temperament,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:53763:263"/>
are ſo Strong to overcome them, that though they eat Brawn or Bacon, they get very Witty Children. And ſo it is certain that there is a Race of Fools, and another of Wiſe Men, and others that ordinarily are born Blunt and void of Judgment.</p>
                  <p>Some Doubts offer themſelves to thoſe that endeavour to pierce to the Root of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: To which an Anſwer may be given, from what has been already ſaid. The firſt is, whence it comes that Baſtards for the moſt part reſemble their Fathers? And of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Legitimate, ninety bear the Figure and Conditions of their Mothers.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond, Why Baſtards are generally Perſonable, Couragious and very Diſcreet?</p>
                  <p>The third, What is the Cauſe, that if a light Woman prove with Child, though ſhe ſwallow poyſon'd Doſes, to make her Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, and often let Blood, yet ſhe never ſlips her Child? But if a Married Woman be with Child by her Husband, upon every ſlight Accident, ſhe lightly Miſcarries.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt doubt <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de natura.</note> 
                     <hi>Plato</hi> anſwers, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that no Man of his own Accord is Evil, till firſt he be incited by his vitious Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament: And alledges for inſtance; Leachers, who by abounding in fruitful Seed, ſuffer many Illuſions, and great Pains: And being moleſted with that Paſſion, to drive it away, Marry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="485" facs="tcp:53763:263"/>Of ſuch <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, that they have very hot and dry Inſtruments of Generation, and for this Cauſe, breed Seed very pricking and apt for Procreation. A Man then goes to ſeek a Woman, none of his own, and repleniſhed with this fruitful, digeſted and well ſeaſoned Seed: Whence it follows of force the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration muſt be made; becauſe where both are equal, the Man's Seed is of greater Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and if a Boy be got of the Seed of ſuch a Father, he will reſemble him of courſe.</p>
                  <p>The contrary happens in Legitimate-Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for Married Men having their Wives always by their Sides, never regard to ripen their Seed, or make it Prolific, but rather up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the leaſt Motion, diſcharge it with great Commotion and Violence: Whereas Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men lying quiet in the Act of Love, their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Veſſels never emit any Seed, but what is duly concocted and well ſeaſoned, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords much in quantity. Therefore Married Women always make the engendring; and their Husbands Seed ſerves for Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>But ſometimes it comes to paſs that both Seeds are matched in equal Perfection; and diſpute in ſuch a manner as neither one nor the other give the Formation; ſo as a Child is got that Reſembes neither Father nor Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. At other times they concur and part the Reſemblance between them, the Fathers Seed makes the Noſe and Eyes, and that of the Mother, the Mouth and Forehead.
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:53763:264"/>
Though if the Fathers Seed wholly predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, the Child will be like him in Perſon and Manners; and when the Mothers Seed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the ſame Reaſon holds alike.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore the Father that deſires the Child ſhould be made of his own Seed, muſt for ſome days forbear his Wife, giving it time to concoct and ripen: and then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that it will take, and his Wives Seed ſerve for Nouriſhment.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond doubt (from what has been ſaid) bears little Difficulty; for Baſtard-Children are ordinarily made of Seed hot and dry; and of this Temperament (as we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten prov'd before) proceeds Bravery and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and a good Imagination; to which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs Worldly Wiſdom. And by the Seeds being duly concocted and well ſeaſoned, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture acts as ſhe pleaſes, drawing them as it were with a Pencel.</p>
                  <p>To the third Doubt may be anſwer'd, that the conceiving of light Women is almoſt always wrought from the Man's Seed, which being drier and more prolific, ſticks cloſer, and takes firmer Root in the Womb. Whereas in the Conception of Married Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which is wrought by their own Seed, the Child is eaſily looſen'd, the Seed being moiſt and wateriſh, or as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> affirms, <note n="*" place="margin">v.

                     <hi>Article V.</hi> Rules to be obſerv'd to preſerve Wit in Children after they are Born.</head>
                  <p>THe Matter whereof Man is made is ſo Alterable and ſubject to Corruption, that at the Inſtant he begins to be, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe begins to Corrupt and Change without being able to help it. Whereupon it is ſaid, <note n="*" place="margin">Wiſdom c.v.</note> 
                     <hi>That we are no ſooner Born but we Ebb every Day.</hi> And therefore has Nature provided there ſhould be in Human Bodies four Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Faculties, the <hi>Attractive, Retentive, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctive,</hi> and <hi>Expulſive:</hi> Which concocting and altering the Food we eat, come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loſt Subſtance, by ſubſtituting new in its Place. Whence we may underſtand that it will be of ſmall Advantage to have a Child form'd of delicate Seed, if Care be not taken of what he afterwards Eats. Becauſe the Formation being finiſhed, there remains to the Child no part of the Seminal Subſtance, whereof in the beginning he was form'd. True it is that the firſt Seed (if well concocted and Seaſoned) is of ſuch Force and Vigor, that digeſting and altering the Meats, it makes them, (though evil and groſs) turn to his good Temperament and Subſtance: But we may ſo far uſe contrary Meats as the Child may loſe the good Qualities it receiv'd from the Seed it was form'd of at firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="488" facs="tcp:53763:265"/>And therefore <note n="*" place="margin">Dial. de natura.</note> 
                     <hi>Plato</hi> ſays, that one of the things that moſt contributes to the ruin of Wit in Man, and his good Manners, is, his bad Education, in Diet. For which reaſon he adviſes that we ſhould give to Children Meats and Drinks delicate and of good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, that as they grow up they may reject the Ill and embrace the Good. The Reaſon hereof is very clear; for if the Brain was form'd at firſt of delicate Seed, and that impairing and conſuming every day, muſt be ſupplied from the Meat we eat, ſure it is, if theſe be groſs and of ill Temperament, and eaten many Days together, the Brain will be converted into the ſame Nature; and therefore it is not enough that the Child be form'd of good Seed, if the Meats he eats (after he is born) have not the ſame Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>What theſe are, will be no Difficulty to evidence, allowing the <hi>Greeks</hi> to have been the diſcreeteſt Men in the World, and that in their ſearch after Meats to make their Children Witty and Wiſe, they found the Beſt and moſt Appropriate: For if the ſubtil and delicate Wit conſiſts in the Brains being compoſed of Parts ſubtil and of good Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, the Meats that (above all others) partake of theſe two Qualities, will be the fitteſt to uſe, for obtaining our End.</p>
                  <p>Goats Milk (mingled with Honey) <hi>Galen</hi> ſays in the Opinion of all the <hi>Greek</hi> Phyſitians,
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:53763:265"/>
is the beſt Food whatever eaten by Men, for (beſides that it has a moderate Subſtance) the Heat thereof exceeds not the Cold, nor the Moiſt the Dry. Therefore we ſaid (a few Pages before) that Fathers who earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aim to get a Wiſe Son, Perſonable and of ſweet Diſpoſitions, muſt eat ſix or ſeven days before Copulation much Goats-Milk mingled with Honey.</p>
                  <p>But though this Food be good as <hi>Galen</hi> ſays, it makes more for the Wit that the Meats be of ſubtil Parts than of moderate Subſtance; for how much the finer the Matter is in the Nouriſhment of the Brain, ſo much the more is the Wit ſharpned. Therefore the <hi>Greeks</hi> drew the Cheeſe and the Whey from the Milk (which are the two groſs Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of its Compoſition) and left the Butter, which is of the nature of Air. This they gave Children to eat, mingled with Honey, with intent to make them Wiſe and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And that this is true appears clearly in what <hi>Homer</hi> relates in his xth <hi>Iliad.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides this Food, the Children eat Crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels made of White-Bread, of very delicate Water, with Hony and a little Salt, and in ſtead of Vinegar (which is nought and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Underſtanding) they added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Butter of Goats-Milk, whoſe Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Subſtance is Appropriate to Wit.</p>
                  <p>Though in this Regiment there is a great Inconvenience; which is, that enuring Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:53763:266"/>
to Meats ſo delicate, they will be leſs hardy to reſiſt the Injuries of the Air, nor be ſo able to defend themſelves from other Accidents that may make them Indiſpos'd, And ſo to make them Wiſe, they are rear'd with little Health, and live not long.</p>
                  <p>This Difficulty requires of us, how Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren may be rear'd Witty and Wiſe, and that, yet the ſame Art may not impair their Health. Which will be eaſy to concert, if Fathers venture to put in Practice ſome Rules and Precepts which I ſhall preſcribe. And becauſe nice People are miſtaken in Educat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Children, and they are ever harp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this Matter. I will firſt give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why their Children, (tho' they have Maſters and Tutors, and themſelves ply their Books ſo hard) make ſo little Progreſs in Learning? And how they may Remedy this, and that without ſhortning their Lives or impairing their Healths.</p>
                  <p>Eight things ſays <hi>Hippocrates</hi> moiſten and fatten the Fleſh of Man. The firſt, to be Idle and live at Eaſe. The ſecond, to Sleep much. The third, to lie on a ſoft Bed. The fourth, to Fare well. The fifth, to be well Clad and Accoutred. The ſixth, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways on Horſe-back. The ſeventh, to have our Will. The eighth, to be engaged in Plays and Paſtimes, and in things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and pleaſe Us. All which are ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a Truth, that if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> had not ſaid it, no Man could deny it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:53763:266"/>Only we may doubt whether the Nice obſerve always this manner of Life; but if it be true that they do, we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that their Seed is very moiſt, and that the Children begot thereof will of Courſe be born with ſuperfluous and redundant Moiſture, which ought to be Diſcuſſed and Conſumed; firſt, as that Quality tends to the deſtruction of the Operations of the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Soul; and next, as Phyſicians ſay, becauſe it ſhortens Life, and impairs the Health.</p>
                  <p>According to this, good Wit, and bodily Health require one and the ſame Quality, which is Dryneſs; and therefore the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts and Rules we are to lay down for making Children Wiſe, will be no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to their Health and long Life.</p>
                  <p>It will be convenient then as ſoon as the Child is born of Parents that are Nice and Delicate (ſuppoſing it's Fleſh colder and moiſter than is convenient for Child-hood) to waſh it in ſalt hot Water, which (in the Opinion of all <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hippo.</hi> lib. II. de diaeta.</note> Phyſicians) drys and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Fleſh, confirms the Sinews, and makes the Child ſtrong and manly: And by waſting the ſuperfluous Moiſture of the Brain, makes him Witty, and frees him from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dangerous <note n="†" place="margin">Lib. I. ad Glau. c.ix.</note> Diſeaſes. On the contrary, the Bath being of freſh hot Water, for that the ſame moiſtens the Fleſh, ſays <note n="‖" place="margin">VI. Aph. xvi.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates,</hi> breeds Five evils: <hi>Effeminacy of Fleſh,
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:53763:267"/>
Weakneſs of the Sinews, Dulneſs of Wit, a Flux of Blood, and Failure of Courage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the Child come into the World with too much Dryneſs, it is convenient to waſh him often in freſh hot Water, and thus <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de ſal. diaeta. c.xxiii.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> directs, <hi>to Bath Children long in warm Water, to prevent Convulſions, to make them grow apace, and be of better Complexion.</hi> It is certain this is to be meant of Children that are born Dry, whoſe evil Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neceſſary to be corrected by recourſe to the contrary Qualities.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Germans</hi> (ſays <hi>Galen</hi>) have a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom to Bath their New-born Children in a River, conceiting that as the Iron glowing out of the Furnace, is made ſtronger by dipping it in cold Water; even ſo the Child reeking from the Mothers Womb, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd of greater Force and Vigor, by waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in cold Water.</p>
                  <p>This is condemn'd by <hi>Galen</hi> as a beaſtly Practice, and he has Reaſon, for put the Caſe, that by this way the Skin is hardned and cloſed, and not ſo eaſily expoſed to the Injuries of the Air, yet it is offended by the Excrements of the Body, through which for want of its being open and pervious, they cannot Sweat and paſs out.</p>
                  <p>A better and more ſecure Expedient is, to Bath the Children (that abound in Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture) in ſalt hot Water; for by waſting in them the ſuperfluous Moiſture, they are
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:53763:267"/>
made very Healthy, and by cloſing the Pores, they will not ſuffer by any Accident what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; nor will their Excrements be ſo ſhut up, that the Paſſages may not open to let them out. And Nature is ſo forcible, that if ſhe can't find a common Way, ſhe will find out another to ſerve the Turn. And when all others fail, ſhe knows how to make new Ways, to expel what offends her. And thus of two Extremes it is more convenient for Health, to have the Skin hard and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what clos'd, than too tender and open.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Thing requir'd is, that ſoon after the Child is born, he ſhould be made acquainted with the Winds, and change of Air, and not kept ſtill lockt up in a Chamber, becauſe that will render it Tender, Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Fooliſh, Feeble, and in three Days it will die. Nothing ſays <note n="*" place="margin">Lib. de aere, locis &amp; aquis.</note> 
                     <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſo much debilitates the Body as to be always in warm Places, immured from Heat and Cold. Nor do's any thing conduce more to Health, than freely to expoſe the Body to all Winds, Hot, Cold, Moiſt and Dry: Which made <note n="†" place="margin">XIV. Sect. prob. xii.</note> 
                     <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ask, What the Reaſon is why thoſe that live in Champion Countries, are more Healthy, and of a better Complexion than thoſe that dwell in Marſhes? And the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty encreaſes the more, conſidering the hard Life they lead, ſleeping on the Ground in their Clothes in open Air, againſt the Sun, the Cold, or Water, faring withal ſo coarſly.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:53763:268"/>
The ſame may be demanded of Shepherds, who are the Healthieſt of all Men, and the Reaſon is, becauſe they have made a League with all the Qualities of the Air, and ſhrink at nothing. On the Contrary, we plainly ſee, that a Man affecting to be Nice, and to be on his Guard againſt the Sun, the Cold, the Serene, and the Wind, in three Days is a dead Man: Therefore it may well be ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſave his Life, ſhall loſe it:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no Man is proof againſt all the Changes of the Air: And therefore it's better to Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom ones ſelf to all, that a Man may not be in Pain, or always in Suſpence.</p>
                  <p>The Error of the Vulgar lies, in thinking that the Child is born ſo tender and delicate, that it cannot bear paſſing from it's Mothers Belly (where there is ſo much Heat) into the Region of the cold Air, without great Damage. But they are utterly miſtaken: For tho' <hi>Germany</hi> be ſo Cold, they throw their Children reeking into the River, and tho' 'tis ſo Beaſtly an Action, it neither do's them harm, nor kills them.</p>
                  <p>The third Thing convenient to be done, is to find out a young Nurſe, of a hot and dry Conſtitution; or according to our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, cold and moiſt in the firſt Degree, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to Hardſhip; us'd to lie on the bare Ground, a ſpare Feeder, and poorly Clad, and ſeaſoned with all ſorts of Weather. Such a one will have ſound Milk, as being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom'd
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:53763:268"/>
to all Changes of Air, and the Child brought up by her many Days together, will become well-limbed and luſty. And if ſhe be Diſcreet and Prudent, the ſame will be of much advantage to his Wit, becauſe her Milk is very hot and dry: Which two Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities correct the ſuperfluous Coldneſs and Moiſture the Child drew from the Womb. How much it imports for the Child's Strength to ſuck ſuch a Milk, well exerciſed, plainly appears in Colts foaled from Mares trained to the Plow and Harrow, which prove the fleeteſt Courſers, and endure long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Labour. But if their Dams run up and down idle in Paſtures, they flag after the firſt Carier.</p>
                  <p>The Order then to be obſerv'd with the Nurſe is to take her home, four or five Months before the Birth, and to give her the ſame Meats to eat that the Lying-in-Mother uſed, that ſhe may have time to ſpend the Blood and bad Humors made by the Ill-Meats ſhe eat before, to the end, the Child (as ſoon as it is born) may ſuck the like Milk to that it drew in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Belly, at leaſt made from the ſame Meats.</p>
                  <p>The fourth is, not to accuſtom the Child to ſleep on a ſoft Bed, nor to load him with Clothes, nor to cram him too much: For theſe three Things ſays <note n="*" place="margin">To eat but once a Day, to lie hard, and go nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Hippo lib. de ſalubri diaeta.</hi>

                  <p>According to this Receipt and Order of Life the wiſeſt Man that ever was in the World was educated, (that was <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Redeemer, as far as he was Man) ſaving that being born in <hi>Nazareth</hi> his Mother may be had no Salt-water at hand, to Bath him. But this was a Cuſtom of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and of all <hi>Aſia</hi> beſide, introduced by ſome skilful Phyſicians for the good of Infants.

                  <p>But as touching the Reſt, ſo ſoon as he was Born, he began to make Friendſhip with the Cold, and other Changes of the Air.

A few Days after they went with him to <hi>Egypt</hi> (a place very hot) where he remained all the time that <hi>Herod</hi> liv'd: His Mother going after this manner could not but give him a Milk well excercis'd and made in all Changes of Air.</p>

                     <hi>Eſaias, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Honey ſhall he eat, that he may know to refuſe the Evil, and chuſe the Good,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From which Words it appears that the <hi>Prophet</hi> gives us to underſtand, that tho' he was the true God, he was jointly a perfect Man: And that to acquire Natural Wit, he was to uſe the ſame Means as other of the Sons of Men. Tho' this is difficult to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and is very ſtrange to think, that in as much as Chriſt our Redeemer eat Butter and Honey (being a Child) he ſhould thenceforward know how to refuſe the Evil, and chuſe the Good when Adult; God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as he is) of infinite Wiſdom, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given him (as he was Man) all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd Knowledge he could receive, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Natural Capacity. Therefore it is certain he knew all out as much in his Mothers Womb, as when he arriv'd at thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty three Years of Age, without eating But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Honey, or borrowing help from any Natural Means requiſite for Human Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
                  <p>All this notwithſtanding, it is of great Force that the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſhould aſſign him the ſame Food the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Trojans</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to give their Children, to render
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:53763:270"/>
them Witty and Wiſe: And for that he ſays, <hi>That he may know to refuſe the Evil, and chuſe the Good,</hi> we are to underſtand that by means of theſe Aliments, Chriſt our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer (as he was Man) obtain'd more exquiſite Wiſdom than he ſhould have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd had he uſed other contrary Meats: For ſo there is need to explain the particle (That) to know, what he meant when he ſpoke in thoſe Terms. We are to preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then that in Chriſt our Redeemer there were two Natures (as the Truth is and our Faith teaches) the one Divine, as he was God; and the other Human, compounded of a Rational Soul, and Elementary Body, ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd and organiz'd, as other of the Sons of Men.</p>
                  <p>As concerning the firſt Nature we are not to treat of the Wiſdom of our Lord Chriſt, becauſe it was Infinite, without Increaſe or Diminution, and without depending on any other thing more than his being God; and ſo he was as Wiſe in his Mothers Womb, as he was at thirty three Years of Age, and even as he was from all Eternity. But as to what concerns his ſecond Nature, you are to know, that the Soul of Chriſt, from the inſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God created it, was as Happy and Glorious, as it is at this Day: and ſince it enjoyed God and his Wiſdom; ſure it is that there was no Ignorance in him, but that he had ſo much Infus'd Knowledge as
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:53763:270"/>
his Natural Capacity was capable of: But withal it is no leſs certain, that according as Glory did not communicate it ſelf to all the Parts of the Body (in reſpect of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind) no more did Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Infuſed communicate it ſelf; for the Brain was not diſpos'd and organiz'd with the Qualities and Subſtance neceſſary to the end the Soul might with ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument Diſcourſe and Philoſophiſe. For if you call to mind what we delivered in the beginning of this Work, that the Graces <hi>gratis</hi> given which God beſtowed upon Men do require ordinarily that the Inſtrument with which they are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd, and the Subject into which they are to be received, contain the Natural Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities requiſite for every ſuch Grace. And the reaſon is, becauſe the Rational Soul is an Act of the Body, and works not without the Mediation of Corporal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</p>
                  <p>The Brain of our Lord Chriſt, (when a Child, and New-born) had much Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, for at that Age it is but requiſite and a Natural Thing; but through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in Quantity, his Rational Soul could not naturally Diſcourſe or Philoſophiſe with ſuch an Inſtrument. And ſo Infus'd Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge paſſed neither to the Corporal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, nor to the Imagination, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; becauſe thoſe three are Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic

Powers (as we have already prov'd) and enjoy not their due Perfection. But the Brain drying with Time and riper Age, the Rational Soul daily diſcover'd more and more the Infus'd Knowledge it had, and Communicated the ſame to the Corporal Faculties.</p>

                     <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>'s Opinion we have prov'd, that the Brain compos'd of a very delicate Subſtance makes a very fine Wit.</p>
                  <p>This Dryneſs our Lord acquir'd by Age, becauſe from the Day of our Birth to that of our Death, we daily grow to more Dryneſs and waſte of Fleſh, and ſo to greater Knowledge.
