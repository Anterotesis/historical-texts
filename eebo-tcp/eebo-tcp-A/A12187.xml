            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>For He had framed an altar according to the altar which he had seen at <hi>Damascus,</hi> neglecting Gods Altar at Jerusalem, as too plaine and homely.</p>

            <p>And though this king was so fearefull that his heart, and the rest of their hearts, were as the leaves in the forrest, shaking and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and quaking at the presence of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and though hee was surprized with feare and horrour, seeing God his enemy, and himselfe Gods enemy, and that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him no good, yet hee would goe on in his owne superstitious course, having some se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret confidence in league and affinity with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kings, that were superstitious like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. This by the way.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Those that brag out of danger, are most coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in danger.</hi>
               </note>We may learne by this wretched King, <hi>That those that are least fearefull before danger, are most basely fearefull in danger.</hi> Hee that was so confident and willfull out of danger, in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger his heart was as the leaves of the forrest. For a wicked man in danger hath no hope from God, and therefore is uncapeable of any entercourse with him. Hee will trust
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17803:3"/>
the devill and his instruments, led with a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious spirit rather then God. As this King had more confidence in the <hi>King of Syria,</hi> that was his enemy, and so shewed himselfe after, then in God. It is the nature of flesh and bloud (being not sanctified by God) to trust in this meanes and that meanes: this carnall help, and that carnall helpe: <hi>a reed of Egypt,</hi> yea the devill, and lies, rather then to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>The Prophet in an holy indignation for the refusing of a signe, to confirme his faith that these Kings should not doe the Church harme, breaketh forth thus. Know O house of David, <hi>is it a smal thing for you to weary men, but will you weary my God also?</hi> God offers you a signe out of his love, and you dislike and contemne his blessed bounty. Therefore <hi>the Lord himselfe shall give you a signe.</hi> What is that? <hi>A virgin shall conceive and beare a Sonne, and shall call his name Emanuell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the inference,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Infinite mercy in God and stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse in man conflicting.</hi>
               </note> wee may see the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betweene the Infinite goodnesse of God, and the inflexible stubbornnesse of Man. Gods goodnesse striving with mans badnesse: when they would have no signe, yet God will give them a signe: his goodnesse overcommeth, and outwrastleth in the contention mans sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full strivings: his mercie prevailes against mans malice.</p>
            <p>To come to the text it selfe. <hi>Behold a virgin shall conceive and beare a Sonne, and they shall call
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17803:4"/>
his name Emanuell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meaning of the Text.</hi>
               </note> It was not so much a signe for the present, as a promise of a miraculous benefit, which was to bee presented almost eight hundred yeares after the prophet spake these words. Even the incarnation of Christ, a miracle of miracles, a benefit of benefits, and the cause of all benefits. He fetcheth comfort against the present distresse, from a benefit to come. And to shew how this can be a ground of comfort, at this time of distresse, <hi>That a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin shall conceive</hi>; We must know, That <hi>Christ was the Lambe slaine from the beginning of the world.</hi> All the godly of the Iewes knew it well enough, the Messias being all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, they knew that he was <hi>yesterday and to day,</hi> and <hi>shall be the same for ever.</hi> The church had in all times comfort from Christ. <hi>Profuit ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam fuit</hi>; Hee did good before he was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the world.</p>
            <p>And thus the Prophet applyes the comfort to the house of <hi>David, a virgin shall conceive and beare a sonne.</hi> And <hi>they shall call his name E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuell. Who shall be of the family of David.</hi> And therefore the house of David shall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and dissolved. The reason is strong: you of the house of <hi>David</hi> are in feare that your Kingdome and nation shall be destroyed; but know that the Messias must come of a virgin, and of the house of <hi>David.</hi> And considering this must certainely come to passe, Why doe ye feare, ye house of <hi>David?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </note>Againe it hath force of a reason thus. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17803:4"/>
promise of our Messias is the grand promise of all, and the cause of all promises, for all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made to the church, are either promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Christ himselfe, or promises in him, and for his sake, because hee takes all promises from God and conveyeth them, and maketh them good to us. God maketh them and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth them in Christ, and for Christ.</p>
            <p>Now the reason stands thus, if God will give a Messias,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>He that will doe the greater he will doe the lesser.</hi>
               </note> that shall bee the <hi>sonne of a virgin,</hi> and <hi>Emanuell,</hi> certainely hee will give you deliverance. Hee that will doe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will doe the lesse; what is the deliverance you desire, to the promised deliverance from hell, and damnation, and to the benefit by the Messias, which you professe to hope for, and believe?</p>
            <p>The Apostle himselfe <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8. reasons thus: <hi>God that spared not his owne Sonne, but gave him to death for us all, how shall not hee with him give us all things?</hi> If God will give Christ to bee <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manuell</hi> and incarnate, he will not stand upon any other inferiour promises or mercies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
            <p>But you will say,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Object.</hi>
               </note> this promise was to come, and how could this confirme their faith,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>How this can confirme their faith for present.</hi>
               </note> for the present, that they should not bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed?</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> in regard of his <hi>taking our nature,</hi> hee was <hi>to come,</hi> yet Christ was alwayes with his <hi>Church before.</hi> They understood him in the <hi>Manna,</hi> he was the <hi>Angel</hi> of the covenant: They
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17803:5"/>
that were spiritually wise amongst the Iewes, understood that he was the <hi>Rocke,</hi> that went before them.</p>
            <p>And againe it is usuall in Scripture to give signes from things <hi>to come,</hi> as 37. Isaiah. <hi>The next yeare thou shalt eate that which groweth of it selfe,</hi> &amp;c. because where faith is, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth things <hi>to come</hi> all one as if they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Make use of the Grand promises to comfort us in petty crosses.</hi>
               </note>And so wee should make this use of the <hi>Grand promises</hi> of Christ to comfort us against all <hi>petty</hi> matters and wants whatsoever. And to reason with the holy Apostle, <hi>God spared not his only begotten sonne, but gave him to death.</hi> He hath given <hi>Christ,</hi> and will he not give all things <hi>needfull?</hi> Hath he given the <hi>greater,</hi> and will he stand with thee for the <hi>lesse?</hi> This is a blessed kinde of reasoning; And so to reason from other <hi>Grand things</hi> promised. God shall raise my body out of the dust, and the grave, and cannot he raise my body out of sicknesse? and my state out of trouble? cannot hee raise the Church out of misery? So saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. <hi>God that raised Christ,</hi> restored me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that had <hi>received the sentence of death</hi>: when we receive sentence of death in our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, looke to him that raised Christ from the dead, and to the grand promises to come. They before Christ comforted themselves in times of all distresse by the grand promise of Christ <hi>to come.</hi> But, now the Messias <hi>is come.</hi> And (which may much more strengthen our
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17803:5"/>
faith,) he <hi>hath</hi> suffered and <hi>given</hi> his body to death for us, and therefore why doubt we of Gods good will in any petty matters whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever?</p>
            <p>To come to the words more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly. <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and beare a Sonne,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               </note> As <hi>Christs conception by the holy Ghost,</hi> his being <hi>borne of the virgin Mary,</hi> &amp;c. you have here the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ. <hi>A virgin shall conceive,</hi> and <hi>bare a sonne.</hi> And the <hi>divine nature</hi> of Christ; his name shall bee called <hi>Emanuell,</hi> which signifieth also his office, God with us by nature, and God with us by office, to set God and us at one. So you have diverse points of divinity couched in the words which I will onely open sutable to the occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold.</hi> This is the usuall <hi>Becon,</hi> set up, the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> usuall <hi>Harbinger</hi> to require our attendance, in all matters concerning Christ. And it hath a threefold force here. <hi>Behold,</hi> as being a thing presented to the eye of faith, He mounteth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the interim betweene the promise and the accomplishment; for faith knoweth no difference of times.</p>
            <p>And then it is to raise attention, <hi>behold</hi> it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> a matter of great concernement.</p>
            <p>And not onely attention, but likewise ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> behold a strange and admirable thing. For what stranger thing is there, then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17803:6"/>
that a virgin should conceive,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Nothing more strange then a virgin to be a mother, and God a man.</hi>
               </note> that a virgin should be a mother: and that God should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man.</p>
            <p>We had need of strong grace to apprehend these strange things. And therefore God hath provided a grace suitable, above reason, and above nature, and that is <hi>faith.</hi> Reason moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth at this. The devill knoweth it and envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it. The Angels know, and wonder at it. The soule it selfe without a grace sutable to the admirablenesse of the thing, can never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. And therefore well may it be said, <hi>Behold, a virgin shall conceive and beare a sonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold a virgin shall conceive and beare.</hi> and why a <hi>virgin?</hi> When God is to be borne, it is fit for a virgin to bee the mother. Christ was not to come by the ordinary way of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ conceived not by ordinary Propagation.</hi>
               </note> he was to come <hi>from</hi> Adam, but not <hi>by</hi> Adam, for he was to be sanctified by the holy Ghost. Because he was indeed to be a <hi>Saviour</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and hee must be without spot, or sinne himselfe, that was to offer himselfe for the sinnes of others; Therefore the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and ground of his nature must bee pure, and cleane, and that is the foundation of all the purity of his life, and conversation, and therefore a <hi>virgin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was typified in <hi>Aarous rod</hi> which bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded though it had no root. No Iuice could come from a dry sticke, yet by an Almighty power the rod did bud. And so <hi>Moses bush,</hi> It burnt and did not consume; And that God
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:17803:6"/>
that caused those things, caused a virgin to be a mother.</p>
            <p>He enters into the wombe of a virgin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any defilement at all, considering the holy Ghost, from the Father and the Son, did purge and purifie, and sanctifie that masse,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Masse wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ was made, was san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost.</hi>
               </note> whereof the blessed body of our Saviour was made. The virgin afforded the <hi>matter,</hi> but the wise <hi>Framer</hi> was the holy Ghost. She was <hi>passive,</hi> the holy Ghost was the <hi>Agent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now when did the virgin conceive? when upon the Angels comming to her, and telling her, <hi>That she was greatly beloved,</hi> and that shee should conceive, she assented, <hi>be it so, as the Lord hath spoken.</hi> When shee assented to the word, presently Christ was conceived:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ conceived, upon Maries as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage by the holy Ghost.</hi>
               </note> her faith, and her wombe conceived together. When her heart did conceive the truth of the promise, and yeelded assent thereunto, her womb con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the same time also.</p>
            <p>From hence learne something for our selves, <hi>It had beene to little purpose, though a virgin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Observ.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>unlesse Christ had beene conceived likewise in her heart.</hi> And there is no benefit, by virtue of this conception to others, but to such as conceive Christ in their hearts also.</p>
            <p>To which end our hearts must bee in some measure made virgin hearts, pure hearts, hearts fit to receive Christ.</p>
            <p>We must assent to promises of pardon, and of life everlasting, <hi>bee it as the Lord saith.</hi> A
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17803:7"/>
Christian is a Christian, and Christ liveth in his heart, at the time of the <hi>assenting to</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. So that if you aske, when doth Christ first live in a Christians heart?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note> I answer then, when the heart yeeldeth a firme assent to the gracious promises made in Christ for the pardoning of sinnes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi>
               </note> and acceptation to the favour of God, and title, and interest to life everlasting. For faith is the birth of the heart.</p>
            <p>Christ was conceived in the wombe of an humble and believing virgin. So that heart that will conceive Christ aright, must bee a humble, and believing heart, humble, to deny <hi>himselfe</hi> in all things. And believing, to goe out of it selfe, to the promises of God in Christ. When God by his spirit hath brought our hearts to be humble,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in our hearts when we rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him onely.</hi>
               </note> and believing, to goe out of themselves, and believe in him, rest upon him, and his promises, then Christ is conceived in our hearts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold a virgin shall conceive and beare a sonne.</hi> Here is the birth of Christ, as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. Christ must not onely be conceived in the wombe, but also brought forth, because God must be manifested in the flesh. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Great is the mystery of Godlinesse, God manifested in the flesh.</hi> If hee had onely beene conceived, and not brought forth, he had not beene manifested, hee was to doe all things that befitted a Mediatour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17803:7"/>And therefore hee went along with us in all the passages of our lives.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christs concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, birth and life like ours.</hi>
               </note> Hee was conceived as we are, remayned in the wombe, so many moneths, borne as we are borne, brought into the light as we are. Away therefore with idle <hi>monkish</hi> devices, and fond conceipts, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the contrary.</p>
            <p>He was like to us in all things, <hi>sinne excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> conceived, brought forth, hung upon the brest as we, an infant as we, hungry and thirsty, and suffered as we.</p>
            <p>And as he was in all things like to us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>In every thing in Christ, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi>
               </note> so in every thing that was in him, there was some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing extraordinary; as hee was a man like to us, so hee was an extraordinary man. Hee was conceived, but of a <hi>virgin,</hi> which is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary: hee was borne, as we are, but there his starre appeared,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ conceived, borne, lived, and dyed, eswe.</hi>
               </note> and the wise men came to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and worship him. He was poore, as wee are, but there were beames of his Godhead appeared; when hee was poore, <hi>he could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a fish to furnish him:</hi> hee dyed as we dye, but he made the <hi>earth to quake, the vaile of the temple to rend,</hi> when hee tryumphed on the crosse. All which declared hee was more then an ordinary person.</p>
            <p>And so wee must all conceive Christ, and beare Christ in our <hi>words, and actions,</hi> it must appeare that Christ <hi>liveth</hi> in us.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>To shew sorth Christ in all our actions.</hi>
               </note> It must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare outwardly to man, what we are inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God. Our whole outward life must bee
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17803:8"/>
nothing but a discovery of Christ living in us. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> which should appeare, by word, conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and action. Our lives should bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but an acting of Christ, living in our soules.</p>
            <p>This is not a meere analogicall truth, but it floweth naturally: whosoever are to have the benefit of his birth, and conception, Christ sendeth into their heart, the same spirit that sanctified the masse, whereof hee was made, and so frameth a disposition suitable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, he sets his owne stampe upon the heart: as the <hi>vnion of</hi> his humane nature to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, was the cause of all other graces of his humane nature, so the spirit of God uniting us to Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vnion with Christ the cause of all grace.</hi>
               </note> is the cause of all grace in us. If we have not the spirit of Christ, wee are none of his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And shalt call his name Emanuel.</hi> Many things might bee observed concerning the ordinary reading of the words. Some read, <hi>shee</hi> shall call his name <hi>Emanuel,</hi> because hee had no father. Others, <hi>his name shall be called Emanuel:</hi> but they be doubtfull, therefore I leave them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Iesus</hi> was his name. Therefore how is it said, he shall be called <hi>Emanuel?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning is, he shall be Emanuel, and shall bee accounted and believed to bee so, he shall be God with us indeed, and shall shew himselfe to be so. For in the Hebrew phrase,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17803:8"/>
the meaning of a thing imports the being of the thing. The like phrase is in <hi>Isaiah</hi> 9.6. <hi>To us a childe is borne, to us a sonne is given, and his name shall be called wonderfull, Counsellour, the Everlasting father, the Prince of peace.</hi> That is, <hi>hee shall bee</hi> believed to bee so, and shall shew himselfe to bee so, and shall bee so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. The like you have, (because it is an answer to the cavill of the Iewes,) which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject he was not called Emanuell,<note place="margin">Ier. 2.3.</note> 
               <hi>Iudah shall bee saved, Israel shall dwell safely, and this is his name, whereby he shall be called, The Lord our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi> For indeed he is Iehovah our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and we have no righteousnesse to stand before God with, but his: divers other places of Scripture there be of the same nature, but these two are pregnant; and therefore, I name them for all the rest.</p>
            <p>Besides the conception and birth of Christ, you have here likewise, the <hi>divine nature of</hi> Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Emanuel, a name of nature and office.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>the offices of</hi> Christ, for Emanuell is a name both of nature and office.</p>
            <p>It is a name of his nature, God, and man, and of his office, which is to reconcile God and man: we could not be <hi>with God,</hi> but God must first be <hi>Man with us.</hi> We were once with God in <hi>Adam,</hi> before hee fell; but there being a breach made, we cannot be recovered againe, till God be with us: he must take our natures, that he may reconcile our persons.</p>
            <p>Now Christ is <hi>Emanuell,</hi> first in regard <hi>of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17803:9"/>
nature,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ Emanuell in regard of our nature.</hi>
               </note> God <hi>with us,</hi> or God <hi>in our nature.</hi> The pure nature of God, and the base nature of man: that were strangers ever since the fall, are knit together in Christ. What can be in a greater degree of strangenesse (except the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils) then mens unholinesse, and Gods pure nature? Yet the nature of man and of God, being so severed before, are met together in one Christ. So that in this one word <hi>Emanuell,</hi> there is heaven and earth, God and man, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and finite: therefore we may well prefix, <hi>Behold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A true Saviour of the world must bee <hi>God with man.</hi> Whether wee consider the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the good we are to have by a Saviour, or the greatnesse of the evil we are to be freed from by a Saviour: both which doe inforce, that he must be <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God with us.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, the greatnesse of the good which we are to have, for he is to bee God and man to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to satisfie the wrath of God, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe a punishment due to sinne, as our surety: hee must give us title to heaven, and bring us thither, and who can doe this but God?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Besides, Secondly hee must know our hearts, our wants, our griefes, our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hee must bee every where to relieve us. And who can doe this but God?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> So Thirdly, in regard of evil, which we are to be freed from. He is to defend us in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17803:9"/>
of the enemies: and who is above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, and sinne, and the wrath of God, and all the oppositions, that stand betweene us and heaven, but God. So in regard of the good, in regard of the evill, and in regard of the preservation, to an Eternall good estate, and freedome from eternall evill, he must be <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God with us.</p>
            <p>These grand principles are enough to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie in this point.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, as he must be <hi>God,</hi> so there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was a necessity of his being <hi>Man. Man</hi> had sinned, and <hi>man</hi> must suffer for sin, and without bloud there was no remission;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Without the blood of Christ, noe remission.</hi>
               </note> and then, that he might be a mercifull, and pittifull Saviour, he must take that nature on him, that he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to save, there must be a sutablenesse, and sympathy. <hi>Sutablenesse,</hi> that the head, and the members. The sanctified, and the Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, may bee both of one nature. And a <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi> that he might be touched with humane infirmities.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this God and man must bee one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> person. For if there were two persons, God one distinct person, and man another: then there were two Christs, and so the actions of the one, could not bee attributed to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>As man dyed and shed his bloud, it could not have beene said that God dyed. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was but one person, God is truely
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17803:10"/>
said to dye, though hee dyed in mans nature, for hee tooke mans nature into unity with his person: and whatsoever either nature did, the whole person is said to doe, and therefore Christ is a Saviour according to both natures, as <hi>God,</hi> and as <hi>Man</hi>: for he was to suffer, and hee was to overcome and satisfie in suffering, he was not onely to heare our prayers, but to answer them. Both natures had an ingredience into all the worke of mediation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God</hi> dyed, and <hi>God</hi> suffered, and supported the <hi>manhood,</hi> that it might uphold the burden of the wrath of God, that it might not sinke under it. And so in all his actions, there was concurrence of divinity and humanity. The meaner workes being done by the Manhood,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meaner workes acted by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood greater by the Godhead.</hi>
               </note> the greater workes by the Godhead, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one, <hi>Emanuel God with us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God must bring us to heaven, by a way sutable to his holinesse, and therefore by way of satisfaction, and that cannot be but by God equall with himselfe.</p>
            <p>And that is the reason, why the Apostle joynes together, <hi>without Christ, without God.</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Ephes 5.</note> they that know not Christ <hi>God-man,</hi> to reconcile God and man, have nothing to doe with God. For the pure nature of God, what hath it to doe with the unpure nature of man, without <hi>Emanuel,</hi> without him that is God man, to make satisfaction?</p>
            <p>But now that Christ hath taken our nature,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17803:10"/>
it is become pure in him, and beloved of God in him. And God in him is become lovely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee is in our nature, yea in Christ, God is become a father <hi>I goe to my father,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>God our father.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and your father</hi>; his nature, is sweet to us in Christ, our nature is sweet to him in Christ, God loveth not our nature, but first in him, in whom it is pure. And then he loveth our nature in us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the spirit of Christ, hee will make our natures like to Christs: and therefore wee may conceive of God as <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God well pleased with us, and we well pleased with him. Out of Christ wee are angry with God, and hee angry with us. Wee could wish there were no God, and choose rather to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the devill, to bee led by his spirit, to all prophanenesse and licentiousnesse. Wee have a rising against God, and his Image, and what ever comes from God, the proud unmortified heart of man swelleth against it. But when the heart once believeth, that Christ <hi>Emanuell</hi> God with us, hath satisfied Gods justice; now God is taken by the believing heart to bee a father reconciled in Iesus Christ. And we are taught to bee his sonnes. And our nature is more and more purified and cleansed, and made like the pure nature of Christ, and so by little and little, the termes betweene God and us are more sweet, till we get to heaven, where our nature shal be absolutely perfect and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the holy spirit. So that he is <hi>Emanuell</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:17803:11"/>
God with us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ Emanuell to make God and us friends.</hi>
               </note> to make God and us friends, which is two waies. First by satisfaction taking <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> away the wrath of God. And then secondly, by the spirit:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>By satisfaction.</hi>
               </note> for God sendeth his Spirit into our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> harts, to fit us for frindship, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>By the Spirit fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God.</hi>
               </note> when we have something of God in us.</p>
            <p>From hence many things may bee spoken, partly for instruction, and comfort. I will name a few.</p>
            <p>First of all, it is to be wondred at, and wee cannot wonder enough (though we were An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and had natures larger then they are) at the marvellous mercies and love of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gods love and mercy to man, to be wondred at.</hi>
               </note> that would stoope so low, as that God in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond person should take our nature and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one with us. It is marvellous love that he would be one with us, by such a meanes as his owne sonne, to make peace betweene him and us. It is a marvellous condescending, and stooping in the sonne to take our nature; when there bee better creatures above us, that hee would let passe all above us, and take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that is dust, into unity of his person, that earth, flesh and bloud, should bee taken into one person with the Godhead, it is wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and marvellous.</p>
            <p>He tooke not the nature of Angels: so that wee bee above Angels,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Man above An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels by Christs incarnation.</hi>
               </note> by the incarnation of Christ. Because hee tooke not the Angels na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are not the spouse of Christ: but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very believing Christian is the spouse of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17803:11"/>
Christ; he is marryed to Christ, he is the head, wee the members: he is the husband, wee the spouse, and therefore wee may stand in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Love of God, in taking our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures on him.</p>
            <p>It requires hearts wounded by the spirit of God, to thinke of, and admire these things an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to their natures. The Angels when Christ was borne could not containe, but breake out, <hi>Glory to God on high, on earth peace, good will towards men</hi>: because there was then peace, peace betweene God and us, and by consequence with all the creatures, which doe but take part with God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge his quarrell.</p>
            <p>These things be matters of admiration, and we shall spend eternity, in admiration thereof in another world, though here our narrow hearts can hardly conceive it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What we cannot believe by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, let us labour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </note> But what wee cannot believe by understanding (as things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove nature,) let us labour to understand them by believing, desire God wee may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, and then we shall understand them to our comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emanuel, God with us.</hi> If God bee with us in our nature, then hee is with us in his love. <hi>And if God be with us, who shall be against us?</hi> For this <hi>Emanuel</hi> hath taken our nature for ever:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Our nature in heaven.</hi>
               </note> hee hath taken it into heaven with him; God and wee shall bee for ever in good termes, because God in our nature is for ever in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17803:12"/>
as an Intercessour appearing for us. There is no feare of a breach now; for our <hi>brother</hi> is in heaven, our <hi>Husband</hi> is in heaven, to preserve an everlasting union and amitie betweene God and us. Now wee may insult in an holy maner over all oppositions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. For if God be with us in our nature, and by consequence in favour, who shall bee against us? and therefore with the Apostle, <hi>let us triumph, Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>Let us make use of this <hi>Emanuel</hi> in all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles whatsoever, whether of the Church, or of our owne persons. In troubles of the Church, the Church hath enemies, hell, and the world, and Satans factors, but wee have one, <hi>Emanuel</hi> God with us, and therefore wee need not feare: you know whose ensigne it is, whose Motto; <hi>Deus nobiscum,</hi> is better than <hi>Sancta Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria. Sancta Maria</hi> will downe, when <hi>Deus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biscum</hi> shall stand.</p>
            <p>I beseech you therefore let us comfort our selves in regard of the Church, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the next chapt. vers. 7. comforts the Church in distresse, <hi>He shall passe through Iudah, he shall over-flow and go over, he shall reach even to the necke, and the stretching out of his wings, shall fill the bredth of thy</hi>

               <hi>land, O Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel.</hi> It may seeme a kinde of complaint. <hi>The enemy stretcheth out their wings over thy land, O Emanuel</hi>: which may teach us in the person of the Church, to goe to <hi>Emanuel,</hi> Remember
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17803:12"/>
the enemies of thy Church spread their wings over thy land, and people, O <hi>Emanuel,</hi> thou seest the malice of the enemy, the malice of Antichrist and his supporters. He is the true <hi>Michael</hi> that stands for his Church. And then in the tenth verse, <hi>Take counsell together, and it shall come to nought, speake the word, and it shall not stand for God is with us.</hi> And as the Church before Christ came in the flesh, much more may we now hee is come in the flesh,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>No counsell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God shall stand.</hi>
               </note> insult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all. Let all the enemies consult together, this king and that power; there is a counsell in heaven will disturbe and dash all their counsells. <hi>Emanuel</hi> in heaven laugheth them to scorne. And as <hi>Luther</hi> sayd, <hi>shall wee weepe and cry, when God laugheth</hi>? He seeth a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of idolatrous wretches, that conspire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to root out all Protestants from the earth, if it lay in their power. They that are inspired with Jesuiticall spirits, the incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the world, have devoured all Israel, and Christendome in their hopes: but the Church, which is <hi>Emanuels</hi> land, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, sees it, and laughs them to scorne. God can dash all their treacherous counsels.</p>
            <p>And so in all personal trouble whatsoever, <hi>Emanuel,</hi> God with us, is fitted to be a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Saviour; he was poore, that he might be with the poor; he took not on him an impassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nature, but he tooke our poverty, our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable nature. Hee is poore with the poore,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17803:13"/>
afflicted with the afflicted, persecuted with the persecuted, he is deserted with them that be deserted, <hi>My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> He suffers with them that suffer, he hath gone throgh al the passages of our lives. In the beginning of it he was conceived and borne,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ with us in poverty and bond.</hi>
               </note> and he hath gone along with us, and is able to pitty and succour us in our poverty, in prison, in bonds, in disgrace, in our conflict with God, in our terrour of conscience, in all our temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and assaults by Sathan; he was temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himselfe by Sathan, for this purpose, that <hi>Emanuel</hi> might in all these be mercifull.</p>
            <p>Let us not lose the comforts of this sweet Name, in which you have couched so many comforts. In the houre of death, when wee are to dye, thinke of <hi>Emanuel.</hi> When <hi>Iacob</hi> was to goe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> sayth God, <hi>Feare not Iacob, goe, I will goe with thee, and bring thee back againe,</hi> and he did bring him back to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Canaan.</hi> So, feare not to dye, feare not to goe to the grave, <hi>Emanuel</hi> hath been there, he will goe into the grave, hee will bring us out of the dust againe: for <hi>Emanuel</hi> is God with us, who is God over death, over sinne, over the wrath of God; God over all, blest for evermore, and hath triumphed over all, so that <hi>what shall separate us from the love of God in Christ Iesus?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ God in us, and for us.</hi>
               </note>He is not onely God with us in our nature, but he is God for us in heaven at this time; he
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17803:13"/>
is God in us by his spirit: hee is God amongst us in our meetings, <hi>Where two or three be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in my name, I will be in the midst of them.</hi> He is God for us to defend us, he is for us in earth, for us in heaven, and wheresoever we be, specially in good causes. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore enlarge our comforts as much as we can.</p>
            <p>And shall not wee then labour to bee with him, as much as we can? All spirits that have any comfort by this <hi>Emanuel</hi> they are touched on by his Spirit, to have desires to bee nearer and nearer to him.</p>
            <p>How shall I know hee is my <hi>Emanuel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>How to know Emanuel to bee ours.</hi>
               </note> not onely God <hi>with us,</hi> but God <hi>with me?</hi> If by the same Spirit of his, that sanctified his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, I have desires to bee nearer and nearer to him, to be liker and liker him. If I am on his side, if I be neare him in my affections, desires, and understanding; if I side not against the Church, nor joyne in opposition against the Gospell. If I finde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly a desire to bee more and more with him, and like to him; if outwardly (in the place where I live) I side with him, and take part with his cause, it is a signe I have interest in him. And therefore let us labour to bee more and more with Christ, and with God, in love, and affections, in faith, in our whole inward man, because he is with us.</p>
            <p>Wee must know this <hi>Emanuel</hi> doth trust us with his cause,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christs cause to be maintained,</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17803:14"/>
now and then, to speak a word for his Church; &amp; he takes it ill if we neglect him. <hi>Curse ye Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roz, because hee came not out to helpe the Lord.</hi> God trusteth us to see, if wee will bee on his side, and calles to us, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did, <hi>Who is on my side, who?</hi> Now, if wee have not a word for the Church, not so much as a prayer for the Church, how can wee say, <hi>God with us?</hi> when we are not used to speake to God by way of prayer, nor to man but by way of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and contestation? By this therefore examine the truth of our interest in Christ.</p>
            <p>Those that intend to receive the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, must thinke, Now I am to be neare unto Christ,<note place="margin">

            <p>And because wee know not how long wee may live here, some of us be sicke and weake, and all of us may fall into danger, wee know not how soone, let it be our comfort, that God is <hi>Emanuell,</hi> hee left heaven, and tooke our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to bring us thither, where himselfe is. When times of dissolution come, consider, I am now going to him to heaven, that came downe from thence, to bring me to that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall mansion of rest and glory.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He occasion of these words we have heard. The Church was in great distresse under two mighty Kings, that threatned great matters; but indeed were but two smoaking fire-brands, that went out of themselves. <hi>Ahaz</hi> being a wicked King, (and wickednes being alwayes full of feares, fearfull in trouble, though not before trouble, for they that bee least fearfull of trouble,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:17803:16"/>
be most fearefull in trouble) and GOD inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding comfort to the Church, the Prophet bids him aske a signe. <hi>Ahaz</hi> out of guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conscience, and stubbournes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would aske none. GOD intended to strengthen his faith, and he would not make advantage of the offer. And therefore the Prophet promiseth a signe, the grand signe, The signe of all signes, the miracle of all miracles, the Incarnation of the <hi>Messias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the way I beseech you let me observe this.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>It is Atheisticall profanesse to despice any helpe, that God in his wisdome thinketh necessary to proppe and shoare our weake faith withall.</hi> And therefore when many out of confidence of their owne graces, and parts refuse the Sacrament (God knowing better then our selves, wee need it) unlesse it bee at one time of the yeare, and <hi>refuse</hi> the other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of preaching, which God hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed, they seeme to know themselves bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then God, who out of knowledge of our weaknes, hath set apart these meanes for the strengthning of our graces.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Grace refused is turned into wrath</hi>
               </note> And as <hi>Ahaz</hi> refusing Gods helpe, provoked God by it, so these must know, they shall not escape without judgment, for it is a tempting of God, and proceedeth from a bad spirit of pride and stubbornes.</p>
            <p>How this promise of the <hi>Messias</hi> could be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17803:16"/>
a signe to them to comfort them, we spake at large, wee will now deliver some thing by way of addition and explication.</p>
            <p>The house of <hi>David</hi> was affraid they should be extinct, by these two great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church, but saith hee, <hi>A Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the house of David shall conceive a Sonne,</hi> and how then can the house of <hi>David</hi> bee extinct?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What God saith man cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anull.</hi>
               </note> Secondly, Heaven hath said it, earth can not disanull it. God hath said it, and all the Creatures in the World can not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate it. It was the promise made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> when he was fallen, it runne along to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and afterward to the <hi>Patriarkes,</hi> so that it must needs be so.</p>
            <p>It was the custome of the men of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Men of God, of ould had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the promises of the Messiah.</hi>
               </note> ledde by the Spirit of God, in these times, in any distresse to have recourse to the promise of the <hi>Messias,</hi> as for other ends, so for this, to raise themselves up by an argument drawne from the greater to the lesse. God will give the <hi>Messias,</hi> GOD will become man. <hi>A virgin shall conceive a Sonne.</hi> And therefore he will give you lesse mercies.</p>
            <p>I note this by the way for this end to teach us a sanctified manner of reasoning.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>How to reason with our selves in a sanctified manner.</hi>
               </note> Was it a strong argument before Christs comming. The <hi>Messias</hi> shall come, and therefore wee may expect inferiour blessings.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17803:17"/>
And shall not we make use of the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son now? Christ is come in the flesh, and is triumphant in Heaven, <hi>God having given Christ, will hee not give all things necessary whatsoever</hi>? Shall the reasonings before Christs comming be of more force, then these bee, now Christ is come, and is in glory, appearing in Heaven for us?</p>
            <p>Beloved, it should be a shame to us, that wee should not have the sanctified art of reasoning, to argue from the gift of Christ, to the giving of all things needfull for us?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>All promises founded in Christ.</hi>
               </note>The ground of this reason is this, All other promises whatsoever they are, are secundary to the grand Fundamentall promise of CHRIST. All promises issue from a Covenant founded in God man. Now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants come from love, and love is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the first person, <hi>loved,</hi> and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all love. Therefore if God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Christ the foundation of love, and out of love makes a covenant, and as branches of the covenant giveth many promises: Then having made good the maine promise of all, (<hi>Iesus Christ</hi>) will hee not make good all the rest? And therefore we should have often in our hearts, and thoughts, the accomplishment of all promises in Christ, and from thence make use of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17803:17"/>
expectation of all inferiour promises. For they issue from that love of God in Christ, which is fully manifested already.</p>
            <p>Wee have spoken of the Preface, <hi>Behold,</hi> which is a word usually prefixed before all the passages of Christ, his Birth, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, his comming againe. And great reason.</p>
            <p>For what doe wee usually behold with earnestnes? rare things, new things, great things, especially if they be great to admiration, and that concerne us neerely; usefull things, especially if they bee present. And is any thing rarer then that, <hi>A Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin shall conceive, and beare a sonne</hi>? then the Incarnation of Christ? never was the like in nature, never the like in Heaven, or earth, that God, and man, should bee in one person. It is a rare thing, a new thing, it is great to wonderment; and therefore in the 9. Chapter of this prophesie, <hi>His name shall bee called wonderfull,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Is. 9 6.</note> as in many other respects, so wonderfull in his Conception and Birth.</p>
            <p>And then all is for us.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christs concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and rare</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>To us a Child is borne, to us a Sonne is given,</hi> in the same Chapter. <hi>For us, and for us men, hee came downe from Heaven.</hi> And then to the eye of Faith, all these things are present: Faith know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no difference of time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:17803:18"/>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Christ is with us here by faith.</hi>
               </note>Christ is present to the eye of faith now. We see him sacrificed in the Sacrament and in the word; faith knoweth no distance of <hi>place</hi> as well as no distance of time: we see him in heaven, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> sitting at the right hand of God for the good of his Church, and therefore behold.</p>
            <p>If ever any thing were, or shall be great from the beginning of the world, to eternity, this is great, this is wonderfull. And if any thing in the world be fit for us, if any thing dignifieth the soule, and raiseth the soule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it selfe, it is this wonderfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Man out of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes wonders at poore things.</hi>
               </note>We out of our weaknes, wonder at poore pety things, as the Disciples at the building of the Temple, <hi>What stones are these</hi>? we wonder at the greatnesse of birth and place, but alas, what is fit for the soule being a large and capable thing to stand in admiration of? Here is that, that tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth admiration it selfe. <hi>Behold a Virgin shall conceive a Sonne.</hi> And therefore attend to the great matter in hand: this I thought good to adde, to what, I formerly delivered in that particular.</p>
            <q>A Virgin shall conceive a Sonne &amp;c.</q>
            <p>You need not goe farther then the text for wonders. For here are 2 great ones a Virgin, a <hi>Mother,</hi> and <hi>Godman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:17803:18"/>So in the words, you have the <hi>conception</hi> and the <hi>birth of Christ</hi> his humane nature, his divine nature, and his office to reconcile God and us in one.</p>
            <p>As he is God in our nature (hee tooke our nature into communion of person) so his office is to bring God and man together, his two natures is to fit him for his office; God and man were at much distant tearmes as could be, unlesse betwene the Devill, and God. And therefore <hi>God man</hi> in one person must performe the great office, of bringing such as were in such opposite tearmes toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Of his conception by the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> wee spake sufficiently, onely wee will adde this for farther explication. A further type of this was in the birth of <hi>Isaack.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isaacks <hi>birth a type of Christs.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Isaack</hi> you know was borne of a dead wombe. Christ was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of a Virgin, and in a manner farre more improbable then the other. Isaack was the <hi>Sonne of the promise.</hi> Christ <hi>was the promised seed,</hi> both in some sort miraculously borne. For indeed it was a true wonder, that <hi>Isaack</hi> should be borne of a dead wombe. And here that a Virgin should conceive. <hi>Sara</hi> had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to supply moisture and juyce to the fruit. And so here was nothing of a man to further Christs conception.</p>
            <p>I will shew why there must be this kind of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17803:19"/>
conception of Christ, which will helpe our faith exceedingly.</p>
            <p>First Christ must be without all sinne of necessity;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Why Christ must be without sin.</hi>
               </note> for else when hee tooke our nature, stubble, and fire had joyned together. <hi>God is a consuming fire,</hi> and therefore the nature must be purified, and sanctified by the holy Ghost in the wombe of the Virgin.</p>

                  <hi>Considerations to defile our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that God hath dignified.</hi>
               </note>But consider it specially in the raising and advancing of our natures to bee one with <hi>God.</hi> Shall <hi>God</hi> bee <hi>God</hi> with us in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in heaven, and shall wee defile our natures that GOD hath so dignified? Shall we livelike beasts whom <hi>God</hi> hath raised above Angells Let swearers, beastly persons, and profane hypocrites, either alter their courses, or else say they beleeve not these truths. Shall a man beleeve, <hi>God</hi> hath taken his nature into unity of his person, and hath raised it above all Angells, and can he turne beast, yea devill incarnate in opposition of CHRIST, and his cause? What a shame is this? can this bee, where these things are beleeved? A Christian should have high thoughts of himselfe, what shall I defile the nature, that <hi>God</hi> hath taken into unity of his person?</p>
            <p>And as hee hath dignified, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and advanced our nature so highly:<note n="4" place="margin">
                  <hi>Consideration.</hi>
               </note> so likewise hee hath infused, and put all the riches of grace into our nature. For all grace is in CHRIST, that a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17803:21"/>
finite nature can bee capable of. For CHRIST is neerest the fountaine. Now the humane nature being so neere the fountaine of all good, that is <hi>God,</hi> it must needs bee as rich as nature can possibly be capable of: And is not this for our good? are not all his Riches for our use?</p>
            <p>And therefore seeing our nature is dignified by <hi>Emanuell,</hi> and inriched ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly by his graces next to infinite. (For our humane nature is not turned to <hi>God,</hi> as some are conceited. It is not dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and so made infinite) yet as much as the creature can bee capable of, there is in Christ-man, and so shall wee defile that nature?</p>
            <p>And from hence that our nature is ingrafted into the <hi>God-head,</hi>
               <note n="5" place="margin">
                  <hi>Consideration.</hi>
               </note> it followeth that what was done in our nature, was of wonderfull extention, force, and dignity, because it was done, when our nature was knit to the <hi>God head,</hi> and therefore it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up all objections. As.</p>
            <p>How could the death of one man sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for the deaths of many milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obiection an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly it was the death of Christ, whose humane nature was ingrafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the second person of the Trinity. For (because they were but one person) whatsoever
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17803:22"/>
the humane nature did or suffered, God did it. If they had beene 2. Persons God had not dyed, God had not suffered, God had not redeemed his Church.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Scripture runneth comfortably on this;<note place="margin">Question.</note> 
               <hi>God hath redeemed the Church with his owne bloud</hi>: hath GOD blood?<note place="margin">Answer.</note> No, but the nature that GOD tooke into unity of persons hath blood, and so being one person with <hi>God, God,</hi> shed his blood. It is <hi>God</hi> that purchased a Church with his blood, it is <hi>God</hi> that dyed. The Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was Mother of <hi>GOD,</hi> because shee is the Mother of that nature which was taken into unity with <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon comes the dignity of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever Christ did, and suffered. Though hee did it in our nature, yet the <hi>God-head</hi> gave it its worth, and not onely worth, but <hi>God</hi> put some activity, some vigour, and force into all that Christ did. It doth advance Christ Mediatour according to both natures, And from hence ariseth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of properties, as Divines call it, which I will not now speake of. It is sufficient to see that whatsoever was done by Christ,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>What is done to by Christ, is done by God</hi>
               </note> was done by <hi>God</hi> hee being <hi>Emanuell,</hi> and therefore had its worth and dignity to prevaile with God. Hence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17803:22"/>
a forcible reason. That <hi>God</hi> must sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Divine Justice,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> because it was the action of a <hi>God-man.</hi> His great sufferings were the sufferings of the second person, in our nature. And hereupon from satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and merit, comes reconciliation betweene <hi>Ged,</hi> and us. <hi>God</hi> being satisfied by Christ, <hi>God,</hi> and we are at tearmes of peace: our peace is well founded, if it bee founded in <hi>God</hi> the Father, by <hi>God</hi> the Sonne, taking our nature into unity of his person. These things must have influence into our comforts, and into our lives, and conversations, being the grand <hi>Articles</hi> of Faith. And therefore wee ought to thinke often of them. Wee must fetch princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of comfort, and holines from hence, as from the greatest arguments that can be, therefore I desire to bee so punctuall in them. <hi>God</hi> is <hi>Emanuell,</hi> especially to make <hi>God,</hi> and us one. Christ is our Friend in taking our nature to make <hi>God,</hi> and us friends againe.</p>
            <p>But how doth friendshippe betweene <hi>God</hi> and us arise from hence?<note place="margin">Quest.</note> that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God</hi> in our nature. I will give 2. or 3. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of it.</p>
            <p>First it is good reason, that <hi>God</hi> should bee at peace with us,<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> because sinne, (the cause of division) is taken away, It is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17803:23"/>
sinne, (the cause of division) is taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is sinne that separateth betweene <hi>God,</hi> and us; and if sinne bee taken away, <hi>God</hi> is mercy it selfe, and mercy will have a current. What stoppeth mercy but sinne? Secondly, take away sinne, it runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine. Christ therefore became <hi>Emanuell God with us.</hi> Because <hi>hee is the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before <hi>Adam</hi> had sinned, there was sweet agreement and communion betweene <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> but sinne that devided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>God</hi> and the creature; now Christ have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made satisfaction for all our sins there can be nothing but mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2. Reason.</note>Againe Christ is a fit person to knit <hi>God</hi> and us together, because our nature is pure in Christ; and therefore in Christ, <hi>God</hi> loveth us. After satisfaction <hi>God</hi> lookes on our nature in Christ, and seeth it pure in him, Christ is the glory of our nature. Now if our nature bee pure in our head, (which is the glory of our nature) <hi>God</hi> is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us, and loveth us in him that is pure, out of whom <hi>GOD</hi> can not love us.</p>
            <p>As Christ is pure, and our nature in him, so he will make us pure at length.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">3. Reason.</note>Thirdly, Christ being our head of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, conveyeth the same spirit that is in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17803:23"/>
him, to all his members, and by little and little, by that spirit purgeth his Church, and maketh her fit for Communion with himselfe, for he maketh us partakers of the Divine nature; he tooke our fraile humane nature, that wee might partake of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, this is, of his Divine <hi>qualities,</hi> to be holy, pure, humble, and obedient, as hee was.</p>
            <p>And thus Christ being a head not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of eminence to rule, and governe, but of influence to flow by his spirit into all his members, is fit to bee a reconciler to bring God, and us together; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our nature is in him, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee doth communicate the same spirit to us, that is in himselfe, and by little and little maketh us holy like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <q>I hasten to the maine use of all.</q>
            <p>Then God the father, and wee are in good tearmes, for the second person is God, in our nature, for this end to make God, and us friends.<note place="margin">Job 9 3.2.</note> There is a notable place, of Scripture which I note for the expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions sake hee speaking there of a <hi>Days man. There is no Dayes-man betweene us that might lay his hand on us both,</hi> that is, a middle person to lay his hand on the one, and the other. Now CHRIST is the middle
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17803:24"/>
person, as the second person in Trinity. And then hee is God, and man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee is fit to bee Mediatour, to lay his hand on both sides, on man as man, on God as God. And CHRIST is a friend to both, to GOD as GOD, to man as man; and therefore hee is fit to bee an <hi>Vmpire,</hi> to be a <hi>Dayes-man,</hi> to bee a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> And hee hath done it to purpose, making that good in Heaven, that hee did on earth. And therefore labour to make a gracious use of all this. I know nothing in the VVorld more usefull, no point of Divinity more pregnant, no greater spring of sanctifying duty, then that God and man were one, to make GOD, and us one.

this <hi>Emanuell</hi> will appeare in our flesh ere long let us wait for the consolation of Israell. <hi>Ema<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nuell</hi> came downe to us, to take our nature u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him and to satisfie Gods wrath, that hee might take us to heaven with himselfe, and that we might bee for ever with him in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And therefore let us (if wee would make a true use of <hi>Emanuell,</hi>) desire to bee with him. Christ delighted before hee came in the flesh to bee with the sonnes of men, and hee is with us now by his spirit, and so willbe with his Church to the end of the world; and shall not wee bee with him as much as wee may? Indeed he loved our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so much, that hee descended from the height of Majestie, to take our misery and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse upon him, and shall not wee desire to bee with him in glory?</p>
            <p>There bee divers evidences whether wee have any ground of comfort in this <hi>Emanuell</hi> or no. This shall be one.</p>

It is the nature of love to desire perfect union, and therefore the Christian soule touched with the spirit of God will desire <hi>to bee dissolved and to be with Christ,</hi>

               <hi>as best of all.

For hee tooke our nature upon him, (beside his other ends) that hee might take our persons to make up mysticall Christ: hee married our nature, to marry our persons. And therefore if hee did it for this end, that wee might bee neere him as our nature is neere him, shall not wee make it a ground of comfort? that our persons shall bee

neere Christ as well as our natures.</p>

               </note>As CHRIST hath two natures in one person, so many persons make up one mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call CHRIST, so that our persons are wonderfully neere to Christ.

Christ is <hi>Emanuell,</hi> God with us in our nature. And will hee suffer his Church to want, that hee hath taken so neere to himselfe? can the members want influence, when the head hath it? can the wife be poore, when the husband is rich? whatsoever <hi>Christ</hi> did to his owne body, to his humane nature taken into the unity of his person, that hee will doe in some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his mysticall body.</p>

               </note>I will shew you some particulars. Hee sanctified his naturall body, by the Holy Ghost, and hee will sanctifie us by the same spirit. For there is the same spirit in head, and members. He loveth his naturall body, and so, as never to lay it aside to eternity. And loveth his mysticall body now in some sort more, for hee gave his naturall body to death, for his mysticall body. And therefore as hee will never lay aside his naturall body, hee will never lay aside his Church, nor any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17803:27"/>
member of his Church: for with the same love, that hee loved his naturall body, hee loveth now his mysticall members. As hee rose to glory in his naturall body, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended to Heaven: so hee will raise his mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body, that it shall ascend as hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended. I beseech you therefore consider what a ground of comfort this is, <hi>God</hi> tooke our nature on him, (besides the grand end of satisfaction) that hee might make us like himselfe in glory, that hee might draw us neere to himselfe. And therefore now <hi>Christ</hi> being in Heaven, having commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and authority over all things put into his hand; hee <hi>having a Name above all names in Heaven,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>9, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>and earth, that at the Name of Iesus every knee should bow,</hi> that is, every subjection should bee given; will he suffer any member of his body to suffer more then hee thinkes fit? No, seeing hee is in Heaven, and glory, for his Churches good. For all that he hath done and suffered is for the Church, and the Churches use.</p>
            <p>To conclude all, Let us consider, what wee are,<note place="margin">

               </note> let not a Christian bee base minded, let him not bee dastardly in any cause that is good, or <hi>Gods</hi>; Let him be on <hi>Gods</hi> side. Who is on his side? a Christian is an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable person, hee is a person that can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee conquered. <hi>Emanuell</hi> became man

to make the Church, and every Christian to be one with him. Christs nature is out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of all that is hurtfull. The Sun shall not shine, the wind shall not blow, to the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es hurt. For the Churches head ruleth over all things, and hath all things in subjection, Angells in heaven, men on earth, Devills in hell, all bow to <hi>Christ</hi>; and shall any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them that he loveth, unlesse for their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good? Therefore though they may kill a Christian and imprison him, yet hurt him they can not. <hi>If God bee on our side, who can bee against us?</hi> but <hi>God</hi> is on our side, and on what grounds? <hi>God-man</hi> hath procured him to be our friend, hee hath satisfied God; and therfore if we beleeve, we be one with <hi>Christ,</hi> and so one with <hi>God.</hi>

            <p>Wee have many against us, the Devils are against us,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Devill and the world our enemies.</hi>
               </note> the world is against us to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the favour of <hi>God,</hi> to hinder accesse to him in prayer, to stoppe the Churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with <hi>God,</hi> and hinder the sweet issue of all things that befall us as farre as they can; but their malice is greater, then their power. If <hi>God</hi> should let them loose, and give the chaine into their owne hand, though they seeme to hurt, yet hurt they cannot in the issue. And shall not we make use of these things in times of distresse? wherefore serve they but to comfort us in all conflicts with Satan, and in all doubtings that arise from our sinfull hearts?
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:17803:28"/>
Answer all with this. <hi>If God be with us, who can bee against us?</hi> If any bee against us name them, if not, be satisfied. And therefore come life, come death, Christ is our surety, he layeth up our dust, keepeth our ashes in the grave, and will Christ loose any member? <hi>Feare not Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob to goe into Egypt. For I will bring thee backe againe.</hi> So feare not to goe into the grave. The spirit of God will watch over our dust, and bring us to heaven. Therefore feare nothing; God will be with us in life, and death, yea for ever; and we shall be for ever with the Lord, as the Apostle saith in the <hi>Thessalonians.</hi> And that issue of all that <hi>Emanuell</hi> hath done, Christ was one in our nature, that hee might bring God and us into favour, that wee may be for ever with him in heaven, that we may be for ever with the Lord, which is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of all the promises.</p>
