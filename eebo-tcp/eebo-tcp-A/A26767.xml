            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, Added by a Perſon of Quality, who had the care of Reviſiing the Tranſlation.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the World the Life of Man being very long, and the Tranſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that happened neither great, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, nor many, there was little need of Hiſtory. The Father living many hundred years with his Children and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, had leiſure and time ſufficient to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in their memories the ſtory of the few Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents that were paſt; and no man coming then to govern any conſiderable number of men, till he had lived the ſpace of three or four of our longeſt lives put together, was by that time abundantly furniſhed from his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and what had happened in his own days, with ſo much prudence, as might qualifie him for Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:4"/>But when after the <hi>Deluge</hi> the Life of Man was brought by degrees to about threeſcore and ten, or fourſcore years, and much of the latter part of that ſmall period became unfit for buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by ſickneſs and other calamities of old age, and the affairs of the World grew numerous, whether conſidered as past, or preſent; then it became neceſſary that <hi>Memorials</hi> ſhould be kept for the relief of humane infirmity, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation of the memory of Actions, and that mankind, who had but a ſhort time to live upon the Earth, might in that time be quickly and eaſily furniſhed with an artificial Experience, derived from an artificial Memory; by which Governours might be qualified for government, and Subjects diſpoſed to a dutiful ſubmiſſion to the Prudence and Conduct of their Superiours: that ſo this ſhort and tranſitory Life of Man might be rendered as wiſe and happy as it was poſſible, and that Piety too might be nouriſhed in the minds of men by a ſerious reflection on the Works of Gods Providence, manifeſted in the ſeveral effects of his wiſe Conduct in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, whereby he has in every Age demonſtrated his Juſtice and Mercy in dealing to every man a Reward according to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the Cauſes of the invention of Letters, and of writing Hiſtories or <hi>Memoires</hi> of paſt Events for the uſe of Poſterity, by thoſe that had ſeen them, or were otherwiſe well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd concerning them. And thoſe into whoſe
<pb facs="tcp:45936:4"/>
hands theſe first Monuments fell, were mighty fond of them, and by often reading and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering them, in a ſhort time much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd themſelves in Wiſdom, Virtue, and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the firſt and moſt ancient Stories were written without any vain pomp of affected Words or Rhetorical Expreſſions: the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian not courting the Applauſe, but labouring hard for the Improvement of the Reader: And he again repairing to thoſe venerable Repoſito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not to ſeek a vaniſhing Light, unprofitable Pleaſure and Devertiſement, but a ſolid and durable Improvement, and the Rules of living well and wiſely. So there is a threefold uſe of Hiſtory: Political, Moral, and Divine. Of all which, briefly in their order.</p>
            <p>The Political uſe of Hiſtory is twofold: firſt, as it relates to Governours; and then, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Subjects or Inferiours.</p>
            <p>The advantages Princes and Great men, who are to govern others, do or may reap from the reading of Hiſtories well and wiſely written, are innumerable; but then they are to ſuch ſo well known, that I need not ſpend any time to remark them here; my deſigne not being to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct my Betters, but to improve (if I may) my Equals.</p>
            <p>And as to Subjects, the uſe of Hiſtory is not much leſs; by which, if they would ſeriouſly reflect upon what is paſt, they might learn many things that would be of great uſe to them, and render theirs and their Governours lives more eaſie and happy.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:5"/>
               <hi>1.</hi> For firſt, they might obſerve with what difficulties all humane Governments are beſet, how often God (for cauſes known ſometimes onely to himſelf) defeats the wiſeſt contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and deſignes of men: How neighbouring Princes interpoſe, and croſs or fruſtrate their undertakings, out of intereſt, fear, hope, envy, and the like: How often want of due inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proviſions, men, moneys, changes in the ſeaſons; and a thouſand other accidents inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene and prevent their purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Now this conſideration would certainly (if men were modeſt and juſt) procure from them a due regard for their Superiours, even then when they are unfortunate, and not make every unproſperous accident that happened, the effect of ſloath, negligence, careleſneſs, and ſupine ſtupidity. And being thus diſpoſed, they might ſometimes, at leaſt, find the reaſon of publick Calamities in themſelves; at others, in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God puniſhing the ſins of men; or in the neighbour Princes, or any other cauſe, rather than traduce and defame their Governours, and ſuſpect their fidelity to their own Intereſts and Honour, which muſt be infinitely dear to any man of ſence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Hiſtory will teach men, that Religion and Liberty are very ill ſecured for the moſt part by Civil War and Rebellion: for as to the firſt, the right hand of God planted it in the World by Miracles and the effect of a mighty Providence, without Force, Wealth, Eloquence, or Policy, by
<pb facs="tcp:45936:5"/>
the Bloud and Patience, the Meekneſs and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, the Holineſs and Reſignation of Saints, Martyrs, and Holy men: And as it was planted, ſo it muſt be defended, ſo it muſt be preſerved.</p>
            <p>But then there is nothing in the world more contrary to this method, than for Subjects to raiſe Tumults, encourage Inſurrections, liſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and attempt the ruine and deſtruction of their Princes and fellow-Subjects, to defend this Faith; which was planted by Meekneſs, and watered with the blouds and tears of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: and this, if Religion be never ſo appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently perſecuted and endeavoured to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed. But who can delineate the madneſs of perpetrating all theſe horrid Villanies out of meer fear &amp; jealouſie Religion ſhould be deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, before there is one drop of Bloud ſpilt, or one man ruined or attempted to be ruined?</p>
            <p>And as to Civil Liberty and Property, they were won from kind and good-natured Princes, by the dutiful Carriage and Civility of their Subjects. And therefore there is ſcarce a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep of them to be found amongst thoſe Nations that were never Civilized; and many of them have never enjoyed thoſe rare Bleſſings, but in a low degree, and ſome ſcarce at all, as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as there is nothing more ungrateful, than for men to turn the Favours of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or indeed of any man, into occaſions of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Reſiſtance, even when there is a real cauſe to be concern'd for the loſs of theſe precious
<pb facs="tcp:45936:6"/>
and ineſtimable Jewels; ſo is there nothing more fooliſh, than for men to put theſe Darlings of theirs to nurſe in Fields and Camps, reeking with the Bloud of their fellow-Subjects, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Fire and Smoak amidſt the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cannon, the ratling of Drums, the ſhrikes and groans of dying men, and all that is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to fleſh and bloud; and after all to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of an enraged Prince, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; and into the leſs-merciful clutches of their own Souldiers, if they happen to overcome their Prince. Certainly there cannot be a more impolitick Errour committed by Subjects, than to reſiſt and rebel, when their Priviledges are really invaded: but then to do all this by way of prevention to be wheadled and cajoled into ſuch miſeries as thoſe with the meer fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of contingent and poſſible deſignes, this is a degree of Rage beyond all other human madneſſes, and can be inſpired by nothing but Furies &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Devils, who take poſſeſſion of the very ſouls of ſuch men, as they are ſaid to have done heretofore of ſome mens bodies. And there is not a more powerful Amulet againſt theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, than a due obſervation of the Tragedies theſe Devils have heretofore raiſed in the world. The truth is, almoſt all the Nation are ſatisfied that next the Mercies of God, nothing did more contribute to our late Preſervation, than the remembrance of our former Miſeries: And the Hiſtory of them may have very near the ſame effect upon our Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:6"/>
               <hi>3.</hi> The third and laſt Political uſe of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is to acquaint the World with the nature and temper of men. There is ſcarce any thing more difficult than for a man to know himſelf well; and if he did not ſometimes ſee himſelf in others, he would hardly perhaps ever do it: But then who but God can pretend to know all the various, changeable, and inconſtant humours, deſignes, and ends of the Maſs of Mankind in the ſpace of thoſe few years we are to live? and yet if it were poſſible, how infinite is the danger of being miſtaken and purchaſing our experience at the price of our ruine?</p>
            <p>But Hiſtory, like a kind Miſtriſs, leads us by the hand into her delightful Gardens, and there reads Lectures upon every Flower, Plant, and Weed, and truly acquaints us how this and the other ſped well or ill; and then aſſures us our Fortune will be the ſame, if we be not ſo wiſe as to take her word, but will be trying over again the ſame Experiments upon our ſelves or others. But above all, if we take <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goues,</hi> People-drivers, the Flatterers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of the <hi>Many,</hi> for good men, or good friends, or in ſhort, any man for a good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-man or Patriot, who is not a good loyal hearty Subject.</p>
            <p>If men would thus a while conſult in Hiſtory the honeſt policy of preſerving themſelves and their Countries from Ruine and Confuſion, they could not but obſerve, that <hi>Immorality</hi> was in every Age the greateſt Enemy of Mankind.

That Ambition, Pride, Avarice, Revenge, Luſt, and Luxury, and the reſt of thoſe horrid deformities of Mortality, were the real weights which ſet theſe Machines in motion, which have torn down Empires, and ruined the most flouriſhing Kingdoms; and particularly have in the memory of man twice, bid fair for the ruine of ours, under two Princes of ſo exact a Juſtice, and ſo God-like a Clemency and Goodneſs, that their Subjects having no real Calamities to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of (which is a Felicity rarely given by Heaven to the beſt Ages) our wanton Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſick of Peace, Plenty, and Proſperity, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the Cabinet of God Almighty, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent boſoms of two excellent Princes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they diſcovered their deſignes of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Popery and Arbitrary Government. And by theſe <hi>Chimerical</hi> fears intoxicated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiched the poor Populace, and putting them at last in fearful Commotions, theſe quick-ſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Privado's of Heaven, the Cenſors of Princes, the Darlings of the Rabble, mounted the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and drove the People as the Devils did the heard of Swine down the ſteep Rocks of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, Schiſm, and Treaſon, while they who put them into this miſerable condition, reaped the Wealth, and divided the Honours and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the Nation amongst them, and under the mask of a pompous Piety, were reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly proud, covetous, ambitious, revengeful, inſolent, treacherous, perjurous, and in a word, a parcel of the moſt ſanctified Rogues and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that ever the Sun ſhin'd upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:7"/>When God Almighty reduced us out of our Hell of Miſery, and <hi>Chaos</hi> of Confuſion, there was no Apologie more frequent in the mouths of men than this: <hi>Who could have thought that men of ſuch ſeeming Piety, of ſo exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eminent a zeal for the Glory of God, the Proteſtant Religion, and the Liberty and Property of the Subject, that ſuch men, I ſay, as theſe ſhould hatch in their minds ſuch horrid Villanies, Treaſons, Rapines, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Perjuries, and ambitious Projects, as we have ſince with aſtoniſhment ſeen them practiſe?</hi> Well, if they had wiſely conſidered the Hiſtories of other Countries, or of former Ages, they might eaſily have foreſeen and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all this Miſery: for whenever men are more ſollicitous for the faults of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, than careful to amend their own; when they ſeek to win the entire love and eſteem of Subjects from their Princes and Governours; let the outſide be what it will, there is Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and Diſcontent within: and therefore ſuch men, of all others, are never to be truſted.</p>
            <p>This Thought well purſued, will lead a man home too, and give him an occaſion to ſearch his own heart, and try diligently whether he is a good and uſeful Member of the Civil Society in which he lives: If he is under the dominion of any of theſe Vices, let him never call himſelf a loyal Subject, or a good Patriot; for whatever his preſent intentions are, he will be neither,
<pb facs="tcp:45936:8"/>
when his Intereſt ſhall lie croſs to his Duty. And becauſe it is much harder to believe ill of ones ſelf, than of another, let Hiſtory acquaint him how many men have been drawn in by their own ſecret, and in all probability to themſelves undiſcovered Vices, till beyond their firſt inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or thoughts, they have been ſwallowed up in an Abyſs of horrible Crimes and Diſorders; and what have betided them, may be our lot too, if we do not purge out, or at leaſt watch the motions of theſe Diſturbers of the World in us.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines of Morality are ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and uneaſie to corrupted minds, and do not eaſily inſinuate and obtain admiſſion; and when they are received, do often make ſuch ſlight impreſſions, that they vaniſh in oblivion and forgetfulneſs: but examples convey them to us with pleaſure and delight, and the variety and wonderful accidents that are to be met with in all Hiſtories, which are nothing but the imagery and various colours of Virtues and Vices embodied and made viſible to us, make vived and laſting impreſſions on the minds of men, and ſtamp and engrave the Ideas of them on the fancy and memory, ſo that nothing but death can deſtroy or obliterate thoſe impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And this was one reaſon why the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents cloathed their moral Obſervations in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, Fables, and Parables; but Hiſtory ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reality of perſons, names, times, and places, do infinitely exceed theſe fictitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations:
<pb facs="tcp:45936:8"/>
and therefore as Hiſtory grew up in the World, theſe fictitious Images of it were laid by and antiquated.</p>
            <p>Examples fit all Capacities, at leaſt ſome or others of them, in a vaſt variety; whereas Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts can hardly be ſo cloathed, but ſome will deſpiſe the meanneſs of the language, or others not underſtand the goodneſs of it: whereas Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples fit themſelves to all Capacities, and teach men before they are aware of it, the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Virtue, the turpitude and baſeneſs of Vice, and the different events which for the moſt part in every Age have attended them.</p>
            <p>This brings me to the third particular I propoſed, the divine uſe of Hiſtory. As the World was not the Product of blind Fate or Chance, but the Work of a Great, Wiſe, and Holy God, who raiſed and built it out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his infinite Power, and by his Wiſdom brought it into this beautiful order in which we behold and admire it: So neither did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it when he had form'd and adorn'd it, but has ever ſince govern'd it with one unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and irreſiſtible Providence and Wiſdom. And this not onely the inanimate and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of it, but above all, his eyes are upon the children of men; and in the government, protection, preſervation, rewarding and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exalting and abaſing them, he exerciſeth ſo ſteady, juſt, and reaſonable a <hi>Providence,</hi> but withal, ſo abſtruſe, hidden, and reſerved, that it exceeds the Wiſdom of the greateſt
<pb facs="tcp:45936:9"/>
and wiſeſt of men to penetrate into the reaſons of it, or to foreſee the events before they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves in time.</p>
            <p>Now in the Hiſtory of the Actions and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of mankind, there is an undeſigned Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of this <hi>Providence</hi> of God, which like ſome Rivers, ſometimes run above ground plain and delightful, or terrible and inſtructive at the firſt glance; but at others, buries it ſelf under Mountains and Hills: and though in thoſe ſecret receſſes it ſtill (like thoſe Rivers) maintains an uninterrupted courſe, yet can no mortal eyes purſue its ſtreams, and obſerve its windings and turnings, or when and where it will break out and again diſcover it ſelf, till he himſelf is pleaſed to bring it into the light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Now Hiſtory has brought down an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted thread of the methods of Providence from the creation of the World to this day; by which, as in a Glaſs, we may ſee a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Juſtice and Mercy of God in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with the ſons of men, and admire that wonderful Wiſdom and Power, which, without offering violence to the freedom of mens wills, has yet been able to diſpoſe them to effect his own moſt holy purpoſes, when they leaſt deſigned it; without any violence has protected Virtue againſt the utmost rage of Men and Devils, and preſerved it through all the Ages of an ill World; and puniſhed Vice by it ſelf, in ways ſo abſtruſe and ſecret, that the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb facs="tcp:45936:9"/>
have been ſtun'd and amazed to ſee not onely their ill deſignes over-ruled, but made the Inſtruments of their own deſerved ruine.</p>
            <p>There is no one thing that hath in every Age ſo much ſtaggered the belief of a divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governing the World and the Affairs of Mankind, as the proſperity of wicked and lewd men, and the miſery and oppreſſion of good and virtuous men. But this Miſt will vaniſh like ſmoak, when men are pleaſed to take a view of past Ages, and obſerve the <hi>Cataſtrophies</hi> of the ſeveral Periods and Ages: for that which may ſeem at one time to be all Myſtery and Riddle, will by degrees open and unfold it ſelf, till at laſt there will be nothing more apparent, than that God had all this while his eyes upon both the one and the other, and kept the inviſible Reins in his own hands, and by ways, unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both by the good and bad, at laſt, tho not ſuddenly, brought them to their deſerved ends, and recompenced both according to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent deſerts; and this will give us an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that as it has been in paſt Ages, ſo it will be in ours; the ſame God is ſtill at the Helm, and he will, as heretofore he has, conduct us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to that end we have deſerved, be it good or bad, without reſpect of perſons, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us in Peace and Virtue, diſpel all melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly thoughts, and free us both from ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and practical temptations.</p>
            <p>It is not hard to apply all I have ſaid to the Hiſtory of our Late Revolutions in <hi>England;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:10"/>
but as I deſigne a Preface to a very ſhort Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of them, and ſo muſt not be long: ſo the Reader will be much more inſtructed and better pleaſed to reflect upon that Hiſtory, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with this Preface, and then determine with himſelf whether theſe thoughts of mine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion are pertinent, and whether there be any thing in the following Story that will prove and illuſtrate the truth of what I have here ſaid; and therefore to him I ſhall leave it.</p>
            <p>But becauſe theſe Pieces never appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> may I have the Readers leave to give him a ſhort account of the deſignes of them.</p>
            <p>The Author of the firſt two Parts was Dr. <hi>Geo. Bates,</hi> a learned and an eminent Phyſician of <hi>London</hi> in the laſt Age, who was afterwards Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and ſo muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be intimately acquainted with many things which were not known to others, and had means to look through all the diſguiſes of that cunning Impoſtor, as his Station and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo afforded him an eaſie acceſs to most of the Grandees that had then a large ſhare in promoting the Miſeries of <hi>England.</hi> The firſt part was publiſhed in the time of <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> and yet is written in an Air and Stile which ſhews the Author durst ſpeak truth, when if diſcovered, his life would have paid the price of his Veracity; and yet that time too may yield us a good aſſurance he did not venture his life for falſhoods and ſlaunders; it was not
<pb facs="tcp:45936:10"/>
then a time to bely proſperous, inſolent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Villains.</p>
            <p>He gives us this account of the Work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by an Epilogue added in a latter impreſſion, at the end of the Firſt Part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whilſt the Original of this ſmall Hiſtory was in Writing, it was ſeveral times ſeen by the Reverend</hi> George <hi>Lord Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter, <hi>the Worthy</hi> Nicholas Oudart <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and Counſellour to the</hi> Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range; <hi>by Sir</hi> John Wederburn <hi>Knight; by Dr.</hi> Richard Owen <hi>Profeſſor of Divinity, and Rector of St.</hi> Swithins <hi>in</hi> London; <hi>by Dr.</hi> George Ent, <hi>heretofore Phyſician to</hi> Charles <hi>the Firſt, and now to the preſent King; and alſo by</hi> Fabian Philips <hi>an Attorney, who was my Aſſiſtant in ſearching the Rolls, Offices, and Monuments of the Law, (that I may not mention</hi> Dugard <hi>who printed it) men above all exceptions: although there is an inſolent Defamer, who pretends I have fathered another mans Work, whoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies I neither value nor fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Paſſage is inſerted by him onely to prove he was the Author of it, but is at the ſame time a ſtrong proof of his integrity: for it is very well known, theſe Perſons were not all of one ſide in our late Diſtractions.</p>
            <p>The firſt Part of this Piece was firſt printed about the year <hi>1651,</hi> without his name, for the information of Strangers, and therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth a ſhort account of the Prerogatives of the
<pb facs="tcp:45936:11"/>
Crown, and the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subject, here; which had been ſo abominably miſrepreſented to Forreigners, that they ſtood generally in great doubt on which ſide the right lay, and conſidering the time when it came out firſt, nothing could be of greater uſe and benefit to the then-oppreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of our late Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Nor was it onely uſeful abroad, but at home alſo: for the People of <hi>England</hi> were then ſo diſtracted by the Contradictions betwixt the Royal and the Rebel Party, that they, at leaſt many of them, did as little know on which ſide to give their Verdict, as the Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hence the Learned and Ingenuous Mr. <hi>Henry Foulis,</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>Hiſtory of the wicked Plots of our pretended Saints,</hi> gives us this Account of himſelf: <hi>As for the Author</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whilſt a School-boy, he was too much ſway'd to</hi> Presbytery; <hi>and delighting in the Stories of our Times, had none to peruſe, but</hi> May, Vicars, Ricraft, <hi>and ſuch-like partial Relators: by which means believing, with the ignorant, all things in print to be true, he was perſwaded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the wrong ſide. But a little before his going to the</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, <hi>lighting by chance upon Dr.</hi> Bates<hi>'s judicious Book</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenchus Motuum, <hi>he found the Laws and true Government to be oppoſite to his former Readings, and therein the Knavery and Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their Oppoſers, ſtrange things which
<pb facs="tcp:45936:11"/>
he had never heard of before. Which, with ſome other aſſiſtance, ſo far prevail'd with him, that in a ſhort time he threw off Father Schiſm, and ever ſince, like little Loyal</hi> John <hi>in the Epitaph,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>For the King, and Church, and Bloud-Royal,</l>
                  <l>He went as true as any Sun-Dial.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſome others who have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the World in print, the benefit they and the Government received from this firſt Part.</p>
            <p>The Second Part was added by Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> after his late Majeſties Reſtitution, to inform the World of the manner of his Majeſties E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape from <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and how things were carried till the depoſition of <hi>Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> wherein is an excellent account of the bloudy War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the juſt Judgment of God upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenanters for joyning with our Engliſh Parliamentarians, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſetting up <hi>Presbytery</hi> here, but indeed to inrich themſelves the ſecond time with the Spoils of <hi>England;</hi> the effect of which was, that <hi>Presbytery</hi> was ruined even in <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>O. C.</hi> and his victorious Independant Army, and they loſt at the ſame time all their Civil Priviledges, and were treated, till the Kings return, as a conquered People by their fellow-Rebels.</p>
            <p>The Third Part was written by one Dr. <hi>Tho. Skynner,</hi> another Learned Phyſician, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb facs="tcp:45936:12"/>
and bring down the Story, and ſhew the Joy of our Nation at the Reſtitution of his late Majeſty. It is in the Original written in a florid ſtile, and full of curious and ingenuous Reflections.</p>
            <p>The Tranſlations of all theſe have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with great care, to make them both true to the Originals, and delightful to the Reader; onely the Tranſlator thought fit to ſupply ſome Papers which are but hinted at, or wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Author; as the Treaty of the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in the Firſt Part; the Coronation-Oath, in the Third; and others. And alſo when there are any Papers or Expreſſions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to publiſh the original Papers and words, when he could find them; but when not, he hath humoured the Tranſlation as near the Latin as the ſence of the Author and <hi>idiome</hi> of the two Languages would permit.</p>
            <p>There is great hope that this ſhort account of our late horrible Confuſions here in <hi>England,</hi> which is ſo acceptable in the Original to all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners and Learned Engliſh-men, may now tranſlated be no leſs acceptable to all thoſe who either cannot read the Latin, or care not to give themſelves ſo much trouble; and that it may contribute ſomething to the interest of the Government, by forewarning men how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to thoſe courſes again which produced ſuch dreadful Effects heretofore.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſupplication of the Houſe of Commons, that whereas all Parliamentary Judgment belongs to the King and the Peers, and not to the Commons, unleſs by a Grant and Permiſſion from the King, it would pleaſe the Kings Majeſty that they be not, contrary to cuſtom, obliged to give Judgment; whereupon the King for the future excuſed them from that trouble, reſerving the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary power of Judging for the time to come to the King and Houſe of Lords onely, (ſave onely in making Laws, or impoſing Taxes and Subſidies) unleſs when it ſhall otherwiſe ſeem fit to the Kings Majeſty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their particular counſel and aſſent for diſpatching the publick Affairs of the Nation.</hi>

            <p>Nay, it was of old the cuſtom alſo, that if any Controverſie or Doubt aroſe about the validity of the Election of the Members of the <hi>Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> the matter was not determined by the other Members of the ſame Houſe, but either by the Lords in the Upper Houſe, or by the Judges in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.

            <p>This alſo is peculiar to the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> (that we may again return to their Priviledges) that it belongs to them firſt to debate and form the Bill for raiſing Money from the People.</p>
            <p>Such therefore is the wonderful temper of our <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> have their ſeveral parts in the publick adminiſtration of Affairs; yet with that harmonious proportion, that

All can help, but none of them hurt the <hi>Publick.</hi> For the Prerogative of the King that gives him the ſupreme power of Government, and of Peace and War, tends to this, that he may have ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend the Laws againſt the Factions of the Nobility, and the Tumults and Inſurrections of the people: whilſt the Nobles, by the high Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they have in giving Judgment and making Laws, can on the one hand put a ſtop to tyrannical attempts, if any ſhould be offered by the King; and on the other, curb the inſolence of a tumultuous and ſeditious common People.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45936:60"/>
how impoſſible it is (in the condition he now ſtands) to fulfil the deſires of his two Houſes, ſince the onely ancient and known ways of paſſing Laws, are either by his Majeſties perſonal aſſent in the Houſe of Peers, or by Commiſſion under his great Seal of</hi> England; <hi>he cannot but wonder at ſuch failings in the manner of addreſs which is now made unto him, unleſs his two Houſes intend that his Majeſty ſhall allow of a great Seal made without his authority, before there be any conſideration had thereupon in a Treaty; which as it may hereafter hazard the ſecurity it ſelf, ſo for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſeems very unreaſonable to his Majeſty. And though his Majeſty is willing to believe that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of very many of both Houſes, in ſending thoſe Bills before a Treaty, was onely to obtain a Truſt from him, and not to take any advantage by paſſing them, to force other things from him, which are either againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience or honour; yet his Majeſty believes it's clear to all underſtandings, that theſe Bills contain (as they are now penned) not onely the diveſting himſelf of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, and that without poſſibility of recovering it either to him or his Succeſſors, (except by repeal of theſe Bills) but alſo the making his Conceſſions guilty of the greateſt preſſures that can be made upon the Subject, as in other particulars, ſo by giving an arbitrary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power to the two Houſes for ever, to raiſe and levy, for Land and Sea-ſervice, of what perſons (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction and quality) and to what numbers they pleaſe; and likewiſe for the payment of the Arrears, to levy what moneys, in ſuch ſort, and by ſuch ways and means (and by conſequence upon the Eſtates of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever perſons) as they ſhall think fit and appoint; which is utterly inconſiſtent with the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject, and his Majeſties truſt in protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: ſo that if the major part of both Houſes ſhall think it neceſſary to put the reſt of the Propoſitions into Bills, his Majeſty leaves the world to judge how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45936:60"/>
it would be for him to conſent thereunto; and if not, what a ſtrange condition (after paſſing thoſe four Bills) his Majeſty and all his Subjects would be caſt into. And here his Majeſty thinks it not unfit to wiſh his two Houſes to conſider well of the manner of their proceeding; that when his Majeſty deſires a perſonal Treaty with them for the ſetling of a Peace, they in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer propoſe the very ſubject matter of the moſt eſſential part thereof to be firſt granted; a thing which will be hardly credible to Poſterity: Wherefore his Majeſty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that neither the deſire of being freed from this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and irksome condition of life his Majeſty hath ſo long ſuffered, nor the apprehenſion of what ſhall befal him in caſe his two Houſes ſhall not afford him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Treaty, ſhall make him change his reſolution of not conſenting to any Act, till the whole be concluded. Yet then he intends not onely to give full and reaſonable ſatisfaction in the particulars preſented to him; but alſo to make good all other Conceſſions mentioned in his Meſſage of the</hi> 16th <hi>of</hi> Novemb. <hi>laſt, which he thought would have produced better effects than what he finds in the Bills and Propoſitions now preſented unto him.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>And yet his Majeſty cannot give over, but now again earneſtly preſſeth for a perſonal Treaty, (ſo paſſionately is he affected with the advantages which Peace will bring to his Majeſty and all his Subjects) of which he will not at all deſpair, (there being no other viſible way to obtain a well-grounded Peace). However, his Majeſty is very much at eaſe within himſelf, for having fulfilled the offices both of a Chriſtian and a King; and will patiently wait the good pleaſure of Almighty God, to incline the hearts of his two Houſes to conſider their King, and compaſſionate their fellow-Subjects mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</hi>

So that the King alone was ſingly to ſuſtain the perſon of a Politician and Divine, againſt the ableſt <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarian</hi> Politicians and Divines of the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>In managing the <hi>Conference,</hi> the King alone,<note place="margin">The K.'s won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful prudence in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> with ſuch incredible Prudence and Eloquence, ſifted and bafled all their ſtrongeſt Arguments, with ſo great lenity and readineſs of condeſcenſion, granted their Demands even when he had made it appear they were unreaſonable (ſo far as with Honour and a ſafe Conſcience he could) that he raviſhed them all into admiration of him; and, which was an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſupernatural Wit, he brought over the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> who were his moſt inveterate enemies, even againſt their will, to his Opinion, (though their Employment, and the danger of their heads, obliged them, againſt their Conſcience, to continue in oppoſition to him.) Without doubt, in this, as in all things elſe, he gave a glorious proof of his Fatherly goodneſs, in that with his own loſs and prejudice onely he would gladly have redeem'd his people from the havock and miſeries of War.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conference</hi> had for ſome time been taken up in compoſing affairs,<note place="margin">In the middle of the Treaty the <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarians</hi> require that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called.</note> when of a ſudden news is brought to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the <hi>Marqueſs of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> was arrived in <hi>Ireland</hi> to govern that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in quality of <hi>Lord Deputy,</hi> by authority from the King; and that he was to ſettle a Peace there,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45936:81"/>
upon the beſt conditions he could; as alſo to levy an Army for delivering the King out of priſon. Upon this, Letters are ſent to the Commiſſioners in the <hi>Iſle of Wight,</hi> with inſtructions to demand of the <hi>King,</hi> that he would recal <hi>Ormond</hi>'s Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and turn him out of that authority which was ſomewhat uneaſie to the Pacificators.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, report is made to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by piece-meals of what was tranſacted in the Conference; where many with a mind as averſe, as the Kings was inclinable to peace,<note place="margin">The K.'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured in Parl.</note> quible at and cenſure the leaſt <hi>punctilio</hi> of every thing, unleſs all were condeſcended to in every tittle according to their own words and preſcribed form: for they were afraid (which ſome of them openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) that the Propoſitions being fully granted, and no more place left for Animoſity or Grievance, they might, if not by force from the people, yet out of ſhame be compelled to conclude a Peace in good earneſt, which they onely deſired in ſhew. For the the King having,<note place="margin">The K. unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many things.</note> contrary to the opinion of all, condeſcended to many things, had not onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſubject matter, but alſo the ſcrupuloſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and niceties of words.</p>
            <p>To the Preface, which aimed not ſo much at the publick Peace, as the branding of himſelf and his party with a note of Ignominy, he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but with this clauſe, <hi>That nothing in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſhould be taken for granted, unleſs all were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed upon in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He agreed to the Iſt Propoſition, of recalling the Declarations; to the XVIth, of the Forces; the XIXth, of the government of <hi>Ireland</hi>; the XVth, of the payment of publick Debts, <hi>Provided theſe Debts were ſtated within the ſpace of two years</hi>; to the XVIIth, of anulling Titles of Honours; the XIXth, of the chief Magiſtrates of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; the XIXth, of the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:45936:81"/>
Great Seal; the XIXth, of the Priviledges of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Of the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">There is no menſion of the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> in theſe Articles, thô it is expreſſed both here and in <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle, and perhaps was thought of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>, provided he had an hundred thouſand pound a year paid him in lieu of it.</p>
            <p>In all theſe points he made himſelf an eaſie prey to the avarice and ambition of others; and that he might render the <hi>Kingdom</hi> more peaceable to others, he even ſuffered it to be ſnatched out of his own hands.</p>
            <p>He gave his conſent to all the Articles of the IIId Propoſition, except one, concerning <hi>Biſhops</hi> and their Revenues; yet in that he was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wanting to the deſires of the Parliament: for whatever did not plainly appear to be of <hi>Divine Inſtitution,</hi> he allowed might be abrogated; ſo that he ſuffered <hi>Archiepiſcopacy</hi> to be aboliſhed, <hi>Epiſcopal Juriſdiction</hi> alſo, that is, the exerciſe of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,</hi> and the ſtate and priviledge of holding <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi>; but he would not ſuffer the power of conferring Orders (<hi>and adminiſtring Church-cenſures</hi>) as being <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> to be altered and leſſened.</p>
            <p>But at length the little <hi>Rabbies of the Aſſembly</hi> and <hi>Pacificators</hi> interweaving with the other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which he could better refute, that of invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> and promiſing privately, that if he would conſent to theſe at preſent, they would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after enlarge his Bonds, as alſo giving him hopes that the Parliament would condeſcend to him in other matters, provided in this he would remit ſomewhat of his ſtrictneſs of Conſcience; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents that for the ſpace of three years, <hi>Orders</hi> ſhall not be conferred by the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> without the conſent of <hi>Presbyters</hi>; nay, that the power of <hi>Ordaining</hi> ſhall be ſuſpended, until twenty Divines of his chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and an Aſſembly called by the Parliament, do meet, determine, and ſettle the <hi>Government</hi> of the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45936:82"/>
               <hi>Church</hi>; to which he promiſed to acquieſce, if the Parliament would do the like: In the mean time he is not againſt it, but that <hi>Presbytery</hi> may be ſetled for a tryal.</p>
            <p>Abhorring the thought of Sacriledge, he would not ſuffer <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Church</hi>-lands to be divided and alienated from the Church; but permitted them to be let out by leaſe for ninety nine years, paying a ſmall yearly rent for the maintenance of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> and as a token of their <hi>Tenure,</hi> provided after the expiring of the Leaſe, they ſhould return to the <hi>Crown</hi> to be employed for the uſe of the <hi>Church:</hi> which, in the mean time, he was firmly reſolved to redeem with his money, and to reſtore them to the <hi>Church-men</hi> to whom in right they belonged.</p>
            <p>Nor would he (being mindful of his Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt his own dangers) conſent to the XVIIIth Propoſition, concerning Delinquents; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That they might be moderately fined.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That they may be debarred from the Kings preſence and coming to Court: that ſome of them alſo may be baniſhed, but not as Traitors, nor yet to loſe their Lives and Eſtates, if they act to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That for three years they be excluded from ſitting in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That they might be brought to tryal, if it were thought fit, and be condignly puniſhed, if they had acted any thing againſt the known Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (which certainly favoured the Kings Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty): But he thought it unjuſt that any man ſhould be puniſhed for his Loyalty to him, according to the dictates of his Conſcience, and the municipal Laws, by a Law made <hi>ex poſt facto.</hi> Yet he condeſcended to other Articles of the ſame Propoſition, upon this condition, that pious and learned <hi>Church-men,</hi> free
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45936:82"/>
from ſcandal, might enjoy a third of their Livings, and not be totally deprived of the liberty of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>He could not, as he ſaid, recal the Authorities which he had given to the <hi>Marqueſs of Ormond,</hi> at the very time when himſelf was confined to priſon. The <hi>Parliament</hi> agreed with him in the reſt: which ſucceeding, then, according to the Conceſſions in the XIXth Propoſition, the Parliament ſhould have the ſole adminiſtration of the affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the mean time, however, he wrote to the <hi>Marqueſs of Ormond,</hi> commanding him to refrain from the execution of his power, ſo long as the Conference and any hopes of Peace continued.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Conference laſted, the <hi>King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The K. makes ſome Propoſals.</note> that he might not ſtill ſuffer ſo hard uſage, and that he might try how the Members of <hi>Parliament</hi> were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards him, gave ſome very juſt and uſeful Propoſals to be ſent to the <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, he deſires,<note place="margin">To which the Parl. in a great part conſent.</note> 
               <hi>That he may have leave to repair forthwith to</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>or any of his houſes near</hi> Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>where he may treat with his Parliament at nearer diſtance, with honour, ſafety, and freedom.</hi> Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, the <hi>Parliament</hi> having felt the pulſe of the <hi>City,</hi> and being encouraged under the hands of the moſt part and beſt of the Citizens, promiſed, ſo ſoon as the Propoſitions were granted, ſhould be allowed him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>King</hi> demands, <hi>That he may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the poſſeſſion of the Lands and Revenues of the Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>That he may have compenſation for his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Rights which the Parliament have thought fit to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh.</hi> To theſe alſo the Parliament willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That by an Act of Oblivion the memory of all things that had been done in time of the War,

might be aboliſhed.</hi> To this Propoſal they did not conſent, but with cautions and limitations, that gave liberty to the <hi>Parliamentarians</hi> to bring Actions againſt any almoſt of the <hi>Kings</hi> Party.</p>

            <p>His Enemies feigned him to be a man of weak Judgment, but found him to be a match, if not ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, to the choiceſt <hi>Politicians</hi> and <hi>Divines:</hi> They reviled him as cowardly and fickle, without faith, and of feminine inconſtancy; but in Battels they felt him to be valiant, perceived him undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Threats, Dangers, and Diſgraces, and unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Priſon and at Death.

            <p>If any thing could be objected to him, it was ſo far from being a fault in ſo rare a Prince, that it was the height of an unſeaſonable Virtue, inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with ſo vitious and corrupt an Age; that is, too much <hi>Lenity</hi> to the <hi>cruel, Candour</hi> to the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous and crafty, a <hi>ſtrict Juſtice and Certitude,</hi> which is not commonly the Virtue of <hi>Kings,</hi> a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> that diſtruſted his own Abilities, and a Mind ſo far from pride, that he was more apt to comply with the worſe Counſels of others, than to ſtick to the beſt of his own; as if he had indeed believed the Calumnies of his Enemies to be true.</p>

            <p>Now there was one thing mainly neceſſary for their future Deſigns, which (as they were pleaſed to flatter themſelves) was eaſie to be obtained.<note place="margin">They ſooth the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
               </note> The Friendſhip and Alliance of no Nation, nor People, ſeemed more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and neceſſary to them, than that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> both in reſpect of Neighbourhood and Situation of the Country, and of the Humour and Inclination of the People; nor did they want a pretext of making application to them.

ſeated upon <hi>Logh Foyle,</hi> where it contracts it ſelf into narrower compaſs, and is on each ſide beautified with goodly Meadows and Paſtures, as the Water is inriched with Fiſhes. Hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Colony of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under the Conduct of Colonel <hi>Docwray,</hi> was there eſtabliſhed; and many <hi>Londoners</hi> flocking thither afterwards, it was called <hi>London-Derry</hi>; the delightfulneſs of which place, drew to it ſo vaſt a number of Inhabitants, that it became, without Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,<note place="margin">London-Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ſtraitned by</hi> Ards,</note> the chief City of <hi>

               </note> which, indeed, he performed very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully and ſeaſonably. For ſwift-flying Fame having brought the news of his approach, <hi>Ards</hi> thought it ſafer preſently to draw off his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, than raſhly to ſight this Enemy, that had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the City to aſſiſt him, and leave Garriſons in Convenient places, that might curb and block up the Town, till upon <hi>Ouen</hi>'s departure, the Siege might be renewed again.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Ouen,</hi> with the joint aſſiſtance of the Beſieged, takes in all the Neighbouring Forts, and reſtored diſtreſſed <hi>London-Derry</hi> to full liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>

            <p>But without longer digreſſion, let us return to <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Inchiqueen,</hi> who having perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Actions beyond expectation, returned tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly to <hi>Finglaſs,</hi> where the <hi>Lord Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> had ſettled his Camp.

In Trinity Colledge of <hi>Oxford</hi> he was initiated in the liberal Arts, and made therein no contemptible Progreſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he applied himſelf to the Study of the <hi>Common Law</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi>; in which having got a little ſmattering, from his very Youth he drank in the Errours of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and aſſiſted the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> in drawing up a Petition againſt the holy order of Epiſcopacy; which was afterwards by <hi>Pennington</hi> and a numerous rabble of <hi>Londoners,</hi> ready at that time for ſuch attempts, preſented to the Parliament.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45936:137"/>
in ordering of Civil Affairs alſo to watch till midnight at length, as the Devil would have it, he was one of the chief in ſhedding of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Blood, his Memory, for that unparalelled Villany, being execrable to all Poſterity.

As to what concerns the eſtabliſhment of Presbytery, it was not certainly the intention of the Covenant, by force of Arms, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it upon people whether they would or not, unleſs it could be made out by Holy Scripture, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſound reaſon; to which they themſelves were ready to ſubſcribe.</hi> Afterwards <hi>they profeſs in the Name of God, and with bowels full of love and compaſſion, That it would be their greateſt joy, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms they might obtain ſatisfaction and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> This they cauſe to be diſperſed among the <hi>Scots</hi> that came to Market to <hi>Berwick,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to wheedle them, and create a good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of themſelves, and ſtir up Factions among the People.</p>

            <p>Hitherto all things ſucceeding according to their expectation; there only wanted a pretext of ſtaying in Lodgings, till all things might be made ready for their paſſage. For that end <hi>Henry Peters, VVindham</hi>'s Servant,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Peters</hi>'s device whereby he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides lodgings in that place.</note> who was privy to the deſign, applies himſelf to an Hoſteſs at <hi>Chayermouth,</hi> and, amongſt other diſcourſes, told her that he was ſervant to a worthy Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was deeply in Love with a Maid that had neither Father nor Mother, who lived not far off, and was as much in Love with him: But that her Guardian oppoſing the Marriage, he reſolved to ſteal her away by Night. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore asks her, if ſhe would for ſome hours en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45936:182"/>
them in her houſe; and at the ſame time gives her a ſmall Gift as a pledge of a greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and drinks a Glaſs of Wine with her. The woman ſoftned by the preſent, and touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Compaſſion for the young Lady, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to ſerve them. Leaving therefore <hi>Trent,</hi> the King ſets out towards <hi>Chayermouth,</hi> with <hi>Juliana Conisbey</hi> his pretended Bride, who was privy to the matter,<note place="margin">The <hi>King</hi> goes thither, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Juliana Conisbey</hi> with him as his Bride.</note> riding behind him upon the ſame Horſe. The <hi>Lord Wilmot,</hi> Colonel <hi>VVindham,</hi> and <hi>Henry Peters</hi> accompany them; and were met by <hi>Elden,</hi> who carried them into a private houſe, whither he went under pretext of view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little Farm: Here the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Majeſty</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf unto him, giving him a ſmall preſent as an earneſt of future Gratitude. From thence the Merchant goes to <hi>Lime,</hi> that he might give notice to the Maſter of the Ship, to be in readineſs to put to Sea at the appointed time; The King with the reſt went to their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at <hi>Chayermouth</hi>; and <hi>Peters</hi> to ſtay for the Boat. But having waited till it was almoſt day, he returned without any News of the arrival of the Boat.<note place="margin">But loſing hopes of a Ship, he preſently departs</note> This put them all into diſorder; and made them think of taking other meaſures, there was no ſafe place here to ſtay in; and the King was reſolved not to loyter a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>After a ſhort conſultation, the King with <hi>Juliana,</hi> and the Colonel accompanying them, advance towards <hi>Bridport,</hi> there to expect the coming of the Lord <hi>VVilmot</hi> and <hi>Peters</hi> in an appointed Inn. <hi>Peters</hi> being to go to <hi>Lime</hi> to learn from the Merchant the reaſon of the diſappointment: And <hi>VVilmot</hi> ſtaying behind in the Inn, upon pretext of new ſhooing his Horſe. But <hi>Elden</hi> the Merchant, who thought
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45936:182"/>
that by this time they had made half their Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, could not imagine the reaſon of the breach of promiſe, nor could he attribute it to any thing elſe, ſave that the man taking his leave of his Friends, it being then the Market-day at <hi>Lime,</hi> had drank ſo much as to make him forget the prefixed time.<note place="margin">Why the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Veſſel failed ſo foully.</note> But it was known after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the Maſter of the Veſſel being come home, to take clean Cloaths and other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for his Voyage with him, was locked up in his Chamber, and bolted in by his Wife: For that very day a Proclamation had been made in the Town, whereby <hi>it was declared Death for any Perſon to aid or conceal the</hi> King; <hi>and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds promiſed to any that could apprehend him.</hi> This put the woman into ſo great fear, leſt her Husband in doing that Office, which he had confeſſed to his Wife to have taken upon him, might ſuffer Shipwrack on Shore: She therefore uſed Entreaties, Tears, and almoſt Violence, to hinder him from it; and at length ſcreamed out, thereby to allarm the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood. Being therefore overcome by ſo much importunity, he kept at home, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to the direction of his Wife.</p>
            <p>Upon the way to <hi>Bridport VVindham</hi> went a little before the King, to view the Rode;<note place="margin">They came to <hi>Bridport</hi> full of Soldiers.</note> and coming near the Town, he found it to be full of Soldiers. For there was a Muſter that day, and a taking on of Soldiers, for an Expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> under <hi>Haines. VVind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was therefore for the Kings going to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, but he laying aſide all fear would needs enter the Town, leſt he might ſeem to have deceived <hi>VVilmot,</hi> and partly alſo that he might refreſh himſelf, tir'd out with night-watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and travelling, and wait for the coming of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45936:183"/>
               <hi>VVilmot.</hi> The <hi>Colonel</hi> took care to provide a Chamber and Victuals; which was no eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be done amongſt ſo many Gueſts. The King, in the mean time was employed in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Horſes into the Stable, and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; nor could he avoid talking with the Soldiers in the yard about his Journey.<note place="margin">Where the <hi>King</hi> was very near diſcovered by an Hoſtler.</note> But the Hoſtler looking him in the face as he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him the Horſes, told him, <hi>You are welcome, I know you very well. Where did you know me?</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the King. <hi>At Exeter,</hi> ſaid he; (for the King had continued long there during the heat of the War,) <hi>I lived two years in an Inn there. And ſo did I,</hi> replied the King, <hi>in the Service of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Porter. <hi>I am glad I have met with a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-man; but I perceive you are ſo buſie that you have no time to drink with me, when I come back from</hi> London, <hi>we'll talk of old Stories.</hi> Being pleaſed with theſe promiſes, and full of Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or God Almighty caſting a Miſt before his Eyes, he forbore all farther diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Shortly after, <hi>VVilmot</hi> paſſing through the Town, they take Horſe, and following the ſtreight Rode to <hi>London,</hi> they met with ſeveral Travellers in the way; and amongſt thoſe one who had formerly been a Servant to <hi>CHARLES the Firſt</hi>:<note place="margin">From thence, as good luck would have it, to <hi>Broad-VVind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</hi>
               </note> Therefore thinking it moſt conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to turn out of the Rode, they followed the next way upon the left hand; and having rid a long time, towards night they came to a Village called <hi>Broad-windſor. Windham</hi> goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to enquire where they were; what the name of the Village was, and whither the way led: And by good luck he ſtumbled upon an Inn-keeper an old Servant of his own, who had been alſo a Soldier in the Kings Army, pleaſed with this good Fortune, he ſpeaks him kindly,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45936:183"/>
and becauſe it grew dark he eaſily obtained Lodging that night for his Company. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it was not long before the Conſtable came with forty Soldiers at his back,<note place="margin">Where he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted by Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers quartering there,</note> who marching to the Sea Coaſt to be tranſported over to <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> muſt be quartered there. The Houſe being peſtered with them, the <hi>Kings Majeſty</hi> had but a very narrow Lodging, yet that was not all the inconvenience. For about midnight a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that followed the Soldiers fell into Labour: Which being noiſed about, the People of the Village flock'd together, and kept a bawling and heavy rout about the keeping of the Child and Mother, which continued till break of day,<note place="margin">And the Country People.</note> when the Soldiers, weary of the jangle, haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Ships.</p>
            <p>During the hubbub, let us look back a little to <hi>Chayremouth,</hi> where the Shoeing of a Horſe went near to have coſt the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> dear,<note place="margin">

               </note> by a diſcourſe ſtarted betwixt the Smith and the Hoſtler. The Smith asking, <hi>From whence came theſe Gentlemen? From</hi> Exeter, <hi>as they ſay,</hi> anſwered the Hoſtler.<note place="margin">
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon a ſuſpition occaſioned by his Horſes Shoes.</note> To whom the Smith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>but I dare ſwear theſe laſt Shoes were put on in the North.</hi> All other circumſtances being conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; to wit, that the Saddles were not taken off in the night time, that, though Travellers, they had ſat up all night, and that the Servant went out of the Inn early in the morning, they preſently conclude that they were Perſons of Quality, who flying, after the late <hi>Worceſter</hi> fight, had wandered thither,<note place="margin">The Hoſtler con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the place,</note> and that perhaps the King was amongſt them.

But neither was it fit to

diſturb him at his Morning Prayers; nor durſt the Hoſtler ſtay till they were winded out, for fear of loſing the Vails he expected from the Gentleman that was upon parting, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore returning,<note place="margin">Who having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly weighed the matter,</note> without any thing done, he lets him go. The Smith having blazed about the ſtory, preſently came the Miniſter, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitouſly enquiring of the Inn-keeper, what the Travellers were that he had lodged that night; from whence they came, whither they were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what was their Buſineſs there? His ſuſpicion being encreaſed by the Inn-keeper's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, he runs to <hi>Butler,</hi> the next Colonel, for obtaining a Warrant to raiſe the Countrey and Soldiers for apprehending the King.<note place="margin">He hunts after the <hi>King,</hi> tho too late,</note> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel refuſing, Captain <hi>Maſſey,</hi> quartered hard by, having gathered together as many Horſe as he could in the hurry, follows after on the <hi>London</hi> Rode as far as <hi>Dorcheſter</hi>; but the King, dy divine Providence, having quitted the Rode, he returned diſappointed of his fair hopes.</p>

            <p>Nor do the <hi>Republican</hi> Spirits onely prevail in the Parliament, but alſo in the Army.<note place="margin">The Republican Soldiers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his ruine.</note> For theſe conſult and plot together, how they might apprehend <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and bring him before the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to be accuſed and condemned of Treaſon; thinking with themſelves, that if they could lay Hands upon him, and make him Priſoner, there would be a ſudden change of Affairs; and that his Favourers and Adherents being thereby baulked, would ſculk and ſhift for themſelves. The truth is, the <hi>Officers</hi> of Three thouſand Horſe, and of no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of Foot, frequently met in <hi>Somerſet-houſe,</hi> and elſewhere, about the contriving and carrying on of that Deſign: But before the Matter came to maturity,<note place="margin">Which he ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſſolved the Parliament.</note> by the Treachery of <hi>Pride,</hi> it came to <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Ears, who, by a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty Diſſolution of the Parliament, prevented all thoſe Machinations, and disbanded thoſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>

            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:45936:230"/>After the Death of his Father, in his Youth, he married a Gentlewoman; but by his profuſe and luxurious way of living, in a ſhort time he ſquandered away both his own and Wives Eſtate,<note place="margin">His youthful Luxury and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> ſo that he was almoſt reduced to Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary.

               <note place="margin">He adviſes the <hi>Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.</hi>
               </note> he told the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarians,</hi> that the Rabble would never be able to fight againſt the <hi>King,</hi> whoſe <hi>Army</hi> conſiſted of Gentlemen, becauſe of the diſparity of the Cauſe and Motives, <hi>Honour</hi> moving the one, and <hi>Pay</hi> the other: but if they deſired to fight

with equal Courage, and overcome the Enemy, they muſt look out for and raiſe good honeſt Soldiers, that would fight meerly for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſake, or at leaſt place ſuch Officers of their Forces. Many have often heard him glory of that Advice. Having therefore obtained leave from the Parliament to raiſe a Regiment, by Letters or Meſſengers he invited the <hi>Honeſt Men</hi> (as he was pleaſed to call them) from among all the Soldiers in the ſeveral Counties, with whom he had had any acquaintance, and perſuaded them to take on with him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Independents, Anabaptiſts, Quakers,</hi> and, in a word, all the Sink of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> come flocking to him; ſo that he made up above a thouſand Horſe: who in the beginning being unskilful either in handling their Arms, or managing a Horſe, by Diligence and Induſtry became in proceſs of time moſt excellent Soldiers; for <hi>Cromwell</hi> uſed them daily to look after, feed,<note place="margin">His Military Diſcipline.</note> and dreſs their Horſes, and, when it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, to lie together on the ground; and beſides, taught them to clean and keep their Arms clear, and have them ready for Service, to chuſe the beſt Armour, and to arm themſelves to the beſt advantage. Trained up in this kind of Military Exerciſe, they excelled all their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Soldiers in Feats of War, and obtained more Victories over their Enemy. This was the beginning of the <hi>New Model,</hi> as they called it. Theſe were preferred to be <hi>Commanders</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in moſt part of the Troops of the Army; the places of Private Soldiers being fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up with luſty ſtrong Fellows, whom <hi>Oliver</hi> trained up and kept in very ſtrict Diſcipline.<note place="margin">His Command and Rule.</note> Afterward he was made <hi>Major-General</hi> of the Horſe, then <hi>Lieutenant-General,</hi> and at laſt <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi>;

till, after all, he raiſed himſelf to the Dignity of <hi>Protector,</hi> and invaded the higheſt Place of Honour and Authority.

            <p>THE Civil War of <hi>England,</hi> begun by a pernicious and fatal <hi>Parliament,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of things paſt.</note> raged for the ſpace of eight years with various ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of Battels; till the <hi>Royaliſts</hi> being in all parts worſted, and not able to keep the Field, <hi>Charles the Firſt,</hi> the beſt of Kings, a Prince of moſt exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but perſecuted Virtue, to avoid the victorious Arms of the <hi>Engliſh Independants,</hi> moved by ill fate or bad counſel, caſt himſelf into the arms of the <hi>Presbyterian Scots,</hi> by whom he was, for a round ſum of money, treacherouſly delivered up into the hands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Traytors.</p>
            <p>Nor was it long before he was a ſad inſtance, that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45936:242"/>
the Priſons of Kings are but little diſtant from their Graves.</p>
            <p>For (what the flagitiouſneſs of paſt Ages never attempted, and future Will hardly believe) the unfortunate Prince, to make way for the Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Traytor <hi>Cromwel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">January 30. 1648.</note> was forced by a ſceni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and mock-form of Law and Juſtice, to lay down his ſacred head to be ſtruck off upon a Block. The boldeſt Villany that ever any Nation ſaw; and a <hi>Parricide</hi> that all the World was aſtoniſhed at.</p>
            <p>But this Villany ſucceeding ſo proſperouſly, and <hi>Britain</hi> at length,<note place="margin">September 3. 1650. <hi>and</hi> Sept. 3. 1651.</note> and <hi>Ireland</hi> being ſubdued by victorious Rebels, as the Forces of <hi>Charles the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> were entirely routed by the defeats at <hi>Dumbar</hi> and <hi>Worceſter; Cromwel</hi> the Traytor delayed no longer the execution of his long-projected Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He knew full well, that the name of the <hi>Parliament</hi> was grown odious to the people, through the uneaſineſs of their flagitious and uſurped Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Turning therefore his Arms againſt his hauty Maſters,<note place="margin">April 20. 1653.</note> he turned them out of the Houſe, as Objects firſt of his own contempt, and then of the peoples ſcorn. The onely grateful action he did to the Kingdom.</p>

               <hi>Lambert</hi> followed another conduct; under an affected modeſty diſguiſing a proud ſpirit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring to nothing leſs than ſupreme Government. He had heretofore poſſeſſed a great ſhare in the friendſhip of <hi>Cromwel</hi>; but whether for his own or his Wife's ſake, I ſhall not determine. Nor was he thought to be diſpleaſed with the old man, ſo long as he hoped for a Succeſſour out of his Family, and to be adopted in the Army, where his reputation was great. He ſecretly deſpiſed <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as too low and unfit for Principality; thinking that he alone remained worthy to be advanced to Supremacy. Which afterwards more <hi>ſecretly,</hi> but not more <hi>juſtly,</hi> he attempted, rather than obtained.</p>
            <p>The awe of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> whilſt alive, gave ſome

The furious unſetled Colonels, without ſenſe or honeſty, laying aſide all care of Reputation or Juſtice, ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and fed their private hopes.

And at the ſame time news was brought to <hi>Monk</hi>'s Camp, that the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> was broken, and the <hi>Rump</hi> again in power.</p>
            <p>What could <hi>Lambert</hi> now between hawk and buzzard do? he was forſaken by Fortune, deluded by <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s confidence, over-reached by <hi>Monk</hi> under a colour of Peace, and deſpiſed by the <hi>Rump.</hi> Should he return to <hi>London,</hi> it was a long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult march; and perhaps as late for the ſuccour of his friends as dangerous to himſelf, having ſuch an Enemy in the rear. Should he engage <hi>Monk</hi> in a Country improper for Horſe, the ground being co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with Ice and Snow, it would be very uncertain, if not in vain, ſince in the dead of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Horſe could do no feats: What to do he could not tell.</p>
            <p>Nor were <hi>Lambert</hi>'s men truer to their Truſt than <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s had been at <hi>London:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The treachery of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s men towards him.</note> for ſo ſoon as they heard of the defection of the <hi>London</hi>-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, baſely, without conſulting their General, nay, and ſlighting his authority, they ſubmit to the <hi>Rump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few now were to be ſeen at <hi>Lambert</hi>'s door, and fewer within; nothing but ſilence, and ſeldom any Guards: He was no more General nor cauſe of the War; but where he hoped for <hi>Laurel</hi> and Triumph, he was fain to ſearch a hiding place: ſo that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any attendance, he ſpeedily and ſecretly betook himſelf to <hi>London.</hi> So fallacious and uncertain a thing is Power, when it is too great.</p>
            <p>A certain kind of Triumviral Power now exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſelf in <hi>Britain</hi> under <hi>Monk, Fleetwood,</hi> and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45936:253"/>
               <hi>Lambert,</hi> not much unlike to that Roman Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virat of <hi>Caeſar, Pompey,</hi> and <hi>Craſſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With almoſt the ſame gallantry <hi>Monk</hi> behaved himſelf in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as <hi>Caeſar</hi> heretofore governed in <hi>Gallia</hi>; but out of their Governments <hi>Monk</hi> out-did <hi>Caeſar:</hi> for the <hi>Roman</hi> being come into the City, offered violence to the <hi>Senate,</hi> and unjuſtly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the <hi>Dictatorſhip.</hi> The other entering <hi>London,</hi> under colour of reſtoring the <hi>Parliament,</hi> by a rare inſtance of Loyalty and Modeſty, reſtored the <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were the emulous and competing <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> more ſollicitous in drawing in <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> were in endeavouring to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociate <hi>Monk</hi> into the Government: for though they contributed their mutual aſſiſtance in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> yet it is certain, they hardly conſpired in any thing, but in the fear that both of them had of <hi>Monk. Fleetwood</hi> was jealous of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s ambition; and <hi>Lambert</hi> could not brook <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s authority: the one could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of an Equal, nor the other of a Superiour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monk</hi> therefore was courted by Letters from both, as having it in his power to give the Government to what Party he pleaſed. Nor could <hi>Fleetwood</hi> have expected better Conditions from <hi>Lambert,</hi> had he prevailed againſt <hi>Monk</hi>; which thoſe who favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in his Army perceiving, avoiding all opportunity of fighting with <hi>Monk,</hi> leſt <hi>Lambert,</hi> perchance, getting the victory, might turn out his Rival <hi>Fleetwood. Lambert</hi> can hardly be compared to <hi>Pompey,</hi> unleſs it be in boundleſs ambition, and the unhappy iſſue thereof; and <hi>Fleetwood</hi> not at all to <hi>Craſſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But without doubt it was the intereſt of the Publick that both were undone, ſeeing <hi>Monk</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the better, reſtored at length <hi>Britain</hi> to it ſelf.</p>

                  <p>AMongſt the many Mercies of God to theſe poor Nations, your peaceable Reſtitution is not the leaſt; it is (as you ſad) his work alone, and to him belongs the glory of it. And I eſteem it as a great effect of his goodneſs to me, that he was pleaſed to make me, amongſt many worthier in your ſervice, ſome way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in it. I did nothing but my duty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not to receive ſo great an honour and reſpect as you are pleaſed to give me at this time and place; which I ſhall ever acknowledge as a high mark of your favour to me. Sir, I ſhall not now trouble you with large Narratives; onely give me leave to acquaint you, That as I marched out of <hi>Scotland</hi> hither, I obſerved the People in moſt Counties in great and earneſt expectations of a Settlement; and ſeveral Applications were made to me, with numerous Subſcriptions to them. The chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt heads of their Deſires were, for a free and full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that you would determine your ſitting; a Goſpel-Miniſtry; encouragement of Learning and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities; and for admittance of the Members ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before the year <hi>1648.</hi> without any previous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45936:256"/>
Oath or Engagement. To which I commonly anſwered, That you are now in a free Parliament; and if there be any force remaining upon you, I would endeavour to remove it; and that you had voted to fill up your Houſe, and then you would be a full Parliament alſo; and that you had already determined your ſitting: and for the Miniſtry, their maintenance, the Laws, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities, you had largely declared concerning them in your laſt Declaration; and I was confident you would adhere to it. But as for thoſe Gentlemen ſecluded in the year <hi>1648.</hi> I told them, you had given judgment in it, and all people ought to acquieſce in that judgment; but to admit any Members to ſit in Parliament without a previous Oath or Engagement to ſerve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in being, it was never done in <hi>England.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſaid it not to them, I muſt ſay (with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) to you, That the leſs Oaths and Engagements are impoſed (with reſpect had to the ſecurity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe) your ſettlement will be the ſooner attained to. I am the more particular in theſe matters, to let you ſee how grateful your preſent Conſultations about theſe matters will be to the people. I know all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Gentry will cloſe with you, if they may be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and gently uſed; and I am ſure you will ſo uſe them, as knowing it to be the common concern, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh and not leſſen our intereſt; and to be careful that neither the <hi>Cavalier</hi> nor the <hi>Fanatick</hi> Party have yet a ſhare in your Civil or Military Power; of the laſt, whoſe impatience to Government you have lately had ſo ſevere experience of. I ſhould ſay ſomething of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> indeed <hi>Ireland</hi> is in an ill ſettled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and made worſe by your interruptions, which prevented the paſſing an Act for the ſettlement of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of Adventurers and Souldiers there, which I heard you intended to have done in a few days; and I preſume it will be now quickly done, being ſo neceſſary at this time, when the wants of the Commonwealth call
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45936:256"/>
for ſupplies: and people will unwillingly pay Taxes for thoſe Eſtates, of which they have no legal aſſurance. I need not tell you how much you were abuſed in the nomination of the Officers of your Armies there; their malice that deceived you hath been ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. I do affirm, that thoſe now who have declared for you, will continue faithful; and thereby convince, that as well there as here, it is the ſober intereſt muſt eſtabliſh Dominion. As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the People of that Nation deſerve to be cheriſhed much; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your late Declaration will much glad their ſpirits: for nothing was more dreadful to them, than a fear to be over-run with Fanatick Notions. I humbly recommend them to your affection and eſteem, and deſire the intended <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion may be proſecuted, and their Taxes made proportionably to thoſe in <hi>England;</hi> for which I am engaged in promiſe to become a Suiter to you. And truly, Sir, I muſt ask leave to entreat you to make a ſpeedy proviſion for their Civil Government there, of which they have been deſtitute near a year, to the ruine of many Families: and except Commiſſioners for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the Government, and Judges to ſit in Courts of Judicature, be ſpeedily appointed, that Country will be very miſerable. I directed Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> (whom I lately ſent to you, to give you an account of the affairs of the Scottiſh Army, and to make certain Propoſals in their names) to preſent ſome perſons to you, both for Commiſſioners and Judges, which he did; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of your great affairs, they were not diſpatched: but I humbly now offer them to your conſideration.</p>

            <p>If what the General ſpake was unpremeditated,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Monk</hi>'s Speech ſuſpected by the Members.</note> certainly it was well his upon: but how the <hi>Rump</hi> were ſatisfied with his Speech, the ſequel will make it appear. Beſides, his declining to take the Oath of Abjuration the day before, the freedom of his ſpeech mightily netled the <hi>Rump-Abjurors,</hi> who
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45936:257"/>
looked upon him as a Dictator rather than an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, commanding rather than petitioning; and who had ſeemed as much diſſatisfied with the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of <hi>Fanaticks,</hi> as the contumacy of the <hi>Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Abjurors</hi> in the mean time, thoſe Piles in the <hi>Rump,</hi> who had the ſole power in carrying of things, began to have jealouſies of the ſincerity of <hi>Monk</hi>'s intentions, and of the extraordinary affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people towards him; and having found an opportunity, they delayed no longer to make a tryal of his thoughts and hidden deſignes.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>Londoners</hi> refuſe to pay Taxes.</note>The <hi>Government</hi> of this <hi>Rump-Parliament</hi> was grown ſo contemptible and loathſome to the <hi>Londo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> that an Order paſt in <hi>Common Council,</hi> That unleſs they had a free and full Parliament, they would not pay one farthing of Taxes: which ſo ſtartled and incenſed the guilty and timerous minds of the <hi>Members,</hi> that <hi>Monk</hi> hath forthwith ſevere orders to march into the City,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">To which he offers violence</note>Though <hi>Monk</hi> abhorred thoſe cruel Orders of theſe <hi>Rulers,</hi> yet he marched into the City with armed Forces, and contrary to his own inclination, puts in execution the hateful Orders of the <hi>Rump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This unexpected Aggreſſion of <hi>Monk</hi> aſtoniſhed the City, and the People were in conſternation at it, appearing firſt by a profound ſilence, then ſecret murmurings, and amazed looks; but there was more ſadneſs than fury in the caſe, and the Town
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45936:257"/>
ſeemed rather ſurrendred than ſtormed. In the mean time the Souldiers had the chief command, ſlighting the Authority of the <hi>Mayor,</hi> and Dignity of the City.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Et nullos Comitatu eſt Purpura faſces.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>—And no Scarlet nor Gold-Chain appeared.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Now did the <hi>Londoners</hi> bewail their own credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the falſe hopes they had conceived of <hi>Monk</hi>; and deſparing of humane aſſiſtance, they directed their eyes to Heaven, preſaging no leſs than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Bondage to the City.</p>
            <p>This odious obedience performed by <hi>Monk</hi> to the <hi>Rump,</hi> put the Spectators to a plunge,<note place="margin">The action of <hi>Monk</hi> is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> and ſuffered various interpretations. But for what he ſo far hazarded his own Reputation in obeying the <hi>Rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers</hi> after this manner, or why, by ſo ſudden a change of counſel and conduct, he endeavoured to regain their favour again, I ſhall not venture to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. The truth is,<note place="margin">And is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpleaſed with himſelf for it.</note> being either conſcious to himſelf of the injury and affront done to the City, or having too much experienced the Arts and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the <hi>Rump,</hi> and being no leſs prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the Prayers of his Friends, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of all, he was ſenſible that his too great compliance with the <hi>Rumpers</hi> reflected upon his own Honour, and that the Indignity offered to the City, had raiſed him too much Envy.</p>
            <p>The ſame night being come back to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> and caſting about what was to be done in this tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kliſh ſtate of affairs, he called to Council privately ſome of the Officers who were his greateſt Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and privy to his ſecret deſignes, and having formed a Letter,<note place="margin">He ſends an angry Letter to the <hi>Rump. Feb. 11.</hi>
               </note> he therein angrily complaining of ſeveral things to the <hi>Rump,</hi> as, <hi>That his ſervices done to the</hi> Houſe <hi>were ſlighted, whilſt the late Traytors,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45936:258"/>
who were not much leſs Enemies to them than to the</hi> Commonwealth, <hi>had with them now much more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit and eſteem than he. From whence elſe proceed your new kindneſs to</hi> Lambert <hi>and</hi> Vane? <hi>and your new offences againſt me? If the perfidy of the</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks <hi>had ſtill diſpleaſed you, why did you with ſo much reſpect receive yeſterday that Leering Heretick</hi> Barebones? <hi>and the inſolent Rabble of</hi> Sectarians, <hi>which lewdly in his company approached you with a diſhoneſt Petition?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This kindneſs of the Houſe ſhewn to a Rabble of Hereticks, is not ſimple (ſincere). It is the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the whole Commonwealth, the general requeſt of the People, Citizens, Souldiers, of every one, and all, That the number of the Members being fill'd up within a week, and then your ſitting determined, you ſhould give place to a new Parliament.</hi>

               </note>In the mean time he himſelf haſtens into the City, that he might make amends for his fault, and wipe off the infamy of the foregoing day. Having ſent a Meſſenger before to acquaint the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi> with his coming, and muſtered his Army in <hi>Finsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>-fields, he is entertained at a ſplendid Dinner in the Lord <hi>Mayor</hi>'s houſe.

               <hi>He declared to them his trouble to ſee what affronts were offered to them by Orders from the Council of State, which he obeyed; yet diſliked that he was neceſſitated to comply with thoſe Commands; but with a reſolution always to run through the greateſt dangers to ſerve them: That he had not forgot their kind Letter at</hi> Morpeth, <hi>wherein he affectionately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, but was forced to retire backwards, like a Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, to make the better ground, and the more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            <p>
               <hi>Monk</hi>'s Speech was with delight and univerſal applauſe heard by the Citizens;<note place="margin">The Citizens rejoyce.</note> and the name of a <hi>New Parliament</hi> ſo pleaſed the minds of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that the City which appeared deſolate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected in the morning, ſeemed tranſported with joy at night, by the ringing of Bells and Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fires.</p>
            <p>Now was <hi>Monk</hi> in every bodies mouth;<note place="margin">And honour <hi>Monk;</hi>
               </note> and the Multitude not able to contain their ſecret joys, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed him the Honour and Deliverer of their Country;<note place="margin">Reproaching the <hi>Rump.</hi>
               </note> praying for and bleſſing him in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

They in great indignation complain, that the violence of old, offered by <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and more lately by <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> was not more grievous, than the preſent-impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious boldneſs of <hi>Monk,</hi> in prefixing a day to their diſſolution.</p>
            <p>But the old Commiſſioners, <hi>Scot</hi> and <hi>Robinſon,</hi> being ſent into the City to the <hi>General,</hi> they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the hypocritical Thanks of the <hi>Rump</hi> for his quelling of the City; and concealing their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure at his Letter, they promiſe a fuller Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and that their diſſimulation might be the more ſpecious, they invite <hi>Monk</hi> again to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> to aſſiſt them with his counſel.</p>
            <p>The General and his Friends gave them a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45936:259"/>
anſwer, as well knowing that the civility of the proud <hi>Rumpers</hi> was not for nought: However, it was the intereſt of both Parties to continue their diſſimulation.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> upon their return, having brought advice of the joyful familiarity that was betwixt the <hi>General</hi> and the Citizens, the <hi>Rump</hi> ſmelt out <hi>Monk</hi>'s deſigne, and were diſtracted in their thoughts.

            <p>So ſoon as <hi>Monk</hi> heard that he was made one of five <hi>Generals,</hi> being unaccuſtomed to affronts, and equally ſlighting the baſeneſs and treachery of the <hi>Rumpers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">He takes it in indignation.</note> he took greater care of his affairs: And that he might not make uſe of the counſel of Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Traytors onely, he deſires a Conference with the old ſecluded <hi>Members</hi>; upon whoſe ſenſe and inclinations when he found there was more to be grounded,<note place="margin">And ſends the ſecluded Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to the houſe. <hi>Feb. 21.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Lambert,</hi> before his Forces were ripe for Action, being thus unexpectedly beſet, for a laſt proof of his Valour drew up his men in order to fight, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reſt that was not in his power,<note place="margin">Both prepare to fight,</note> to deſtiny; and <hi>Ingoldsbey</hi> did the like: both for ſome hours mutually expecting the charge.</p>

                  <hi>Harriſon,</hi> rather of a baſe than low Birth, was the Son of a <hi>Butcher</hi>; bred at firſt a <hi>Pettifogging Country-Attorney:</hi> but in the heat of the Civil Wars, when the onely way to get into Power, was Fanaticiſm and Treaſon, he fled to the Rebellious Army; and there turning a furious <hi>Anabaptiſt,</hi> and advanced to be a Colonel, he grew very intimate with <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and his Competitor in Villany. But being a proud and haughty fellow, and a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate <hi>Republican,</hi> he fell out, and was highly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with <hi>Oliver</hi> when he was made <hi>Protector</hi>; not that he hated the Tyrant <hi>Cromwel,</hi> but diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be outſtripped, and to ſubmit to one who from a fellow-Souldier was become his Prince.</p>

Factions prevailed. He was the firſt of the <hi>Jugglers</hi> that from the Pulpit ſounded the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet to Civil War, a fellow full of talk, and had a knack of ſporting the People into Sedition, with an inſipid kind of Buffoonry and Lying, which paſt with them for Eloquence, and became a Crony of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s by a flagitious compliance. <hi>October</hi> the ſeventh,<note place="margin">Clements, Scot, Jones, <hi>and</hi> Scroop, <hi>executed.</hi> Octob. 17.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Clements</hi> was heretofore a Merchant in <hi>London</hi>; a luſtful mercenary <hi>Traytor,</hi> who abuſed his <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarian</hi> Authority to Whoredom and Leache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>

                  <hi>Scot</hi> ſprung out of a Brew-houſe, and amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Calamities of the Civil War, was admitted into the Parliament-houſe; and of all the Traytors perhaps, was the moſt inveterate Enemy to <hi>Charles the Martyr,</hi> of which Villany he bragg'd to the laſt: and ſo rejoyced in the Kings Murder, that he would have Poſterity remember him as an Author of ſo great a Crime; and beſides the murder of the King, was guilty of many other horrid Villanies.</p>
               <p>Of all the <hi>Regicides</hi> that ſurrendred themſelves, <hi>Scroop</hi> onely was hanged: for whether by indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or obſtinacy, he drew upon himſelf this ill fortune; or that a mans deſtiny is not to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, I ſhall not determine: for after that he had

                  </note>His Youth was looſe, infamous and debauched; but having run out his Eſtate, and from a prodigal Rogue turning Puritan, and then Fanatick, like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Cataline,</hi> incited by Beggary, he ventured upon the overthrow of the State.</p>
               <p>Bearing a mind above a private condition, he ſtill appeared as a private perſon, and had the art to ſet himſelf off undiſcerned: He had a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dexterity amongſt the Fanatick Rout, (in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45936:272"/>
whoſe opprobrious friendſhip he chiefly delighted) of winning upon the minds of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> ſhaking his bald pate, and ſmiling with a deceitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; he was by Nature and Art excellently diſpoſed for alluring the affections of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; nor do I know whether amongſt mortal men there was even a cunniner Artiſt in pretended Piety, a wickeder or more crafty man, and bolder in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any Villany.</p>
               <p>But by what deceitful grinning Arts having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and murdered the <hi>King,</hi> he raiſed himſelf to Supreme Power; many great Wits and able Pens have already deſcribed: Much he did in War, but more by Perfidiouſneſs, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, Perjury, and Falſhood.</p>
               <p>More cruel he was than the ancient Tyrants, whoſe Manners and Examples he imitated: with <hi>Tiberius</hi> he was ſubtile and ſuſpicacious, <hi>He had a crafty diſpoſition with a jealous head,</hi>

                  <hi>and delighted in none of his Virtues ſo much as in Diſſimulation</hi>; more eaſily concealing Hatred than Fear. <hi>Nero</hi> he acted in the ſlaughter of his beſt Country-men, nor was he unlike him in driving a Coach.

               </p>
               <p>But that he might not onely appear famous through Crimes and Villanies, by intervals he made a ſhew of ſome great actions; not from a principle of Goodneſs, but Ambition; nor out of love to Virtue, but Vanity, and future Glory.

               <p>Pity it was that that bold Orator,<note place="margin">Milton.</note> or rather Bagpiper, was out of the way at the ſhameful Obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of the Traytors, that the ſame hand which (reproaching all Kings in Latin) vindicated the

               <p>Strangers may perhaps wonder, and no leſs our Poſterity at home, that ſuch baſe and contemptible fellows, many of them Brewers, others who drank as they had brewed, and ſpent their Eſtates; and ſome again whoſe ignominious Poverty was a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the Nation, ſhould overturn the flouriſhing ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> and get to the top of Authority and Government.</p>

that the cowardly running of the Enemy ſhould have cut them ſhort of a more triumphant Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> always preferred a whole skin, though with a diſhonourable flight, before Honour with danger.</p>

                     <hi>The Fire of</hi> London. Sept. 2.</note>But ſo many fortunate ſucceſſes over conquered Enemies abroad, were quaſhed by a ſudden and moſt diſmal Calamity at home; as if the beams of our ſhining Fortune were always to be intermixed and ſet off by Adverſities: For on the ſecond of <hi>September,</hi> a Lamentable Fire broke out in <hi>London</hi>; a ſad Judgment of an offended God againſt <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Fire began in a Bakers houſe in the lower part of the City near <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> amongſt old rotten houſes apt to catch fire, and full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſtible Goods. The darkneſs of the night putting all things into terrour and confuſion, increaſed the horrour of the Calamity. The Citizens being frightened, delayed the uſe of timely Remedies; and which was no ſmall acceſſion to the Evil, the people neglecting too much their houſes, were too fatally ſet upon the haſty removing of their Goods, which were yet at length devoured by the nimble flames.</p>
               <p>The raging Eaſt Wind that had much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet at Sea, did far greater damage in the burning City, by carrying the force of the flames through the greateſt part of <hi>London.</hi> The Conflagration grew ſoon inſuperable by the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45936:290"/>
blowing of the Wind; which raiſing in a moment the fire from the bottom to the tops of the houſes, and ſcattering flakes in all places, it grew too ſtrong for the endeavours of thoſe that laboured to quench it. Here the blazes of ruddy flames were to be ſeen, and there the craſhing of falling houſes to be heard; and which was the ſadeſt Spectacle under the Sun, the doleful looks of ſo many Citizens, the wailings of deſolate women, and the cries of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and decrepit aged people: And in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken ſhops of the wealthy Inhabitants, numbers of Thieves and Pilferers, greedier of Booty than the fire, villanouſly skulked.</p>
               <p>No man that had a ſenſe of humane Miſeries, could ſee, and not be affected with the diſmal ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of the Ruining City of <hi>London.</hi> Now were there to be ſeen almoſt an hundred <hi>Churches</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to <hi>God,</hi> and many <hi>Hoſpitals,</hi> the Monuments of ancient Piety; beſides other <hi>publick Buildings,</hi> raiſed at the vaſt charges of our Anceſtors; the famed <hi>Sion-Colledge,</hi> and <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and ſtately Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> as ſad Spectacles of the Calamity, either bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under their own Rubbiſh, or ſtanding Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the devouring flames.</p>
               <p>Whilſt all things elſe in the <hi>Exchange</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, without ſparing the many Statues of our Kings, onely that of <hi>Greſham</hi> the Founder ſtood, to bewail the Ruines of his own Fabrick: ſo kind was Fate to the fame and memory of the liberal Doner.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King,</hi> whoſe high-born Soul was above the Viciſſitudes of humane Contingencies, could not but with grief and ſorrow behold the lamentable Calamity of his wretched Subjects, and native Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exhorting, comforting, and adviſing them in their greateſt difficulties: And therefore he ordered,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45936:291"/>
that the next houſes to the fire ſhould be blown up, that a void ſpace being made betwixt the Buildings, the remaining part of the City, that which ſtill ſtood, might be ſaved; this being the laſt Remedy that could be uſed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Duke of York</hi> alſo, and many of the Nobility, praiſed and encouraged the forward, aſſiſted the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and gave a generous example to all by the vigorous reſiſtance they made againſt the devouring flames.</p>

                  </note>After that the Conflagration had continued four days, to the ineſtimable loſſes of the Citizens, and had burnt down thirteen thouſand houſes, it was at length ſtopt more at the direction of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, than by any humane Arts or Means.</p>
               <p>The more loyal part of the Citizens, affected with the <hi>Kings</hi> ſorrow more than their own, put an high value upon his Royal Compaſſion towards them.<note place="margin">The Fictions of <hi>Fanaticks</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Fire.</note> But the <hi>Fanatical</hi> Clubs, who turned even the Calamities of their Country into Reproaches, could ſcarcely forbear to miſcal the Judgment a Command; or at leaſt did buz it about, that the <hi>Kings</hi> Guards were a hindrance to thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to put out the fire; but the commoner ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was, that ſome <hi>French</hi> Agents had fired the City: And many reaſons were by fear or envy ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to confirm the Treachery; nothing being more uſual amongſt the common People, than to make all Caſualties Deſignes.</p>

               <p>But being at length tired out with an irkſome impriſonment, and, for the ſake of liberty,<note place="margin">He takes on with the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;</hi>

               <p>Here it was that firſt of all he gained the good eſteem of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who then commanded the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>-Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having performed an action more advantageous to his General, than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to himſelf.

five years: until Quarrels and Animoſities happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London</hi> betwixt the <hi>Rumpers</hi> and <hi>Colonels</hi> of the Army, he laid hold on the occaſion for reſtoring of the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at what time firſt he framed the deſigne of reſtoring <hi>Charles</hi> to the Throne, I ſhall hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to determine: Cavillers, and thoſe that make the worſt of things, gave it out, that his dutiful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the <hi>King</hi> were but fortuitous; but they who judge impartially, affirm that it was a deſigne laid many years before. Certainly the beſt of <hi>Kings,</hi> more mindful of the effects of his Loyalty, than of its beginning, received the duty of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and kind ſervices, and honourably and liberally rewarded them.</p>
               <p>The year before his death, he fell into a <hi>Dropſie</hi>; and being weary of the ordinary methods and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Phyſicians, he made uſe of a certain Quack-Medicine, which in appearance recovered him; but his body being opened after his death, a great deal of Water was found in his Bowels, and much congealed Bloud in both the Ventricles of his Heart, and other neighbouring Veſſels: For the motion both of the Heart and Bloud being weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an inveterate Dropſie, gave occaſion to the ſtagnating of the chylous juyce about the Heart; which ſtopping the Fountain of the circulating Bloud, put at length a ſtop to his laſt breathings for life.</p>
               <p>The Marriage of his onely Son was in a manner the laſt thing he minded in this life; who a few days before his death was married to the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Ogle,</hi> and Grand-daughter to the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>; thereby to ſettle, as well as honour, his Family by an Alliance with ſo Noble a Houſe.</p>
               <p>After he had ſeen <hi>Britain</hi> rejoycing in Triumphs,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45936:295"/>
beheld <hi>Charles</hi> confirmed in the Throne by ten years happy Reign, and after he had adminiſtred the greateſt Offices of Truſt under the King, both in Peace and War, being upwards of ſixty years of age, he yielded to Deſtiny, which he willingly and undauntedly ſubmitted unto; that after the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of a paſt Life, he might at length triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Death.</p>
               <p>He left but one onely Son, the Illuſtrious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his Fathers Fame, hopeful to the State, and cheriſhed by the King as his own. <hi>Charles</hi> who had often viſited and condoled with him in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was with him to the laſt, and expreſſed the ſame affection for dying <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that he had teſtified to him during his life.</p>
               <p>From <hi>Somerſet</hi>-houſe, where he had lain in ſtate,<note place="margin">The Solemnity of his Funerals</note> he was with a ſplendid pomp of ſolemn Funerals at the <hi>Kings</hi> charges conveyed to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-Abbey, and there amidſt the Tears and Condolings of all good men, interred amongſt the Auguſt Monuments of Kings, being the laſt Triumph due to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>They who are curious to have a deſcription of the ſhapes and countenance of ſo great a man, may know; that he was a perſon more graceful than beautiful; of a middle ſtature, ſtrong and well comparted, with a comely preſence; and of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, rather than ſevere or ſtern, aſpect.</p>
               <p>He may eaſily be reckoned a moſt valiant <hi>General</hi> in War,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> not onely to be compared to the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his own age, but to the moſt renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Warriours of elder times; and of ſo great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he was in Military affairs, that the modeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt do acknowledge too great a Courage in <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle.</hi> He ſpent almoſt his whole life in Arms, and at length growing old amidſt Victories, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came gray-headed under a Helmet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45936:296"/>In <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Sea and by Land, ſo happy was <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that Fortune traced out for him,<note place="margin">His Prudence,</note> Honour, Renown, and Titles.

               <p>We may, moreover; reckon <hi>Albemarle</hi> happy, not onely in the greatneſs of the Action, but alſo in the ſeaſonableneſs of the Service: That he brought back the Government to a Prince of ſo juſt and good a temper, who put ſo true an eſtimate upon his Loyalty, and under whom it would never be unſafe nor dangerous to deſerve the moſt: <hi>For good Offices are acceptable,</hi>

               <p>Peace being now eſtabliſhed at home, and <hi>Janus</hi> his Temple ſhut, <hi>Albemarle</hi> departed the more joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully out of this life, that when he left no Troubles in <hi>Britain,</hi> yet he left behind him a Love for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the hearts of all good men: ſo much the more wanted, that he had taken care that nothing ſhould be wanting, having left nothing in the State but his own death to be bewailed; the <hi>King</hi> flouriſhing in his Government, and the Loyalty of the <hi>Parliament</hi> as yet vieing with the modeſty of the <hi>Prince.</hi> Every one enjoyed the happineſs they deſired at home, and Peace with all Nations abroad, till the League-breaking <hi>Dutch</hi> again provoked the Engliſh Arms.</p>
