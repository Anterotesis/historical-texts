            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER, Added by a PerÅ¿on of Quality, who had the care of ReviÅ¿iing the TranÅ¿lation.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the World the Life of Man being very long, and the TranÅ¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that happened neither great, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, nor many, there was little need of HiÅ¿tory. The Father living many hundred years with his Children and Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children, had leiÅ¿ure and time Å¿ufficient to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in their memories the Å¿tory of the few Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currents that were paÅ¿t; and no man coming then to govern any conÅ¿iderable number of men, till he had lived the Å¿pace of three or four of our longeÅ¿t lives put together, was by that time abundantly furniÅ¿hed from his own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and what had happened in his own days, with Å¿o much prudence, as might qualifie him for Government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:4"/>But when after the <hi>Deluge</hi> the Life of Man was brought by degrees to about threeÅ¿core and ten, or fourÅ¿core years, and much of the latter part of that Å¿mall period became unfit for buÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s by Å¿ickneÅ¿s and other calamities of old age, and the affairs of the World grew numerous, whether conÅ¿idered as past, or preÅ¿ent; then it became neceÅ¿Å¿ary that <hi>Memorials</hi> Å¿hould be kept for the relief of humane infirmity, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuation of the memory of Actions, and that mankind, who had but a Å¿hort time to live upon the Earth, might in that time be quickly and eaÅ¿ily furniÅ¿hed with an artificial Experience, derived from an artificial Memory; by which Governours might be qualified for government, and Subjects diÅ¿poÅ¿ed to a dutiful Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to the Prudence and Conduct of their Superiours: that Å¿o this Å¿hort and tranÅ¿itory Life of Man might be rendered as wiÅ¿e and happy as it was poÅ¿Å¿ible, and that Piety too might be nouriÅ¿hed in the minds of men by a Å¿erious reflection on the Works of Gods Providence, manifeÅ¿ted in the Å¿everal effects of his wiÅ¿e Conduct in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the World, whereby he has in every Age demonÅ¿trated his JuÅ¿tice and Mercy in dealing to every man a Reward according to his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e were the CauÅ¿es of the invention of Letters, and of writing HiÅ¿tories or <hi>Memoires</hi> of paÅ¿t Events for the uÅ¿e of PoÅ¿terity, by thoÅ¿e that had Å¿een them, or were otherwiÅ¿e well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd concerning them. And thoÅ¿e into whoÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:45936:4"/>
hands theÅ¿e first Monuments fell, were mighty fond of them, and by often reading and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conÅ¿idering them, in a Å¿hort time much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd themÅ¿elves in WiÅ¿dom, Virtue, and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the firÅ¿t and moÅ¿t ancient Stories were written without any vain pomp of affected Words or Rhetorical ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions: the HiÅ¿to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian not courting the ApplauÅ¿e, but labouring hard for the Improvement of the Reader: And he again repairing to thoÅ¿e venerable RepoÅ¿ito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, not to Å¿eek a vaniÅ¿hing Light, unprofitable PleaÅ¿ure and DevertiÅ¿ement, but a Å¿olid and durable Improvement, and the Rules of living well and wiÅ¿ely. So there is a threefold uÅ¿e of HiÅ¿tory: Political, Moral, and Divine. Of all which, briefly in their order.</p>
            <p>The Political uÅ¿e of HiÅ¿tory is twofold: firÅ¿t, as it relates to Governours; and then, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Subjects or Inferiours.</p>
            <p>The advantages Princes and Great men, who are to govern others, do or may reap from the reading of HiÅ¿tories well and wiÅ¿ely written, are innumerable; but then they are to Å¿uch Å¿o well known, that I need not Å¿pend any time to remark them here; my deÅ¿igne not being to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿truct my Betters, but to improve (if I may) my Equals.</p>
            <p>And as to Subjects, the uÅ¿e of HiÅ¿tory is not much leÅ¿s; by which, if they would Å¿eriouÅ¿ly reflect upon what is paÅ¿t, they might learn many things that would be of great uÅ¿e to them, and render theirs and their Governours lives more eaÅ¿ie and happy.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:5"/>
               <hi>1.</hi> For firÅ¿t, they might obÅ¿erve with what difficulties all humane Governments are beÅ¿et, how often God (for cauÅ¿es known Å¿ometimes onely to himÅ¿elf) defeats the wiÅ¿eÅ¿t contrivan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and deÅ¿ignes of men: How neighbouring Princes interpoÅ¿e, and croÅ¿s or fruÅ¿trate their undertakings, out of intereÅ¿t, fear, hope, envy, and the like: How often want of due inÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, proviÅ¿ions, men, moneys, changes in the Å¿eaÅ¿ons; and a thouÅ¿and other accidents inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene and prevent their purpoÅ¿es.</p>
            <p>Now this conÅ¿ideration would certainly (if men were modeÅ¿t and juÅ¿t) procure from them a due regard for their Superiours, even then when they are unfortunate, and not make every unproÅ¿perous accident that happened, the effect of Å¿loath, negligence, careleÅ¿neÅ¿s, and Å¿upine Å¿tupidity. And being thus diÅ¿poÅ¿ed, they might Å¿ometimes, at leaÅ¿t, find the reaÅ¿on of publick Calamities in themÅ¿elves; at others, in the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tice of God puniÅ¿hing the Å¿ins of men; or in the neighbour Princes, or any other cauÅ¿e, rather than traduce and defame their Governours, and Å¿uÅ¿pect their fidelity to their own IntereÅ¿ts and Honour, which muÅ¿t be infinitely dear to any man of Å¿ence.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> HiÅ¿tory will teach men, that Religion and Liberty are very ill Å¿ecured for the moÅ¿t part by Civil War and Rebellion: for as to the firÅ¿t, the right hand of God planted it in the World by Miracles and the effect of a mighty Providence, without Force, Wealth, Eloquence, or Policy, by
<pb facs="tcp:45936:5"/>
the Bloud and Patience, the MeekneÅ¿s and Å¿im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, the HolineÅ¿s and ReÅ¿ignation of Saints, Martyrs, and Holy men: And as it was planted, Å¿o it muÅ¿t be defended, Å¿o it muÅ¿t be preÅ¿erved.</p>
            <p>But then there is nothing in the world more contrary to this method, than for Subjects to raiÅ¿e Tumults, encourage InÅ¿urrections, liÅ¿t Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and attempt the ruine and deÅ¿truction of their Princes and fellow-Subjects, to defend this Faith; which was planted by MeekneÅ¿s, and watered with the blouds and tears of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs: and this, if Religion be never Å¿o appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently perÅ¿ecuted and endeavoured to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troyed. But who can delineate the madneÅ¿s of perpetrating all theÅ¿e horrid Villanies out of meer fear &amp; jealouÅ¿ie Religion Å¿hould be deÅ¿ign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, before there is one drop of Bloud Å¿pilt, or one man ruined or attempted to be ruined?</p>
            <p>And as to Civil Liberty and Property, they were won from kind and good-natured Princes, by the dutiful Carriage and Civility of their Subjects. And therefore there is Å¿carce a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tep of them to be found amongst thoÅ¿e Nations that were never Civilized; and many of them have never enjoyed thoÅ¿e rare BleÅ¿Å¿ings, but in a low degree, and Å¿ome Å¿carce at all, as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as there is nothing more ungrateful, than for men to turn the Favours of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or indeed of any man, into occaÅ¿ions of Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and ReÅ¿iÅ¿tance, even when there is a real cauÅ¿e to be concern'd for the loÅ¿s of theÅ¿e precious
<pb facs="tcp:45936:6"/>
and ineÅ¿timable Jewels; Å¿o is there nothing more fooliÅ¿h, than for men to put theÅ¿e Darlings of theirs to nurÅ¿e in Fields and Camps, reeking with the Bloud of their fellow-Subjects, Å¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Fire and Smoak amidÅ¿t the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cannon, the ratling of Drums, the Å¿hrikes and groans of dying men, and all that is dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to fleÅ¿h and bloud; and after all to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of an enraged Prince, if he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails; and into the leÅ¿s-merciful clutches of their own Souldiers, if they happen to overcome their Prince. Certainly there cannot be a more impolitick Errour committed by Subjects, than to reÅ¿iÅ¿t and rebel, when their Priviledges are really invaded: but then to do all this by way of prevention to be wheadled and cajoled into Å¿uch miÅ¿eries as thoÅ¿e with the meer fears and jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ies of contingent and poÅ¿Å¿ible deÅ¿ignes, this is a degree of Rage beyond all other human madneÅ¿Å¿es, and can be inÅ¿pired by nothing but Furies &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching Devils, who take poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of the very Å¿ouls of Å¿uch men, as they are Å¿aid to have done heretofore of Å¿ome mens bodies. And there is not a more powerful Amulet againÅ¿t theÅ¿e Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eries, than a due obÅ¿ervation of the Tragedies theÅ¿e Devils have heretofore raiÅ¿ed in the world. The truth is, almoÅ¿t all the Nation are Å¿atisfied that next the Mercies of God, nothing did more contribute to our late PreÅ¿ervation, than the remembrance of our former MiÅ¿eries: And the HiÅ¿tory of them may have very near the Å¿ame effect upon our PoÅ¿terity.</p>

There is Å¿carce any thing more difficult than for a man to know himÅ¿elf well; and if he did not Å¿ometimes Å¿ee himÅ¿elf in others, he would hardly perhaps ever do it: But then who but God can pretend to know all the various, changeable, and inconÅ¿tant humours, deÅ¿ignes, and ends of the MaÅ¿s of Mankind in the Å¿pace of thoÅ¿e few years we are to live? and yet if it were poÅ¿Å¿ible, how infinite is the danger of being miÅ¿taken and purchaÅ¿ing our experience at the price of our ruine?</p>
            <p>But HiÅ¿tory, like a kind MiÅ¿triÅ¿s, leads us by the hand into her delightful Gardens, and there reads Lectures upon every Flower, Plant, and Weed, and truly acquaints us how this and the other Å¿ped well or ill; and then aÅ¿Å¿ures us our Fortune will be the Å¿ame, if we be not Å¿o wiÅ¿e as to take her word, but will be trying over again the Å¿ame Experiments upon our Å¿elves or others. But above all, if we take <hi>Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goues,</hi> People-drivers, the Flatterers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorers of the <hi>Many,</hi> for good men, or good friends, or in Å¿hort, any man for a good Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths-man or Patriot, who is not a good loyal hearty Subject.</p>
            <p>If men would thus a while conÅ¿ult in HiÅ¿tory the honeÅ¿t policy of preÅ¿erving themÅ¿elves and their Countries from Ruine and ConfuÅ¿ion, they could not but obÅ¿erve, that <hi>Immorality</hi> was in every Age the greateÅ¿t Enemy of Mankind.
<pb facs="tcp:45936:7"/>
That Ambition, Pride, Avarice, Revenge, LuÅ¿t, and Luxury, and the reÅ¿t of thoÅ¿e horrid deformities of Mortality, were the real weights which Å¿et theÅ¿e Machines in motion, which have torn down Empires, and ruined the most flouriÅ¿hing Kingdoms; and particularly have in the memory of man twice, bid fair for the ruine of ours, under two Princes of Å¿o exact a JuÅ¿tice, and Å¿o God-like a Clemency and GoodneÅ¿s, that their Subjects having no real Calamities to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of (which is a Felicity rarely given by Heaven to the beÅ¿t Ages) our wanton Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Å¿ick of Peace, Plenty, and ProÅ¿perity, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled the Cabinet of God Almighty, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent boÅ¿oms of two excellent Princes, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended they diÅ¿covered their deÅ¿ignes of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Popery and Arbitrary Government. And by theÅ¿e <hi>Chimerical</hi> fears intoxicated and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiched the poor Populace, and putting them at last in fearful Commotions, theÅ¿e quick-Å¿ight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Privado's of Heaven, the CenÅ¿ors of Princes, the Darlings of the Rabble, mounted the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, and drove the People as the Devils did the heard of Swine down the Å¿teep Rocks of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, SchiÅ¿m, and TreaÅ¿on, while they who put them into this miÅ¿erable condition, reaped the Wealth, and divided the Honours and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of the Nation amongst them, and under the mask of a pompous Piety, were reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouÅ¿ly proud, covetous, ambitious, revengeful, inÅ¿olent, treacherous, perjurous, and in a word, a parcel of the moÅ¿t Å¿anctified Rogues and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors that ever the Sun Å¿hin'd upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:7"/>When God Almighty reduced us out of our Hell of MiÅ¿ery, and <hi>Chaos</hi> of ConfuÅ¿ion, there was no Apologie more frequent in the mouths of men than this: <hi>Who could have thought that men of Å¿uch Å¿eeming Piety, of Å¿o exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and eminent a zeal for the Glory of God, the ProteÅ¿tant Religion, and the Liberty and Property of the Subject, that Å¿uch men, I Å¿ay, as theÅ¿e Å¿hould hatch in their minds Å¿uch horrid Villanies, TreaÅ¿ons, Rapines, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Perjuries, and ambitious Projects, as we have Å¿ince with aÅ¿toniÅ¿hment Å¿een them practiÅ¿e?</hi> Well, if they had wiÅ¿ely conÅ¿idered the HiÅ¿tories of other Countries, or of former Ages, they might eaÅ¿ily have foreÅ¿een and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented all this MiÅ¿ery: for whenever men are more Å¿ollicitous for the faults of their Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, than careful to amend their own; when they Å¿eek to win the entire love and eÅ¿teem of Subjects from their Princes and Governours; let the outÅ¿ide be what it will, there is Pride, Ambition, Avarice, and DiÅ¿content within: and therefore Å¿uch men, of all others, are never to be truÅ¿ted.</p>
            <p>This Thought well purÅ¿ued, will lead a man home too, and give him an occaÅ¿ion to Å¿earch his own heart, and try diligently whether he is a good and uÅ¿eful Member of the Civil Society in which he lives: If he is under the dominion of any of theÅ¿e Vices, let him never call himÅ¿elf a loyal Subject, or a good Patriot; for whatever his preÅ¿ent intentions are, he will be neither,
<pb facs="tcp:45936:8"/>
when his IntereÅ¿t Å¿hall lie croÅ¿s to his Duty. And becauÅ¿e it is much harder to believe ill of ones Å¿elf, than of another, let HiÅ¿tory acquaint him how many men have been drawn in by their own Å¿ecret, and in all probability to themÅ¿elves undiÅ¿covered Vices, till beyond their firÅ¿t inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or thoughts, they have been Å¿wallowed up in an AbyÅ¿s of horrible Crimes and DiÅ¿orders; and what have betided them, may be our lot too, if we do not purge out, or at leaÅ¿t watch the motions of theÅ¿e DiÅ¿turbers of the World in us.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines of Morality are Å¿ometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaÅ¿ant and uneaÅ¿ie to corrupted minds, and do not eaÅ¿ily inÅ¿inuate and obtain admiÅ¿Å¿ion; and when they are received, do often make Å¿uch Å¿light impreÅ¿Å¿ions, that they vaniÅ¿h in oblivion and forgetfulneÅ¿s: but examples convey them to us with pleaÅ¿ure and delight, and the variety and wonderful accidents that are to be met with in all HiÅ¿tories, which are nothing but the imagery and various colours of Virtues and Vices embodied and made viÅ¿ible to us, make vived and laÅ¿ting impreÅ¿Å¿ions on the minds of men, and Å¿tamp and engrave the Ideas of them on the fancy and memory, Å¿o that nothing but death can deÅ¿troy or obliterate thoÅ¿e impreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions. And this was one reaÅ¿on why the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents cloathed their moral ObÅ¿ervations in Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, Fables, and Parables; but HiÅ¿tory ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the reality of perÅ¿ons, names, times, and places, do infinitely exceed theÅ¿e fictitious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preÅ¿entations:
<pb facs="tcp:45936:8"/>
and therefore as HiÅ¿tory grew up in the World, theÅ¿e fictitious Images of it were laid by and antiquated.</p>
            <p>Examples fit all Capacities, at leaÅ¿t Å¿ome or others of them, in a vaÅ¿t variety; whereas Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts can hardly be Å¿o cloathed, but Å¿ome will deÅ¿piÅ¿e the meanneÅ¿s of the language, or others not underÅ¿tand the goodneÅ¿s of it: whereas Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples fit themÅ¿elves to all Capacities, and teach men before they are aware of it, the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineÅ¿s of Virtue, the turpitude and baÅ¿eneÅ¿s of Vice, and the different events which for the moÅ¿t part in every Age have attended them.</p>
            <p>This brings me to the third particular I propoÅ¿ed, the divine uÅ¿e of HiÅ¿tory. As the World was not the Product of blind Fate or Chance, but the Work of a Great, WiÅ¿e, and Holy God, who raiÅ¿ed and built it out of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his infinite Power, and by his WiÅ¿dom brought it into this beautiful order in which we behold and admire it: So neither did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ert it when he had form'd and adorn'd it, but has ever Å¿ince govern'd it with one unÅ¿earcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and irreÅ¿iÅ¿tible Providence and WiÅ¿dom. And this not onely the inanimate and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal part of it, but above all, his eyes are upon the children of men; and in the government, protection, preÅ¿ervation, rewarding and puniÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, exalting and abaÅ¿ing them, he exerciÅ¿eth Å¿o Å¿teady, juÅ¿t, and reaÅ¿onable a <hi>Providence,</hi> but withal, Å¿o abÅ¿truÅ¿e, hidden, and reÅ¿erved, that it exceeds the WiÅ¿dom of the greateÅ¿t
<pb facs="tcp:45936:9"/>
and wiÅ¿eÅ¿t of men to penetrate into the reaÅ¿ons of it, or to foreÅ¿ee the events before they diÅ¿co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themÅ¿elves in time.</p>
            <p>Now in the HiÅ¿tory of the Actions and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of mankind, there is an undeÅ¿igned Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tory of this <hi>Providence</hi> of God, which like Å¿ome Rivers, Å¿ometimes run above ground plain and delightful, or terrible and inÅ¿tructive at the firÅ¿t glance; but at others, buries it Å¿elf under Mountains and Hills: and though in thoÅ¿e Å¿ecret receÅ¿Å¿es it Å¿till (like thoÅ¿e Rivers) maintains an uninterrupted courÅ¿e, yet can no mortal eyes purÅ¿ue its Å¿treams, and obÅ¿erve its windings and turnings, or when and where it will break out and again diÅ¿cover it Å¿elf, till he himÅ¿elf is pleaÅ¿ed to bring it into the light a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Now HiÅ¿tory has brought down an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted thread of the methods of Providence from the creation of the World to this day; by which, as in a GlaÅ¿s, we may Å¿ee a repreÅ¿enta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the JuÅ¿tice and Mercy of God in his dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings with the Å¿ons of men, and admire that wonderful WiÅ¿dom and Power, which, without offering violence to the freedom of mens wills, has yet been able to diÅ¿poÅ¿e them to effect his own moÅ¿t holy purpoÅ¿es, when they leaÅ¿t deÅ¿igned it; without any violence has protected Virtue againÅ¿t the utmost rage of Men and Devils, and preÅ¿erved it through all the Ages of an ill World; and puniÅ¿hed Vice by it Å¿elf, in ways Å¿o abÅ¿truÅ¿e and Å¿ecret, that the Workers of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb facs="tcp:45936:9"/>
have been Å¿tun'd and amazed to Å¿ee not onely their ill deÅ¿ignes over-ruled, but made the InÅ¿truments of their own deÅ¿erved ruine.</p>
            <p>There is no one thing that hath in every Age Å¿o much Å¿taggered the belief of a divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence governing the World and the Affairs of Mankind, as the proÅ¿perity of wicked and lewd men, and the miÅ¿ery and oppreÅ¿Å¿ion of good and virtuous men. But this MiÅ¿t will vaniÅ¿h like Å¿moak, when men are pleaÅ¿ed to take a view of past Ages, and obÅ¿erve the <hi>CataÅ¿trophies</hi> of the Å¿everal Periods and Ages: for that which may Å¿eem at one time to be all MyÅ¿tery and Riddle, will by degrees open and unfold it Å¿elf, till at laÅ¿t there will be nothing more apparent, than that God had all this while his eyes upon both the one and the other, and kept the inviÅ¿ible Reins in his own hands, and by ways, unpercei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved both by the good and bad, at laÅ¿t, tho not Å¿uddenly, brought them to their deÅ¿erved ends, and recompenced both according to their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent deÅ¿erts; and this will give us an aÅ¿Å¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that as it has been in paÅ¿t Ages, Å¿o it will be in ours; the Å¿ame God is Å¿till at the Helm, and he will, as heretofore he has, conduct us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿o to that end we have deÅ¿erved, be it good or bad, without reÅ¿pect of perÅ¿ons, which will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve us in Peace and Virtue, diÅ¿pel all melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly thoughts, and free us both from Å¿pecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and practical temptations.</p>
            <p>It is not hard to apply all I have Å¿aid to the HiÅ¿tory of our Late Revolutions in <hi>England;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45936:10"/>
but as I deÅ¿igne a Preface to a very Å¿hort Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tory of them, and Å¿o muÅ¿t not be long: Å¿o the Reader will be much more inÅ¿tructed and better pleaÅ¿ed to reflect upon that HiÅ¿tory, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare it with this Preface, and then determine with himÅ¿elf whether theÅ¿e thoughts of mine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaÅ¿ion are pertinent, and whether there be any thing in the following Story that will prove and illuÅ¿trate the truth of what I have here Å¿aid; and therefore to him I Å¿hall leave it.</p>
            <p>But becauÅ¿e theÅ¿e Pieces never appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>EngliÅ¿h,</hi> may I have the Readers leave to give him a Å¿hort account of the deÅ¿ignes of them.</p>
            <p>The Author of the firÅ¿t two Parts was Dr. <hi>Geo. Bates,</hi> a learned and an eminent PhyÅ¿ician of <hi>London</hi> in the laÅ¿t Age, who was afterwards Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ician to <hi>Oliver Cromwel,</hi> and Å¿o muÅ¿t of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ity be intimately acquainted with many things which were not known to others, and had means to look through all the diÅ¿guiÅ¿es of that cunning ImpoÅ¿tor, as his Station and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alÅ¿o afforded him an eaÅ¿ie acceÅ¿s to most of the Grandees that had then a large Å¿hare in promoting the MiÅ¿eries of <hi>England.</hi> The firÅ¿t part was publiÅ¿hed in the time of <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> and yet is written in an Air and Stile which Å¿hews the Author durst Å¿peak truth, when if diÅ¿covered, his life would have paid the price of his Veracity; and yet that time too may yield us a good aÅ¿Å¿urance he did not venture his life for falÅ¿hoods and Å¿launders; it was not
<pb facs="tcp:45936:10"/>
then a time to bely proÅ¿perous, inÅ¿olent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Villains.</p>
            <p>He gives us this account of the Work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf by an Epilogue added in a latter impreÅ¿Å¿ion, at the end of the FirÅ¿t Part.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>WhilÅ¿t the Original of this Å¿mall HiÅ¿tory was in Writing, it was Å¿everal times Å¿een by the Reverend</hi> George <hi>Lord BiÅ¿hop of</hi> WincheÅ¿ter, <hi>the Worthy</hi> Nicholas Oudart <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary and CounÅ¿ellour to the</hi> Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range; <hi>by Sir</hi> John Wederburn <hi>Knight; by Dr.</hi> Richard Owen <hi>ProfeÅ¿Å¿or of Divinity, and Rector of St.</hi> Swithins <hi>in</hi> London; <hi>by Dr.</hi> George Ent, <hi>heretofore PhyÅ¿ician to</hi> Charles <hi>the FirÅ¿t, and now to the preÅ¿ent King; and alÅ¿o by</hi> Fabian Philips <hi>an Attorney, who was my AÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant in Å¿earching the Rolls, Offices, and Monuments of the Law, (that I may not mention</hi> Dugard <hi>who printed it) men above all exceptions: although there is an inÅ¿olent Defamer, who pretends I have fathered another mans Work, whoÅ¿e Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies I neither value nor fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This PaÅ¿Å¿age is inÅ¿erted by him onely to prove he was the Author of it, but is at the Å¿ame time a Å¿trong proof of his integrity: for it is very well known, theÅ¿e PerÅ¿ons were not all of one Å¿ide in our late DiÅ¿tractions.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t Part of this Piece was firÅ¿t printed about the year <hi>1651,</hi> without his name, for the information of Strangers, and therefore he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿eth a Å¿hort account of the Prerogatives of the
<pb facs="tcp:45936:11"/>
Crown, and the Priviledges of Parliament, and Liberties of the Subject, here; which had been Å¿o abominably miÅ¿repreÅ¿ented to Forreigners, that they Å¿tood generally in great doubt on which Å¿ide the right lay, and conÅ¿idering the time when it came out firÅ¿t, nothing could be of greater uÅ¿e and benefit to the then-oppreÅ¿Å¿ed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereÅ¿t of our late Soveraign.</p>
            <p>Nor was it onely uÅ¿eful abroad, but at home alÅ¿o: for the People of <hi>England</hi> were then Å¿o diÅ¿tracted by the Contradictions betwixt the Royal and the Rebel Party, that they, at leaÅ¿t many of them, did as little know on which Å¿ide to give their Verdict, as the Neighbour Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hence the Learned and Ingenuous Mr. <hi>Henry Foulis,</hi> in his Preface to his <hi>HiÅ¿tory of the wicked Plots of our pretended Saints,</hi> gives us this Account of himÅ¿elf: <hi>As for the Author</hi> (Å¿aith he) <hi>whilÅ¿t a School-boy, he was too much Å¿way'd to</hi> Presbytery; <hi>and delighting in the Stories of our Times, had none to peruÅ¿e, but</hi> May, Vicars, Ricraft, <hi>and Å¿uch-like partial Relators: by which means believing, with the ignorant, all things in print to be true, he was perÅ¿waded to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the wrong Å¿ide. But a little before his going to the</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niverÅ¿ity, <hi>lighting by chance upon Dr.</hi> Bates<hi>'s judicious Book</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenchus Motuum, <hi>he found the Laws and true Government to be oppoÅ¿ite to his former Readings, and therein the Knavery and Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of their OppoÅ¿ers, Å¿trange things which
<pb facs="tcp:45936:11"/>
he had never heard of before. Which, with Å¿ome other aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance, Å¿o far prevail'd with him, that in a Å¿hort time he threw off Father SchiÅ¿m, and ever Å¿ince, like little Loyal</hi> John <hi>in the Epitaph,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>For the King, and Church, and Bloud-Royal,</l>
                  <l>He went as true as any Sun-Dial.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There are Å¿ome others who have acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the World in print, the benefit they and the Government received from this firÅ¿t Part.</p>
            <p>The Second Part was added by Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi> after his late MajeÅ¿ties ReÅ¿titution, to inform the World of the manner of his MajeÅ¿ties E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cape from <hi>WorceÅ¿ter,</hi> and how things were carried till the depoÅ¿ition of <hi>Richard Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi> wherein is an excellent account of the bloudy War in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and the juÅ¿t Judgment of God upon the <hi>Scotch</hi> Covenanters for joyning with our EngliÅ¿h Parliamentarians, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Å¿etting up <hi>Presbytery</hi> here, but indeed to inrich themÅ¿elves the Å¿econd time with the Spoils of <hi>England;</hi> the effect of which was, that <hi>Presbytery</hi> was ruined even in <hi>Scotland</hi> by <hi>O. C.</hi> and his victorious Independant Army, and they loÅ¿t at the Å¿ame time all their Civil Priviledges, and were treated, till the Kings return, as a conquered People by their fellow-Rebels.</p>
            <p>The Third Part was written by one Dr. <hi>Tho. Skynner,</hi> another Learned PhyÅ¿ician, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
<pb facs="tcp:45936:12"/>
and bring down the Story, and Å¿hew the Joy of our Nation at the ReÅ¿titution of his late MajeÅ¿ty. It is in the Original written in a florid Å¿tile, and full of curious and ingenuous Reflections.</p>
            <p>The TranÅ¿lations of all theÅ¿e have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with great care, to make them both true to the Originals, and delightful to the Reader; onely the TranÅ¿lator thought fit to Å¿upply Å¿ome Papers which are but hinted at, or wholly omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Author; as the Treaty of the IÅ¿le of <hi>Wight,</hi> in the FirÅ¿t Part; the Coronation-Oath, in the Third; and others. And alÅ¿o when there are any Papers or ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to publiÅ¿h the original Papers and words, when he could find them; but when not, he hath humoured the TranÅ¿lation as near the Latin as the Å¿ence of the Author and <hi>idiome</hi> of the two Languages would permit.</p>
            <p>There is great hope that this Å¿hort account of our late horrible ConfuÅ¿ions here in <hi>England,</hi> which is Å¿o acceptable in the Original to all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners and Learned EngliÅ¿h-men, may now tranÅ¿lated be no leÅ¿s acceptable to all thoÅ¿e who either cannot read the Latin, or care not to give themÅ¿elves Å¿o much trouble; and that it may contribute Å¿omething to the interest of the Government, by forewarning men how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themÅ¿elves to thoÅ¿e courÅ¿es again which produced Å¿uch dreadful Effects heretofore.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>pon the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Å¿upplication of the HouÅ¿e of Commons, that whereas all Parliamentary Judgment belongs to the King and the Peers, and not to the Commons, unleÅ¿s by a Grant and PermiÅ¿Å¿ion from the King, it would pleaÅ¿e the Kings MajeÅ¿ty that they be not, contrary to cuÅ¿tom, obliged to give Judgment; whereupon the King for the future excuÅ¿ed them from that trouble, reÅ¿erving the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary power of Judging for the time to come to the King and HouÅ¿e of Lords onely, (Å¿ave onely in making Laws, or impoÅ¿ing Taxes and SubÅ¿idies) unleÅ¿s when it Å¿hall otherwiÅ¿e Å¿eem fit to the Kings MajeÅ¿ty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire their particular counÅ¿el and aÅ¿Å¿ent for diÅ¿patching the publick Affairs of the Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, it was of old the cuÅ¿tom alÅ¿o, that if any ControverÅ¿ie or Doubt aroÅ¿e about the validity of the Election of the Members of the <hi>HouÅ¿e of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> the matter was not determined by the other Members of the Å¿ame HouÅ¿e, but either by the Lords in the Upper HouÅ¿e, or by the Judges in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. And if any of them alÅ¿o departed from the Parliament without leave from the <hi>King</hi> and both HouÅ¿es, he was brought before the <hi>Kings Privy-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> or <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> to receive Å¿entence for his faults; but he was never puniÅ¿hed at the will and pleaÅ¿ure of his own HouÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>This alÅ¿o is peculiar to the <hi>HouÅ¿e of Commons,</hi> (that we may again return to their Priviledges) that it belongs to them firÅ¿t to debate and form the Bill for raiÅ¿ing Money from the People.</p>
            <p>Such therefore is the wonderful temper of our <hi>Monarchy,</hi> that the <hi>King, Lords,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> have their Å¿everal parts in the publick adminiÅ¿tration of Affairs; yet with that harmonious proportion, that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45936:22"/>
All can help, but none of them hurt the <hi>Publick.</hi> For the Prerogative of the King that gives him the Å¿upreme power of Government, and of Peace and War, tends to this, that he may have Å¿trength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend the Laws againÅ¿t the Factions of the Nobility, and the Tumults and InÅ¿urrections of the people: whilÅ¿t the Nobles, by the high Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they have in giving Judgment and making Laws, can on the one hand put a Å¿top to tyrannical attempts, if any Å¿hould be offered by the King; and on the other, curb the inÅ¿olence of a tumultuous and Å¿editious common People.

how impoÅ¿Å¿ible it is (in the condition he now Å¿tands) to fulfil the deÅ¿ires of his two HouÅ¿es, Å¿ince the onely ancient and known ways of paÅ¿Å¿ing Laws, are either by his MajeÅ¿ties perÅ¿onal aÅ¿Å¿ent in the HouÅ¿e of Peers, or by CommiÅ¿Å¿ion under his great Seal of</hi> England; <hi>he cannot but wonder at Å¿uch failings in the manner of addreÅ¿s which is now made unto him, unleÅ¿s his two HouÅ¿es intend that his MajeÅ¿ty Å¿hall allow of a great Seal made without his authority, before there be any conÅ¿ideration had thereupon in a Treaty; which as it may hereafter hazard the Å¿ecurity it Å¿elf, Å¿o for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent it Å¿eems very unreaÅ¿onable to his MajeÅ¿ty. And though his MajeÅ¿ty is willing to believe that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of very many of both HouÅ¿es, in Å¿ending thoÅ¿e Bills before a Treaty, was onely to obtain a TruÅ¿t from him, and not to take any advantage by paÅ¿Å¿ing them, to force other things from him, which are either againÅ¿t his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿cience or honour; yet his MajeÅ¿ty believes it's clear to all underÅ¿tandings, that theÅ¿e Bills contain (as they are now penned) not onely the diveÅ¿ting himÅ¿elf of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, and that without poÅ¿Å¿ibility of recovering it either to him or his SucceÅ¿Å¿ors, (except by repeal of theÅ¿e Bills) but alÅ¿o the making his ConceÅ¿Å¿ions guilty of the greateÅ¿t preÅ¿Å¿ures that can be made upon the Subject, as in other particulars, Å¿o by giving an arbitrary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited power to the two HouÅ¿es for ever, to raiÅ¿e and levy, for Land and Sea-Å¿ervice, of what perÅ¿ons (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diÅ¿tinction and quality) and to what numbers they pleaÅ¿e; and likewiÅ¿e for the payment of the Arrears, to levy what moneys, in Å¿uch Å¿ort, and by Å¿uch ways and means (and by conÅ¿equence upon the EÅ¿tates of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿oever perÅ¿ons) as they Å¿hall think fit and appoint; which is utterly inconÅ¿iÅ¿tent with the Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Subject, and his MajeÅ¿ties truÅ¿t in protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them: Å¿o that if the major part of both HouÅ¿es Å¿hall think it neceÅ¿Å¿ary to put the reÅ¿t of the PropoÅ¿itions into Bills, his MajeÅ¿ty leaves the world to judge how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿afe

it would be for him to conÅ¿ent thereunto; and if not, what a Å¿trange condition (after paÅ¿Å¿ing thoÅ¿e four Bills) his MajeÅ¿ty and all his Subjects would be caÅ¿t into. And here his MajeÅ¿ty thinks it not unfit to wiÅ¿h his two HouÅ¿es to conÅ¿ider well of the manner of their proceeding; that when his MajeÅ¿ty deÅ¿ires a perÅ¿onal Treaty with them for the Å¿etling of a Peace, they in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wer propoÅ¿e the very Å¿ubject matter of the moÅ¿t eÅ¿Å¿ential part thereof to be firÅ¿t granted; a thing which will be hardly credible to PoÅ¿terity: Wherefore his MajeÅ¿ty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that neither the deÅ¿ire of being freed from this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and irksome condition of life his MajeÅ¿ty hath Å¿o long Å¿uffered, nor the apprehenÅ¿ion of what Å¿hall befal him in caÅ¿e his two HouÅ¿es Å¿hall not afford him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿onal Treaty, Å¿hall make him change his reÅ¿olution of not conÅ¿enting to any Act, till the whole be concluded. Yet then he intends not onely to give full and reaÅ¿onable Å¿atisfaction in the particulars preÅ¿ented to him; but alÅ¿o to make good all other ConceÅ¿Å¿ions mentioned in his MeÅ¿Å¿age of the</hi> 16th <hi>of</hi> Novemb. <hi>laÅ¿t, which he thought would have produced better effects than what he finds in the Bills and PropoÅ¿itions now preÅ¿ented unto him.</hi>

            <p>In the mean while, report is made to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by piece-meals of what was tranÅ¿acted in the Conference; where many with a mind as averÅ¿e, as the Kings was inclinable to peace,<note place="margin">The K.'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿wers are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ured in Parl.</note> quible at and cenÅ¿ure the leaÅ¿t <hi>punctilio</hi> of every thing, unleÅ¿s all were condeÅ¿cended to in every tittle according to their own words and preÅ¿cribed form: for they were afraid (which Å¿ome of them openly profeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed) that the PropoÅ¿itions being fully granted, and no more place left for AnimoÅ¿ity or Grievance, they might, if not by force from the people, yet out of Å¿hame be compelled to conclude a Peace in good earneÅ¿t, which they onely deÅ¿ired in Å¿hew. For the the King having,<note place="margin">The K. unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many things.</note> contrary to the opinion of all, condeÅ¿cended to many things, had not onely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Å¿ubject matter, but alÅ¿o the Å¿crupuloÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and niceties of words.</p>
            <p>To the Preface, which aimed not Å¿o much at the publick Peace, as the branding of himÅ¿elf and his party with a note of Ignominy, he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, but with this clauÅ¿e, <hi>That nothing in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference Å¿hould be taken for granted, unleÅ¿s all were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreed upon in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He agreed to the IÅ¿t PropoÅ¿ition, of recalling the Declarations; to the XVIth, of the Forces; the XIXth, of the government of <hi>Ireland</hi>; the XVth, of the payment of publick Debts, <hi>Provided theÅ¿e Debts were Å¿tated within the Å¿pace of two years</hi>; to the XVIIth, of anulling Titles of Honours; the XIXth, of the chief MagiÅ¿trates of the <hi>Kingdom</hi>; the XIXth, of the

Great Seal; the XIXth, of the Priviledges of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Of the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">There is no menÅ¿ion of the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> in theÅ¿e Articles, thÃ´ it is expreÅ¿Å¿ed both here and in <hi>Baker</hi>'s Chronicle, and perhaps was thought of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theÅ¿e Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note>, provided he had an hundred thouÅ¿and pound a year paid him in lieu of it.</p>
            <p>In all theÅ¿e points he made himÅ¿elf an eaÅ¿ie prey to the avarice and ambition of others; and that he might render the <hi>Kingdom</hi> more peaceable to others, he even Å¿uffered it to be Å¿natched out of his own hands.</p>
            <p>He gave his conÅ¿ent to all the Articles of the IIId PropoÅ¿ition, except one, concerning <hi>BiÅ¿hops</hi> and their Revenues; yet in that he was not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether wanting to the deÅ¿ires of the Parliament: for whatever did not plainly appear to be of <hi>Divine InÅ¿titution,</hi> he allowed might be abrogated; Å¿o that he Å¿uffered <hi>ArchiepiÅ¿copacy</hi> to be aboliÅ¿hed, <hi>EpiÅ¿copal JuriÅ¿diction</hi> alÅ¿o, that is, the exerciÅ¿e of <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical JuriÅ¿diction,</hi> and the Å¿tate and priviledge of holding <hi>EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tical Courts</hi>; but he would not Å¿uffer the power of conferring Orders (<hi>and adminiÅ¿tring Church-cenÅ¿ures</hi>) as being <hi>ApoÅ¿tolical,</hi> to be altered and leÅ¿Å¿ened.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:45936:82"/>
               <hi>Church</hi>; to which he promiÅ¿ed to acquieÅ¿ce, if the Parliament would do the like: In the mean time he is not againÅ¿t it, but that <hi>Presbytery</hi> may be Å¿etled for a tryal.</p>
            <p>Abhorring the thought of Sacriledge, he would not Å¿uffer <hi>BiÅ¿hops</hi> and <hi>Church</hi>-lands to be divided and alienated from the Church; but permitted them to be let out by leaÅ¿e for ninety nine years, paying a Å¿mall yearly rent for the maintenance of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hops,</hi> and as a token of their <hi>Tenure,</hi> provided after the expiring of the LeaÅ¿e, they Å¿hould return to the <hi>Crown</hi> to be employed for the uÅ¿e of the <hi>Church:</hi> which, in the mean time, he was firmly reÅ¿olved to redeem with his money, and to reÅ¿tore them to the <hi>Church-men</hi> to whom in right they belonged.</p>
            <p>Nor would he (being mindful of his Friends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midÅ¿t his own dangers) conÅ¿ent to the XVIIIth PropoÅ¿ition, concerning Delinquents; but he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That they might be moderately fined.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That they may be debarred from the Kings preÅ¿ence and coming to Court: that Å¿ome of them alÅ¿o may be baniÅ¿hed, but not as Traitors, nor yet to loÅ¿e their Lives and EÅ¿tates, if they act to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That for three years they be excluded from Å¿itting in Parliament.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That they might be brought to tryal, if it were thought fit, and be condignly puniÅ¿hed, if they had acted any thing againÅ¿t the known Laws of <hi>England,</hi> (which certainly favoured the Kings Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty): But he thought it unjuÅ¿t that any man Å¿hould be puniÅ¿hed for his Loyalty to him, according to the dictates of his ConÅ¿cience, and the municipal Laws, by a Law made <hi>ex poÅ¿t facto.</hi> Yet he condeÅ¿cended to other Articles of the Å¿ame PropoÅ¿ition, upon this condition, that pious and learned <hi>Church-men,</hi> free
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45936:82"/>
from Å¿candal, might enjoy a third of their Livings, and not be totally deprived of the liberty of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</p>
            <p>He could not, as he Å¿aid, recal the Authorities which he had given to the <hi>MarqueÅ¿s of Ormond,</hi> at the very time when himÅ¿elf was confined to priÅ¿on. The <hi>Parliament</hi> agreed with him in the reÅ¿t: which Å¿ucceeding, then, according to the ConceÅ¿Å¿ions in the XIXth PropoÅ¿ition, the Parliament Å¿hould have the Å¿ole adminiÅ¿tration of the affairs of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In the mean time, however, he wrote to the <hi>MarqueÅ¿s of Ormond,</hi> commanding him to refrain from the execution of his power, Å¿o long as the Conference and any hopes of Peace continued.</p>

               <hi>VVilmot.</hi> The <hi>Colonel</hi> took care to provide a Chamber and Victuals; which was no eaÅ¿ie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be done amongÅ¿t Å¿o many GueÅ¿ts. The King, in the mean time was employed in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the HorÅ¿es into the Stable, and looking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; nor could he avoid talking with the Soldiers in the yard about his Journey.<note place="margin">Where the <hi>King</hi> was very near diÅ¿covered by an HoÅ¿tler.</note> But the HoÅ¿tler looking him in the face as he deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd him the HorÅ¿es, told him, <hi>You are welcome, I know you very well.

            <p>Shortly after, <hi>VVilmot</hi> paÅ¿Å¿ing through the Town, they take HorÅ¿e, and following the Å¿treight Rode to <hi>London,</hi> they met with Å¿everal Travellers in the way; and amongÅ¿t thoÅ¿e one who had formerly been a Servant to <hi>CHARLES the FirÅ¿t</hi>:<note place="margin">From thence, as good luck would have it, to <hi>Broad-VVind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿or.</hi>
               </note> Therefore thinking it moÅ¿t conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to turn out of the Rode, they followed the next way upon the left hand; and having rid a long time, towards night they came to a Village called <hi>Broad-windÅ¿or.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45936:183"/>
and becauÅ¿e it grew dark he eaÅ¿ily obtained Lodging that night for his Company.

The HouÅ¿e being peÅ¿tered with them, the <hi>Kings MajeÅ¿ty</hi> had but a very narrow Lodging, yet that was not all the inconvenience. For about midnight a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that followed the Soldiers fell into Labour: Which being noiÅ¿ed about, the People of the Village flock'd together, and kept a bawling and heavy rout about the keeping of the Child and Mother, which continued till break of day,<note place="margin">And the Country People.</note> when the Soldiers, weary of the jangle, haÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their Ships.</p>
            <p>During the hubbub, let us look back a little to <hi>Chayremouth,</hi> where the Shoeing of a HorÅ¿e went near to have coÅ¿t the Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> dear,<note place="margin">

            <p>For (what the flagitiouÅ¿neÅ¿s of paÅ¿t Ages never attempted, and future Will hardly believe) the unfortunate Prince, to make way for the UÅ¿urpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Traytor <hi>Cromwel,</hi>

He knew full well, that the name of the <hi>Parliament</hi> was grown odious to the people, through the uneaÅ¿ineÅ¿s of their flagitious and uÅ¿urped Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. Turning therefore his Arms againÅ¿t his hauty MaÅ¿ters,<note place="margin">April 20. 1653.</note> he turned them out of the HouÅ¿e, as Objects firÅ¿t of his own contempt, and then of the peoples Å¿corn.

And at the Å¿ame time news was brought to <hi>Monk</hi>'s Camp, that the <hi>Committee of Safety</hi> was broken, and the <hi>Rump</hi> again in power.</p>
            <p>What could <hi>Lambert</hi> now between hawk and buzzard do? he was forÅ¿aken by Fortune, deluded by <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s confidence, over-reached by <hi>Monk</hi> under a colour of Peace, and deÅ¿piÅ¿ed by the <hi>Rump.</hi> Should he return to <hi>London,</hi> it was a long and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult march; and perhaps as late for the Å¿uccour of his friends as dangerous to himÅ¿elf, having Å¿uch an Enemy in the rear.

            <p>Nor were <hi>Lambert</hi>'s men truer to their TruÅ¿t than <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s had been at <hi>London:</hi>
               <note place="margin">The treachery of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s men towards him.</note> for Å¿o Å¿oon as they heard of the defection of the <hi>London</hi>-Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, baÅ¿ely, without conÅ¿ulting their General, nay, and Å¿lighting his authority, they Å¿ubmit to the <hi>Rump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Few now were to be Å¿een at <hi>Lambert</hi>'s door, and fewer within; nothing but Å¿ilence, and Å¿eldom any Guards: He was no more General nor cauÅ¿e of the War; but where he hoped for <hi>Laurel</hi> and Triumph, he was fain to Å¿earch a hiding place: Å¿o that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any attendance, he Å¿peedily and Å¿ecretly betook himÅ¿elf to <hi>London.</hi> So fallacious and uncertain a thing is Power, when it is too great.</p>

            <p>Nor were the emulous and competing <hi>CraÅ¿Å¿us</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> more Å¿ollicitous in drawing in <hi>CaeÅ¿ar,</hi> than <hi>Fleetwood</hi> and <hi>Lambert</hi> were in endeavouring to aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ociate <hi>Monk</hi> into the Government: for though they contributed their mutual aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning the <hi>Rump-Parliament,</hi> yet it is certain, they hardly conÅ¿pired in any thing, but in the fear that both of them had of <hi>Monk. Fleetwood</hi> was jealous of <hi>Lambert</hi>'s ambition; and <hi>Lambert</hi> could not brook <hi>Fleetwood</hi>'s authority: the one could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of an Equal, nor the other of a Superiour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monk</hi> therefore was courted by Letters from both, as having it in his power to give the Government to what Party he pleaÅ¿ed. Nor could <hi>Fleetwood</hi> have expected better Conditions from <hi>Lambert,</hi> had he prevailed againÅ¿t <hi>Monk</hi>; which thoÅ¿e who favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Fleetwood</hi> in his Army perceiving, avoiding all opportunity of fighting with <hi>Monk,</hi> leÅ¿t <hi>Lambert,</hi> perchance, getting the victory, might turn out his Rival <hi>Fleetwood.

                  <p>AMongÅ¿t the many Mercies of God to theÅ¿e poor Nations, your peaceable ReÅ¿titution is not the leaÅ¿t; it is (as you Å¿ad) his work alone, and to him belongs the glory of it. And I eÅ¿teem it as a great effect of his goodneÅ¿s to me, that he was pleaÅ¿ed to make me, amongÅ¿t many worthier in your Å¿ervice, Å¿ome way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trumental in it. I did nothing but my duty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve not to receive Å¿o great an honour and reÅ¿pect as you are pleaÅ¿ed to give me at this time and place; which I Å¿hall ever acknowledge as a high mark of your favour to me. Sir, I Å¿hall not now trouble you with large Narratives; onely give me leave to acquaint you, That as I marched out of <hi>Scotland</hi> hither, I obÅ¿erved the People in moÅ¿t Counties in great and earneÅ¿t expectations of a Settlement; and Å¿everal Applications were made to me, with numerous SubÅ¿criptions to them. The chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿t heads of their DeÅ¿ires were, for a free and full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and that you would determine your Å¿itting; a GoÅ¿pel-MiniÅ¿try; encouragement of Learning and <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>niverÅ¿ities; and for admittance of the Members Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded before the year <hi>1648.</hi> without any previous
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45936:256"/>
Oath or Engagement. To which I commonly anÅ¿wered, That you are now in a free Parliament; and if there be any force remaining upon you, I would endeavour to remove it; and that you had voted to fill up your HouÅ¿e, and then you would be a full Parliament alÅ¿o; and that you had already determined your Å¿itting: and for the MiniÅ¿try, their maintenance, the Laws, and <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverÅ¿ities, you had largely declared concerning them in your laÅ¿t Declaration; and I was confident you would adhere to it. But as for thoÅ¿e Gentlemen Å¿ecluded in the year <hi>1648.</hi> I told them, you had given judgment in it, and all people ought to acquieÅ¿ce in that judgment; but to admit any Members to Å¿it in Parliament without a previous Oath or Engagement to Å¿erve the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in being, it was never done in <hi>England.</hi> But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I Å¿aid it not to them, I muÅ¿t Å¿ay (with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don) to you, That the leÅ¿s Oaths and Engagements are impoÅ¿ed (with reÅ¿pect had to the Å¿ecurity of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon CauÅ¿e) your Å¿ettlement will be the Å¿ooner attained to. I am the more particular in theÅ¿e matters, to let you Å¿ee how grateful your preÅ¿ent ConÅ¿ultations about theÅ¿e matters will be to the people. I know all the Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Gentry will cloÅ¿e with you, if they may be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and gently uÅ¿ed; and I am Å¿ure you will Å¿o uÅ¿e them, as knowing it to be the common concern, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliÅ¿h and not leÅ¿Å¿en our intereÅ¿t; and to be careful that neither the <hi>Cavalier</hi> nor the <hi>Fanatick</hi> Party have yet a Å¿hare in your Civil or Military Power; of the laÅ¿t, whoÅ¿e impatience to Government you have lately had Å¿o Å¿evere experience of. I Å¿hould Å¿ay Å¿omething of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Scotland:</hi> indeed <hi>Ireland</hi> is in an ill Å¿ettled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and made worÅ¿e by your interruptions, which prevented the paÅ¿Å¿ing an Act for the Å¿ettlement of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tates of Adventurers and Souldiers there, which I heard you intended to have done in a few days; and I preÅ¿ume it will be now quickly done, being Å¿o neceÅ¿Å¿ary at this time, when the wants of the Commonwealth call
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45936:256"/>
for Å¿upplies: and people will unwillingly pay Taxes for thoÅ¿e EÅ¿tates, of which they have no legal aÅ¿Å¿urance. I need not tell you how much you were abuÅ¿ed in the nomination of the Officers of your Armies there; their malice that deceived you hath been Å¿ufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feÅ¿ted. I do affirm, that thoÅ¿e now who have declared for you, will continue faithful; and thereby convince, that as well there as here, it is the Å¿ober intereÅ¿t muÅ¿t eÅ¿tabliÅ¿h Dominion. As for <hi>Scotland,</hi> the People of that Nation deÅ¿erve to be cheriÅ¿hed much; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve your late Declaration will much glad their Å¿pirits: for nothing was more dreadful to them, than a fear to be over-run with Fanatick Notions. I humbly recommend them to your affection and eÅ¿teem, and deÅ¿ire the intended <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>nion may be proÅ¿ecuted, and their Taxes made proportionably to thoÅ¿e in <hi>England;</hi> for which I am engaged in promiÅ¿e to become a Suiter to you. And truly, Sir, I muÅ¿t ask leave to entreat you to make a Å¿peedy proviÅ¿ion for their Civil Government there, of which they have been deÅ¿titute near a year, to the ruine of many Families: and except CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging of the Government, and Judges to Å¿it in Courts of Judicature, be Å¿peedily appointed, that Country will be very miÅ¿erable. I directed Mr. <hi>Gumble</hi> (whom I lately Å¿ent to you, to give you an account of the affairs of the ScottiÅ¿h Army, and to make certain PropoÅ¿als in their names) to preÅ¿ent Å¿ome perÅ¿ons to you, both for CommiÅ¿Å¿ioners and Judges, which he did; but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿on of your great affairs, they were not diÅ¿patched: but I humbly now offer them to your conÅ¿ideration.</p>

                  <hi>Cromwel</hi> indeed came of a better Race, but which he himÅ¿elf for ever diÅ¿graced. The ancient dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of his Family by the name of <hi>Williams,</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged afterward by his AnceÅ¿tors, in the time of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> to that of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> had its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal from a BlackÅ¿mith.</p>

                  </note>His Youth was looÅ¿e, infamous and debauched; but having run out his EÅ¿tate, and from a prodigal Rogue turning Puritan, and then Fanatick, like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Cataline,</hi> incited by Beggary, he ventured upon the overthrow of the State.</p>
               <p>Bearing a mind above a private condition, he Å¿till appeared as a private perÅ¿on, and had the art to Å¿et himÅ¿elf off undiÅ¿cerned: He had a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dexterity amongÅ¿t the Fanatick Rout, (in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:45936:272"/>
whoÅ¿e opprobrious friendÅ¿hip he chiefly delighted) of winning upon the minds of the <hi>Rebels,</hi> Å¿haking his bald pate, and Å¿miling with a deceitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; he was by Nature and Art excellently diÅ¿poÅ¿ed for alluring the affections of the DiÅ¿Å¿en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; nor do I know whether amongÅ¿t mortal men there was even a cunniner ArtiÅ¿t in pretended Piety, a wickeder or more crafty man, and bolder in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any Villany.</p>
               <p>But by what deceitful grinning Arts having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and murdered the <hi>King,</hi> he raiÅ¿ed himÅ¿elf to Supreme Power; many great Wits and able Pens have already deÅ¿cribed: Much he did in War, but more by PerfidiouÅ¿neÅ¿s, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criÅ¿ie, Perjury, and FalÅ¿hood.</p>
               <p>More cruel he was than the ancient Tyrants, whoÅ¿e Manners and Examples he imitated: with <hi>Tiberius</hi> he was Å¿ubtile and Å¿uÅ¿picacious, <hi>He had a crafty diÅ¿poÅ¿ition with a jealous head,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tacit. <hi>Annab. l.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 4.</note> 
                  <hi>and delighted in none of his Virtues Å¿o much as in DiÅ¿Å¿imulation</hi>; more eaÅ¿ily concealing Hatred than Fear. <hi>Nero</hi> he acted in the Å¿laughter of his beÅ¿t Country-men, nor was he unlike him in driving a Coach.

                  </note> 
                  <hi>and a redneÅ¿s that fortified him againÅ¿t BluÅ¿hing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that he might not onely appear famous through Crimes and Villanies, by intervals he made a Å¿hew of Å¿ome great actions; not from a principle of GoodneÅ¿s, but Ambition; nor out of love to Virtue, but Vanity, and future Glory. This alone was wanting to his fortune and our Å¿lavery, that he had neither a Son nor SucceÅ¿Å¿our able to match him.</p>
               <p>Pity it was that that bold Orator,<note place="margin">Milton.</note> or rather Bagpiper, was out of the way at the Å¿hameful ObÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies of the Traytors, that the Å¿ame hand which (reproaching all Kings in Latin) vindicated the

               <p>Strangers may perhaps wonder, and no leÅ¿s our PoÅ¿terity at home, that Å¿uch baÅ¿e and contemptible fellows, many of them Brewers, others who drank as they had brewed, and Å¿pent their EÅ¿tates; and Å¿ome again whoÅ¿e ignominious Poverty was a Å¿can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the Nation, Å¿hould overturn the flouriÅ¿hing Å¿tate of <hi>England,</hi> and get to the top of Authority and Government.</p>
               <p>Would we know the cauÅ¿e of it? TheÅ¿e were the Spoils, and theÅ¿e the Trophies of HereÅ¿ie; which taking its riÅ¿e from the <hi>Sermonizing Presbyterian</hi> MiniÅ¿ters, increaÅ¿ed by the <hi>Independants,</hi> hurried on by the Kennel of all the Sectarians, and by a kind of flying Contagion Å¿pread over all the <hi>Forces,</hi> could not be Å¿topt till they had Å¿hed the <hi>Royal Bloud,</hi> Å¿ubverted the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and made one ruinous heap of all good Subjects.</p>

The darkneÅ¿s of the night putting all things into terrour and confuÅ¿ion, increaÅ¿ed the horrour of the Calamity. The Citizens being frightened, delayed the uÅ¿e of timely Remedies; and which was no Å¿mall acceÅ¿Å¿ion to the Evil, the people neglecting too much their houÅ¿es, were too fatally Å¿et upon the haÅ¿ty removing of their Goods, which were yet at length devoured by the nimble flames.</p>
               <p>The raging EaÅ¿t Wind that had much incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded the <hi>EngliÅ¿h</hi> Fleet at Sea, did far greater damage in the burning City, by carrying the force of the flames through the greateÅ¿t part of <hi>London.</hi> The Conflagration grew Å¿oon inÅ¿uperable by the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45936:290"/>
blowing of the Wind; which raiÅ¿ing in a moment the fire from the bottom to the tops of the houÅ¿es, and Å¿cattering flakes in all places, it grew too Å¿trong for the endeavours of thoÅ¿e that laboured to quench it. Here the blazes of ruddy flames were to be Å¿een, and there the craÅ¿hing of falling houÅ¿es to be heard; and which was the Å¿adeÅ¿t Spectacle under the Sun, the doleful looks of Å¿o many Citizens, the wailings of deÅ¿olate women, and the cries of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and decrepit aged people: And in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿aken Å¿hops of the wealthy Inhabitants, numbers of Thieves and Pilferers, greedier of Booty than the fire, villanouÅ¿ly skulked.</p>
               <p>No man that had a Å¿enÅ¿e of humane MiÅ¿eries, could Å¿ee, and not be affected with the diÅ¿mal Å¿pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle of the Ruining City of <hi>London.</hi> Now were there to be Å¿een almoÅ¿t an hundred <hi>Churches</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ecrated to <hi>God,</hi> and many <hi>HoÅ¿pitals,</hi> the Monuments of ancient Piety; beÅ¿ides other <hi>publick Buildings,</hi> raiÅ¿ed at the vaÅ¿t charges of our AnceÅ¿tors; the famed <hi>Sion-Colledge,</hi> and <hi>Royal Exchange</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> the <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> and Å¿tately Cathedral of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> as Å¿ad Spectacles of the Calamity, either bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under their own RubbiÅ¿h, or Å¿tanding Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the devouring flames.</p>

               <p>The <hi>King,</hi> whoÅ¿e high-born Soul was above the ViciÅ¿Å¿itudes of humane Contingencies, could not but with grief and Å¿orrow behold the lamentable Calamity of his wretched Subjects, and native Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, exhorting, comforting, and adviÅ¿ing them in their greateÅ¿t difficulties: And therefore he ordered,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45936:291"/>
that the next houÅ¿es to the fire Å¿hould be blown up, that a void Å¿pace being made betwixt the Buildings, the remaining part of the City, that which Å¿till Å¿tood, might be Å¿aved; this being the laÅ¿t Remedy that could be uÅ¿ed.</p>

               <p>Here it was that firÅ¿t of all he gained the good eÅ¿teem of <hi>Cromwel,</hi> who then commanded the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>-Forces in <hi>Ireland,</hi> having performed an action more advantageous to his General, than ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to himÅ¿elf.

five years: until Quarrels and AnimoÅ¿ities happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>London</hi> betwixt the <hi>Rumpers</hi> and <hi>Colonels</hi> of the Army, he laid hold on the occaÅ¿ion for reÅ¿toring of the <hi>King.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But at what time firÅ¿t he framed the deÅ¿igne of reÅ¿toring <hi>Charles</hi> to the Throne, I Å¿hall hardly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ume to determine: Cavillers, and thoÅ¿e that make the worÅ¿t of things, gave it out, that his dutiful Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the <hi>King</hi> were but fortuitous; but they who judge impartially, affirm that it was a deÅ¿igne laid many years before. Certainly the beÅ¿t of <hi>Kings,</hi> more mindful of the effects of his Loyalty, than of its beginning, received the duty of <hi>Albemarle,</hi> as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and kind Å¿ervices, and honourably and liberally rewarded them.</p>
               <p>The year before his death, he fell into a <hi>DropÅ¿ie</hi>; and being weary of the ordinary methods and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of PhyÅ¿icians, he made uÅ¿e of a certain Quack-Medicine, which in appearance recovered him; but his body being opened after his death, a great deal of Water was found in his Bowels, and much congealed Bloud in both the Ventricles of his Heart, and other neighbouring VeÅ¿Å¿els: For the motion both of the Heart and Bloud being weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an inveterate DropÅ¿ie, gave occaÅ¿ion to the Å¿tagnating of the chylous juyce about the Heart; which Å¿topping the Fountain of the circulating Bloud, put at length a Å¿top to his laÅ¿t breathings for life.</p>
               <p>The Marriage of his onely Son was in a manner the laÅ¿t thing he minded in this life; who a few days before his death was married to the Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Ogle,</hi> and Grand-daughter to the Duke of <hi>NewcaÅ¿tle</hi>; thereby to Å¿ettle, as well as honour, his Family by an Alliance with Å¿o Noble a HouÅ¿e.</p>
               <p>After he had Å¿een <hi>Britain</hi> rejoycing in Triumphs,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45936:295"/>
beheld <hi>Charles</hi> confirmed in the Throne by ten years happy Reign, and after he had adminiÅ¿tred the greateÅ¿t Offices of TruÅ¿t under the King, both in Peace and War, being upwards of Å¿ixty years of age, he yielded to DeÅ¿tiny, which he willingly and undauntedly Å¿ubmitted unto; that after the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of a paÅ¿t Life, he might at length triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Death.</p>
               <p>He left but one onely Son, the IlluÅ¿trious Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of his Fathers Fame, hopeful to the State, and cheriÅ¿hed by the King as his own. <hi>Charles</hi> who had often viÅ¿ited and condoled with him in his Å¿ick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, was with him to the laÅ¿t, and expreÅ¿Å¿ed the Å¿ame affection for dying <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that he had teÅ¿tified to him during his life.</p>
               <p>From <hi>SomerÅ¿et</hi>-houÅ¿e, where he had lain in Å¿tate,<note place="margin">The Solemnity of his Funerals</note> he was with a Å¿plendid pomp of Å¿olemn Funerals at the <hi>Kings</hi> charges conveyed to <hi>WeÅ¿tminÅ¿ter</hi>-Abbey, and there amidÅ¿t the Tears and Condolings of all good men, interred amongÅ¿t the AuguÅ¿t Monuments of Kings, being the laÅ¿t Triumph due to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>They who are curious to have a deÅ¿cription of the Å¿hapes and countenance of Å¿o great a man, may know; that he was a perÅ¿on more graceful than beautiful; of a middle Å¿tature, Å¿trong and well comparted, with a comely preÅ¿ence; and of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed, rather than Å¿evere or Å¿tern, aÅ¿pect.</p>
               <p>He may eaÅ¿ily be reckoned a moÅ¿t valiant <hi>General</hi> in War,<note place="margin">His Courage.</note> not onely to be compared to the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of his own age, but to the moÅ¿t renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Warriours of elder times; and of Å¿o great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation he was in Military affairs, that the modeÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t do acknowledge too great a Courage in <hi>Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle.</hi> He Å¿pent almoÅ¿t his whole life in Arms, and at length growing old amidÅ¿t Victories, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came gray-headed under a Helmet.</p>

                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45936:296"/>In <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Sea and by Land, Å¿o happy was <hi>Albemarle,</hi> that Fortune traced out for him,<note place="margin">His Prudence,</note> Honour, Renown, and Titles.
