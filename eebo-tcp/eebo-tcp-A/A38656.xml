            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ROBERT Earl of ESSEX,
To the Honorable
House of Commons:</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Received an Order the last
night, to desire me forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
to send a Commission
to Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> to
command the Forces of <hi>Kent, Surrey,
Sussex</hi> and <hi>Hampshire,</hi> according to an
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54976:3"/>
Ordinance of both Houses; I am so
ready for the advancement of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
service he is now ingaged in, and
my will to satisfie the desire of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
House of <hi>Commons,</hi> as that I
have sent down a Commission accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:
But finding expressions in that
Order that might intimate a neglect in
me, and being confident of mine own
Integrity to serve both Houses, and to
preserve the good opinion of the house
of <hi>Commons,</hi> I shall acquaint you that I
sent a Commission by Mr. <hi>Nicolls,</hi>
which he kept some dayes, and then
wrote earnestly to mee for another
more ample; I wondring why hee
should keep it so long, and then send
for another, deferred my Resolution,
untill I came up; But this Order inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
prevented mee of asking the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54976:3"/>
reason: It is true, the Commission was
not according as I usually grant them
(but it gave him full Authority for the
present service.)</p>
            <p>For the Reasons of my Limitations
in the former Commission, I forbear to
give them; But whensoever the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
shall command me, I shall be ready
to make it appear, I did no more then I
ought to do, having received so great a
Trust from the Parliament, in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of my duty, and then to submit
to their further pleasures.</p>
            <p>Sir, I shall desire you to beleeve, it
shalbe my greatest care, so to carry my
self, as that I may give a reall accompt
of my Actions, whensoever it shall
please the Parliament to require it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:54976:4"/>
The charge I took, was not by my
seeking (I knowing my own imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions)
but not in the least way of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
and constancy, and it was a great
incouragement to me, the noble and
free offers of both Houses, <hi>To live and
dye with me;</hi> which hath put a great
confidence in me, that <hi>I</hi> shall never
want your just Protection and Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
And that you will take care of
that Army that hath shewed so much
Faithfulnesse and Resolution in your
services, and that God hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of his infinite goodnesse so to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect;
And for my own part, <hi>I</hi> am eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day so confirmed in the justnesse of
the <hi>Cause,</hi> that let the strength <hi>I</hi> have
be never so weak, I shall never desert
