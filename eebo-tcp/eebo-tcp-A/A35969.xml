         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Receipt to make Metheglin as it is made at
Liege, Communicated by Mr. Masillon.</head>
            <p>TAke one Measure of Honey, and three
Measures of Water, and let it boil till
one measure be boiled away, so that
there be left three measures in all; as
for Example, take to one Pot of Honey, three
Pots of Water, and let it boil so long, till it come
to three Pots. During which time you must
Skim it very well as soon as any scum riseth;
which you are to continue till there rise no
scum more. You may, if you please, put to it
some spice, to wit, Cloves and Ginger; the
quantity of which is to be proportioned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as you will have your Meath, strong, or
weak. But this you do before it begin to boil.
There are some that put either Yeast of Beer,
or Leaven of bread into it, to make it work.
But this is not necessary at all; and much less to
set it into the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. <hi>Masillon</hi> doth neither
the one nor the other. Afterwards for to Tun it,
you must let it grow Luke-warm, for to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
it. And if you do intend to keep your
Meathe a long time, you may put into it some
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>opps on this fashion. Take to every Barrel of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106905:5"/>
Meathe a Pound of Hops without leaves, that
is, of Ordinary Hops used for Beer, but well
cleansed, taking only the Flowers, without
the Green-leaves and stalks. Boil this pound
of Hops in a Pot and half of fair water, till <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
come to one Pot, and this quantity is sufficient
for a Barrel of Meathe. A Barrel at <hi>Liege</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
ninety Pots, and a Pot is as much as a
Wine quart in <hi>England.</hi> (I have since been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
from <hi>Liege,</hi> that a Pot of that Countrey
holdeth 48 O<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nces of Apothecary's measure:
which I judge to be a Pottle according to
<hi>London</hi> measure, or two Wine-quarts.) When
you Tun your Meath, you must not fill
your Barrel by half a foot, that so it may
have room to work. Then let it stand six weeks
slightly stopped; which being expired, if the
Meath do not work, stop it up very close. Yet
must you not fill up the Barrel to the
very brim. After six Months you draw off the clear
into another Barrel, or strong Bottles, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the dregs, and filling up your new Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
or Bottels, and stopping it or them very close.</p>
            <p>The Meath that is made this way, (<hi>Viz.</hi> In
the Spring, in the Month of <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> which
is the proper time for making of it,) will keep
many a year.</p>

Proportion of Herbs is to make six Gallons of
Decoction, so that you may take eight or nine

Lukewarm, Dissolve your proportion of Honey
in it. After it is well dissolved and laved with
strong Arms or woodden Instruments, like Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle-doors
or Scoops, boil it gently, till you
have taken away all the scum; then make an
end of well boyling it, about an hour in all.
Then pour it into a wooden vessel, and let it
stand till it be cold. Then pour the clear
through a Sieve of hair, ceasing pouring when
you come to the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oul thick settling. Tun the
clear into your vessel, (without Barm) and
stop it up close, with the Spices in it, till you
perceive by the hissing that it begins to work.
Then give it some little vent, else the Barrel
would break. When it is at the end of the
working, stop it up close. She useth to make
it at the end of Summer, when she takes up her
Honey, and begins to drink it in Lent. But it
will be better if you defer piercing it till next
Winter. When part of the Barrel is drunk, she
botteleth the rest, which maketh it quicker and
better. You clear the Decoction from the
Herbs by a Hair-sieve.</p>

            <p>The Honey of dry open Countries, where
there is much Wild-thyme, Rosemary, and
Flowers, is best. It is of three sorts, Virgin-honey,
Life-honey, and Stock-honey. The
first is the best. The Life-honey next. The
Virgin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Spring before, and are taken up in Autumn;
and is made best by chusing the Whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>est combs
of the Hive, and then letting the Honey run
out of them lying upon a Sieve without pressing
it, or breaking of the Combs. The Life-honey
is of the same Combs broken after the Virgin-honey
is run from it; The Merchants of Honey
do use to mingle all the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orts together. The
first of a Swarm is called Virgin-honey. That of the
next year, after the Swarm was hatched, is
Life-honey. And ever after, it is Honey of
Old-stocks. Honey that is forced out of the
Combs, will always taste of Wax. <hi>Hampshire</hi>
Honey is most esteemed at <hi>London.</hi> About

            <p>When all is dissolved, it must be so strong
that an Egge may swim in it with the end up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
And if it be too sweet or too strong, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is too much Honey; then you must
put more water to it; yet so, that, as above, an
Hens Egge may swim with the point upwards:
And then that newly added water must be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
well stirred about, so that it may be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
all alike. If the Eggs sink (which is a token
that there is not honey enough) then you must
put more Honey to it, and stir about, till it be
all dissolved, and the Eggs swim, as abovesaid.
This being done, it must be hanged over the fire,
and as it beginneth to seeth, the scum, that doth
arise upon it, both before and after, must be
clean skimed off. When it is first set upon the
fire, you must measure it first with a stick, how
deep the Kettel is, or how much Liquor there
be in it; and then it must boil so long, till one
third part of it be boiled away. When it is thus
boiled, it must be poured out into a Cooler, or
open vessel, before it be tunned in the Barrel; but
the Bung-hole must be left open, that it may have
vent. A vessel, which hath served for Sack is best.</p>

how high the water cometh, making a notch,
where the superficies toucheth the stick. As
soon as the water is warm, put in your Honey,
and let it boil, skiming it always, till it be very
clean; Then put to every Gallon of water, one
pound of the best Blew-raisins of the Sun, first
clean picked from the stalks, and clean washed.
Let them remain in the boiling Liquor, till they
be throughly swollen and soft; Then take them
out, and put them into a Hair-bag, and strain all
the juice and pulp and substance from them in
an Apothecaries Press; which put back into
your liquor, and let it boil, till it be consumed
just to the notch you took at first, for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

run through a Hair-strainer into an empty
Woodden-fat, which must stand endwise, with
the head of the upper-end out; and there let it
remain till the next day, that the liquor be quite
cold. Then Tun it up into a good Barrel, not
filled quite full, but within three or four fingers
breadth; (where Sack hath been, is the best)
and let the bung remain open for six weeks
with a double bolter-cloth lying upon it, to

into a Cask, that hath been used for Sack, and
stop it up close, having an eye to give it a little
vent, if it should work. If it cast out any foul
Liquor in working, fill it up always presently
with some of the same liquor, that you have kept
in bottles for that end. When it hath wrought,
and is well settled (which may be in about two
months or ten weeks) draw it into Glass-bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
as long as it comes clear; and it will be

will be in the bottom of the bottle.</p>
            <p>He since told me, that to this Proportion of
Honey and water, to make a Hogshead of

and six Ounces of Spice of all sorts: All which
will be mellowed and rotted away quite, (as
well as the lushiousness of the Honey) in the
space of a year or two. For this is to be kept
so long before it be drunk.</p>
            <p>If you would have it sooner ready to drink,
you may work it with a little yeast, when it is
almost cold in the Kiver: and Tun it up as soon
as it begins to work, doing afterwards as is said
before; but leaving a little vent to purge by, till
it have done working. Or in stead of yeast, you
may take the yolks of four New-laid-eggs, and
almost half a pint of fine Wheat-flower, and
some of the Liquor you have made: beat them
well together, then put them to the Liquor in
the Cask, and stop it up close, till you see it
needful, to give it a little vent.</p>

            <p>The first of <hi>Septemb.</hi> 1663. Mr. <hi>Webb</hi> came
to my House to make some for Me. He took
fourty three Gallons of water, and fourty two
pounds of <hi>Norfolk</hi> honey. As soon as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
boiled, He put into it a slight handful of
Hops; which after it had boiled a little above
a quarter of an hour, he skimed off; then put
in the honey to the boyling water, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
a whi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e scum rose, which he skimed off
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106905:11"/>
still as it rose; which skiming was ended in
little above a quarter of an hour more. Then
He put in his herbs and spices, which were these:
Rose-mary, Thyme, Winter-savory, Sweet-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joram,
Sweet-bryar-leaves, seven or eight little
Parsley<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>roots: There was most of the Savoury,
and least of the Eglantine, three Ounces of
Ginger, one Ounce and a half of Cinnamon, five
Nutmegs (half an Ounce of Cloves he would
have added, but did not,) And these boiled an
hour and a quarter longer; in all from the first
beginning to boil, somewhat less then two
hours: Then he presently laded it out of the
Copper into Coolers, letting it run through a
Hair-sieve: And set the Coolers shelving
(tilted up) that the Liquor might afterwards
run the more quietly out of them. After the
Liquor had stood so about two hours, he poured
or laded out of some of the Coolers very gently,
that the dregs might not rise, into other Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
And about a pint of very thick dregs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
last in the bottom of every Cooler. That
which ran out, was very clear: After two hours
more settling, (in a shelving situation,) He
poured it out again into other Coolers; and
then very little dregs (or scarce any in some of
the Coolers) did remain. When the Liquor was
even almost cold, He took the yolks of three
New-laid-eggs, a spoonful of fine white flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:106905:12"/>
and about half a pint of new fresh barm of
good strong Beer (you must have care that your
barm be very white and clean, not sullied and
foul, as is usual among slovenly Brewers in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>)
Beat this very well together, with a little
of the Liquor in a skiming dish, till you see it
well incorporated, and that it beginneth to
work. Then put it to a pailful (of about two
Gallons and a half) of the Liquor, and mingle
it well therewith. Then leave the skiming dish
reversed floating in the middle of the Liquor,
and so the yest will work up into and under the
hollow of the dish, and grow out round about
the sides without. He left this well and thick
covered all night, from about eleven a clock at
night; And the next morning, finding it had
wrought very well, He mingled what was in the
Pail with the whole proportion of the Liquor,
and so Tunned it up into a Sack-cask. I am not
satisfied, whether he did not put a spoonful of
fine white good Mustard into his Barm, before
he brought it hither, (for he took a pretext to
look out some pure clean white barm) but he
protested, there was nothing mingled with the
barm, yet I am in doubt. He confessed to me
that in making of Sider, He put's in half as much
Mustard as Barm; but never in Meathe. The
fourth of <hi>September</hi> in the morning, he Bottled

this Meathe (for he did Tun the whole quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
into one large Rundlet, and two little
ones) whereof the one contained thirty Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;
and the other, twenty two. There remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
but little settling or dregs in the Bottom's
of the Barrels, but some there was. The Bottles
were set into a Cool Cellar, and He said they
would be ready to drink in three weeks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The
Proportion of Herbs and Spices is this; That
there be so much as to drown the luscious sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Honey; but not so much as to taste
of herbs or spice, when you drink the Meathe.
But that the sweetness of the honey may kill
their taste: And so the Meathe have a pleasant
taste, but not of herbs, nor spice, nor honey.
And therefore you put more or less according
to the time you will drink it in. For a great deal
will be mellowed away in a year, that would be
ungratefully strong in three months. And the
honey that will make it keep a year or two, will
require triple proportion of spice and herbs.

Baulm, four of Rosemary; two of Bayleaves;
one of Thyme, and one of Sweet-marjoram,
and five Eringo-roots splirted. When the water
hath drawn out the vertue of the herbs (which
it will do in half an hours boiling,) let it run
through a strainer or sieve, and let it settle so,
that you may pour the clear from the Dregs.
To every three Gallons of the Clear, take one
of Honey, and with clean Arms stripped up,
lade it for two or three hours, to dissolve the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the water; lade it twice or thrice that day.
The next day boil it very gently to make the
scum rise, and scum it all the while, and now and
then pour to it a ladle full of cold water, which
will make the scum rise more: when it is very
clear from scum, you may boil it the more
strongly, till it bear an Egge very high, that the
breadth of a groat be out of the water, and that
it boil high with great walms in the middle of
the Kettle: which boiling with great Bubbles
in the middle is a sign it is boiled to it's height.
Then let it cool till it be Lukewarm, at which
time put some Ale-yest into it, to make it
work, as you would do Ale. And then put it
up into a fit Barrel first seasoned with some
good sweet White-wine (as Canary-sack) and

keep the bung open, till it have done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
filling it up with some such honey-drink
warmed, as you find it sink down by working
over. When it hath almost done working,
put into it a bag of thin stuff (such as Bakers
use to bolt in) fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

containing two parts of Ginger-sliced, and one
apiece of Cinamon, Cloves and Nutmegs, with
a Pebble-stone in it to make it sink; And stop
it up close for six Months or a year, and then
you may draw it into Bottles. If you like Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damom-seeds,
you may adde some of them to
the spices. Some do like Mint exceedingly to
be added to the other herbs. Where no yeast
is to be had, The Liquor will work if you set
it some days in the hot Sun (with a cover, like
the roof of a house over it, to keep wet out, if
it chance to rain) but then you must have
great care, to fill it up, as it consumeth, and to
stop it close a little before it hath done work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and to set it then presently in a Cool Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.
I am told that the Leaven of bread will
make it work as well as yest, but I have not
tryed it. If you will not have it so strong, it
will be much sooner ready to drink; As if you
take six parts of water to one of Honey. Some
do like the drink better without either herbs or
spices, and it will be much the whiter. If

            <head>Sack with Clove-gilly flowers.</head>
            <p>If you will make a Cordial Liquor of Sack
with Clove-gillyflowers, you must do thus.
Prepare your Gillyflowers, as is said before, and
put them into great double glass-bottles, that
hold two gallons a piece, or more; and put to
every gallon of Sack, a good half pound of the
wiped and cut flowers, pu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting in the flowers
first, and then the Sack upon them. Stop the
glasses exceeding close, and set them in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Cellar. Let them stand so, till you see
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:106905:15"/>
that the Sack hath drawn out all the principal
tincture from them, and that the flowers begin
to look palish; (with an eye of pale, or faint
in Colour) Then pour the Sack from them, and
throw away the exhausted flowers, or distil
a spirit from them; For if you let them remain
longer in the Sack, they will give an earthy tast
to them. You may then put the tincted Sack
into fit bottles for your use, stopping them very
close. But if the season of the flowers be not
yet past, your Sack will be better, if you put
it upon new flowers, which I conceive will not
be the worse, but peradventure the better, if
they be a little dried in the shade. If you drink
a Glass or two of this sack at a meal, you will
find it a great Cordial.</p>
            <p>Upon better consideration; I conceive the
best way of making <hi>Hydrom<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l</hi> with Clove-gilly-flowers,
is thus: Boil your simple Liquor to it's
full height (with three parts of water to one of
Honey,) take a small parcel out, to make a
strong infusion of flowers, pouring it boyl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng
hot upon the flowers in earthen vessels. If you
have great quantity, as six to one, of Liquor, you
will easily draw out the tincture in fourteen or
sixteen hours infusion; otherwise you may
quicken your liquor with a parcel of Sack. In
the mean time make the great quantity of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
work with yest. When it hath almost done
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:106905:15"/>
fermenting, but not quite, put the infusion to it
warm, and let it ferment more if it will. When
that is almost done, put to it a bag with flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to hang in the bung.</p>
            <p>I conceive that <hi>Hydromel</hi> made with Juniper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries
(first broken and bruised) boiled in it,
is very good. Adde also to it Rosemary and
Bayleaves.</p>
            <p>Upon tryal of several ways, I conclude (as
things yet appear to me) that to keep Meath
long, it must not be fermented with yest (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
you put Hops to it) but put it in the barrel,
and let it ferment of it self, keeping a thick
plate of lead upon the bung, to lie close upon
it, yet so that the working of the Liquor may
raise it, to purge out the foulness, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
some new made plain Liquor, to fill it up
as it sinks, warm whiles it works: but cold du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
three or four month's after. Then stop the
bung exceeding close. And when you will make
your Mead with Cherries or Morello-Cherries,
or Raspes, or Bilberries, or Black-cherries, put
their juyce to the Liquor when you tun it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever boiling it therein; about one quart of
juyce to every three or four gallons of Liquor.
You may squeese out the clear juyce, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
it with the Liquor, and hang the Magma in
a bag in the bung. I think it is best to break the
stones of the Cherries, before you put their
Magma into the bag.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:106905:16"/>
Since I conceive, that Clove-gilly-flowers
must never be boiled in the Liquor: that eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porateth
their Spirits, which are very volatile:
But make a strong infusion of them, and besides
hang a Bag of them in the bung. I conceive
that it is good to make the Liquor pretty strong
(not too much, but so as the taste may be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full)
of some strong herbs, as Rosemary, Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves,
Sweet-marjoram, Thyme, Broad-thyme,
and the like. For they preserve the drink, and
make it better for the stomack and head. Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Sun is the best way of Fermentation,
when the drink is strong. The Root of Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica
or Elecampane, or Eringo, or Orris, may
be good and pleasant, to be boiled in the Liquor.
Raspes and Cherries and Bilberies are never to
be boiled, but their juyce put into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,

of each two handfuls: Six Eringo-roots.
When the water hath taken out the vertue of
the herbs and roots, let it settle, and the next
day pour off the clear, and in every three Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
of it boil one of honey, scumming it well,
and putting in a little cold water now and then
to make the scum rise, as also some whites of
Eggs. When it is clear scummed, take it off, and
let it cool; then work it with Ale-yest; tun it
up, and hang in it a bag, with Ginger, Cinamom,
Cloves and Cardamom. And as it worketh
over, put in some strong honey-drink warmed.
When it works no more, stop it up close.</p>
            <p>In twenty Gallons of water boil Sweet-bryar-leaves,
Eye-bright, Rosemary, Bayes, Clove-gilly-flowers
of each five handfuls, and four
Eringo-roots. To every two gallons and a half
of this decoction, put one gallon of honey;
boil it, &amp;c. When it is tunned up, hang in it a

and sufficient quantity of the spices above.</p>
            <p>In both these Receipts, the quantity of the
herbs is too great. The strong herbs preserve
the drink, and make it nobler. Use Marjoram
and Thyme in little quantity in all.</p>

Therefore you must put in another, if the

When you take it off, let none of the Liquor
go away with the dross. 3. When you take it
from the fire, let it settle well, before it be

keep it: and when it comes near the bottom,
let it be taken carefully from the sediment,
with a thin Dish, so as nothing be put into the

            <p>Take to every quart of honey, 4, 5, or 6,
quarts of water; boil it on a good quick fire as
long as any scum riseth; as it boils, put about
half a pint of water at a time very often, and
scum it very well as it riseth; and be sure to
keep it up to the same height and quantity as at
the first: Put into it a little Rosemary, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the quantity that you make, and boil it
half a quarter of an hour; scum it very well.
You may put a little Ginger into it, onely to
give it a taste thereof, and let it have a little
walm of heat after it. Then take and put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Woodden vessel, (which must be well
scalded, least it taste of any thing) let it stand

little good light barm. That which you make
in the winter, you must let it stand three days
and three nights covered up, before you bottle
it up; and two nights in summer, and then
bottle it up. But be sure, you scum off the
barm before the bottling up.</p>
            <p>Your vessel, which you intend to boil your
Meath in, must stand in scalding water, whilst
you boil your Meath; it will drink up the less

As you desire your Metheglin in strength, so
take at the first either of the quantities of water.
Five quarts is reasonable.</p>

have your Meath taste of Raspes, or Cherries

the water first with them; by putting five or six

from the Grains or Seeds, or Stones. And then

set them over so soft a fire, that you may endure
to melt and break the honey with your hands.
When the honey is all melted, put in an Egge,
and let it fall gently to the bottome, and if
the Egge rise up to the top again of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
then is it strong enough of the honey;
but if it lie at the bottome, you must put in
more honey, stirring of it till it do rise. If
your honey be very good, it will bear half a
Gallon of water more to a Gallon of Honey.
Then take Sweet-bryar, Rose-mary, Bayes,
Thyme, Marjoram, Savory, of each a good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
which must be tyed up all together in a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle

When you have put these things together set
it upon a quick fire, and let it boil as fast as
you can for half an hour, or better, skiming of
it very clean, which you must Clarifie with two
or three whites of Eggs. Then take it off from
the fire, and put it presently into some clean
covers, and let it stand till the next morning;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:106905:33"/>
then pour the clear from the bottom and tun it
up; putting in a little bag of such spice as you
like, whereof Ginger must be the most. After it
hath stood some three or four days, you may
put in some two or three spoonfuls of good-ale-yest;
it will make it ready the sooner to

it, have four Gallons of Black-currants, bruise
them in a stone mortar, that they may the

Put them and their juyce into the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
and pour the cool Liquor upon them, so as

plate of lead lying loose on, that the working
of the Liquor may lift it up, as it needeth to
cast out the filth. And still as it worketh over,
fill it up with fresh Liquor, made in the same
proportion of honey and water. A moneth

            <p>Take of all sorts of herbs, that you think

Rose-mary, Angelica, Wild-thyme, Hys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sop,
Agrimony, Burnet, and such other as
you may like; as also some field herbs; But
you must not put in too many, especially Rose-mary
or any strong herb. Less then half a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
will serve of every sort. Boil your herbs,
and strain them out, and let the Liquor stand
till the morrow, and settle; Then take of the
clearest of the Liquor two Gallons and a half
to one Gallon of Honey; and in that propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
take as much of them as you will make,
and let it boil an hour, and in the boiling
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106905:48"/>
scum it very clean. Then set it a cooling as
you do Beer; and when it is cold, take some
very good Ale-barm, and put it into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Tub, you mean the Metheglin shall
work in, which pour into the Tub by little and
little, as they do Beer, keeping back the thick
settling, which lieth in the bottome of the
vessels, wherein it is cooled. And when all is
put together, cover it with a cloth, and let it
work very near three days. And when you
mean to put it up, scum off all the barm clean,
and put it up into your Barrel or Firkin, which
you must not stop very close in four or five
days, but let it have a little vent, for it will
work; and when it is close stopped, you must
look to it very often, and have a peg in the
top, to give it vent, when you hear it make a
noise (as it will do) or else it will break the
barrel. You may also, if you please, make a
bag, and put in good store of sliced Ginger,
and some Cloves and Cinnamon, and boil it in,
or put it into the barrel and never boil it. Both
ways are good.</p>
            <p>If you will make small Metheglin, you may
put fivse or six Gallons of water to one of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Put in a little Cinnamon and Cloves and
boil it well. And when it is cold, put it up in
bottles very close stopped, and the stopples well
tyed on. This will not keep above five or six
weeks, but it is very fine drink.</p>

               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:106905:48"/>
Make your Metheglin as soon as ever you
take your Bees; for if you wash your combs
in the water you boil your herbs in, when it is
cold, it will sweeten much. But you must after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
strain it through a cloth, or else there
will be much wax.</p>

            <p>If you will have it to keep a year or two,
take six parts of water, and one of honey; But
if you will have it to keep longer, take but four
parts of water to one of honey. Dissolve the
honey very well in the water, then boil it
gently, skimming it all the while as the scum
riseth, till no more scum riseth. Then pour it
out of the Copper into a fit vessel or vessels to
cool. Then Tun it up in a strong and sweet cask,
and let it stand in some place, where there
is some little warmth; (It will do as well
without warmth, but be longer growing
ripe) This will make it work. At first a course
foul matter will work over; to which purpose
it must be kept always full with fresh Liquor of
the same, as it worketh over. When it begins
to work more gently, and that which riseth at
the top, is no more foul, but is a white froth;
then fill and stop it up close, and set it in a cool
cellar, where it is to stand continually.</p>
            <p>After half a year or a year, you may draw it
off from the Lees into a clean vessel, or let it

perfect Cyder consisteth in not having it work
much, scarce ever at all; but, at least, no second
time; which Ordinary Cider doth often, upon
change of weather, and upon motion: and
upon every working it grows harder. Do then
thus:</p>
            <p>Choose good Apples. Red streaks are the

fermenting; but not so large a superficies as to
endanger dying, by the airs depredating too

            <p>The drift in both these settlings is, that the
grosser parts consisting of the substance of the

Apple, may settle to the bottom, and be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered

maketh it work again (upon motion or change
of weather) and spoils it. After twenty four hours
draw of it, to see if it be clear, by the settling
of all dregs, above which your spigot must be.
If it be not clear enough, draw it from the
thick dregs into another vessel, and let it settle
there twenty four hours. This vessel must be
less then the first, because you draw not all out
of the first. If then it should not be clear
enough, draw it into a third, yet lesser then
the second; but usually it is at the first. When
it is clear enough draw it into bottles, filling
them within two fingers, which stop close. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

be a danger of their working (which would
break the bottles) you may take out the stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

               </gap>have a thin slice or skim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
of Latton, and with that raise up the thick
Cream, putting your slice under it so nicely,
that you take up no milk with it; and have a
Ladle or Spoon in the other hand to help the
cream upon the slice, which thereby will become
mingled: and lay these parcels of Cream in a
dish, into which you have first put a little raw
Cream, or of that (between Cream and Milk)
that is immediately under the Clouts. To take
the Clouts the more conveniently, you hold a
back of a Ladle or skimming-dish against the
further side of the Clout, that it may not slide
away when the Latton slice shuffeth it on the
other side to get under it, and so the Clout will
mingle together or dubble up, which makes it
the thicker, and the more graceful. When you
have laid a good Laire of Clouts in the dish,
put upon it a little more fresh, raw or boiled-cream,
and then fill it up with the rest of the
Clouts. And when it is ready to serve in, you
may strew a little Sugar upon it, if you will you
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106905:74"/>
may sprinkle in a little Sugar between every
flake or clout of Cream. If you keep the dish
thus laid a day longer before you eat it, the
Cream will grow the thicker and firmer. But if
you keep it, I think it is best to be without
sugar or raw Cream in it, and put them in,
when you are to serve it up. There w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll be a
thin Cream swimming upon the milk of the
Kettle after the Clouts are taken away, which
is very sweet and pleasant to drink. If you
should let your clouts lie longer upon th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
milk, then I have said, before you skim it off,
the Milk underneath would grow sowre, and
spoil the cream above. If you put these clouts
into a Churm with other cream, it w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and roots that are in season. In Spring and
Summer you use Cerfevil, Oseille, Borage,
Bugloss, Pourpier, Lettice, Chicoree and
Cowcombers quartered, &amp;c. The manner of
using them is to boil store of them about half
an hour or a quarter, in a pot by it self, with
some bouillon taken out off the great pot; half
an hour before dinner, take light bread well
dryed from all moisture before the fire; then
cut in slices, laid in a dish over coals, pour
upon it a ladleful of broath, no more then
the bread can presently drink up; which when
it hath done, put on another ladleful, and stew
that, till it be drunk up; repeat this three or
four times, a good quarter of an hour in all, till
the bread is swelled like a gelly (if it be too
long, it will grow glewy and stick to the dish)
and strong of broth; then fill it up near full
with the same strong broth, which having stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

your Capon or other meat upon that, and so

some Bouillon no longer then as if they were

the whole stock a quarter of an hour
after the other hath stewed a quarter of an hour
upon the bread. Sometimes Old-pease boiled
in the broth from the first, to thicken it, but no

piece of the bottom of a Venison Pasty, put in
from the first. Also Venison bones.</p>

stew it, till the bread have drunk up all that
broth, then add a little more, and stew; so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
by little and little, that the bread may
imbibe it and swell: whereas if you drown it
at once, the bread will not swell, and grow
like gelly; and thus you will have a good
potage. You may add Parsley-roots or Leeks,
Cabbage or Endive in the due time before the
broth is ended boiling, and time enough for
them to become tender. In the Summer you
may put in Lettice, Sorrel, Purslane, Borage
and Bugloss, or what other pot-herbs you like.
But green herbs do rob the strength and Vigor
and Cream of the Potage.</p>

very well with as much fine Sugar as is sufficient

sugar, or sugar and Eggs. Thus you have only the

active, penetrative and friendly to nature.

            <p>The Queen Mothers Pressis was thus made.
Take <hi>un Gigot</hi> of Mutton, a piece of Veal, and
a Capon (or half the quantity of each of
these) and put them to rost with convenient
fire, till they are above half rosted, or rather,
till they be two thirds rosted. Then take them
off, and squeese out all their juyce in a press
with screws, and scum all the fat from it, and
put it between two dishes upon a Chafing dish
of Coals to boil a very little, or rather but to
heat well; for by then it is through hot, the
juyce will be ripened enough to drink, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106905:88"/>
before it was raw and bloody; then if
you perceive any fat to remain and swim upon it,
cleanse it away with a Feather. Squeese the
juyce of an Orange (through a holed spoon)
into half a Porrenger full of this, and add a
little Salt, and drink it. The Queen used
this at nights in stead of a Supper; for when
she took this, she did eat nothing else. It is of
great, yet temperate nourishment. If you take
a couple of Partridges in stead of a Capon, it
will be of more nourishment, but hotter.
Great weaknesses and Consumptions have been

ready, made of Crumbs of stale Manchet

to Salt the meat) and a less quantity of White-pepper.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:106905:106"/>
Cover over on both sides all the flesh
with this, pretty thick, pressing it on with your
fingers and flat Knife, to make it lie on. Then
lay the Steaks upon a Gridiron over a very
quick fire (for herein consisteth the well do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
and when the fire hath pierced in a little
on the one side, turn the other, before any
juyce drop down through the Powder. This
turning the steaks will make the juyce run back
the other way; and before it run through, and
drop through this side, you must turn again the
other side: doing so, till the Steaks be broiled
enough. Thus you keep all the juyce in them,
so that when you go to eat them (w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

abundance of juyce runneth out as soon as

so as not to break it, but to loosen
all the flakes within. It is the best way to have
them beaten with hard heavy Ropes. And
though thus beaten, they will keep a long
time, if you put them into Pease-straw, so thrust
in as to keep them from all air, and that they
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:106905:116"/>
touch not one another, but have straw enough
between every fish. When you will make the
best dish of them, take only the tails, and tye
up half a dozen or eight of them with White-thred.
First, they must be laid to soak over
night in cold water. About an hour and half, (or
a little more) before they are to be eaten, put
them to boil in a pot or Pipkin, that you may
cover with a cover of Tin or Letton so close,
that no steam can get out; and lay a stone or
other weight upon it, to keep the cover from
being driven off by the steam of the water. Put
in no more water, then well to cover them.
They must never boil strongly, but very leasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and but simpringly. It will be near half an
hour before the water begin to boil so: And
from their beginning to do so, they must boil a
good hour. You must never put in any new
water, though hot, for that will make the
fish hard. After the hour, take out the fishes,
and untie them, and lay them loose in a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander
with holes to drain out the water, and
toss them in it up and down very well, as you
use to do Butter and Pease; and that will loosen
and break asunder all the flakes, which will
make them the more susceptible of the Butter,
when you stew them in it, and make it pierce
the better into the flakes, and make them ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Then lay them by thin rows in the dish,
they are to be served up in: casting upon every
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106905:116"/>

and at the same time make some thin

dress a good dish full of them, to be

dressing. When you find your Beef is as tender
as can be, and will scacely hold together, to be
taken up together, and that all the other things
are ready, lay the tostes in the dish, where the
Beef is to lye; pour some of the Liquor upon
it. Then lay the Beef upon the tosts; throw

and so let it stand a while well covered

like a gelly. Then serve it up. If you want
Liquor, you may still recruit your self out of
the first Beef-broth, which you keep all to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
any want afterwards. Have a care, whiles it
is stewing, in the Winy-liquor, to lift the flesh
sometimes up from the bottom of the vessel,

to the bottom, and burn; but you cannot take
it out, for it would fall in pieces. It will be

some Marrow, and some Chessnuts, and some

not absolutely necessary, if you will go about

carefully there be no worms in them; and peel
off their upper skin on the tops: the little ones,
peel whole. As you peel them, throw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

to them ten or twelve spoonfuls of water, and

quick-fire, and scum them well all the while,
taking away a great deal of foulness, that will
rise. They will shrink into a very little room.
When they are sufficiently parboiled to be
tender, and well cleansed of their scum, (which
will be in about a quarter of an hour,) take
them out, and put them into a Colander, that

of whole Pepper to it, twenty or thirty Cloves,
one Nutmeg quartered, two or three flakes of
Mace, three Bay-leaves; (some like Limon-Thyme
and Rose-mary; but then it must be a
very little of each) boil all these together, till
the Vinegar be well impraegnated with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients,
which will be in about half an hour.
Then take it from the fire, and let it cool.
When the pickle is quite cold, and the Mush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms

the pickle, and will keep very good half a year.

but a simpring or stewing boiling, which must
continue seven or eight hours. Sometimes he
boileth it half over night, and the rest next

it, you may supply that want thus; When
the Beef is through boiled, you may put so

Coops, wherein every fowl is a part, and not

that, one may be scalding and drying the day, the
other is used, and before every fowl one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is this: Boil Barley in water, till it be tender,
keep some so, and another parcel of it boil with
Milk, and another with strong Ale. Let them be
boiled as wheat that is cried. Use them different
days for variety, to get the fowl appetite. Lay it
in their trough, with some Brown-Sugar mingled
with it. In the partition for Liquor, let them
have water or strong Ale to drink. They will be
very drunk and sleep; then eat again. Let a

which being dissolved and scummed, I put
in the flesh, and in near an hour of temperate

it was enough. When it was cold, it was
store of firm clear red gelly, environing in great
quantity the quarters, that were also very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

by this making, that the juyce of Quinces is not

            <p>The Decoction of the flesh is only good for

            <p>Take Quinces newly from the tree, fair and
sound, wipe them clean, and boil them whole in
a large quantity of water, the more the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better,
and with a quick-fire, till the Quinces crack and
are soft, which will be in a good half hour, or
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:106905:152"/>
an hour. Then take out the Quinces, and press
out their juyce, with your hands hard, or gently
in a press through a strainer, that only the clear
liquor or juyce run out, but none of the pap, or
solid and fleshy substance of the Quince. (The
water, they were boiled in, you may throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.)
This liquor will be slimy and mucilagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
which proceedeth much from the seeds
that remaining within the Quinces, do contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to making this Liquor. Take three pound
of it, and one pound of fine Sugar, and boil them
up to a gelly, with a moderate fire, so that they
boil every where, but not violently. They may
require near an hours boiling to come to a gelly.
The tryal of that is, to take a tin of silver plate,
and wet it with fair-water, and drop a little of
the boiling juyce upon the wet plate; if it stick
to the plate, it is not enough; but if it fall off
(when you sl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pe the Plate) without sticking at
all to it, then is it enough: and then you put it
into flat shallow Tin forms, first wetted with
cold water, and let it stand in them four or five
hours in a cold place, till it be quite cold. Then
reverse the plates, that it may shale and fall out,
and so put the parcels up in boxes.</p>
            <p>Note, you take fountain water, and put the
Quinces into it, both of them being cold. Then
set your kettle to boil with a very quick-fire,
that giveth a clear smart flame to the bottom
of the kettle, which must be uncovered all the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:106905:153"/>
while, that the gelly may prove the whiter; And
so likewise it must be whiles the juyce or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is boiling with the Sugar, which must be the
finest, that it may not need clarifying with an
Egg; but that little scum that riseth at the sides
at the beginning of moderate boiling must be
scummed away. You let your juyce or expression
settle a while, that if any of the thick substance
be come out with it, it may settle to the bottom;
for you are to use for this only the clear juyce:
which to have it the clearer, you may let it run
through a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>large, thin, open, strainer, without
pressing it. When you boil the whole Quinces,
you take them out, to strain them as soon as
their skins crack, and that they are quite soft;
which will not happen to them all at the same
time, but according to their bigness and ripeness.
Therefore first take out and press those, that are
ready first: and the rest still as they grow to a fit
state to press. You shall have more juyce by
pressing the Quinces in a torcular, but it will be
clearer, doing it with your hands; both ways,
you lap them in a strainer.</p>

            <head>Conserve of Red Roses.</head>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Glisson</hi> makes his conserve of red
Roses thus: Boil gently a pound of red Rose
leaves (well picked, and the Nails cut off) in
about a pint and a half (or a little more, as by
discretion you shall judge fit, after having done
it once; The Doctors Apothecary takes two
pints) of Spring water; till the water have
drawn out all the Tincture of the Roses into it
self, and that the leaves be very tender, and look
pale like Linnen; which may be in a good half
hour, or an hour, keeping the pot covered whiles
it boileth, Then pour the tincted Liquor from
the pale Leaves (strain it out, pressing it gently,
so that you may have Liquor enough to dissolve
your Sugar) and set it upon the fire by it self
to boil, putting into it a pound of pure double
refined Sugar in sm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll Powder; which as soon as
it is dissolved, put in a second pound; then a
third, lastly a fourth, so that you have four pound
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:106905:159"/>
of Sugar to every pound of Rose-leaves. (The
Apothecary useth to put all the four pounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Liquor altogether at once,) Boil these
four pounds of Sugar with the tincted Liquor, till
it be a high Syrup, very near a candy height, (as
high as it can be, not to flake or candy) Then
put the pale Rose-leaves into this high Syrup, as
it yet standeth upon the fire, or immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the taking it off the fire, But presently take it
from the fire, and stir them exceeding well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
to mix them uniformly; then let them
stand till they be cold; then pot them up. If
you put up your Conserve into pots, whiles it is
yet throughly warm, and leave them uncovered
some days, putting them in the hot Sun or stove,
there will grow a fine candy upon the top,
which will preserve the conserve without paper
upon it, from moulding, till you break the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
crust, to take out some of the conserve.</p>
            <p>The colour both of the Rose-leaves and the
Syrup about them, will be exceeding beautiful
and red, and the taste excellent; and the whole
very tender and smoothing, and easie to digest in
the stomack without clogging it, as doth the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
rough conserve made of raw Roses beaten
with Sugar, which is very rough in the throat.
The worst of it is, that if you put not a Paper to
lie always close upon the top of the conserve, it
will be apt to grow mouldy there on the top;
especially <hi>aprés que le pot est entamé.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:106905:160"/>
The Conserve of Roses, besides being good
for Colds and Coughs, and for the Lunges, is
exceeding good for sharpness and heat of Urine,
and soreness of the bladder, eaten much by it self,
or drunk with Milk, or distilled water of Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
and Plantaine, or of Milk.</p>

            <head>Another Conserve of Roses.</head>
            <p>Doctor <hi>Bacon</hi> related to me, that Mr. <hi>Minito</hi>
The <hi>Roman</hi> Apothecary, made him some conserve
of Roses, in th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s manner. He took twelve
pounds (of sixteen Ounces to the pound) of
the best lump or kitchin Sugar, and clarified it
very well with whites of Eggs, using Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water
in doing this. He made his reckoning,
that his twelve pound of Sugar, came to be but
nine pound, when all the scum was taken away,
and the Sugar perfectly clarified. Boil it then
to a Syrup, and when it is about half boiled, go
roundly about your Rose-leaves. They must be
picked and the white nails cut off before-hand;
but begin not to beat them before your Syrup
is half boiled. Then put thirty Ounces (which
is two pound and an half of Roses to
every pound of such Sugar) of your Red-Roses into
the Mortar, and beat them well, squeesing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, as you beat them, some of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilest
and best part (which comes out first) of
about two Limons, which brings out their
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:106905:160"/>
colour finely. You must have finished beating
your Roses, by then the Sugar is come by boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a high Syrup (for if you should let them

               </gap>ll in the Air, but a little while, they would
grow black, and of ill colour) then with your
ladle put the Roses to the Sugar, and stir them
very well in it, to Incorporate all well and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
together. So let them boil on gently
(for all thi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> while you take not your preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
pan from the fire, and a thick scum of the
Roses will rise, which you scum off from time
to time continually as it comes up, and reserve
this in a pot by it self, for it will be good hard
Sugar of Roses, and may be about an eight or
ninth part of the whole. After it is clear from
scum, and hath boiled near a quarter of an hour
with the Roses in it, and that you see by a drop
upon a plate, that it is of a due consistence; take
your pan from the fire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and stir all very well to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it into pots, which leave unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
during ten or twelve days, setting them in
the hot strong Sun all the day long during that
time, to give the Roses a fine hard crust or
candy at the top; but under it, in the substance
of the matter, it will be like a fine clear Syrupy
gelly. If the Sun favour you not, then you
may use a stove. After twelve days, tie covers of Paper,
upon the pots.</p>
