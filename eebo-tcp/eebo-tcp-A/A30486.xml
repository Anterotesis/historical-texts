            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have read over Mr. <hi>Er. Warren</hi>'s Defence
of his Exceptions against <hi>the Theory of
the Earth:</hi> which, it may be, few will do
after me; as not having curiosity or
patience enough, to read such a long
Pamphlet, of private or little use. Such altercations
as these, are to you, I believe, as they are to me, a
sort of folly; but the Aggressor must answer for that,
who makes the trouble inavoidable to the Defendant.
And 'tis an unpleasant exercise: a kind of Wild-goose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase;
where he that leads must be followed, through
all his extravagances.</p>
                  <p>The Author of this Defence must pardon me, if I
have less apprehensions both of his judgment and
temper, than I had before. For, as he is too verbose
and long-winded ever to make a close reasoner: So it
was unexpected to me to find his style so captious and
angry, as it is in this last paper. And the same strain
continuing to the end, I was sorry to see that his
bloud had been kept upon the fret, for so many
months together, as the Pamphlet was a-making.</p>
                  <p>He might have made his work much shorter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any loss to the Sence. If he had left out his
popular enlargements, juvenile excursions, stories and
strains of Country-Rhetorick, (whereof we shall give
you some instances hereafter) his Book would have
been reduc'd to half the compass. And if from that
reduc'd half; you take away again trifling altercations
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104274:2"/>
and pedantick repartees, the remainder would fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the compass of a few pages. For my part, I am
always apt to suspect a man that makes me a long
answer: for the precise point to be spoken to, in a
multitude of words is easily lost: and words are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
multiplied for that very purpose.</p>
                  <p>However if his humour be verbose, it might have
been, at least, more easie and inoffensive: there having
been no provocation given him in that kind. But let
us guess, if you please, as well as we can, what it was
in the late Answer, that so much discomposed the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
and altered his style. Either it must be the
words and language of that Answer: or the Sence of
it, without respect to the Language. As to the Words,
'tis true, he gives some instances of expressions offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
to him; yet they are but three or four, and those
methinks,<note place="margin">P. 31.</note> not very high: tho' he calls them <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>of passion;</hi> they are these <hi>indiscreet, rude, injudicious,</hi>
and <hi>uncharitable.</hi> These characters, it seems, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the Excepter, in some part of the answer,
upon occasion offer'd. And whether those occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
were just or no, I dare appeal to your judgement.
As to the word <hi>Rude,</hi> which seems the most harsh,
I had said indeed, that he was <hi>rude</hi> to <hi>Anaxagoras:</hi> and
so he was, not to allow him to be a competent wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in matter of fact, whom all Antiquity, sacred and
prophane, hath represented to us as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
men amongst the ancients. I had also said in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place, that, <hi>a rude,</hi> and <hi>injudicious defence of
Scripture</hi> by <hi>railing and ill language,</hi> is the <hi>true way to
lessen and disparage it.</hi> This I still justifie as true, and
if he apply it to himself, much good may it do him.
I do not remember that it is any where said that he
was <hi>rude</hi> to the Theorist; if it be, 'tis possibly upon
occasion of his charging him with <hi>Blasphemy, horrid
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost,</hi> for saying, <hi>the Earth
was dissolv'd at the Deluge.</hi> And I appeal to any man,
whether this is not an <hi>uncharitable,</hi> and a <hi>rude</hi> charge.
If a man had cursed God, or call'd our Saviour an
Impostor, what could he have been charg'd with more,
than <hi>Blasphemy, horrid blasphemy?</hi> And if the same
things be charg'd upon a man, for saying, the Earth
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104274:2"/>
was dissolv'd at the Deluge, either all crimes and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
must be equal, or the change must be rude. But
however it must be rude in the opinion of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist,
who thinks this neither crime nor error.</p>
                  <p>What says the <hi>Defence</hi> of the Exceptions to this?<note place="margin">p. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note>
It makes use of distinctions for mitigation of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
and says, it will <hi>indirectly, consequentially,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductively,
be of blasphemous importance.</hi> Here blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
is changed into <hi>blasphemous importance,</hi> and <hi>horrid
blasphemy</hi> into <hi>consequential, &amp;c.</hi> But taking all these
mitigations, it seems however, according to his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology,
all errors in Religion are <hi>blasphemy,</hi> or of <hi>bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous
importance.</hi> For all errors in Religion must
be against Scripture one way or other: at least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequentially,
indirectly, or reductively: and all that
are so, according to the doctrine of this Author, must
be <hi>blasphemy</hi> or of <hi>blasphemous importance.</hi> This is
crude Divinity, and the Answer had reason to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
what we cited before, That, a rude and injudicious
defence of Scripture, is the true way to lessen and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage it.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>uncharitable:</hi> as for the
other two words, <hi>indiscreet</hi> and <hi>injudicious,</hi> I cannot
easily be induc'd to make any apology for them. On
the contrary, I'm afraid, I shall have occasion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
these characters again, especially the latter of
them, in the perusal of this Pamphlet. However they
do not look like <hi>brats of passion,</hi> as he calls them: but
rather as cool and quiet judgments, made upon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and premises. I had forgot one expression more.
The answer, it seems, somewhere calls the Excepter a
<hi>Dabbler</hi> in <hi>Philosophy,</hi> which he takes ill. But that he
is a dabbler, both in Philosophy and Astronomy, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
will evidently appear upon this second examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the same passages upon which that Character
was grounded. We will therefore leave that to the
trial, when we come to those passages again, in the
following discourse.</p>
                  <p>These, <hi>Sir,</hi> as far as I remember, are the words and
expressions which he hath taken notice of, as offensive
to him, and effects of passion. But, methinks, these
cannot be of force sufficient to put him so much out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104274:3"/>
of humour, and change his style so much, as we find
it to be in this last Pamphlet. And therefore I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable
to believe, that 'tis the sence rather, than the
words or language of the Answer, that hath had this
effect upon him: and that some unhappy passages,
that have expos'd his mistakes, were the true causes
of these resentments. Such passages I will guess at, as
well as I can, and note them to you as they occur to
my memory.</p>
                  <p>But give me leave first, upon this occasion of his
new way of writing, to distinguish and mind you of
three sorts of arguing, which you may call, <hi>Reasoning,
wrangling,</hi> and <hi>scolding.</hi> In fair reasoning, regard is
had to Truth only, not to Victory: let it fall on whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side it will. But in wrangling and scolding, 'tis
victory that is pursued and aim'd at in the first place,
with little regard to truth. And if the contention be
manag'd in civil terms, 'tis but wrangling: if in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil,
'tis scolding. I will not so far anticipate your
judgment as to rank this Arguer in any of the three
orders: if you have patience to read over his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet,
you will best see how and where to set him in
his proper place.</p>
                  <p>We now proceed to those passages in the answer,
which probably have most exasperated the Author of
the Exceptions and the Defence.<note place="margin">Exe. p. 77. &amp;c.</note>
In his Exceptions he had said, The Moon being present, or in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
place in the Firmament, at the time of the Chaos,
she would certainly trouble and discompose it, as she
does now the waters of the Sea: and, by that means,
hinder the formation of the Earth. To this we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd,
that <hi>the Moon that was made the 4th. day, could
not hinder the formation of the Earth, which was made the
3d. day.</hi> This was a plain intelligible answer: and at
the same time discover'd such a manifest blunder in
the objection, as could not but give an uneasie thought
to him that made it.</p>
                  <p>However we must not deny, but that he makes some
attempt to shift it off in his Reply:<note place="margin">Def. p. 12.</note> For he says, <hi>the
Earth formed the 3d. day, was Moses's Earth, which the
Excepter contends for: but the Earth he disputes against,
is the Theorist's, which could not be formed the 3d. day.</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104274:3"/>
He should have added, and therefore <hi>would be hinder'd
by the Moon:</hi> otherwise this takes off nothing. And
now the question comes to a clear state: for when the
Excepter says, the Moon would have hinder'd the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Earth, either he speaks upon <hi>Moses</hi>'s hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,
or upon the Theorist's hypothesis. Not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Theorist's Hypothesis,<note place="margin">Ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. p. 77, 78.</note> for the Theorist does not
suppose the Moon present then. And if he speaks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<hi>Moses</hi>'s Hypothesis,<note place="margin">Def. p. 73. lin. 12, 13.</note> the Moon that was made the
<hi>4th.</hi> day, must have hinder'd the formation of the Earth
the <hi>3d.</hi> day. So that the objection is a blunder upon
either Hypothesis.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, whereas he suggests that the Answerer
makes use of <hi>Moses</hi>'s hypothesis to confute his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
but does not follow it himself: 'Tis so far true,
that the Theorist never said that <hi>Moses</hi>'s six-days Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was to be understood literally, but however it is
justly urg'd against those that understand it literally,
and they must not contradict that interpretation
which they own and defend.</p>
                  <p>So much for the Moon, and this first passage, which
I suppose was troublesome to our Author. But he
makes the same blunder, in another place, as to the
<hi>Sun.</hi> Both the Luminaries, it seems, stood in his way.
In the <hi>10th.</hi> Chapter of his Exceptions, he gives us a
new Hypothesis about the <hi>Origin of Mountains:</hi> which,
in short, is this, that they were drawn or suckt out of
the Earth by the influence and instrumentality of the
Sun. Whereas the Sun was not made, according to
<hi>Moses,</hi> till the <hi>4th.</hi> day, and the Earth was form'd the
<hi>3d.</hi> day. 'Tis an unhappy thing to split twice upon
the same rock, and upon a rock so visible. He that
can but reckon to four, can tell whether the <hi>3d.</hi> day,
or <hi>4th.</hi> day, came sooner.</p>
                  <p>To cure this Hypothesis about the <hi>Origin of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 97, 98, 99<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 100, 101<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> he takes great pains in his <hi>Defence,</hi> and attempts
to do it chiefly by help of a distinction: dividing
Mountains into <hi>Maritime</hi> and <hi>Inland.</hi> Now 'tis true,
says he, <hi>These maritime Mountains, and such as were made
with the hollow of the Sea, must rise when that was sunk or
deprest:</hi> namely, the <hi>3d.</hi> day. Yet Inland ones, he says,
might be raised some earlier, and some later: and by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104274:4"/>
the influence of the Sun. This is a weak and vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
to defend his notion; for, besides that this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction
of <hi>Maritime</hi> and <hi>Inland Mountains,</hi> as arising
from different causes, and at different times, is without
any ground, either in Scripture or reason: if their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
origin was admitted, the Sun's extracting these
Inland Mountains out of the Earth, would still be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
and incongruous upon other accounts.</p>
                  <p>Scripture, I say, makes no such distinction of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
made at different times and from different cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
This is plain, seeing <hi>Moses</hi> does not mention Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
at all in his six-days Creation: nor any where
else, till the Deluge. What authority have we then
to make this distinction: or to suppose that all the
great Mountains of the Earth were not made toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Besides, what length of time would you require,
for the production of these Inland Mountains? were
they not all made within the six-days Creation? hear
what <hi>Moses</hi> says at the end of the <hi>6th.</hi> day. <hi>Thus the
Heavens and the Earth were finished,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. c. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and all the host of
them. And on the 7th. day, God ended his work which he
had made.</hi> Now if the Excepter say, that the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
were all made within these six-days, we will not
stand with him for a day or two: for that would
make little difference as to the action of the Sun. But
if he will not confine their production to <hi>Moses</hi>'s six
days, how does he keep to the Mosaical Hypothesis?
or how shall we know where he will stop, in his own
way? for if they were not made within the six days,
for any thing he knows, they might not be made till
the Deluge; seeing Scripture no where mentions
Mountains before the Flood.</p>
                  <p>And as Scripture makes no distinction of Maritime
and Inland Mountains, so neither hath this distinction
any foundation in Nature or Reason. For there is no
apparent or discernible difference betwixt Maritime
and Inland Mountains, nor any reason why they
should be thought to proceed from different causes,
or to be rais'd at different times. The Maritime
Mountains are as rocky, as ruderous, and as irregular
and various in their shape and posture, as the Inland
Mountains. They have no distinctive characters, nor
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104274:4"/>
any different properties, internal or external: in their
matter, form, or composition: that can give us any
ground to believe, that they came from a different
Original. So that this distinction is meerly precarious,
neither founded in Scripture nor reason: but made
for the nonce to serve a turn.</p>
                  <p>Besides, what bounds will you give to these Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Mountains? are they distinguisht from Inland
Mountains barely by their distance from the Sea, or
by some other Character? If barely by distance, tell
us then how far from the Sea do the Maritime Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
reach, and where do the Inland begin, and how
shall we know the <hi>Terminalis Lapis?</hi> Especially in a
continued chain of Mountains, that reach from the
Sea many hundreds of miles Inland: as the <hi>Alpes</hi> from
the Ocean to <hi>Pontus Euxinus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

fifteen hundred miles in length, from the <hi>Chinese</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean
to the Sea of <hi>Pamphylia.</hi> In such an uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Ridge of Mountains, where do the Land-Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
end, and the Sea-mountains begin? Or what mark
is there, whereby we may know that they are not all
of the same race, or do not all spring from the same
original? Such obvious enquiries as these, shew suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently,
that the distinction is meerly arbitrary and ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
                  <p>But suppose this distinction was admitted, and the
Maritime Mountains made the <hi>3d.</hi> day, but Inland
Mountains I know not when: the great difficulty still
remains, <hi>How</hi> the Sun rear'd up these Inland Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
afterwards. Or if his power be sufficient for such
effects, why have we not Mountains made still to this
day? seeing our Mountain-maker the Sun is still in the
Firmament, and seems to be as busie at work, as ever.
The <hi>Defender</hi> hath made some answer to this question,<note place="margin">Def. p. 99.</note>
in these words, <hi>The question is put, why have we no Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
made now? It might as well have been askt,</hi> says he,
<hi>why does not the fire make a dough-bak'd loaf swell and <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uff
up?</hi> And, he says, <hi>this answer must be satisfactory to the
question propounded.</hi> It must be, that is, for want of a
better: for otherwise this Dowe-comparison is unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory
upon many accounts. First, there was no
ferment in the Earth, as in this Dowe-cake: at least it
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104274:5"/>
is not prov'd, or made appear, that there was any.
Nay, in the <hi>Exceptions,</hi> when this Hypothesis was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd,
there was no mention at all made of any fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or leaven in the Earth: but the effect was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imputed to <hi>Vapors</hi> and the <hi>Sun.</hi> But to supply their
defects, he now ventures to add the word <hi>fermentive,</hi>
as he calls it.<note place="margin">Ibid <hi>lin.</hi> 19.</note> A <hi>fermentive, flatulent principle,</hi> which
heav'd up the Earth, as Leaven does Dowe. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
that this is a meer groundless and gross Postula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
to suppose any such leaven in the Earth; if there
had been such a principle, it would have swoln the
whole mass uniformly, heav'd up the exterior region
of the Earth every where, and so not made Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
but a swoln bloated Globe.</p>
                  <p>This Sir, is a <hi>2d.</hi> passage, which I thought might
make the Defender uneasie. We proceed now to a
<hi>3d.</hi> and <hi>4th.</hi> in his Geography and Astronomy. In
the <hi>14th.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 289.</note> 
                     <hi>Chapter</hi> of his <hi>Exceptions,</hi> speaking of the
change of the situation of the Earth, from a right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
to an oblique, he says, <hi>according to the Theory, the
Ecliptick in the Primitive Earth, was its Equinoctical now.</hi>
This, he is told by the Answer, is a great mistake;
namely, to think that the <hi>Earth, when it chang'd its si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
chang'd its poles and circles.</hi> What is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
to this? <hi>He speaks against a change,</hi> says the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
<hi>in the poles and circles of the Earth; A needless
trouble, and occasion'd by his own oversight. For had he
but lookt into the Errata's, he might have seen there, that
these parentheses, upon which he grounded what he says,
should have been left out.</hi> So this is acknowledg'd an
<hi>Erratum,</hi> it seems, but an <hi>erratum Typographicum;</hi> not

Parentheses, and the sentence stands thus, <hi>For under the

according to the Theory, was its Equinoctial: and divided
the Globe into two Hemispheres, as the Equator does now.
The dry ground, &amp;c.</hi> How does this alter or mend the
sence? It is not still as plainly affirm'd, as before, that,
according to the Theory, the Ecliptick in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

is suppos'd throughout all this Paragraph.<note place="margin">Ex<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

'tis down-right ignorance or a gross mistake in the

                  <p>And this leads me to a <hi>4th.</hi> passage, much-what of
the same nature, where he would have the Earth to
have been translated out of the Aequator into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick,
and to have chang'd the line of its motion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Sun, when it chang'd its situation. His words

                     <hi>So that in her annual motion about the Sun, she,</hi>
namely, the Earth before her change of situation, <hi>was
carried directly under the Equinoctial.</hi> This is his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake.
The Earth mov'd in the Ecliptick, both before
and after her change of situation: for the change was
not made in the Circle of her motion about the Sun,
but in her posture or inclination in the same Circle.
Whereas he supposes that the <hi>shifted both posture,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 159.</note> 
                     <hi>and
also her circuit about the Sun,</hi> as his words are in the
next paragraph. But we shall have occasion to reflect
upon this again in its proper place. We proceed now
to another Astronomical mistake.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>5th.</hi> passage, which probably might disquiet him,
is his false argumentation at the end of the <hi>8th.</hi> chap.
concerning <hi>Days</hi> and <hi>Months.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exc. p. 187.</note> He says there, if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
days were longer towards the Flood, than at first:
(which no body however affirms) fewer than thirty
would have made a month: whereas the duration of
the Flood is computed by months consisting of thirty
days a-piece: <hi>therefore,</hi> says he, <hi>they were no longer
than ordinary.</hi> This argumentation the <hi>Answer</hi> told
him, <hi>was a meer paralogism, or a meer blunder.</hi> For 30
days are 30 days, whether they are longer or shorter:
and Scripture does not determine the length of the
days. There are several pages spent in the <hi>Defence,</hi> to
get off this blunder:<note place="margin">P. 78, 79, 80, 81.</note> Let's here how he begins: <hi>Tho'
Scripture does not limit or account for the length of days
expresly, yet it does it implicitly, and withal very plainly
and intelligibly.</hi> This is deny'd, and if he make this
out, that Scripture does very <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>intelligibly</hi>
determine the length of days at the Deluge, and makes
them equal with ours at present, then, I acknowledge,
he hath remov'd the blunder: otherwise it stands the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104274:6"/>
same, unmov'd and unmended. Now observe how he
makes this out; <hi>For,</hi> says he, <hi>Scripture gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that days before the Flood were of the same length
that they are of now, BY INFORMING VS, that months
and years, which were of the same length then, that they are
of at present, were made up of the same number of days.</hi> Here
the blunder is still continued, or, at best, it is but trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
from days to months, or from months to years.
He says, <hi>Scripture informs us that months and years were
of the same length then, that they are of at present.</hi> If he
mean by the <hi>same length,</hi> the same <hi>number of days,</hi> he
relapses into the old blunder, and we still require the
length of those days. But if Scripture informs us that
the months and years at the Flood, were of the same
length that they are of now, according to any abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
and known measure, distinct from the <hi>number of
days,</hi> then the blunder is sav'd. Let's see therefore by
whether of these two ways he proves it in the next
words, which are these, <hi>For how could there be just 12
months in the year, at the time of the Deluge: and 30
days in each of those months, if days then had not consisted,
as they do now, of 24 hours a piece.</hi> We allow a day might
then consist of 24 hours, if the distinction of hours
was so ancient. But what then, the question returns
concerning the length of those <hi>hours</hi> as it was before
concerning the length of the <hi>days:</hi> and this is either
<hi>idem per idem,</hi> or the same error in another instance.
If you put but <hi>hours</hi> in the place of <hi>days,</hi> the words of
the <hi>Answer</hi> have still the same force: <hi>Twenty four hours
were to go to a day, whether the hours were longer or shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
and Scripture does not determine the length of the
hours.</hi> This, you see, is still the same case, and the same
paralogism hangs upon both instances.</p>
                  <p>But he goes on still in this false tract, in these words:
<hi>And as Providence hath so ordered nature, that days (that
depend upon its diurnal motion) should be measur'd by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgyrations
of the Earth.—So it hath taken care that
each of these circumrotations should be performed in 24
hours: and consequently that every day should be just so
long that 30 of them (in way of round reckoning) might
compleat a month.</hi> Admit all this, that 30 days com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
a month. Still if Scripture hath not determin'd
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:104274:6"/>
the length of those days, nor the slowness or swiftness
of the circumgyrations that make them, it hath not
determin'd to us the length of those months, nor of
the years that depend upon them. This one would
take to be very intelligible: yet he goes on still in
the same maze, thus, <hi>But now had the circumgyrations of
the Earth grown more slow towards the Deluge (by such
causes as the Excepter suggested) so as every day had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of 30 hours, &amp;c.</hi> But how so, I pray? This is a
wild step: why 30 hours? where does Scripture say so:
or where does the Theorist say so? We say the Day
consisted then as now of 24 hours, whether the hours
were longer or shorter: and that Scripture hath not
determin'd the length of those hours, nor consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of those days, nor consequently of those months, nor
consequently of those years. So, after all this a-do, we
are just where we were at first, namely, That Scripture
not having determin'd the absolute length of any one,
you cannot by that determine the length of any other.
And by his shifting and multiplying instances, he does
but <hi>absurda absurdis accumulare, ne perpluant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We offer'd before, in our Answer, to give the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
some light into his mistake: by distinguishing in
these things, what is <hi>absolute</hi> from what is <hi>relative:</hi> the
former whereof, cannot, under these or any such like
circumstances, be determin'd by the latter. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
A man hath ten children, and he will not say
absolutely and determinately what portion he will
give with any one of them: but he says, I will give
my eldest child a tenth part more than my <hi>2d,</hi> and my
second a <hi>9th.</hi> part more than my <hi>3d,</hi> and my third
an <hi>8th.</hi> part more than my <hi>4th;</hi> and so downwards in
proportion, to the youngest. Not telling you, in any
absolute sum, what money he will give the youngest,
or any other: you cannot by this tell what portion
the man will give with any of his children. I leave
you to apply this, and proceed to a nearer instance,
by comparing the measures of <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Longitude.</hi> If
you know how many inches make a foot, how many
feet a pace, how many paces a mile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> you cannot by
these numbers determine the absolute quantity of any
one of the foresaid measures, but only their relative
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104274:7"/>
quantity as to one another. So if Scripture had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd,
of how many hours a Day consisted: of how
many days a Month: of how many months a Year:
you could not by this alone determine the absolute
duration or quantity of any one of these, nor whether
they were longer or shorter than our present hours,
days, months, or years. And therefore, I say still, as
I said at first, 30 days are 30 days, whether they are
longer or shorter: and 30 circumgyrations of the Earth,
are 30, whether they be slower or swifter. And that
no Scripture-proof can be made from this, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
or consequentially, that the days before the
Flood, were or were not, longer than they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
But we have been too long upon this head.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now from his Astronomy to his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy.<note place="margin">P. 38.</note>
'Twas observ'd in the <hi>Answer,</hi> that the Excepter
in the beginning of the <hi>9th. Chap.</hi> suppos'd Terrestrial
Bodies to have a <hi>nitency inwards, or downwards towards the
Center.</hi> This we noted as a false principle in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
and to rectifie his mistake, he now replyes, That
he understood that expression only of <hi>self-central</hi> and
<hi>quiescent Bodies.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. 82.</note> Whereas in truth, the question he was
speaking to, was about a fluid Body turning upon its
Axis. But however let us admit his new sence, his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
I'm afraid, will still need rectification; namely, he
affirms now, that <hi>Quiescent Earthly Bodies are impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a nitency inward, or downward towards the Center.</hi>
I deny also this reform'd principle; if Bodies be turn'd
round, they have a nitency upwards, or from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their motion. If they be not turn'd round, nor
mov'd, but quiescent, they have no nitency at all, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upwards nor downwards: but are indifferent to
all lines of motion, according as an external impulse
shall carry them, this way or that way. So that his
<hi>impregnation with a nitency downwards,</hi> is an occult and
fictitious quality, which is not in the nature of Bodies,
whether in motion or in rest. The truth is, The Author
of the Exceptions makes a great flutter about the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian
Philosophy,</hi> and the <hi>Copernican Systeme,</hi> but the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
mistakes he commits in both, give a just suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
that he understands neither.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, we come to the grand discovery of a <hi>Fifteen-Cubit-Deluge,</hi>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:104274:7"/>
which, it may be, was as uneasie to him
upon second thoughts, as any of the rest: at least one
would guess so, by the changes he hath made in his
Hypothesis. For he hath now, in this <hi>Defence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 181, 182.</note> reduc'd the
Deluge to a destruction of the world by <hi>Famine,</hi> rather
than by <hi>drowning.</hi> I do not remember in Scripture any
mention made of <hi>Famine</hi> in that great judgment of water
brought upon mankind, but he thinks he hath found
out something that favours his opinion: namely, <hi>that
a good part of mankind at the Deluge, were not drown'd,
but starv'd for want of victuals.</hi> And the argument is this,
because in the story of the Deluge, men are not said
to be <hi>drown'd,</hi> but to <hi>perish, die</hi> or be <hi>destroy'd.</hi> But are
they said any where in the story of the Deluge, to have
been <hi>famish'd?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 17.</note> And when God says to <hi>Noah, I will bring a slood of waters upon the Earth, to destroy all flesh,</hi> Does
it not plainly signifie, that that destruction should be
by <hi>drowning?</hi> But however let us hear our Author:
when he had been making use of this new Hypothesis
of <hi>starving,</hi> to take off some arguments urged against
his fifteen-cubit Deluge (particularly, that it would
not be sufficient to destroy all mankind) he adds these
words by way of proof.<note place="margin">Def. p. 182.</note> 
                     <hi>And methinks there is one thing
which seems to insinuate, that a good part of the Animal
world might perhaps come to an end thus: by being driven
to such streights by the over flowing waters, as to be FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MISHT
or STARV'D to death. The thing is this, in
the story of the Deluge, it is no where said of men and living
creatures, that they were drown'd, but they dyed, or were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</hi>
Those that are <hi>drown'd</hi> are destroy'd, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
as well as those that are <hi>starv'd:</hi> so this proves
nothing. But that the destruction here spoken of, was
by drowning, seems plain enough, both from God's
words to <hi>Noah</hi> before the Flood, and by his words af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Flood, when he makes his Covenant with <hi>Noah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
in this manner:<note place="margin">Gen. 9. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>I will establish my Covenant with you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a
Flood.</hi> Now to be cut off, or destroy'd by the waters
of a Flood, is, methinks, to be drown'd. And I take <hi>all
flesh</hi> to comprehend the Animal World, or at least,
all mankind. Accordingly our Saviour says, <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. 39.
in <hi>Noah</hi>'s time, <hi>the flood came, and took them all away:</hi>
namely, all mankind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:104274:8"/>
This is one Expedient our Author hath found out,
to help to bear off the inconveniences that attend his
fifteen-cubit Deluge: namely, by converting a good
part of it into a <hi>Famine.</hi> But he hath another Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to joyn to this, by increasing the Waters: and
that is done, by making the <hi>Common Surface</hi> of the
Earth, or the <hi>highest parts</hi> of it,
as he calls them, to
signifie ambiguously,<note place="margin">Def. 165. &amp; 180.</note> or any height that pleases him;
and consequently fifteen Cubits above that, signifies
also what height he thinks fit. But in reality, there is
no surface common to the Earth, but either the <hi>exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
surface,</hi> whether it be high or low: or the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
level</hi> of the Earth, as it is a Globe or convex Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
If by his <hi>common surface</hi> he mean the <hi>exteriour sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi>
that takes in Mountains as well as Low-lands, or
any other superficial parts of the Earth. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if the Deluge was fifteen Cubits above this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
surface, it was fifteen Cubits above the highest
Mountains, as we say it was. But if by the common
surface he mean the common level of the Earth, as it
is a Globular or convex Body, then we gave it a right
name when we call'd it the <hi>ordinary level</hi> of the Earth:
namely, that level or surface that lies in an equal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity
with the surface of the Sea. And his fifteen
Cubits of water from that level, would never drown
the World. Lastly, If by the common surface of the
Earth, he understand a <hi>3d.</hi> surface, different from both
these, he must define it, and define the height of it:
that we may know how far this fifteen-cubit Deluge
rise, from some known basis. One known basis is the
surface of the Sea, and that surface of the Land that
lies in an equal convexity with it: tell us then if the
waters of the Deluge were but fifteen Cubits higher
than the surface of the Sea, that we may know their
height by some certain and determinate measure, and
upon that examine the Hypothesis. But to tell us they
were fifteen Cubits above, not the Mountains or the
Hills, but the Highlands, or the <hi>highest parts of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
surface of the Earth,</hi> and not to tell us the height of
these highest parts from any known basis: nor how
they are distinguisht from Hills and Mountains, which
incur our sences, and are the measures given us by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:104274:8"/>
                     <hi>Moses:</hi> This, I say, is but to cover his Hypothesis with
ambiguities, when he had made it without grounds:
and to leave room to set his Water-mark higher or
lower, as he should see occasion or necessity. And of
this indeed we have an instance in this land Pamphlet,
for he has rais'd his Water-mark there, more than an
hundred Cubits higher than it was before. In his <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions</hi>
he said,<note place="margin">P. 300.</note> 
                     <hi>not that the waters were no where higher
than just fifteen Cubits,</hi> above the ground, they might
in most places be <hi>thirty, forty,</hi> or <hi>fifty Cubits higher.</hi>
But in his <hi>Defence</hi> he says,<note place="margin">P. 180.</note> the Waters might be an
<hi>hundred</hi> or <hi>two hundred</hi> Cubits higher, than the <hi>general
ordinary plain</hi> of the Earth. Now what security have
we, but that in the next Pamphlet, they may be 500
or a 1000 Cubits higher than the ordinary surface of
the Earth.</p>
                  <p>This is his <hi>2d.</hi> Expedient, raising his Water-mark
indefinitely. But if these two methods be not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to destroy Mankind, and the animate World, he
hath yet a third, which cannot fail: and that is, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
them by Evil Angels.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. 90.</note> 
                     <hi>Flectere si nequeo.</hi> This
is his last refuge; to which purpose he hath these
words, <hi>When Heaven was pleas'd to give Satan leave, he
caus'd the fire to consume</hi> Job's <hi>sheep, and caused the wind
to destroy his Children. And how easily could these spirits,
that are ministers of God's vengeance, have made the waters
of the Flood fatal to those Creatures that might have esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
them, if any could have done it?</hi> As suppose an Eagle,
or a Faulcon: The Devil and his crue catcht them all,
and held their moses under water. However, methinks,
this is not fair play, to deny the Theorist the liberty
to make use of the ministery of <hi>good Angels,</hi> when he
himself makes use of <hi>evil Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These, Sir, and such like passages, where the notions
of the Excepter have been expos'd, were the causes, I
imagine, of his angry reply. Some Creatures, you
know, are more fierce after they are wounded: and
some upon a gentle chase will fly from you, but if you
press them and put them to extremities, they turn
and fly in your face. I see by our Author's example,
how easily, in these personal altercations, reasoning
degenerates into wrangling, and wrangling into scold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:104274:9"/>
However, if I may judge from these two Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses
which he hath made, about the <hi>rise of Mountains,</hi>
and a <hi>fifteen-cubit Deluge,</hi> of all trades I should never
advise him to turn <hi>Hypothesis-maker.</hi> It does not seem
at all to lie to his hand, and things never thrive that
are undertaken, <hi>Diis iratis, genioque sinistro.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as we have given you some account of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Philosophical notions, so it may be you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
that we should entertain you with some pieces of
his wit and eloquence. The truth is, he seems to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and value himself upon a certain kind of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-wit
and popular eloquence, and I will not grudge
you the pleasure of enjoying them both, in such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
as I remember. Speaking in contempt of the
Theory and the Answer, (which is one great subject
of his wit) he expresses himself thus: <hi>But if arguments
be so weak,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>that they will fall with a fillip, why should grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
force be used to beat them down? To draw a Rapier to
stab a Fly; or to charge a Pistol to kill a Spider; I think
would be preposterous.</hi> I think so too, in this we're a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed.
In another place, being angry with the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,
that he would not acknowledge his errours to
him, he hath these words, <hi>'Tis unlucky for one to run his
head against a post:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 108.</note> 
                     <hi>But when he hath done, if he will say
he did not do it, and stand in and defend what he says:
'tis a sign he is as senceless as he was unfortunate: and is
fitter to be pitied than confuted.</hi> This wit, it may be,
you'll say, is downright clownery. The truth is, when
I observ'd, in reading his Pamphlet, the courseness of
his repartees, and of that sort of wit wherein he deals
most and pleases himself, it often rais'd in my mind,
whether I would or no, the Idea of a <hi>Pedant:</hi> Of one
that had seen little of the World, and thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
much wittier and wiser than others would take
him to be. I will give you but one Instance more of
his rustical wit: Telling the Theorist of an itch of
writing:<note place="margin">P. 214.</note> 
                     <hi>Methinks,</hi> says he, <hi>he might have laid that pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rient
humour, by scratching himself with the briars of a
more innocent controversie: or by SCRVBBING
SOVNDLY against something else than the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</hi>
He speaks very sensibly, as if he understood
the disease, and the way of dealing with it. But I
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104274:9"/>
think <hi>Holy Scripture</hi> does not come in well upon that
occasion.</p>
                  <p>All this is nothing, Sir, in comparison of his popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
eloquence. See with what alacrity he runs it off
hand, in a similitude betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and a Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
of a County.<note place="margin">P. 113.</note> 
                     <hi>When the King makes a Gentleman
Lord-Lieutenant of a County, by virtue of his Commission is
he presently the strongest man that is in it? Does it enable
him to encounter whole Regiments of Souldiers in his single
person? Does it impower him to carry a Cannon upon his
neck? Or when the great Gun is fir'd off, to catch the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
as it flies, and put it up in his Pocket? So when God
gave</hi> Adam <hi>dominion over the Fowls, did he mean that
he should dive like a Duck, or soar like a Falcon? that
he should swim as naturally as the Swan, and hunt the
Kite, or Hobby, as Boys do the Wren? Did he mean that he
should hang up Ostritches in a Cage, as people do Linnets:
or fetch down the Eagles to feed with his Pullen, and make
them perch with his Chickens in the Henroost?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So much for the Fowls, now for the Fish. When
God <hi>gave Adam dominion over the Sea,</hi>

in a Ship from</hi> Dover <hi>to</hi> Calis, <hi>by a brisk gale out of a pair

not be grievously perjur'd persons?—Or if the Historian
that writes the Peloponnesian war, had told that the Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
who fell in it, fought only with Sun beams, and single
Currants which grew thereabouts, and that hundreds and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:104274:10"/>
thousands were stabb'd with the one, and knock'd on the
head with the other: who would believe that ever there
were such weapons in that war; that ever there was such a
fatal war in that Country? even so,</hi> &amp;c. These, Sir, are
flights and reaches of his Pen, which I dare not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
but leave them to your judgment.</p>
                  <p>Thus much is to give you a tast only of his wit and
eloquence: and if you like it, you may find more of
the same strain, here and there, in his writings. I have
only one thing to mind him of, <hi>That</hi> he was desir'd by
the Theorist to <hi>write in Latin (if he was a Scholar) as
being more proper for a subject of this nature.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eng. Theo. p. 287.</note> If he had
own'd and followed that character, I'm apt to think
it would have prevented a great many impertinencies:
His tongue probably would not have been so flippant
in popular excursions and declamations, as we now
find it. Neither is this any great presumption or rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of judgment, if we may guess at his skill in that
Language by his translations, here and there. <hi>Cum
plurimâ religione</hi> is render'd <hi>with the principles of their
Religion.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Excep. p. 293.</note> And if he say he followed Sir <hi>W. Rawleigh</hi>
in his translation, he that follows a bad translator with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
correction or notice, is suppos'd to know no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
himself. And this will appear the more probable,
if we consider another of his translations, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
work. <hi>Rei personam</hi> he translates <hi>the Representation
of the things:</hi> instead of <hi>the person of the Guilty:</hi> or the
person of him that is <hi>Reus</hi> not <hi>Actor.</hi> And in this, I
dare say, he was seduc'd by no example. But least we
should be thought to misrepresent him, take his own
words,<note place="margin">Def. p. 168, 169.</note> such as they are. <hi>Yea, though it was spoken never so
positively, it was but to set forth REI PERSONAM: to make
the more full and lively representation of the supposed
thing.</hi> Here, you see, he hath made a double blunder,
first, in jumbling together <hi>person</hi> and <hi>thing:</hi> then, if
they could be jumbled together, <hi>rei persona</hi> would not
signifie the <hi>full and lively representation of the thing,</hi> but
rather a disguise or personated representation of the
thing. However I am satisfied from these instances,
that he had good reason, notwithstanding the caution
or desire of the Theorist to the contrary, to write his
Books in his Mother's tongue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:104274:10"/>
Thus we have done with the first part: which was to
mark out such passages, as we thought might probably
have inflam'd the Authors style in this reply. When men
are resolv'd not to own their faults, you know there is
nothing more uneasie and vexatious to them, than to
see them plainly discover'd and expos'd. We must now
give you some account of the contents of his Chapters,
so far as they relate to our subject. <hi>Chap. 1st. Nothing.
Chap. 2d.</hi> is against <hi>extraordinary providence:</hi> or that the
Theorist should not be permitted to have recourse to it
upon any occasion. This recourse to extraordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
being frequently objected in other places, and
of use to be distinctly understood: we will speak of it
apart at the latter end of the Letter. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. is about the
<hi>Moon's hindering the formation of the Earth before she
was form'd her self, or in our neighbourhood;</hi> as we have
noted before. Another thing in this Chap. is his urging,
<hi>Oyly</hi> or <hi>Oleagineous</hi> particles not to have been in the
<hi>Chaos,</hi> but made since. I'll give a short answer to this:
Either there was or was not, <hi>Oleagineous</hi> matter in the
new-made Earth, (I mean in its superficial region.)
when it came first out of a Chaos? If there was, there
was also in the Chaos, out of which that Earth was
immediately made. And if there was no oleagineous
matter in the new-made Earth, how came the soil to
be so fertile, so fat, so unctuous? I say not only <hi>fertile,</hi>
but particularly <hi>fat</hi> and <hi>unctuous:</hi> for he uses these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
words frequently in the description of that soil.<note place="margin">Exc. p. 211.</note> And
all fat and unctuous liquors are oleagineous:<note place="margin">Def. p. 69, &amp; p. 98.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
we have us'd those words promiscuously, in
the description of that Region: (<hi>Eng. Theor. Chap.</hi> 5.) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
only such unctuous liquors as are lighter
than water and swim above it, and consequently would
stop and entangle the terrestrial particles in their fall or
descent. And seeing such unctuous and oleagineous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
were in the new-made Earth, they must certainly
have been in the matter out of which it was immediately
form'd, namely, in the Chaos. All the rest of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
we are willing to leave in its full force: apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Theory, or the Answer, to be in no danger
from such argumentations or reflections.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>4th. Chap.</hi> is very short and hath nothing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104274:11"/>
The <hi>5th. Chap.</hi> is concerning the cold in the
circumpolar parts, which was spoken to in the Answer
sufficiently, and we stand to that. What is added about
extraordinary providence, will be treated of in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place. The <hi>6th. Chap.</hi> is also short, against this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
<hi>that it is not safe to argue upon suppositions actually
false.</hi> And I think there needs no more to prove it, than
what was said in the Answer. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. is chiefly about
texts of Scripture, concerning which I see no occasion
of saying any more than what is said in the <hi>Review of
the Theory.</hi> He says (<hi>p.</hi> 49.) that the Theorist catches
himself in a trap, by allowing that <hi>Ps.</hi> 33. 7. is to be
understood of the ordinary posture of the waters, and
yet applying it to their extraordinary posture under the
vault of the Earth. But that was not an extraordinary
posture according to the Theorist, but their natural
posture in the first Earth. Yet I allow the expression
might have been better thus, in <hi>a level or spherical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity,
as the Earth.</hi> He interprets <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (<hi>p.</hi> 53.) which we
render <hi>the Garden of the Lord,</hi> not to be Paradise, but
any pleasant Garden;<note place="margin">Gen. 13. 10.</note> yet gives us no authority, either
of ancient Commentator or Version, for this novel
and paradoxical interpretation. The Septuagint render
it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. The <hi>Vulgate, Paradisus Domini:</hi> and
all ancient Versions that I have seen render it to the
same sence. Does he expect then that his single word
and authority, should countervail all the ancient Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slators
and Interpreters? To the last place alledged by
the Theorist, Prov. 8. 28. he says the Answerer charges
him unjustly that he understands by that word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> no
more than the <hi>rotundity</hi> or <hi>spherical figure</hi> of the Abyss.
Which, he says, is a <hi>point of nonsence.</hi> I did not think
the charge had been so high however, seeing some
Interpreters understand it so. But if he understand by
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the <hi>banks</hi> or <hi>shores</hi> of the Sea, then he should have
told us how those banks or shores are <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>super

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 59. He says the Excepter does not misrepresent
the Theorist when he makes him to affirm the constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the First Earth to have been meerly mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical;
and he cites to this purpose two places, which
only prove, that the Theorist made use of no other
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:104274:11"/>
causes, nor see any defect in them, but never affirm'd
that these were the only causes. You may see his words
to this purpose expresly, <hi>Engl. Theor. p.</hi> 65. whereof the
Excepter was minded in the <hi>Answer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 60.</note> 
                     <hi>p.</hi> 3. In the last Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
of this Chapter, if he affirms any thing, he will
have <hi>the Pillars of the Earth</hi> to be understood <hi>literally.</hi>
Where then, pray, do these Pillars stand that bear up
the Earth? or if they bear up the Earth, what bears
them up? what are their Pedestals, or their foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
But he says Hypotheses must not regulate Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
though in natural things, but be regulated by it,
and by the letter of it. I would gladly know then, how
his Hypothesis of the motion of the Earth, is regulated
by Scripture, and by the letter of it. And he unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gives an instance just contrary to himself, namely, of
the Anthropomorphites: for they regulate natural rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and philosophy by the letter or literal sence of
Scripture, and therein fall into a gross errour. Yet we
must not call the Author <hi>injudicious,</hi> for fear of giving
offence.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>8th. Chap.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> begins with the Earths <hi>being carried di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
under the Equinoctial,</hi> before its change of situation:
<hi>without any manner of obliquity in her site, or declination
towards either of the Tropicks in HER COVRSE.</hi> Here you
see, when the Earth chang'd its situation, it chang'd,
according to his Astronomy, two things: its <hi>site,</hi> and its
<hi>course;</hi> its site upon its axis, and its course in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens.
And so he says again in the next paragraph, <hi>put
the case the Earth shift her posture, and also her CIRCVIT
about the Sun, in which she persisted till the Deluge.</hi> Here
is plainly the same notion repeated: that the Earth
chang'd not only <hi>its site,</hi> but also its <hi>road</hi> or <hi>course</hi> about
the Sun. And in consequence of this he supposes its course
formerly to have been under the Equinoctial, and now
under the Ecliptick: it being translated out of the one
into the other, at its change. Yet he seems now to be
sensible of the absurdity of this doctrine, and therefore
will not own it to have been his sence:<note place="margin">P. 61.</note> and as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that he meant otherwise, he alledges, that he
declar'd before, that by the Earths ritght situation to the
Sun, <hi>is meant that the axis of the Earth was always kept
in a parallelism to that of the Ecliptick.</hi> But what's this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:104274:12"/>
to the purpose? This speaks only of the <hi>site</hi> of the
Earth, whereas his errour was in supposing its <hi>course</hi> or
<hi>annual orbit</hi> about the Sun, as well as its site upon its
own axis, to have been different, and chang'd at the
Deluge: as his words already produc'd against him,
plainly testifie.</p>
                  <p>What follows in this Chapter is concerning the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Equinox. And as to the reasoning part of what
he says in defence of his Exceptions, we do not grudge
him the benefit of it, let it do him what service it can.
And as to the Historical part, he will not allow a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to be a good witness as to matter of fact, if he did
not assign true causes of that matter of fact. To which I
only reply, tho' <hi>Tiverton</hi> Steeple was not the cause of <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi>
sands, as the <hi>Kentish</hi> men thought, yet their testimony
was so far good, That there were such Sands, and such
a Steeple. He also commits an errour as to the nature
of <hi>Tradition.</hi> When a Tradition is to be made out, it
is not expected that it should be made appear that none
were ignorant of that Tradition in former Ages: or
that all that mention'd it, understood the true grounds
and extent of it: but 'tis enough to shew the plain foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of it in Antiquity, as a Conclusion, tho' they did
not know the reasons and premises upon which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.
For instance, The <hi>Conflagration</hi> of the world
is a doctrine of Antiquity, traditionally deliver'd from
age to age: but the <hi>Causes</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of the Confla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration,
they either did not know, or have not deliver'd
to us. In like manner, that the first age and state of the
world was without change of Seasons, or under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Equinox, of this we see many footsteps in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity,
amongst the Jews, Christians, Heathens: Poets,
Philosophers; but the Theory of this perpetual Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nox,
the causes and manner of it, we neither find, nor
can reasonably expect, from the Ancients. So much
for the Equinox.</p>
                  <p>This Chapter, as it begun with an errour, so it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily
ends with a paralogism: namely, that, <hi>because
30 days made a month at the Deluge, therefore those
days were neither longer nor shorter than ours are at
present.</hi> Tho' we have sufficiently expos'd this before
yet one thing more may be added, in answer to his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:104274:12"/>
confident conclusion, in these words; But to talk, <hi>as
the Answerer does, that the Month should be lengthen'd by
the Days being so, is a fearful blunder indeed. For let the
days (by slackening the Earth's diurnal motion) have been
never so long, yet (its annual motion continuing the same)
the Month must needs have kept its usual length: only few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
days would have made it up.</hi> 'Tis not usual for a Man
to persevere so confidently in the same errour; As if
the intervals of time, hours, days, months, years, could
not be proportionably increast: so as to contain one
another in the same proportion they did before, and
yet be every one increast as to absolute duration. Take
a Clock, for instance, that goes too slow: The circuit
of the Dial-plate is 12. hours, let these represent the 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Signs in his Zodiack: and the hand to be the Earth
that goes thorough them all: and consequently the
whole circuit of the Dial-plate represents the Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
as we said, this Clock to go too slow, this will not
hinder but still fifteen minutes make a quarter, in this
Clock: four quarters make an hour, and 12. hours
the whole circuit of the Dial-plate. But every one of
these intervals will contain more time than it did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
according to absolute duration, or according to
the measure of another Clock that does not go too
slow. This is the very case which he cannot or will
not comprehend: but concludes thus in effect, that
because the hour consists still of four quarters in this
Clock, therefore it is no longer than ordinary.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>9th.</hi> Chapter also begins with a false notion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that <hi>Bodies quiescent</hi> (as he hath now alter'd the case)
<hi>have a nitency downwards.</hi> Which mistake we rectified
before, if he please. Then he proceeds to the <hi>Oval</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Earth. And many flourishes and harangues
are made here to little purpose. For he goes upon a
false supposition, that the Waters of the Chaos were
made Oval by the weight or gravitation of the Air. A
thing that never came into the words or thoughts of
the Theorist. Yet upon this supposition he runs into the
<hi>deserts of Bilebulgerid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> 86.</note> and the waters of <hi>Mare del Zur:</hi>
Words that make a great noise, but to no effect. If
he had pleas'd he might have seen the Theorist made
no use of the weight of the Air upon this occasion, by
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104274:13"/>
the instance he gave of the pressure of the Moon, and
the flux of the waters by that pressure. Which is no
more done by the gravitation of the Air, than the
Banks are prest, in a swift current and narrow chanel,
by the gravitation of the water. But he says rarefied
Air makes less resistance than gross Air: and rarefied
water in an Aeolipile, it may be, he thinks presses with
less force than unrarefied. Air possibly may be rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to that degree as to lessen its resistance: but we
speak of Air moderately agitated, so as to be made
only more brisk and active. Moreover he says, the
waters that lay under the Poles must have risen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicularly,
and why might they not, as well, have
done so under the Equator? The waters that lay na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
and originally under the Poles, did not rise at
all: but the waters became more deep there, by those
that were thrust thither from the middle parts of the
Globe. Upon the whole I do not perceive that he hath
weaken'd any one of the Propositions upon which the
formation of an Oval Earth depended. Which were
these, <hi>First,</hi> that the tendency of the waters from the
center of their motion, would be greater and stronger
in the Equinoctial parts, than in the Polar: or in those
parts where they mov'd in greater circles and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
swifter, than in those where they were mov'd
in lesser circles and slower. Secondly, Agitated Air hath
more force to repel what presses against it, than stagnant
Air: and that the Air was more agitated and rarefied
under the Equinoctial parts, than under the Poles.
Thirdly, Waters hinder'd and repell'd in their primary
tendency, take the easiest way they can to free them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from that force, so as to persevere in their motion.
Lastly, to flow laterally upon a Plain, or to ascend upon
an inclin'd Plain, is easier than to rise perpendicularly.
These are the Propositions upon which that discourse
depended, and I do not find that he hath disprov'd any
one of them. And this, Sir, is a short account of a
long Chapter, impertinencies omitted.</p>

'pray, how long the world was without knowing the
use of Iron, in several parts of it: as in the Northern

Cities, after their fashion. And to come nearer home,
consider what Towns and Cities our Ancestros, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi>

Why might not <hi>Henochia, Cain</hi>'s City, be such a City

'twas answer'd, that Scripture does not mention Iron or
Iron-tools in building of the Ark: but only Gopher
wood and Pitch.<note place="margin">Def. p. 103.</note> To which he replies, <hi>If Scriptures silence
concerning things be a ground of presumption that they were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104274:14"/>
not, what then shall we think of an Oval and unmountainous
Earth, an inclosed Abyss, a Paradisiacal world, and the like:
which the Scripture makes no mention of.</hi> I cannot easily
forbear calling this an <hi>injudicious</hi> reflection, tho' I know
he hath been angry with that word, and makes it a
<hi>brat of passion.</hi> But I do assure him I call it so coolly
and calmly. When a thing is deduc'd by natural argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and reason, the silence of Scripture is enough.
If he can prove the <hi>motion of the Earth</hi> by natural ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and that Scripture is silent in that point, we
desire no better proof. Now in all those things which
he mentions, an Oval and unmountainous Earth, an
Inclosed Abyss, a Paradisiacal world, Scripture is at least
silent: and therefore 'tis natural arguments must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
these cases. And this ill-reasoning he is often
guilty of, in making no distinction betwixt things that
are, or that are not, prov'd by natural arguments, when
he appeals to the interpretation of Scripture.</p>

only what is to be said hereafter concerning
the literal sence of Scripture. However he is too lavish

this Earth, or as our Rivers now? I'am sure the <hi>Theory,</hi>

the contrary: but rather suppos'd the waters fruitful,
as the ground was. But as to an <hi>open Sea,</hi> whether side

The real question to be consider'd here, setting aside
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:104274:14"/>
pedantry, is this, <hi>whether</hi> that Thing (Sun, or Rainbow,
or any other) could have any significancy as a sign,

have done without a sign. This is more material to be

                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. Is concerning Paradise, and to justifie or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
himself why he baulkt all the difficulties, and said
nothing new or instructive, upon that subject. But he
would make the Theorist inconsistent with himself, in
that he had said,<note place="margin">Def. p. 125.</note> that <hi>neither Scripture, nor reason, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the place of Paradise: and yet determines it by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Christian Fathers.</hi> Where's the inconsistency
of this? The Theory, as a Theory, is not concern'd in a
<hi>Topical</hi> Paradise; and says moreover that neither Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
nor reason, have determin'd the place of it; but
if we refer our selves to the judgment and tradition of
the Fathers, and stand to the majority of their Votes,
(when Scripture and reason are silent) they have so far
determin'd it, as to place it in the other Hemisphere,
rather than in this: and so exclude that shallow opinion
of some moderns, that would place it in <hi>Mesopotamia.</hi>
And to baffle that opinion was the design of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orist;
as this Author also seems to take notice.<note place="margin">P. 131.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>After this and an undervaluing of the Testimonies of
the Fathers, he undertakes to determine the place of
Paradise by Scripture, and particularly that it was in
<hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> or some region thereabouts. And his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is this, because in the last verse of the <hi>3d.</hi> chap.
of <hi>Genesis,</hi> the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>flaming sword</hi> are said to be

chiefly depend for the interpretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
And the <hi>Vulgate</hi> renders it, <hi>ante Paradisum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptatis:</hi>
and according to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Pentateuch 'tis
rendered <hi>ex adverso.</hi> Now what better authorities can
he bring us for his translation? I do not find that he
gives any, as his usual way is, but his own authority.
And as for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in the <hi>2d. chap.</hi> and <hi>8th. ver.</hi>
which is the principal place, 'tis well known, that, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the <hi>Septuagint,</hi> all the ancient Versions, Greek and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:104274:15"/>
Latin, (besides others) render it to another sence. And
there is a like uncertainty of translation in the word

                     </gap> as we have noted elsewhere. Lastly, the Rivers of
Paradise, and the countreys they are said to run through
or encompass, are differently understood by different
Authors, without any agreement or certain conclusion.
But these are all beaten subjects, which you may find
in every Treatise of Paradise, and therefore 'tis not
worth the time to pursue them here.</p>
                  <p>Then he proceeds to the <hi>longevity of the Ante-diluvians:</hi>
which, so far as I can understand him to affirm any
thing,<note place="margin">P. 139.</note> he says was not <hi>general:</hi> but the lives of some
few were <hi>extraordinarily length'ned by a special blessing; the
elongation of them being a work of Providence, not of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
This is a cheap and vulgar account,(and so are all
the contents of this Chap.) prov'd neither by Scripture,
nor reason: and calculated for the humour and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of those, that love their case more than a diligent
enquiry after truth. He hath indeed a bold assertion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
that <hi>Moses</hi> does distinguish, as much or more,
betwixt <hi>two races of men before the Floud:</hi> the one <hi>long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers,</hi>
and the other <hi>short-livers,</hi> As he hath distinguisht
the Gyants before the Flood, from the common race
of mankind.<note place="margin">P. 141.</note> These are his words, <hi>Is not his distinction
equally plain in both cases?</hi>
speaking of this formentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
distinction. Or, <hi>if there be any difference, does he not
distinguish better betwixt long-livers and short-livers, than
he does betwixt men of Gigantick and of usual proportion?</hi>
Let's see the truth of this: <hi>Moses</hi> plainly made mention
of two races of mankind:<note place="margin">Gen. 6. 4.</note> the ordinary race, and those
of a Gigantick race, or <hi>Gyants.</hi> Now tell me where he
plainly makes mention of <hi>short-livers</hi> before the Flood.
And if he no where make mention of <hi>short-livers,</hi> but
of <hi>long-livers</hi> only, how does he distinguish as plainly of
these two races, as he did of the other two? for in the
other he mention'd plainly and severally both the parts
or members of the distinction, and here he mentions
but one, and makes no distinction.</p>
                  <p>Then he comes to the Testimonies cited by <hi>Iosephus</hi>
for the longevity of the <hi>Ante-diluvians,</hi> or first inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Earth. And these he roundly pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be <hi>utterly false.</hi> This Gentleman does not seem,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104274:15"/>
to be much skill'd in Antiquity, either sacred or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane:
and yet he boldly rejects these Testimonies (as
he did those of the Fathers before) as <hi>utterly false:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 142.</note> which
<hi>Iosephus</hi> had alledg'd in vindication of the History of
<hi>Moses.</hi> The only reason he gives, is, because these Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
say, They liv'd <hi>a thousand years:</hi> whereas <hi>Moses</hi>
does not raise them altogether so high. But the question
was not so much concerning the precise number of
their years, as about the excess of them beyond the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
lives of men: and a round number in such cases
is often taken instead of a broken number. Besides, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
according to the account of <hi>Moses,</hi> the greater part
of them liv'd above nine hundred years, at least he
should not have said these Testimonies in <hi>Iosephus</hi> were
<hi>utterly false,</hi> but false in part, or not precisely true.</p>
                  <p>Now he comes to his reasons against the Ante-dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian
longevity; which have all had their answers before,
and those we stand to. But I wonder he should think
it reasonable, that mankind,<note place="margin">P. 144, 145.</note> throughout all ages, should
increase in the same proportion as in the first age: And
if a decuple proportion of increase was reasonable at
first, the same should be continued all along: and the
product of mankind, after sixteen hundred years, should
be taken upon that supposition. I should not grudge
to admit that the first pair of Breeders might leave ten
pair: but that every pair of these ten, should also leave
ten pair, without any failure: and every pair in their
children should again leave ten pair: and this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
without diminution or interruption, for sixteen
hundred years, is not only a hard supposition, but ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
incredible. For still the greater the number was,
the more room there would be for accidents, of all
sorts: and every failure towards the beginning, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
in other parts, would cut off thousands in
the last product.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. Is against the Dissolution of the Earth, and
the Disruption of the Abyss, at the Deluge: such as the
Theory represents. Here is nothing of new argument,
but some stroaks of new railing wit, after his way. He
had said in his <hi>Exceptions</hi> that the <hi>Dissolution of the Earth
was horrid blasphemy:</hi> now he makes it <hi>Reductive Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi>
as being <hi>indirectly, consequentially,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 153, 154.</note> or <hi>reductively,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:104274:16"/>
to Scripture. But this rule, we told him, all errors
in Religion would be blasphemy, and if he extend this
to errors in Philosophy also, 'tis still more harsh and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious.
I wonder how he thinks, the doctrine, which
he owns, about the motion of the Earth, should escape
the charge of <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> that being not only indirectly,
but directly and plainly contrary to Scripture. We
thought that expression, <hi>the Earth is dissolv'd,</hi> being a
Scripture expression, would thereby have been protected
from the imputation of <hi>blasphemy:</hi> and we alledg'd to
that purpose, (besides, <hi>Ps.</hi> 75. 3.) <hi>Isa. 24. 19. Amos</hi> 9. 5. He
would have done well to have prov'd these places in
the Prophets <hi>Isaiah</hi> and <hi>Amos,</hi> to have been <hi>figurative</hi>
and <hi>tropological,</hi> as he call it: for we take them both to
relate to the dissolution of the Earth, which literally
came to pass at the Deluge. And he not having prov'd
the contrary, we are in hopes still that the <hi>Dissolution
of the Earth</hi> may not be <hi>horrid blasphemy,</hi> nor of <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous importance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then having quarrel'd with the Guard of Angels
which the Theorist had assign'd for the preservation of
the Ark, in the time of the Deluge: he falls next into
his blunder, that the Equator and Ecliptick of the Earth
were interchang'd, when the situation of the Earth was
chang'd. This error in the Earth is cousin-germain to
his former error in the heavens, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Earth
chang'd its tract about the Sun, and leapt out of the
Equator into the Ecliptick, when it chang'd its situation.
The truth is, this Copernican Systeme seems to ly cross
in his imagination. I think he would do better to let it
alone. However, tho' at other times he is generally ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bose
and long-winded, he hath the sence to pass this by,
in a few words: laying the blame upon certain paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses
or semicircles, whose innocency notwithstanding
we have fully clear'd, and shew'd the poison to be
spread throughout the whole paragraph, which is too
great to be made an <hi>Erratum Typographicum.</hi>

and Brick; which as they are the first stony materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
that we read of, for building: so the ruines of them
might stand after the Deluge. And that they had no other
materials is the more probable, because, after the Flood, at
the building of <hi>Babel, Moses</hi> plainly intimates that they had
no other materials than those.<note place="margin">Gen. 11. 3.</note> For the Text says, <hi>They said
one to another, go to, let us make Brick, and burn them thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
And they made Brick for stone, and slime had they had mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.</hi>
But now this argument, methinks, may be retorted
upon the Excepter with advantage. For, if there were no
dissolutions, concussions, or absorptions, at the Deluge, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the ruines of <hi>Ioppa,</hi> methinks we might have had
the ruines of an hundred Antediluvian Cities. Especially,
if, according to his Hypothesis, they had good stone, and
good Iron, and all other materials, fit for strong and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
building. And, which is also to be consider'd, that it
was but a fifteen-cubit Deluge, so that Towns built upon
eminences or high-lands, would be in little danger of
being ruin'd: much less of being abolisht.</p>
                  <p>His last argument (<hi>p.</hi> 163.) proves, if it prove any thing,
that God's promise, that <hi>the world</hi> should not be <hi>drown'd</hi>
again, was a <hi>vain and trifling thing,</hi> to us, who know it must
be burnt. And consequently, if <hi>Noah</hi> understood the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration
of the World, he makes it a <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>trifling
thing</hi> to <hi>Noah</hi> also. If the Excepter delight in such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions,
let him enjoy them, but they are not at all to
the mind of the Theorist.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. Now we come to his new Hypothesis of <hi>Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen-cubit
Deluge.</hi> And what shifts he hath made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104274:17"/>
the World with such a diminutive Flood, we have
noted before: First, by raising his water-mark, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it uncertain. Then by converting the Deluge, in a
great measure, into <hi>Famine.</hi> And lastly, by destroying
Mankind and other Animals, with <hi>evil Angels.</hi> We shall
now take notice of some other incongruities in his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis.
When he made <hi>Moses</hi>'s Deluge but <hi>fifteen Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
deep,</hi> we said that was an <hi>unmerciful Paradox,</hi> and askt,
whether he would have it receiv'd as a <hi>Postulatum,</hi> or as
a <hi>Conclusion.</hi> All he answers to this is, That the same que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
may be askt concerning several parts of the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:<note place="margin">P. 166.</note>
particularly, that the Primitive Earth had no <hi>Open Sea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Whether is that, says he, to be receiv'd as a <hi>Postulatum,</hi>
or as a <hi>Conclusion?</hi> The answer is ready, as a <hi>Conclusion:</hi>
deduc'd from premises, and a series of antecedent reasons.
Now can he make this answer for his fifteen-Cubit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge?
Must not that still be a <hi>Postulatum,</hi> and an unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
one? As to the Theory, there is but one Postulatum
in all, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Earth rise from a Chaos.</hi> All the other
Propositions are deduc'd from premises, and that one Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulatum
also is prov'd by Scripture and Antiquity. We
had noted further in the Answer, that the Author had
said in his Exceptions, that he would not defend his Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis
as <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real:</hi> and we demanded thereupon,
<hi>Why</hi> then did he trouble himself or the World with what
he did not think <hi>true</hi> and <hi>real?</hi> To this he replies, <hi>Many
have written ingenious and useful things, which they never
believ'd to be true and real.</hi> Romances suppose, and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
fictions: Will you have your fifteen-cubit Deluge
pass for such? But then the mischief is, where there is
neither Truth of Fact, nor Ingenuity of invention, such a
composition will hardly pass for a Romance, or a good
fiction. But there is still a greater difficulty behind: The
Excepter hath unhappily said,<note place="margin">Exc. p. 302.</note> 
                     <hi>Our supposition stands suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Divine Authority: as being founded upon Scripture:
which tells us as plainly as it can speak, that the waters pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vailed
but fifteen Cubits upon the Earth.</hi> Upon which words
the Answerer made this remark,<note place="margin">Answ. p. 67.</note> 
                     <hi>If his Hypothesis be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon Scripture, and upon Scripture as plainly as it can
speak, Why will not he defend it as TRVE and REAL? for
to be supported by Scripture, and by plain Scripture, is as much
as we can alledge for the articles of our Faith.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Des. p. 168.</note> To this he
replies now, that he <hi>begg'd allowance at first, to make bold
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104274:17"/>
with Scripture a little.</hi> This is a bold excuse: and he espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
one would think, should take heed how he makes
bold with Scripture: lest, according to his own notion,
he fall into <hi>blasphemy</hi> or something of <hi>blasphemous impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
indirectly, consequentially,</hi> or <hi>reductively,</hi> at least.
However this excuse, if it was a good one, would take
no place here: for to understand and apply Scripture, in
that sence that it speaks <hi>as plainly as it can speak,</hi> is not to
make bold with it, but modestly to follow its dictates and
plain sence.</p>
                  <p>He feels this load to lie heavy upon him, and struggles
again to shake it off, with a distinction. When he said his
fifteen-cubit Deluge was <hi>supported by divine authority,</hi> &amp;c.
This,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he says, was spoken <hi>by him, in an Hypothetick or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positious
way: and that it cannot possibly be understood other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by men of sence.</hi> Here are two hard words, let us first
understand what they signifie, and then we shall better
judge how Men of sence would understand his words.
His <hi>Hypothetick</hi> or <hi>suppositious way,</hi> so far as I understand
it, is the same thing as by <hi>way of supposition;</hi> Then his
meaning is, he <hi>supposes</hi> his fifteen-cubit Deluge is <hi>suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by divine authority:</hi> And he <hi>supposes</hi> it is <hi>founded upon
Scripture as plainly as it can speak.</hi> But this is to suppose
the Question, and no Man of sence would make or grant
such supposition. So that I do not see what he gains
by his <hi>Hypothetick</hi> and <hi>suppositious</hi> way. But to draw him
out of this mist of words, Either he affirms this, that his
<hi>Hypothesis is supported by divine authority: and founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Scripture as plainly as it can speak:</hi> or he denies it, or
he doubts of it. If he affirm it, then all his excuses and
diminutions are to no purpose, he must stand to his cause,
and show us those plain Texts of Scripture. If he deny it,
he gives up his cause, and all that divine authority he
pretended to. If he doubt of it, then he should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
himself doubtfully; as, <hi>Scripture may admit of that
sence, or may be thought to intimate such a thing;</hi> but
he says, with a plerophory, <hi>Scripture speaks it as plainly as
it can speak.</hi> And to mend the matter, he unluckily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns
in the following words,<note place="margin">P. 16<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, 16<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>Yea, tho' it was spoken never
so positively, it was but to set forth REIPERSONAM:
to make a more full and lively representation of the supposed
thing.</hi> He does well to tell us what he means by <hi>Rei
Personam,</hi> for otherwise no Man of sence, as his phrase is,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:104274:18"/>
would ever have made that translation of those words.
But the truth is, he is so perfectly at a loss how to bring
himself off, as to this particular, that in his confusion he
neither makes good sence, nor good Latin.</p>
                  <p>Now he comes to another inconsistency which was
charg'd upon him by the <hi>Answer:</hi> Namely, that he rejects
the <hi>Church-Hypothesis</hi> concerning the Deluge, and yet had
said before,<note place="margin">Exc. p. 300.</note> 
                     <hi>I cannot believe (which I cannot well endure to
speak) that the Church hath ever gone on in an irrational way
of explaining the Deluge.</hi> That he does reject this
Church-Hypothesis was plainly made out from his own
words: because he rejects the <hi>Common Hypothesis:</hi> The
<hi>general standing Hypothesis:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the Citations in the Answ. p. 68.</note> The <hi>usual Hypothesis:</hi> The <hi>usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
sence they put upon Sacred story,</hi> &amp;c. These citations he
does not think fit to take notice of in his reply: but puts
all upon this general issue, which the <hi>Answerer</hi> concludes
with: <hi>The Church-way of explaining the Deluge, is either ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
or irrational. If he say it is rational, why does he desert
it, and invent a new one. And if he say it is irrational, then
that dreadful thing, which he cannot well endure to speak,
That, the Church of God hath ever gone on in an irrational
way of explaining the Deluge, falls flat upon himself.</hi> Let's
hear his answer to this Dilemma.<note place="margin">Def. p. 170.</note> 
                     <hi>We say,</hi> says he, <hi>that the
Church-way of explaining the Deluge,</hi> (by creating and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilating
waters for the nonce) <hi>is very rational.</hi> Then say
I still, why do you desert it, or why do you trouble us
with a new one? Either his Hypothesis is more ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
than the Church-Hypothesis, or less rational? If less
rational, why does he take us off from a better, to amuse
us with a worse? But if he say his Hypothesis is more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
than that of the Church's, Then <hi>Woe</hi> be to him, in
his own words,<note place="margin">P. 171.</note> that so <hi>black a blemish should be fasten'd
upon the wisest and noblest Society in the World,</hi> as to make
himself more wise than they, and his Hypothesis more
rational than theirs. The truth is, This Gentleman hath
a mind to appear a <hi>Virtuoso:</hi> for the new Philosophy, and
the <hi>Copernican</hi> Systeme: and yet would be a Zealot for
orthodoxy, and the Church-way of explaining things.
Which two designs do not well agree, as to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
World; and so betwixt two Stools he falls to the
ground, and proves neither good Church-man, nor good
Philosopher.</p>
                  <p>But he will not still be convinc'd that he deserts the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:104274:18"/>
Church-hypothesis, and continues to deny the desertion
in these words,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>We say that we do not desert or reject the Church
way of explaining the Deluge.</hi> Now to discover, whether
these words are true or false, Let us observe, <hi>First,</hi> what he
acknowledges to have said against the Church-Hypothesis:
<hi>Secondly,</hi> what he hath said more than what he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
here. He acknowledges that he said the Church-Hypothesis
<hi>might be disgustful to the best and soundest Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick
judgments.</hi> And this is not good Character. Yet this
is not all, for he hath fairly dropt a principal word in the
sentence, namely, <hi>justly.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Exc. p. 312.</note> His words, in his <hi>Exceptions,</hi> were
these, <hi>such inventions</hi> (which he applyes to the Church-Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis)
<hi>as have been, and, IVSTLY may be disgustful, not
only to nice and squeamish, but to the best and soundest Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
judgments.</hi> Now judge whether he cited this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
before, truly and fairly: and whether in these words,
truly cited, he does not disparage the Church-Hypothesis,
and justifie, those that are disgusted at it.</p>
                  <p>He furthermore acknowledges that the usual ways of
explaining the Deluge <hi>seem unreasonable to some, and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
to others, and unsatisfactory to the most.</hi> But, it seems,
he will neither be of these <hi>some, others</hi> or <hi>most.</hi> Lastly, he
acknowledges that he had said,<note place="margin">Def. p. 171.</note> 
                     <hi>The ordinary supposition, that
the Mountains were covered with waters in the Deluge, brings on
a necessity of setting up a new Hypothesis for explaining the
Flood.</hi> If so, what was this <hi>ordinary supposition:</hi> was it not the
supposition of the Church? And was that such, as made it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to set up a new Hypothesis for explaining the Flood?
Then the old Hypothesis was insufficient, or irrational.</p>
                  <p>Thus much he acknowledges: but he omits what we no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before, his rejecting or disapproving the <hi>common Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis,</hi>
the <hi>general standing Hypothesis,</hi> the <hi>usual sence they put
upon the sacred story,</hi> &amp;c. And do not all these phrases denote
the Church-Hypothesis?<note place="margin">Exc. p. 325.</note> He further omits, that he confest,
<hi>he had expounded a Text or two of Scripture, about the Deluge,
so as none ever did. And deserting the common receiv'd sence,
puts an unusual gloss upon them.</hi> And is not that <hi>common re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
sence,</hi> the sence of the Church? and his <hi>unusual gloss</hi>
contrary to it? Lastly, he says, by his Hypothesis, we need
not fly to a <hi>new Creation of Waters,</hi> and gives his reasons
at large against that opinion, which you may see, <hi>Except.</hi>
p. 313. Now those reasons he thought either to be <hi>good</hi>
reasons, or <hi>bad</hi> reasons: if bad, why did he set them down,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:104274:19"/>
or why did he not confute them? if good, they stand good
against the Hypothesis of the Church: for he makes that
<hi>new Creation</hi> and <hi>Annihilation</hi> of waters at the Deluge, to
be the Hypothesis of the Church. <hi>Defen. p.</hi> 170. I fear I
have spent too much time in shewing him utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent
with himself in this particular. And I wonder he
should be so sollicitous to justifie the Hypothesis of the
Church in this point, seeing he openly dissents from it in
a greater: I mean in that of the <hi>Systeme of the World.</hi> Hear
his words,<note place="margin">Def. p. 136.</note> if you please, to this purpose. <hi>And what does the
famous Aristotelian Hypothesis seem to be now, but a mass of
Errours? where such a Systeme was contrived for the Heavens,
and such a situation assign'd to the Earth, as neither reason
can approve, nor nature allow. Yet so prosperous and prevailing
was this Hypothesis, that it was generally receiv'd, and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
propagated for many ages.</hi> This prosperous prevailing
error, or mass of errors, was it not espoused and suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Church? And to break from the Church in
greater points, and scruple it in less, is not this to strain
at Gnats, and swallow Camels?</p>
                  <p>So much for his inconsistency with himself. The rest of
this Chapter in the <hi>Answer,</hi> shews his inconsistency with
<hi>Moses;</hi> both as to the waters covering the tops of the
Mountains, which <hi>Moses</hi> affirms and the Excepter denyes;
and as to the decrease of the Deluge, which <hi>Moses</hi> makes
to be, by the waters retiring into their chanels, after fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
reciprocations, <hi>going</hi> and <hi>coming.</hi> But the Excepter
says, the Sun suck'd up the waters from the Earth: just
as he had before suck'd the mountains out of the Earth.
These things are so groundless, or so gross, that it would
be tedious to insist longer upon them. And whereas it is
not reasonable to expect, that any others should be idle
enough, as we must be, to collate three or four Tracts,
to discern where the advantage lies in these small alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations:
I desire only, if they be so dispos'd, that they would
collate the <hi>Exceptions, Answer</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> in this one
Chapter, which is our Author's Master-piece: And from
this I am willing they should take their measures, and
make a judgment, of his good or bad success in other parts.</p>
                  <p>What shifts he hath us'd to make his <hi>fifteen-cubit De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi>
sufficient to destroy all mankind and all animals, we
have noted before: and here 'tis (<hi>p.</hi> 181, 182.) that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
them to <hi>famine.</hi> And after that, he comes to a long
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104274:19"/>
excursion of seven or eight pages, about the imperfection
of <hi>Shipping</hi> after the Flood:<note place="margin">Def. p. 183, 184, 185, &amp;c.</note> a good argument for the
Theorist, that they had not an open Sea, Iron-tools, and
materials for shipping, before the Flood. For what should
make them so inexpert in Navigation for many years and
ages after the Flood, if they had the practice and experience
of it, before the Flood? And what could hinder their having
that practice and experience, if they had an open Sea, and
all Iron and other materials, for that use and purpose?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, he comes to his notion of the <hi>Great Deep,</hi> or
<hi>Tehom-Rabbah.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. 191.</note> Which he had made before, in express words,
to be the Holes and Caverns in the Rocks; I say, in express
words, such as these,<note place="margin">Exc. p. 312.</note> 
                     <hi>Now supposing that the Caverns in the
Mountains were this great Deep:</hi> speaking of <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Great
Deep,</hi> according to this new Hypothesis. He says further
(<hi>p.</hi> 105.) <hi>In case it be urg'd,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. p. 105.</note> 
                     <hi>that Caverns, especially Caverns
so high situate, cannot properly be called the great Deep.</hi> Where
you see, his own objection supposes that he made those
caverns the <hi>Great Deep.</hi> And in the same page, speaking
of the Psalmists <hi>Great Deeps</hi> (in his own sence of making
them holes in rocks) and <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Great Deep,</hi> he says, <hi>the
same thing might be meant by both.</hi> By all these expressions
one would think it plain, that by his <hi>Great Deep</hi> he meant
his <hi>caverns</hi> in rocks: yet now, upon objections urged against
it, he seems desirous to fly off from that notion. But does
not yet tell us plainly what must be meant by <hi>Moses</hi>'s
<hi>Great Deep.</hi> If, upon second thoughts, he would have the
Sea to be understood by it, why does he not answer the
objections that are made by the Theorist against that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation?<note place="margin">Engl. Th. p. 81, &amp;c.</note>
Nay, why does he not answer what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
had objected before (<hi>Except p.</hi> 310.) against that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position?
He seems to unsay now, what he said before:
and yet substitutes nothing in the place of it, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by <hi>Moses</hi>'s T<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hom-Rabbah.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. Is a few words concerning these expressions
of <hi>Shutting the windows of Heaven</hi> and the <hi>Fountains of the
Abyss,</hi> after the Deluge. And these were both shut alike, and
both of them no less than the <hi>Caverns</hi> in the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 17. Hath nothing of argumentation or Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy:
but runs on in a popular declamatory way, and (if
I may use that forbidden word) injudicious. All amounts
to this, <hi>Whether</hi> we may not go contrary to the letter of
Scripture, in natural things, when that goes contrary to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104274:20"/>
plain reason. This we affirm, and this every one must af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
that believes the <hi>motion of the Earth,</hi> as our Vertuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
pretends to do. Then he concludes all with an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
close, that he follows the great example of a R.
Prelate,<note place="margin">Def. p. 215.</note> and <hi>militates under that Episcopal banner.</hi> I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to believe that he writ at first, in hopes to curry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with certain persons, by his great zeal for Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy;
but he hath made such an hotch-potch of new Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
and Divinity, that I believe it will scarce please
the party he would cajole: nor so much as his R. Patron.
I was so civil to him in the Answer, as to make him a
Saint in comparison of that former Animadverter: but,
by the style and spirit of this last Pamphlet, he hath forfeited
with me all his saintship, both absolute and comparative.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for his Chapters: and as to his reflections
upon the <hi>Review of the Theory,</hi> they are so superficial
and inconsiderable, that I believe he never expected that
they should be regarded. I wonder however, that he
should decline an examination of the <hi>2d.</hi> part of the
Theory. It cannot be for want of good will to confute
it: he hath shewn that to the height, whatsoever his power
was. Neither can it be for want of difference or disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in opinion, as to the contents of this later part:
for he hath reckon'd the <hi>Millennium</hi> amongst the errors
of the ancient <hi>Fathers, (Def. p.</hi> 136.) and the <hi>Renovation of
the World</hi> he makes <hi>Allegorical. (p.</hi> 224. &amp;c.) It must therefore
be for want of some third thing: which he best knows.</p>
                  <p>But before we conclude, Sir, we must remember that
we promised to speak apart to two things, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
objected to the Theorist by this Writer, and to little
purpose; namely, his flying to <hi>Extraordinary Providence,</hi>
and his flying from the <hi>literal sence</hi> of Scripture. As to
Extraordinary Providence, Is the Theorist alone debarr'd
from recourse to it, or would he have all men debarr'd,
as well as the Theorist? If so, why doth he use it so much
himself? And if it be allow'd to others, there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
it should be deny'd the Theorist, unless he have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own'd
it, and so debarr'd himself that common privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
But the contrary is manifest, in a multitude of
places, both of the first and second part of the Theory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For,<note place="margin">Eng. The. p. 105. &amp;c.</note> besides a discourse on purpose upon that subject, in

words of the same book (<hi>Latin</hi>) he does openly avow,
both Providence (natural and moral) and miracles: in
these words, <hi>Deni<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> cùm certissimum sit, à divinâ Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ
pendere res omnes, cujuscunque ordinis, &amp; ab eâdem vera
miracula edita esse, &amp;c.</hi> And as to the second part of the
Theory, the ministery of Angels is there acknowledg'd fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
both as to natural and moral administrations.
From all which instances it is manifest, that the Theorist
did not debar himself, by denying either <hi>Miracles, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
ministery,</hi> or <hi>extraordinary Providence;</hi> But if the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepter
be so injudicious (pardon me that bold word) as
to confound all extraordinary Providence with the <hi>Acts
of Omnipotency,</hi> he must blame himself for that, not the
Theorist. The <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Annihilation</hi> of waters is an
act of pure Omnipotency, This the Theorist did not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of at the Deluge: and if this be his fault, as it is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
objected to him (<hi>Def. p. 9. 66. 170, &amp;c.</hi>) he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veres
in it still,<note place="margin">Eng. The p. 18, 19.</note> and in the reasons he gave for his opinion,
which are no where confuted. But as for acts of Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
power, he does every where acknowledge them in
the great Revolutions,<note place="margin">The. Lat. p. 53. Eng. p. 107, 108.</note> even of the natural World. If the
Excepter would make the Divine Omnipotency as cheap
as the ministery of Angels, and have recourse as freely
and as frequently to that, as to this: If he would make
all extraordinary Providence the same, and all miracles,
and set all at the pitch of Infinite power, this may be an
effect of his ignorance or inadvertency, but is no way
imputable to the Theorist.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it may be observ'd that the Theorist
hath no where asserted, that <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Cosmopoeia</hi> (which
does not proceed according to ordinary Providence) is
to be literally understood; and therefore what is urg'd
against him from the letter of that <hi>Cosmopoeia,</hi> is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
urg'd and without ground. There are as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and better Authorities, that <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>six-days Creation</hi>
should not be literally understood, than there are, why
those Texts of Scripture that speak about the <hi>motion of
the Sun,</hi> should not be literally understood. And as to
the Theorist, he had often intimated his sence of that
Cosmopoeia, that it was exprest <hi>more humano, &amp; captum
populi:</hi> as appears in several passages; In the Latin Theory,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104274:21"/>
speaking of the <hi>Mosaical Cosmogonia,</hi> he hath these words:
<hi>Constat haec Cosmopoeia duabus partibus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theor. li. 2. c. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>quarum prima, massas
generales atque rerum inconditarum statum exhibet: sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turque
eadem principia, &amp; eundem ordinem, quem antiqui
usque retinuerunt. Atque in hoc nobiscum conveniunt omnes
ferè interpretes Christiani: nempe,</hi> Tohu Bohu <hi>Mosaicum

aut, si mavis, Theologicam: quâ, motibus Chaos, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum

&amp; successivis ipsius mutationibus in varias regiones &amp;
elementa: His, inquam, post-habitis, popularem narrationem
de ortu rerum hoc modo instituit. Res omnes visibiles in sex
classes, &amp;c.</hi> This is a plain indication how the Theorist
understood that Cosmopoeia. And accordingly in the
<hi>English Theory</hi> the Author says,<note place="margin">P. 288.</note> 
                     <hi>I have not mention'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s
<hi>Cosmopoeia: because I thought it deliver'd by him as a
Law-giver, not as a Philosopher. Which I intend to show at
large in another Treatise: not thinking that discussion proper
for the vulgar Tongue.</hi> The Excepter was also minded of
this in the Answer, <hi>p.</hi> 66. Now, 'tis much, that he, who
hath searcht all the corners, both of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
Theory, to pick quarrels, should never observe such
obvious passages as these. But still make objections from
the letter of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Cosmopoeia: which affect the
Theorist no more than those places of Scripture that speak
of the motion of the Sun, or the Pillars of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>In the last place, the Theorist distinguisht two methods
for explaining the natural World: that of an <hi>ordinary</hi>
and that of an <hi>extraordinary Providence.</hi> And those that
take the second way, he said, might dispatch their task
as soon as they pleas'd if they engag'd omnipotency in
the work. But the other method would require time:
it must proceed by distinct steps, and leisurely motions,
such as Nature can admit; And, in that respect, it might
not suit with the busie lives, or impatient studies, of most
Men. Whom he left notwithstanding to their liberty to
take what method they pleas'd: provided they were not
troublesome in forcing their hasty thoughts upon all
others. Thus the Theorist hath exprest himself at the
end of the first Book:<note place="margin">C. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Interià, cùm non omnes à naturâ ità

quibus velmalè fundatis, aliquid dandum esse existimo, modò non sint turbulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi>
Thus the Theorist, you see, sets two ways before them, and 'tis indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
to him whether they take, if they will go on their way peaceably.
And he does now moreover particularly declare, That he hath no ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
either to make the <hi>Excepter,</hi> or any other of the same dispositions of
will, and the same elevation of understanding, proselytes to his Theory.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for <hi>Providence;</hi> As to the <hi>literal sence</hi> of Scripture, I find,
if what was noted before in the <hi>Answer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 82, 83. &amp;c.</note> had been duly consider'd, there
would be little need of additions upon that subject. The matter was sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
freely and distinctly, and the remarks or reflections which the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hath made in his <hi>Defence,</hi> upon this doctrine, are both shallow &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.
I say, <hi>partial:</hi> in perverting the sence, and separating such things as
manifestly depend upon one another. Thus the Excepter falls upon that
expression in the <hi>Answer,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Def. p. 202.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us remember that this contradicting Scripture,
here pretended, is only in natural things:</hi> where he should have added the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of the sentence, <hi>And also observe how far the Excepter himself, in
such things, hath contradicted Scripture.</hi> Here he makes an odious declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as it the Answerer had confest that he <hi>contradicted Scripture in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things:</hi> whereas the words are contradicting Scripture, <hi>here pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi>
and 'tis plain by all the discourse, that 'tis the literal sence of Scripture
that is here spoken of, which the Excepter is also said to contradict. Such
an unmanly captiousness shews the temper and measure of that spirit,
which rather than say nothing will misrepresent the plain sence of an
Author. In like manner, when he comes to those words in the Answer,
The case therefore is this, whether <hi>to go contrary to the letter of Scripture in
things that relate to the natural world, be destroying the foundation of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
affronting Scripture, and blaspheming the Holy Ghost.</hi> He says, this is
not to state the case truly,<note place="margin">Def. p. 206.</note> for it is not, says he, <hi>going contrary to the letter
of Scripture that draws such evil consequences after it, but going contrary to
the letter of Scripture, where it is to be literally under stood.</hi> And <hi>this the
Theorist does,</hi> he says, and the <hi>Excepter does not.</hi> But who says so besides
himself? This is fairly to beg the question, and can he suppose the
Theorist so easie as to grant this without proof? It must be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
matter that determines, what is, and what is not, to be literally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood.
However he goes on, begging still the question in his own
behalf, and says, those Texts of Scripture that speak of the motion and
course of the Sun, are not to be understood literally. But why not? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the literal sence is not to his mind? Of four Texts of Scripture
which the Theorist alledg'd against him, for the motion of the Sun, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
but one, &amp; that very superficially, to say no worse. 'Tis <hi>Ps.</hi> 19. where
the Sun at his rising is said to be as a <hi>Bridegroom coming out of his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and to rejoyce as a strong man to run his race. And his going forth is from
the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the ends of it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 207.</note> Which he answers
with this vain flourish: <hi>Then the Sun must be a man, and must be upon his
marriage; and must be drest in fine cloaths, as a Bridegroom is. Then he must
come out of a Chamber, and must give no more light, and cast no more heat than
a Bridegroom does</hi> &amp;c. If a man should ridicule, at this rate, the discourse
of our Saviour concerning <hi>Lazarus</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bosom, and <hi>Dives</hi> in
hell, with a great gulf betwixt them, yet talking audibly to one another;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104274:22"/>
And that <hi>Lazarus</hi> should be sent so far,<note place="margin">Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16.</note> as from heaven to hell, only to <hi>dip
the tip of his finger in water,</hi> and cool <hi>Dives</hi> his tongue. He that should go
about thus to expose our Saviours parable, would have a thankless office,
and effect nothing: for the substance of it would stand good still: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that mens Souls live after death, and that good Souls are in a state of
ease and comfort, and bad Souls in a state of misery. In like manner, his
ridiculing some circumstances in the comparison made by the Psalmist,
does not at all destroy the substance of that discourse: namely, that the
Sun moves in the firmament, with great swiftness and lustre, and hath
the circuit of its motion round the Earth. This is the substance of what
the Psalmist declares, and the rest is but a similitude which need not be
literally just in all particulars.</p>
                  <p>After this he would fain perswade the Theorist, that he hath excused
the Excepter for his receding from the literal sence, as to the motion of
the Earth:<note place="margin">Def. p. 208.</note> Because he hath granted, that, in certain cases, we may and
must recede from the literal sence. But where, pray, hath he granted, that
the motion of the Earth was one of those cases? yet suppose it be so, may
not the Theorist then enjoy this priviledge of receding from the literal
sence upon occasion, as well as the Excepter? If he will give, as well as
take, this liberty, let us mutually enjoy it. But he can have no pretence
to deny it to others, and take it himself. It uses to be a rule in writing,
that a man must not <hi>stultum fingere Lectorem.</hi> You must suppose your
Reader to have common sence. But he that accuses another of <hi>blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>
for receding from the literal sence of Scripture in natural things, and
does himself, at the same time, recede from the literal sence of Scripture,
in natural things: one would think, <hi>quoad hoc,</hi> either had not, or would
not exercise, common sence: in a literal way.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, He comes to the common known rule, assign'd to direct us,
when every one ought to follow, or leave, the literal sence: which is, <hi>not
to leave the literal sence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">p. 215.</note> 
                     <hi>when the subject matter will bear it, without absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
or incongruity.</hi> This he repeats in the next page thus, The rule is,
<hi>When no kind of absurdities or incongruities accrue to any Texts, from the
literal sence.</hi> If this be <hi>his</hi> rule, to what Texts does there accrue any ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity
or incongruity, by supposing the Sun to move? for Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
speaks upon that supposition, and not one word for the motion of
the Earth. Thus he states the rule, but the <hi>Answerer</hi> supposed, that the
absurdity or incongruity might arise from the <hi>subject matter.</hi> And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
he still maintains, that there are as just reasons (from the subject
matter) and better authorities, for receding from the literal sence, in the
narrative of the six-days Creation, than in those Texts of Scripture, that
speak of the motions and course of the Sun. And to affirm the <hi>Earth to
be mov'd,</hi> is as much <hi>Blasphemy,</hi> and more contrary to Scripture, than to
affirm it to have been <hi>dissolv'd,</hi> as the Theorist hath done.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I beg your excuse for this long Letter, and leave it to you to judge

you know self-defence, and to repel an assailant, is always allow'd: and
