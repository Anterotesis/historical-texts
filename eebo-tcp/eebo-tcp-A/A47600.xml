            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>N Epiſtle before a Booke is as
ordinary as a Buſh before a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne,
and as unneceſſary if
either the Wine or the Booke be
good: The Author would have
written a Dedicatory if he had
knowne to whom; For the candid intelligent Buyer,
or Reader of his Booke there needs no complement:
To the ignorant, or malevolent he cannot deſcend ſo
low as to uſe any. He therefore inſtead of an Epiſtle
prefixes an Apologie for the Buyers of his Book, and
not the Readers of Freecoſt: Firſt, for that he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by him many pieces of reall and ſolid learning
ready written for the Preſſe, he expoſes this toy and
trifle to the worlds view and cenſure: Next, that
he being old and ſtricken in yeares, doth write of love
<pb facs="tcp:34627:4"/>
and ſuch idle devices; for the firſt, he obſerves that
Ballads, and twelve peny Pamphlets, are a more
currant commodity than Books of a greater bulk and
better note, and like light French ſtuffes, are ſooner
bought than cloth of Gold or Tiſſue, which is not for
every ones wearing: For the ſecond, he conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that many elder men then he, doe weare love-lockes
and Fancies, he entring into his ſecond, and
worſt childhood may of courſe be excuſed, if as in his
firſt he was taken with Hobby-horſes, Rattles, and
Babies: So like old men, who doe but <hi>Clariùs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epitire,</hi>
he dote upon women and beauties, and ſuch
things, of which they can commonly make little or no
uſe: It is very true, that a Ladies beauty with
whom he was ſcarcely acquainted, begot theſe lighter
Fancies in his head, with whom if he had been real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in love, perhaps he would have written more and
better lines; It may be ſaid of him, that <hi>Agnoſcit
veteris veſtigia flammae,</hi> but thoſe fires are now
rak'd up in Embers, his <hi>Couure feu</hi> Bell being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
rung: ſince he that writ theſe lines could have
writ worſe, theſe perhaps may pleaſe ſome curteous
favourable judgements, to whom only be preſents and
recommends them.</p>
