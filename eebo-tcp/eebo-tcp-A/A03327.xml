            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:26866:3"/>
and hardy enterpriſes, which muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed as an infallible veritie: and therefore I ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deeme thoſe Princes aboue ſpecified (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their fortunes, fame, and exploits) had neuer come to ſuch end, but for want of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. And now ſith there are three other Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal vertues which are requiſit in him that ſhould be in authoritie: that is to ſay, Prudence, Iuſtice, and Fortitude, which ſo wonderfully adorne and beautifie all eſtates (If Temperance be with them adioyned, that they moue the very enemies with admiration to praiſe them) ſome peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as affection leads) will commend one, ſome another: as <hi>Aristotle</hi> the Prince of Philoſophers names Prudence, the mother of vertues, but <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Aristot. Cicero. Prudence.</note> defines her the knowledge of things which ought to be deſired and followed, and alſo of them which ought to be fled and eſchewed; yet you ſhall finde that for want of Temperance, ſome which were counted very wiſe, fell into wonderfull reproch and infamie. But Iuſtice that incomparable vertue, (as the ancient Ciuilians define her) is a perpetual and conſtant wil which giueth to euery man his right, yet if ſhee be not conſtant, which is the gift of Fortitude; nor equal in diſcerning right from wrong, wherein is Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb facs="tcp:26866:4"/>
nor vſe proportion in iudgement and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which pertaineth to Temperance: ſhe can neuer be called equitie or iuſtice, but fraud, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, iniuſtice and iniurie. And, to ſpeak of Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which <hi>Cicero</hi> defineth, a conſiderate vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking <note place="margin">Fortitude. Cicero.</note> of perils, and enduring of labours; if he whom we ſuppoſe ſtout, valiant, and of good courage, want Prudence, Iuſtice, or Temperance, he is not counted wiſe, righteous and conſtant, but ſottiſh, rude and deſperate. For Temperance (ſaith <hi>Cicero)</hi> is of reaſon in luſt and other euill <note place="margin">Cicero.

This noble vertue is diuided into three parts, that is, Continencie, Clemencie, and Modeſty, which well obſerued and kept (if grace be to them adioyned) it is impoſſible for him that is endued with the aboue named vertues euer to fall into the infortunate ſnares of calamitie, or misfortune. But Ambition, which is immoderate deſire of honor, rule, dominion, and ſuperiority, (the very deſtruction of nobilitie and common weales, as among the Romans; <hi>Sylla, Marius, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, Cinna, Catiline, Pompey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> are witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes) hath brought great decay to our countrey, and countrey-men.

                  <l>At leaſt I thought to quench <hi>Cupidoes</hi> fire,</l>
                  <l>And eke to worke my luſting loues reliefe,</l>

                  <l>Likewiſe my <hi>Elſtride</hi> I as Queene ordain'd,</l>

                  <l>Straight fled, and mou'd the Corniſh men to fight.</l>
                  <l>To them when ſhe declar'd her piteous plight,</l>
                  <l>In haſt they raiſd an armie, for to be</l>

                  <l>I thought to quaile their courage all by force:</l>
                  <l>But to my coſt I found too late beware.</l>
                  <l>There is no ſtrength in armour: men, ne horſe</l>
                  <l>Can vaile, if <hi>Ioue</hi> on wronged take remorce.</l>

                  <l>The trumpets blew and I denide the peace:</l>
                  <l>I minded to expell them all the Realme,</l>
                  <l>Or elſe to make them euer after ceaſe.</l>

                  <l>(They ſaid) and take my <hi>Guendoline</hi> againe,</l>
                  <l>They would reuenge the wrong or elſe be ſlaine.</l>

                  <l>Though truth bid tell the tale and ſtorie as it fell:</l>
                  <l>But ſith that I miſlike not audience, time, nor place,</l>
                  <l>Therefore, I cannot keepe my woes in counſell well.</l>
                  <l>* No greater eaſe of heart then griefes to tell,</l>

                  <l>That is the ſalue and med'cine of our paine,</l>

                  <l>Vs all our father <hi>Leire</hi> did loue too well God wot.</l>

                  <l>But yet though vice on vertue die with rage,</l>
                  <l>It cannot keepe her vnderneath to drowne:</l>

                  <l>The louing kindneſſe they deſeru'd in fine requite.</l>
                  <l>So found my ſiſters fauour in his ſight,</l>
                  <l>By flatterie faire they won their fathers heart,</l>

                  <l>Yet ſhortly I may chance, if Fortune will,</l>

                  <l>It were too long, but yet I briefly ſhall:</l>
                  <l>The cauſe <hi>Cordila</hi> ought her ſiſters ſpite</l>
                  <l>Was, they procur'd her, and their fathers thrall.</l>

                  <l>Both ſiſters elder, and her father graue,</l>
                  <l>And eke at length the kingdome all to haue.</l>

                  <l>Of Cornwall and of Wales, whom I did bring</l>
                  <l>To warre, againſt <hi>Cordila</hi> and her men:</l>
                  <l>We ſaid we would our title winne agen,</l>
                  <l>And that becauſe our fathers had it yore,</l>
                  <l>We ment to get it ours againe therefore.</l>

                  <l>Euen ſo our minds ambitious often are</l>
                  <l>And blinded, that we cannot reaſon ſee.</l>
                  <l>We thinke no men, but Gods on earth we bee,</l>
                  <l>Yet worſe are we then beaſts which know their kind:</l>
                  <l>For we haue nought but miſchiefe oft in mind.</l>

                  <l>By right or wrong, by might or malice, we</l>
                  <l>Could neuer liue like Fortune for to gaine:</l>

                  <l>O then we ioy, we lift our ſelues to skie,</l>

                  <l>If alſo I his ſtate might vndermine.</l>
                  <l>I thought, indeed, to haue it all in fine:</l>
                  <l>By force or fraud I did intend alone</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>To ſpeake in few, we waged warre ſo long</l>
                  <l>Gainſt her, at laſt we put her vnto flight:</l>
                  <l>We warriers for our Aunt were far too ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>Purſude and tooke, depriu'd her of her right.</l>
                  <l>We thought it ours what ſo we wan by might:</l>
                  <l>Eke ſo play tyrants: Traitors all do watch</l>
                  <l>To get by ſpoile, and count their owne they catch.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Not ſo contented were we with the pray,</l>

                  <l>Where long we fought it ſtoutly on each ſide,</l>

                  <l>Or brag what luck they haue, or tell their happie fate,</l>

                  <l>And ſo I entred Parthia as mine owne,</l>
                  <l>The Parthians me receiued with triumphs great:</l>
                  <l>When mine approch to <hi>Artabane</hi> was knowne,</l>
                  <l>In plaine before the City of his ſeat</l>

                  <l>So when great multitudes aſſembled were,</l>
                  <l>Their horſes left behind and bowes laid downe,</l>
                  <l>Amongſt their cups deuoide of force the feare,</l>
                  <l>By numbers great the chiefe of all the towne,</l>

               <l>Which ſaying did indeed amaze me more by much,</l>
               <l>Then all the force that man againſt my will might bend:</l>
               <l>For who the will of God with weapons may reſiſt?</l>
               <l>And when as ſinne hath ſold a countrey to decay,</l>
               <l>Then praier muſt preuaile, for weapons will not help.</l>
               <l>And when the end is come, when all the glaſſe is runne,</l>
               <l>Who can reſiſt the force of Fate and deſtinies?</l>
               <l>Who things forerun to fall from falling can refraine?</l>
               <l>It paſſeth mortall might to bring ſuch things about.</l>
               <l>Let man content himſelfe to do what beſt he may,</l>
               <l>By trying too too much, no man his God may tempt,</l>
               <l>But mortall man muſt thinke that God the beſt doth know,</l>
               <l>Who can depreſſe to duſt and raiſe when beſt him pleaſe.</l>
               <l>And as I thus amidſt my muſings did remaine,</l>
               <l>I did reſigne my crowne, and deem'd al honours vaine.</l>
               <l>And though it greeu'd me much to feele the fall I ſelt,</l>
               <l>Yet was I well content, I could not as I would:</l>
               <l>For which I left my land, my people, and my place.</l>
               <l>The Saxons they obtain'd the wage for which they war'd.</l>
               <l>When I three yeares had raign'd, without one day of reſt,</l>
               <l>Euen then in mourning robes at Rome I did arriue,</l>
               <l>And there contemning all the world, and worldly things,</l>
               <l>I made my ſelfe a Monke, (ceaſe Memory to muſe)</l>

               <l>Amongſt the Friers there, I led my lingring life.</l>
               <l>And til my dying day I daily did deuiſe,</l>

               <l>That nothing may content the minde of mortall man:</l>
               <l>The more my ſelfe did eate, the hungrier ay I was,</l>

               <l>The more I reſted me, the more I wearied was,</l>

               <l>And to conclude, I found I neuer could obtaine</l>
               <l>The thing, but in the end it cauſde me to complaine:</l>
               <l>My preſent good ſucceſſe, did threaten thrall to come;</l>

I nine yeares led my life, and neuer felt annoy.</l>

               <l>Who fed like Bacon fat, did nought but play and pray.</l>

               <l>Then in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Church at Rome they did me lay,</l>
               <l>Booted and ſpurd, euen as you ſee me here this day.</l>
               <l>So now you haue the whole of all my Tragedie.</l>
               <l>Of <hi>Brutus</hi> blood the laſt I liu'd that rul'd as king:</l>

               <l>The <hi>Saxons</hi> had the day, for which they longed long.</l>
               <l>They England cal'd the Ile, of <hi>Brute</hi> which tooke her name.</l>
               <l>Some men be borne to bliſſe, and ſome to hatefull hap:</l>
               <l>Who would haue thought, that I in warre a raging king,</l>
               <l>Should by the force of Fate, at Rome haue dide a Monke?</l>
               <l>Let all the world then know, that nothing is ſo ſure,</l>
               <l>That can afford and ſay, I thus wil aye endure.</l>
               <l>For that which ſeemeth beſt, is ſooneſt brought to naught,</l>

               <l>Will teach that I haue taught, and proue it paſſing plaine.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Paulus Aemilius</hi> did die but wretchedly:</l>

                  <l>The hony dew of Fortune ſo faſt on vs did drop,</l>

                  <l>Who through vntruth their truſt did ill betray:</l>
                  <l>Yet by this meanes obtained I may pray,</l>
                  <l>Of King and Dukes I found for this ſuch fauour,</l>
                  <l>As made me Duke of Northfolke for my labour.</l>

                  <l>For when this <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of Herford ſaw,</l>
                  <l>What ſpoile the King made of the noble bloud,</l>
                  <l>And that without all Iuſtice, cauſe, or lawe,</l>
                  <l>To ſuffer him, he thought not ſure nor good:</l>
                  <l>Wherefore to me twofaced in one hood,</l>
                  <l>As touching this, he fully brake his minde,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But I, although I knew my Prince did ill,</l>

                  <l>Not as a read, but as a hainous thing.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus where my duty bound me to haue told</l>
                  <l>My Prince his fault, and wild him to refraine,</l>
                  <l>Through flattery loe, I did his ill vphold,</l>

                  <l>Woe, woe to Realmes where ſuch are put in truſt,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For when the Duke was charged with my plaint,</l>
                  <l>He flat denied that any part was true,</l>
                  <l>And claimd by armes to anſwere his attaint,</l>
                  <l>And I by vſe that warlike feates well knew,</l>

                  <l>My Steward falſe thus being fled and gone,</l>

                  <l>Becauſe we could not keepe the townes we won,</l>
                  <l>For they were more then we might eaſily weeld,</l>
                  <l>One yeare vndid what we in ten had done:</l>

                  <l>So did Lord <hi>Roſſe</hi> and I then Earle, for ours:</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But ſith we could no finall peace induce,</l>
                  <l>For neither would the others couenants heare,</l>
                  <l>For eighteene months we did conclude a truce:</l>
                  <l>And while as friends we lay together there,</l>
                  <l>Becauſe my warrant did me therein beare,</l>
                  <l>To make a perfit peace and through accord,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And for the French Kings daughters were too ſmall,</l>
                  <l>I fancied moſt Dame <hi>Margaret</hi> his niece,</l>
                  <l>A louely Ladie beautifull and tall,</l>
                  <l>Faire ſpoken, pleaſant, and a Princely piece,</l>
                  <l>In wit and learning matchleſſe hence to Greece,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But ere I could the grant of her attaine,</l>
                  <l>All that our King had of her fathers lands,</l>
                  <l>As Maunts the towne, the countie whole of Maine,</l>
                  <l>And moſt of Aniow duchie in our hands,</l>
                  <l>I did releaſe him by aſſured bands.</l>
                  <l>And as for do wire with her none I ſought,</l>

                  <l>Becauſe thereby his precontract he brake,</l>
                  <l>Made with the heire of the Earle of Arminacke,</l>

                  <l>Thus vertue ſtarues, but luſtfood muſt be larded.</l>
                  <l>For I made Marqueſſe went to France againe,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus righteouſneſſe brought <hi>Humfrey</hi> to rebuke,</l>

                  <l>So mought I alſo dame <hi>Margaret</hi> the Queene,</l>
                  <l>By meane of whom this miſchiefe firſt began,</l>
                  <l>Did ſhe (trow ye) her ſelfe not ouer weene</l>
                  <l>Death to procure to that moſt worthy man?</l>
                  <l>Which ſhe and hers afterward mought well ban,</l>
                  <l>On whom did hang (as I before haue ſaid)</l>
                  <l>Her husbands life, his honour and his ayd.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For whilſt he liued which was our ſtable ſtay,</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Yorke</hi> and his impes were kept as vnder yoke,</l>
                  <l>But when the Piller remoued was away,</l>
                  <l>Then burſt out flame, that late before was ſmoke,</l>
                  <l>The traytour couert then caſt off his cloke,</l>
                  <l>And from his den came forth in open light,</l>
                  <l>With titles blind which he ſet forth for right.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But this to bring about, him firſt behoued</l>
                  <l>The King and his kin aſunder for to ſet:</l>
                  <l>Who being perforce or practiſe remoued,</l>
                  <l>Then had they avoided the principall let,</l>
                  <l>Which kept the ſought pray ſo long from the net:</l>
                  <l>The next point after, was, themſelues to place</l>
                  <l>In rule aboue the reſt, next vnto his Grace.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Therefore was I firſt whom they put out of place,</l>
                  <l>No cauſe pretending but the common-weale,</l>
                  <l>The Crowne of England was the very caſe,</l>
                  <l>Why to the Commons they burned ſo in zeale.</l>
                  <l>My faults were clokes their practiſe to conceale,</l>
                  <l>In counſaile hearing conſider the intent,</l>
                  <l>For in pretence of truth treaſon oft is ment.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So their pretence was only to remoue</l>
                  <l>Counſaile corrupt from place about the King.</l>
                  <l>But O ye Princes, you it doth behoue</l>
                  <l>This caſe to conſtrue as no fained thing,</l>
                  <l>That neuer traytour did ſubdue his King,</l>
                  <l>But for his plat, ere he could ſurder wade,</l>

                  <l>And if by hap he could ſo bring about,</l>
                  <l>Them to ſubdue at his owne wiſh and will,</l>
                  <l>Then would hee wax ſo arrogant and ſtout,</l>
                  <l>That no reaſon his outrage might fulfill,</l>
                  <l>But to proceed vpon his purpoſe ſtill</l>
                  <l>Til King and counſaile brought were in one caſe:</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So for the fiſh caſting forth a net,</l>
                  <l>The next point was in driuing out the plat,</l>
                  <l>Commons to cauſe in rage to fume and fret,</l>
                  <l>And to rebell, I cannot tell for what,</l>
                  <l>Requiring redreſſe of this and of that:</l>
                  <l>Who if they ſpeed, the ſtander at receit</l>
                  <l>Graſp will the pray, for which he doth await.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then by ſurmiſe of ſome thing pretended,</l>
                  <l>Such to diſplace as they may well ſuſpect,</l>
                  <l>Like to withſtand their miſchiefe intended,</l>
                  <l>And in their roomes their banders to elect,</l>
                  <l>The aduerſe party proudly to reiect,</l>
                  <l>And then with reports the ſimple to abuſe,</l>
                  <l>And when theſe helps faile, open force to vſe.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So this Dukes traines were couert and not ſeene,</l>
                  <l>Which ment no leſſe, that he moſt pretended,</l>
                  <l>Like to a Serpent couert vnder greene,</l>

                  <l>Zealous hee was, and would haue all things mended,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>For had he beene plaine, as he ment indeed,</l>

                     <hi>Henry</hi> to depoſe from the royall place,</l>
                  <l>His haſte had been waſte, and much worſe his ſpeed,</l>
                  <l>The King then ſtanding in his peoples grace.</l>
                  <l>This Duke therefore ſet forth a goodly face,</l>
                  <l>As one that ment no quarell for the Crowne,</l>
                  <l>Such as bare rule he only would put downe.</l>

                  <l>None I accuſe, nor yet my ſelfe defend,</l>
                  <l>Faults I know I had, as none liues without,</l>
                  <l>My chiefe fault was folly, I put thee out of doubt.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Folly was the chiefe, the naughtie time was next,</l>
                  <l>VVhich made my Fortune ſubiect to the chiefe:</l>
                  <l>If England then with ſtrife had not been vext,</l>
                  <l>Glorie might haue growen whereas enſued griefe.</l>
                  <l>Yet one thing is my comfort and reliefe,</l>
                  <l>Conſtant I was in my Princes quarrell</l>
                  <l>To die or liue, and ſpared for no parrell.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>VVhat though Fortune enuious was my foe?</l>
                  <l>A noble heart ought not the ſooner yeeld,</l>
                  <l>Nor ſhrinke abacke for any weale or woe,</l>
                  <l>But for his Prince lie bleeding in the feeld:</l>
                  <l>If priuie ſpight at any time me helde,</l>
                  <l>The price is paid: and grieuous is my guerdon,</l>
                  <l>As for the reſt me God (I truſt) will pardon.</l>

                  <l>I curſe them both as deepe as any can,</l>
                  <l>And alway did: yet through my fooliſh rime,</l>
                  <l>They ſtayned me with that moſt hatefull crime.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I neuer meant the King or Counſell harme,</l>

                  <l>The rime I made, though rude, was ſound in ſence,</l>
                  <l>For they therein whom I ſo fondly named,</l>
                  <l>So ruled all, that they were foule defamed.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This was no treaſon, but the very troth,</l>
                  <l>They ruled all, none could deny the ſame:</l>
                  <l>What was the cauſe then why they were ſo wroth?</l>
                  <l>What, is it treaſon in a riming frame</l>
                  <l>To clip, to ſtretch, to adde, or change a name?</l>
                  <l>And this reſeru'd, there is no rime nor reaſon,</l>

                  <l>Theſe metaphors I vs'd with other more,</l>
                  <l>As Cat, and Rat, the halfe names of the reſt,</l>

                  <l>They prattle and prate as doth the Popingay:</l>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F erſt in Kings affaires we counted were of truſt,</l>
                  <l>To fight in waged warres, as Captaines gainſt the foes,</l>
                  <l>And might therefore aliue receiue the guerdon iuſt,</l>
                  <l>Which aye his Maieſtie employ'd on thoſe:</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For if when as we warr'd, for Prince and publike weale,</l>
                  <l>We might to each for both haue time and place to ſpeake,</l>
                  <l>Then why not now, if we to both appeale?</l>
                  <l>Sith both well know our dealings were not weake.</l>
                  <l>We claime as right, in truth our minds to breake,</l>
                  <l>The rather eke we thinke to ſpeake we franchiz'd are,</l>

                  <l>Was neuer part, ſo plaid, in open ſtage</l>
                  <l>As mine, nor fame, of man flew halfe ſo far.</l>
                  <l>I ſate on bench, when thowſands at the bar</l>
                  <l>Did plead for right: for I in publique weale</l>
                  <l>Lord Chancelor was, and had the great broad ſeale.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now haue I told, how I did riſe aloft,</l>
                  <l>And ſate with pride, and pomp, in golden hall,</l>
                  <l>And ſet my feete, on coſtly carpets ſoft,</l>
                  <l>And plaid at goale, with goodly golden ball:</l>
                  <l>But after, Lord, I muſt rehearſe my fall.</l>
                  <l>O trembling heart, thou canſt not now for teares</l>

                  <l>Beſt weepe it out, and ſudden ſilence keepe,</l>
                  <l>Till priuy pangs, make pinched heart complaine:</l>
                  <l>Or caſt thy ſelfe, into ſome ſlumbring ſleepe,</l>
                  <l>Till wakened wits, remembrance bring againe.</l>
                  <l>When heauy teares, do hollow cheekes diſtaine,</l>
                  <l>The world will thinke, thy ſprits are growne ſo weake,</l>
                  <l>The feeble tongue, hath ſure no power to ſpeake.</l>

                  <l>A tale by ſignes, with ſighes and ſobs ſet out,</l>
                  <l>Moues peoples mindes, to pity plagued men:</l>
                  <l>With howling voice, do rather crie and ſhout,</l>
                  <l>And ſo by arte, ſhew forth thy ſorrow then.</l>
                  <l>For if thou ſpeake, ſome man will note with pen</l>
                  <l>What <hi>Wolſey</hi> ſaid, and what threw <hi>Wolſey</hi> downe,</l>

                  <l>Before I fell, I had a time to riſe:</l>
                  <l>As fatall chance, and Fortune me preferd.</l>
                  <l>So miſchiefe came, and did my ſtate deſpiſe.</l>
                  <l>If I might plead, my caſe among the wiſe,</l>
                  <l>I could excuſe, right much of mine offence:</l>
                  <l>But leaue a while, ſuch matter in ſuſpence.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Pope, or pride, or peeuiſh parts of mine,</l>
                  <l>Made King to frowne, and take the ſeale from me:</l>
                  <l>Now ſeru'd no words, nor pleaſant ſpeeches fine,</l>
                  <l>Now <hi>Wolſey,</hi> lo, muſt needes diſgraced be.</l>
                  <l>Yet had I leaue (as dolefull priſner free)</l>
                  <l>To keepe a houſe (God wot) with heauy cheere,</l>
                  <l>Where that I found, no wine, ne bread, nor beere.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>My time was come, I could no longer liue,</l>
                  <l>What ſhould I make, my ſorrow further knowne:</l>
                  <l>Vpon ſome cauſe, that King that all did giue</l>

                  <l>My goods, my plate, and all was ouerthrowne,</l>

                  <l>But harken now, how that my Fortune fell,</l>
                  <l>To Yorke I muſt, where I the Biſhop was:</l>
                  <l>Where I by right, in grace a while did dwell,</l>
                  <l>And was in ſtawle, with honour great to paſſe.</l>
                  <l>The Priors then, and Abbots gan to ſmell,</l>
                  <l>How Cardnall muſt, be honourd as he ought,</l>
                  <l>And for that day, was great prouiſion brought.</l>

                  <pb n="515" facs="tcp:26866:267"/>
                  <l>At Cawood then, where I great buildings made,</l>
                  <l>And did through cauſe, expect my ſtawling day,</l>
                  <l>The King deuiſde, a ſecret vnder ſhade,</l>
                  <l>How Cardnall ſhould, bee reſt and brought away.</l>
                  <l>One <hi>Wealſh</hi> a Knight, came downe in good aray,</l>
                  <l>And ſeaſned ſure, becauſe from Court hee came,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Then was I led, toward Court, like dog in ſtring,</l>
                  <l>And brought as biefe, that Butcher-row muſt ſee.</l>
                  <l>But ſtill I hopte, to come before the King,</l>
                  <l>And that repaire, was not denide to me.</l>
                  <l>But he that kept, the Towre, my guide muſt be.</l>
                  <l>Ah there I ſaw, what King thereby did meane,</l>
                  <l>And ſo I ſearcht if conſcience now were cleane.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Some ſpots I found, of pride and popiſh parts,</l>

                  <l>Now Oxford came, to minde, with all their arts,</l>
                  <l>And Cambridge too, but all not worth a flie:</l>
