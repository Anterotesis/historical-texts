         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

story for the varietie, the continuance, the manner, and all

and may in the reading produce the same effects in
others: Yet againe, when I consider the estate of mans
frailty, mutable, troublesome, and full of encumbrances,
and ouerlooke the condition of mortality, which in Princes
themselues is subiect to inconueniences, and many times
fearefull conuulsions, I wonder the lesse, because God will
be knowne vnto them, and they haue for the most part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed

which I also pray, that they may still hold vp the heads of

brought them to vntimely ouerthrowes, either by their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,

this is the cunning of the Deuill, who to fill vp the vast

            <p>But least my Preface extend beyond the boundes of my

against the current of gouernment, or the ebbings and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

not be tied vp with the slender bindings of rebellion, nor
taught any lesson against their wils either of fauouring, or
disfauouring, whom they please. As for personall faults;
Alas, Princes, Prelates, Officers, Maiestrates, and all sorts

of men will runne the race of mortality; and if it were

            <p>When this our Priest <hi>Richard Simond,</hi> or <hi>Versepelles Sinon,</hi>
well perceiued and vnderstood the gentle condition and
pregnancy of this <hi>Lambert,</hi> he wrought most cunningly

entangle men with such strange illusions,<note place="margin">The end of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelish deuices our destruction.</note> and all in the end

cry out,
<q>Medeae faciunt ad scelus omne manus:</q>
So was he led by the hands of this Priest, who was now set

not dead, but secretly conueied into some other Country,
as <hi>Edward</hi> surnamed the Outlaw had in former times beene

both craftily and audaciously he put his businesse to the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and sailed with his pupill ouer into <hi>Ireland,</hi> where his
Grand-father and Ancestors had gotten such loue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
that euen the name of <hi>Mortimer</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> was sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
and religious amongst them: For barbarous nations are
strong obseruers of ceremonies &amp; customes, and whatsoeuer
hath taken root and impression amongst them, will hardly
be remoued or extinguished, as it is too lamentably appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
at this houre, where the imposturing of Priests hath got
the vpper hand of all religion and piety, and to sweare by
<hi>Oneales</hi> hand, is of more efficacy, then to call God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

            <p>Heere he smoothly made relation of his owne, and the

against the present gouernment, enlarging his discourse
with his miraculous preseruation, when without law, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

treason, all which, by Gods prouidence and his assistance,
was iudiciously preuented, and hee had from a meere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseration
of a Princes estate, aduentured himselfe in that
manner, and to such a place, where he supposed true-hearted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:2985:11"/>

maintained.</p>
            <p>Whereupon <hi>Th. Geral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was an answer ready, and such an one deliuered with so
smooth and attractiue a demeanour, that though hee had
not beene such as hee protested: yet hee would haue sworne
him of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>igh birth and extraordinary bringing vp, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to assemble together all his affinity, and friends, to
whom he related the matter, as it chanced, with intimation
of the glory of the enterprize, and the good seruice to God
and the Church, for establishing a Prince deiected in his
throne, who was the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rue and onely <hi>Plantaginet,</hi> left to spring

their loyalty and resolued courages to take his part, that
the right heire of the crowne might bee restored to <hi>England,</hi>
and themselues eternized to heereafter memory, for so meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
a worke. Little needed a spur (saith our Prouerb) to
a forward horse, all that saw him beleeued it, and such as
heard onely the report, according to the Poet,
<q>—&amp; errorem vocis, vt omen, amo,</q>
Clapt their hands for ioy, that they should bee employed in
an enterprize of such wonder and important greatnesse:
whereupon money, horse, armour, men, and all things else
were promised, which might be aduantagious to such a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse.
But alas, <hi>Ireland</hi> was too weake, and of themselues
they did onely discouer their malice, curbed yet with insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
giuing the King notice, how their wills exceeded
their power, and that they were ready to entertaine euerie
opportunitie to doe any mischeefe. Therefore they sent
ouer into <hi>England,</hi> acquainting many discontented persons
with the businesse: but most principally, as to the life of
their actions, they submitted to <hi>Margaret</hi> Duches of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:2985:12"/>
sister of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, for her directions.
This was a woman of a wonderfull composure, so adorned
with princely qualities,<note place="margin">Margaret Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy entertaineth this quarrell.</note> and setled in Maiesticall authoritie,
as you shall heare heereafter, that she was admired of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and beloued in her owne countrey. Onely as stinking
flies lying secretly in boxes of sweet oyntments, putrifie the
same, did an innated malice, and virulent hatred to the <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castrian</hi>
Family, corrupt her other vertues, and (as it were)
thrust vp her princely enduments into a meere bog &amp; poole
of dirt and filthinesse: For although shee knew the bloud of
<hi>Yorke</hi> extinguished, and that the Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> was in
King <hi>Henries</hi> possession, as taken forth together with the
Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> now his wife, out of the castle of <hi>Sherrington</hi>
in <hi>Yorke-shire,</hi> vnder the custodie of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Robert Willoughby:</hi>
Yet insatiate in her hate and so consequently in her reuenge:
<q>Nam ingentes parturit ira minas:</q>
She admitted of euerie motion of disturbance, and inuented
meanes of her owne, to set in combustion the whole s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ate of
<hi>England,</hi> vnder a hopefull pretence to see the King ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
and supplanted.</p>
            <p>Thus did she pile vp together the fire of this disturbance,
and countenanced the matter more with her greatnesse and
power, then all the other complices besides: but if you aske
me, how she continued in this authority, being a widow, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
strangers, and enemie to so great a Prince as the
King of <hi>England:</hi> I will answer in a word, and measure out
the cheefe and principall cord that bound her royaltie toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgoine,</hi> hauing married this Lady
<hi>Margaret,</hi> daughter to <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and sister to
<hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, had yet no issue by her, but left one sole

to <hi>Maximilian</hi> sonne to <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperour, by

preserued, that she was highly reputed of, and esteemed
for the same: To which, when she added a politique ordring
her affaires, both for the maintenance of their honour, and
administration of Iustice in the Common-wealth: so that I
may say with the ancient Poet,<note place="margin">Eurip. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

willingly consented to be apparrelled and adorned
after her fashion, so that like an absolute Prince indeed, she
proceeded both in the gouernment for their benefit, and the
illustration of her owne greatnesse.</p>
            <p>In this Orb of reputation thus moouing herselfe, she still
shined like a full planet, from whose influence could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
nothing but sweet presages, till stepping aside into a
contrary motion of despight and rankor against the King, as
an enemie to knowledge and her owne conscience, she coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
this ridiculous &amp; yet vnhappy coniuration, which
by her meanes grew apace, like broad and stinking burs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
in themselues, and spoiling all the grasse about
them, vntill at last they were by a politique hand of preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
pull'd vp by the roots, and cast vnder foot into the dirt.
For when King <hi>Henry</hi> was certefied of all these tumults and
comminations, and knew the deepnesse and fulnesse of the
channell, in which the tottered barke of this rebellion stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
he verily supposed the best point of wisdome was <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

obstare,</hi> and so attempted with all care and vigilancy to
turne the rage of those troubles another way, or else to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
them from flowing ouer the banks of his enclosures,
and although the collusion &amp; fraud of the inuention, vexed
him more then the matter or substance of such a rebellion:
yet hee moderated his anger, and with <hi>Ianus</hi> looked both
waies, smiling with one face at the ridiculousnesse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the proiect: and marking warily with another, all the
meanes to redact the confused <hi>Chaos</hi> of this molestation to
better order and vniformity, desiring onely at Gods hands
to preuent effusion of bloud, which must needes bee spilt in
any settled warre and contracted army. Besides, in well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:2985:13"/>
battells, the euent was disputable, and many times pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments
were ordained, as well to reduce good men <hi>ad
correctionem</hi> and amendment, as to bring bad men to <hi>ruinam</hi>
and destruction. And therfore if it were possible, he would
rebate the insolency by other meanes, and diuert it from
handy blowes and bloudy contentions: whereupon he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his Councell together at the <hi>Charter-house</hi> besides his
royal mannour of <hi>Richmond</hi> and there consulted, how to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie
this sudden tumult and conspiracy, without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
disturbance or open defiance. This motion of the
Kings so tempered with grauity, mercy, and commiseration,
was so well accepted of the whole company, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
applauded his high wisdome, and religious care, and
put in practise, whatsoeuer seemed conuenient for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
affaires.</p>
            <p>They first began with a generall pardon, published to all
offenders that were content to receiue the same,<note place="margin">Articles agreed vpon by the Councell, to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the warre.</note> and remain
obedient to the Maiestie of <hi>England.</hi> For although at this
very instant S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Th. Broughton,</hi> who had obscured the Lord
<hi>Louell</hi> a great season from the King, was in a manner ready
to giue him battell, with many friendly coadiutors and a
well-settled army: yet did the King thinke it policie to desist
from a forcible ouerrunning them; because, as desperate of
life or pardon, considering their former treasons and abuses,
they would hardly be reclaimed in their rages, but now fight
for their liues and liberties. Againe, in shewing exemplarie
Iustice vpon them, once subiect to accusation or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he must needes proceed against many, yea such whose
offences in standing out, could admit of no pardon: and
therefore (as I sayd) he gently proclaimed the same, which
was much auailable to his purpose. For euen those, which
fauoured the Lord <hi>Louell</hi> most, began to stagger in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions,
when they perceiued the Kings benignitie, and
knew with what lenitie and commiseration he was willing to
proceede.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they thought it necessary and pertinent to
their peace, to shew the sonne of <hi>Clarence</hi> personally abroad
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:2985:13"/>
in the Citie, and other publike places, whereby the rumor
might be dashed out of countenance, and the purblinde eies
of false opinion extinguished. For such an impression this
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ictiue relation of his escape had made, that though they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him present, yet durst some of them sweare, it was but
a deuise of the Kings: whereby you may obserue the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and inconueniences of idle reports, which if they be not
strangled in the cradle with <hi>Hercules</hi> Serpents, and smothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
betimes, ere they come to stronger groth and life, will
viper like after they haue receiued warmth in ones bosome,
fly in his face: Nay, such is the nature of deuices in a totte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Common-wealth, that prohibitions to restraine them,
augment them the more, and they who would haue spoken
nothing but truth, left to their owne liberty; being prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed,
diuulge more then they meant.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It was determined, that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
wife to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth should loose her lands, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
from all manner of sway in the gouernment, because
she had voluntarily submitted her selfe and daughters to the
hands of King <hi>Richard,</hi> whereby all former contract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and
pretences of establishment might haue beene frustrated,
through the inconstancie of a woman: or as the State pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a priuate ambition, or couetousnesse to set any loome
on worke to weaue the web of her owne pleasure and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
which although was a heinous crime, and very
dangerous to the present Kings peace and tranquillitie: yet,
questionlesse the doome and iudgement seemed ouer rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous:
<hi>Durus fuit hic sermo,</hi> and if euer <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ius</hi> proued
<hi>summa iniuria,</hi> it was verified in this verdict. For question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
they forgot the turbulency of those times, the rage of
the tyrant, the fearefulnesse of many accidents, the seducing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of a King, and the flattering promises of a whole <hi>Common-wealth,</hi>
wherein stronger iudgements might haue falled then
a womans: But it should seeme that God hath a speciall
hand in the punishment of sinnes, and disposing of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes.
For without controuersie, if she consented to the
murthering of King <hi>Richards</hi> wife for her owne ease and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:2985:14"/>
if she seemed an aduersary to the good preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
to <hi>England</hi> by vniting the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amilies: or if she proiected her
owne aduancement in the present glory of the Kingdome,
forgetting the losse of her husband, the murther of her
kindred, the slaughter of her children, the odiousnesse of
the incest, and the curse of Heauen vpon crying sins: God
would neuer suffer such horrible faults vnreuenged, but
as you heare inflicted her wauering and inconsiderate time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse
with this punishment: For, she was presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to the Abbey of <hi>Barmondsey</hi> in Southwarke, and there
deceased after she had liued a while in some calamitous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
and excruciation both of soule and body: such are
all humane instabilities, wordly chances, and the condition
of <hi>Princes</hi> themselues. Otherwise, she that being a poore wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
had resisted the Kings importunity, &amp; by her chast and
modest behauiour attracted his good will to marry her: she
that had founded a Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> bearing her
name at this hower of <hi>Queenes</hi> Colledge, for the propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of learning, and education of Children and Students:
she, that had loued her husband, and the glory of <hi>England,</hi>
endeauouring all things to the augmentation of the honor
of them both: she, that seemed proud in workes of charity,
and to help forward the petitions of honest complainants
and distressed suiters: she, that kneeled on her knees for
<hi>Clarences</hi> liberty, and importuned the King to remember
his brother, by the example of <hi>Richard</hi> the first, who remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his brother <hi>Iohn</hi> a farre greater delinquent; had neuer
fallen so low into the dangerous pit of a sonne in lawes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure,
and seene her selfe generally maligned through the
kingdome: or else, as I said, the reuealed things belong to
vs, the secret to God, who questionlesse blew the coales of
this displeasure, to purge the contagion and infection of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
heart, which was only knowne to himselfe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, because they knew that reward and hope of
gaine might doe much with corrupted persons, and irreso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
men (as all Rebels were) they proclaimed a gratuity of
a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>housand pounds sterling to any one which would present
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:2985:14"/>
the State with the body of this counterfeit <hi>Lambert,</hi> to which
they were the rather induced, because not long before, the
Tyrant <hi>Richard</hi> the third had preuailed with the like against
the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> whom his owne seruant <hi>Banister</hi>
betraied in hope of recompence from the State, which is
also a custome in <hi>Italy,</hi> where the heads of the <hi>Banditi</hi> are
vallued at so many <hi>checkinos</hi> or peeces of gold, and so the
<hi>Zaffi,</hi> or other desperate <hi>Ruffiani</hi> obtaine many preies and
booties.</p>
            <p>Last of all, it was concluded to haue forces in readinesse,
and an Army prepared, whatsoeuer should chance, with all
prouision and furniture belonging to the setting forth of the
same, and honour of such a Kingdome, that neither security
or presumption one way of their owne greatnesse and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,
might make them too confident of themselues,
nor vilipending and slight regard of the contrary, another
way too negligent against their enemies.</p>
            <p>When all things were thus befitted to the disposing and
ordering their affaires: On a Sunday ensuing, <hi>Edward</hi> the
yong Earle of <hi>Warwick</hi> was brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Tower through
the publike streetes of London to the Cathedrall Church
of <hi>Pauls,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Earle of Warwicke shewne in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</note> where he remained all Procession time and high
Masse, hauing open conference with many of the Nobilitie,
especially such, whom the King suspected might haue been
induced to the commotion vpon the full assurance of his es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape.
But if he had asked them why he was imprisoned, or
what transgression the King could impute vnto him, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him in <hi>dures</hi> in that manner, and after put him to death
being an infant innocent, without law or reason, I meruaill
what they would haue answered, or how the Councell them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
would haue satisfied a iudicious questioner in that
kinde: yet by this occasion the imaginations of diuers were
setled, and the better sort belieued, that these Irish newes
were simulatory, and represented <hi>Ixions</hi> boasting that he
had laien with <hi>Iuno,</hi> when it was but a cloude, as by the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
birth of the <hi>Centaures</hi> did appeare.</p>
            <p>But it was not so with all: For, as it often happens in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:2985:15"/>
stopping of a violent inundation of water, that it causeth it
the more to rage and make a terrible noice, whereas running
in a deep channell it would goe quietly away: So fell it out
in the suppressing of these rumors, and mens hatred and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice:
many were the more exasperated, and by this gentle and
saire course to reduce them, thought all but trickes of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to deceiue them; proouing like certaine kinds of burs
and nettles, which soughtly handled sting the more violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but hardly crushed together lose their force and energie.
Of this sort was the Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi>

               </gap>, had a
priuacy of humor, which many men excepted against, as
fantasticall, and precise: For he was so cautelous in his
words, and singular in his phrases and actions, that he would
neither sweare nor tell a lie, by reason his communication
was still seasoned with sauorie <hi>Parenthesis</hi> and breakings off,

            <p>The number amounts to so many, if men faile not in
their computations: I dare not iustifie it further then one
my credit another, with such like. Yea, in his enterprises he

               <hi>Henry</hi> through this false rumor, he determined with the same

            <p>But King <hi>Henry</hi> supposing he had setled and appeased the

moued and disturbed, yea, as it were secure and carelesse of
any further malice and dangerous attempt against his estate
and dignitie, mistrusting nothing lesse, then any man to be
so foolish and mad, as to belieue that <hi>Lambert</hi> could be the
Earle: so that he coniectured nothing, but the suppressing

of those barbarous <hi>Irish,</hi> and the sedation of that trouble,
vntill he heard how the Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> was fled out of the

vntill he heard how the Duches of <hi>Burgoine</hi> coadiuted the

were resolued to giue him battaile; this somewhat moued
him, and exasperated his displeasure: For when he saw no
other <hi>cataplasme</hi> could serue the turne, but that he must cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terise
the sore, and sere and cut away the putrified flesh of
this corrupted and rebellious body, he determined with

            <p>Whereupon he commanded his Musters to goe forward,<note place="margin">The King rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

their obduratnesse, nor diuert their inficious intents against
him, he resolued with an equall strength, to remoue the
blocks of his peace and quietnesse, cast thus in his way by
flagitious contumacy and ridiculous innouation. But some
fires are not so easily quenched, as raised or maintained: for
though all his aduises, and good order consorted with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
yet were they not sufficient to stop the mouth, or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the passage of the present disturbance with deputies or
Commissioners: therefore he set forward in person, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
they would arriue from <hi>Flanders</hi> side on some of those

to him to excuse and purge himselfe of those crimes
enforced against him, or at least such ouersights, in which he
perfunctorily performed his duty while he was in <hi>France.</hi>
To him was sent the Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> by way of <hi>anticipation</hi>
to intercept at this time his iourney: For the King was too
full of troubles and cogitations about the suppressing his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

to the Tower, which when some of the Councell supposed
a hard doome, he answered them plainly, What need further
words? If he be my friend, as I am confident thereof, he will
be contented a while to suffer a little reproach and rebuke
for my sake: yea, peraduenture pleasure, and contentment.
If he be otherwise, it is a place of security, and would I had
my aduersaries as safe there, as they would me in the like ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>From thence the King went to <hi>Norwich,</hi> where he solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nised

of successe in the end. Thus they made no more adoe, but

which as their case stood, must be their best friend, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for <hi>England:</hi> the Army consisting (as yet principally)
of high <hi>Almaines,</hi> and a multitude of beggerly <hi>Irish,</hi> which
according to the <hi>Roman</hi> saying, were many men, and few
Soldiers. For their best defences were Scains and Mantles,

and well ordred troopes.<note place="margin">Lambert with his Armie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> Of these the Lord <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Gerardine</hi> was Captaine, and with these and the rest,
they landed for a speciall purpose (or if you will to vni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e

within a little of <hi>Lancaster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These affaires so notorious, and so publike, could not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:2985:17"/>
haue so secret a passage and contriuance, but the worthy and
wise King must needes be made acquainted with the same:
whereupon he dispatched certaine horse and scout-masters,
through the West parts of the Realme, to attend the arriuall
of his enemies abroad: yea, peraduenture to ouerwatch the
actions of his friends at home, as much troubled with the
vnconstancy of these, as perturbed with the rebellion of
them. Presently after he raised a sufficient Armie, ouer
which the Duke of <hi>Bedford,</hi> and Earle of <hi>Oxford</hi> were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
commanders, whom he sent forward before him, then
he came in person to <hi>Couentrey,</hi> where the principall <hi>rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous</hi>
was appointed, and where he first heard of the landing
of his enemies. Within a while he could fill vp a scedule
with the chiefe Traitors names, and the manner of their
troopes and proceedings: Last of all, he called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
proposing only two principall matters vnto them: First,
whether it were better to encounter with his enemies out of
hand, as <hi>Achitophel</hi> perswaded <hi>Absalom</hi> to do against <hi>Dauid,</hi>
and so to dissipate them by maine force and expedition, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Poet:
<q>Tolle moras:<note place="margin">Lucan. lib. 1.</note> semper nocuit differre paratis.</q>
Secondly, or weary them out by delaies and detracting of
time, as <hi>Quintus Fabius</hi> surnamed after <hi>Maximus</hi> did by
<hi>Hannibal,</hi> and so sent him far enough from Rome into <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia</hi>
and <hi>Apuleia,</hi> whereupon he was eternized with,
<q>Vnus homo nobis cunctando restituit rem.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The conclusion was, that though many times great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
whose fury at the first rushes could not be rebated,
were at last spent with time, expectation, and many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences;
as want of pay, commotions, mutinies, encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
in a strange Country, feare of forraine people, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,
famine, and such like: yet as the affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
stood, all speed and an orderly festination was to be
put in practise, lest (like a ball of snow in a moist, cold, and
misty Country, which by often rowling groweth greater and
greater) they might augment their numbers with their rage
and madnesse, being so neere the <hi>Scots</hi> open enemies, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:2985:18"/>
in the north parts dissembling friends: Whereupon the
King remooued to <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and tooke a field neere vnto
a wood called <hi>Bowers,</hi> whither came vnto him the Lord
<hi>George Talbot</hi> Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King with his army is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.</note> the Lord <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

&amp; had the fulnesse of his subiects obedience, to his

loue, and obseruation of the subiect: nor the souldier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
as in the amity and full assurance of one another,
especially being all of a nation and language, to vnderstand
the wants of such as would be supplied, and be releeued with
the willingnesse of those which are ready to performe the
same.</p>
            <p>In this space, the Earle of <hi>Lincolne</hi> entred <hi>Yorke-shire</hi> by
easie iournies, for not ouerwearying his princely Nephew
vnaccustomed to trauell, and after his precize manner, hee
both commanded, that no violence should be offered to any
of the Inhabitants, &amp; commended all those, which repaired
vnto him, vsing such humility and affable demeanour, that
it wan the hearts of many as yet vnsettled, vnto him, and
strengthened the loue of such, as had already submitted
themselues. Notwithstanding, being much frustrated in his
expectation of many coadiutors, and failing in that suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
which hee presumed vpon, hee began a little to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
an ill companion to all noble designes, feare and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust;
casting vp an vntoward reckoning of his proceedings
in this manner: To retire backe againe, were to meet death
and destruction by a way which he looked not for: To goe
forward, hee was yet too weake, the King being so strong
and enabled, which irresolution made the Poet cry out:

mightie armie, he absolutely determined to trie the fortune
of a battell,<note place="margin">The Earle of Lincolne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forward to Newarck to meet the King.</note> and encounter with his aduersaries, who not

               </gap>e them, in despight
of anie protraction, in what den or place soeuer, they meant
to obscure themselues: whereupon he marched from <hi>Yorke</hi>
to <hi>Newarck</hi> vpon <hi>Trent,</hi> presuming the King to bee two or

was in his bosome, as vnderstanding his egresse, regresse, and
progresses, which he vndertooke, and when he came there,
was ready to flie in his face. For hee settled himselfe the
night before the battell, approaching within three miles of

            <p>The valiant and ouer-hardy Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> nothing
terrified at the matter, but rather
<q>—duro ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And came forward apace: yet not in anie ouer-daring man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
but vnstartled in his resolutions, retained his accusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
grauity, and verie neere the Kings armie, at a village

resolution the next day,<note place="margin">Stoke field.</note> to call <hi>Fortune</hi> to the deciding of the
controuersie. The King likewise prepared himselfe, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
acquainting the companie with matters of necessity, in an
equall and plaine field diuided the troops, and darraigned
the battalions.</p>
            <p>To tell you of any signes, wonders, prodegies, prophesies,
dreames, deuises, forewarnings, or portentous accidents,
making sometimes a cause either good or bad, would spend
time to lose time, and procure small thankes in the paines:
For the superstitious and ignorant would bee angrie, at the
opposition and repugnancy: and the truely religious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at the vanity and superfluity, as abhorring the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation

my discourse concerning militarie proceedings, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchings,

would preuent me from a fitter and more opportune occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
heereafter. To discourse of the Captaines, the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
encouragements, the Earle of <hi>Lincolnes</hi> orations, the
Kings forcible and gracious speech, the intimation of the
imposture, and discouery of the treasons at large, were to
prolong the history without further profit, then a poore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention,
which would questionlesse extenuate the worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the businesse: therefore I desist from all extraneall
and superfluous discourses, and apply my selfe to a more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct
enarration of the matter.</p>
            <p>When the field was fully and orderly agreed vpon,<note place="margin">The armies ioyne.</note> the

               </gap>tguard of his armie, and
with a manly courage, onely animated the Souldiers, that
day to remember his honour, the Kings safety, and their

whereat the <hi>Irish</hi> began their accustomed cry, or if you will
<hi>Lullal lullo,</hi> which neither affrighted nor troubled the <hi>English</hi>
on the contrary side, but ministred occasion rather to laugh
at. The <hi>Germanes</hi> perceiuing the skirmishes and violent
meetings of these warlike bodies, contrary to their vsuall
keeping of their stands and close fights, set vpon the Kings
Vauntguard, and as they were approoued and expert men
in many encounters, so did they for the time in all things, as

the <hi>English</hi> man to man, or battell to battell and for

haue paralleld the best of his aduersaries. But to decipher,
and truely to speake of <hi>Martin Swart,</hi> I shall much disable
his worthinesse and merit. For he was heroike in spirit,
strong in heart, and of great ability in body, expert, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced,
and failing in nothing but his fortune: Eor when the
<hi>Irish,</hi> being most of them (as I sayd) vnarmed, were put by
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2985:19"/>
their light manner of skirmishing a farre off, and charged
with strong horses on the Flancks, and as strong bodies of
pikes in the Front, to which you may adde the cunning of
the Kings artillery, and violence of the arrowes, which fell
downe like haile vpon these poore and naked soules, they
knew no way of resisting or retiring, but were subiect to a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
encounter and slaughter. And although they held out a
while, as long as an equall met man-hood protracted the
victory: yet were they so pressed and oppressed, that they
quickly yeelded, and shrunke vnder the stroakes of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
arme. Againe, the Kings Foreward being full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie
and well furnished, continually supplied with Wings
and Archers, &amp; wonderfully encouraged with the high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
of the Commanders, at last brake the bodie of the
<hi>Almaines,</hi> and scattered their company with a lamentable
discomfiture: yet I must needes say, they were first more
terrified to see the <hi>Irish</hi> killed so confusedly, then exanima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with their owne disasters.<note place="margin">The King ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory against the Rebells.</note> What should I report? it is
with staggering troops and dispersed companies, as with a

till he come to the bottome: so these yeelded to the
fortune of a defeat without recouery, and onely met honor
in the way to a glorious death. Therfore I will stand the lesse
on descriptions. For neuer was a victorie so soon gotten, nor
a busines more quickly ended, many being slain, many taken
prisoners, many hurt, and few or none escaped: the cheefest
reason because the Lord <hi>Louell,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> &amp; other

at the valiant <hi>Germans</hi> man-hood and exploits, ioyned

they were as good as their words. For after men and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

commanded, that none should kill or hurt the Earle of
<hi>Lincolne,</hi> that being brought vnto him, hee might discouer
the secrets of this mischeefe, and the viperous brood of false-hearted
subiects: but the souldiers would not permit it, lest
the sauing of his life might, by such detection endanger di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers

            </p>
            <p>After this victory, the King would needes solemnize a

Then he proceeded to the casting vp a new accounts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy

told him, that he which rolleth a stone vp a hill, may perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenture
haue it fall vpon his own head, and he that looketh
too high in a dangerous entrenched ground, may fall into
the ditch. Notwithstanding, for his pennance he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to perpetuall imprisonment: but <hi>Lambert</hi> admitted
into the palace, and from place to place, came at last to bee

            <p>After this great mischeefe (like a peece of Ordnance ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged)
was thus broken in the fulnesse, and that with little
trouble, tumult, and expences, compared to many other
warres. The King (as you heard) returned thankes to the
Decider of all controuersies, and presently sent word to
<hi>London</hi> of his prosperity and aduenture, seeming sorry for
nothing, but the death of the Earle of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> assuring the
Duke of <hi>Bedford</hi> and Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> that he delighted
in his humours, and had a determination to haue saued his
life, adding yet this by the way, that hee was amazed at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Therfore it must needs be, that he presumed on further

this threatning storme of commotion and disturbance,
but also choaked with the dust of their owne dissention, the

            <p>In this triumphant prosperity he returned to <hi>London,</hi> and
was as well welcommed to the people, as contented in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
and so ran forward in the race of all mundane felicitie
and maiesticall happinesse. But neither his owne wisdome,
the vigilancy of the Officers, the fidelity of his Nobles, the
policy of his Councellours, the loyalty of his subiects, nor
the whole regard of the Common wealth, could turne the
frame of heauen about, nor preuent his destiny, concerning
following mischeefes:

desperate of successe: so that loth to remaine amongst such

distrustfull enemies, hee quietly returned to his most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
friend the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the master buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of this worke.</p>
            <p>The Duches before he came,<note place="margin">Perkin welcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to Lady Margaret.</note> thought euery hower from
his departure, a whole yeare, till his retorne: For to heare
how he proceeded, was a quiet to her thoughts, and to know
how fortune would deale with him a ioy to her heart, but to
see him a very rauishment: Yet when she vnderstood how
he was abiected and repudiated in the French Court, it could
not choose but be a great agony and amasement vnto her.
Notwithstanding, to preuent all suspition, she seemed at his
arriuall no lesse reuiued, then a mother is glad for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne
of her long absented sonne, or a person condemned,
for a pardon and restauration to his life and dignity: At his
first approach she receiued him with large embraces, and
hanging ouer his neck, seeming to shed teares of ioy and
comfort for his escape from many dangers and aduentures:
O dissembling and deceiuable hypocrisie! that euer a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

out of Gods one mouth, who in seuerall places of Scripture
hath puplished wherein a bad woman doth exceed all the
creatures of the World.</p>
            <p>After this extacy was past, she proceeded with a cunning
desire to haue him relate his first miraculous preseruation,
his after trauails and exploration of Countries, his next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement
in <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and finally his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:2985:25"/>
wherein he proceeded so effectually, and orderly without
stammering or stuttering, that the whole company verily
belieued it, and such as were not present, the rather, induced
by the report of others, sorrowing for nothing, but that they
heard him not <hi>Vina Voce,</hi> and endeauouring what they could
to present their personall obedience vnto him: Whereupon
when she perceiued, how euery thing consorted to her owne
wishes, she assigned him a Guard of 50 persons in Murry
and Blue, and honoured him with a cloth of Estate, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination
of the <hi>White Rose</hi> and Prince of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From thence forward the Nobilitie of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of <hi>England</hi> with all obsequious diligence attended him,
and from a reuerent estimation of his auncestors, performed

that had confined themselues to priuiledged places for debts

Some, euen of the better sort, through rashnesse and

beleeued verily, that this <hi>Perkin</hi> was the indubitate sonne of

of apprehension, without examining the probability and

that so bringing many coadiutors, they might not onely be

            <p>With this newes and man, the inquisitours returned into
<hi>England,</hi> and made a true report vnto his Maiesty of all that
euer they knew and heard, both concerning the assumpted
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2985:27"/>
presumption and impudency of the counterfet, as also the
proceedings and purposes of all the conspiratours, which
was seconded by the faithful letters of especial persons, who
had larger commission to make their commorance the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
out of <hi>England:</hi> when the King was thus satisfied, and (as
he supposed) to all seeming reasonable vnderstanding, had
openly and apparantly manifested it, heresolued to haue it
further published and declared, by open proclamations and
sound of trumpet, both in the Realmes of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and in the courts of forraine Princes: for which
purpose he sent ouer diuers Embassadours to many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
especially to <hi>Philip</hi> Arch-Duke of <hi>Burgoine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Embasie to the Arch-Duke.</note> and his
Councellours, as a place which neerest concerned him. This
Embasie was the charge and commission of S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ed. Poinings,</hi>
a most valiant Gentleman; and <hi>William Warrham</hi> Doctor of
the lawes, a man of great modesty, learning and grauity.
The generall poynts of their commission had large fields to
walke in, but the principall matters to be enforced had these
limitations.</p>
            <p>FIrst, to declare that the young man resident amongst
them with the Lady <hi>Margaret,</hi> was descended of a base
and obscure parentage, hauing falsly and vntruly vsurped
the name of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> who long before was
murthered in the Tower with his brother the Prince, by the
commandement of King <hi>Richard</hi> their vncle, as many men
liuing can testifie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that from the probability of the matter and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
of reason, there was no likelihood, that King <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
dispossessing the Prince both of his life and Kingdom,
would leaue the other brother stil to affright him, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
him in his gouernment.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> their mother, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
attainted in Parliament, for surrendring her daughters
into the Tyrants custody, and committing them into his
hands, who, she knew, had already murthered their brethren.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, to desire the Arch-Duke, and the principall
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2985:28"/>
Lords of his Councell, not to giue any credit to such illusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
nor suffer themselues to bee any more blinded or sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with impostures, or shadowing appearances of truth.</p>
            <p>Last of all, to remember how King <hi>Henry</hi> had (some few
yeeres since) succoured and releeued <hi>Maximilian</hi> their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Lord, almost oppressed and ouercome with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
hostility of the French King, and intestine rebellion of
his owne subiects, and therefore it must be vnprincely, and
a poynt of great ingratitude, either directly or indirectly, to
abett or maintaine any traytour, or trayterous practises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him, or the peace and tranquility of his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>With these instructions the Embassadours failed into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and were gently receiued, and honourably wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed
by the Arch-Duke and his Councell, as appeared
by the solemnity of their audience, and quicke dispatch of
their businesse: wherein Doctor <hi>William Warrham</hi> in a well
penned oration declared the Kings minde, as before you
heard, and by the way touched the malice of Lady <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi>
saying with the Poet,
<q>—Tantaenè animis coele stibus irae:</q>
And vnder a kinde of reprehension, rebuked her inficious
disposition against a Prince of so great worth and deseruing,
that neuer wronged her, nor entertained a preiudiciall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,
to inflict either her or hers with any malignant iniury;
wherin she only might be compared to a weak breath, which
spitting against a forcible winde, had it returned b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
into her face, adding withall somewhat vehemently,
that in her olde age, contrary to the nature of all births, shee
had brought forth two such detestable monsters, that is to
say, <hi>Lambert</hi> before disputed vpon, and now this <hi>Peter,</hi> that
the like was neuer heard of. And whereas, in the concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of children, women were commonly deliuered in eight
or nine moneths, as nature did require, she could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased
in eight or nine yeeres; nay, the youngest was fifteen
yeeres old, before her threnes were passed, and they iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to be shewed openly, and this was not sufficient neither,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:2985:28"/>
but they must bee at least extracted of Princes, and able to
giue Kings battell in the open field: whereupon hee might
well conclude with that ancient Poet:
<q>
                  <l>Sedres excellens est,<note place="margin">Eurip. Andro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mache.</note> contra reptiles bestias</l>

                  <l>Quae viperas &amp; ignem superant:</l>
                  <l>Sed nullus contra mulierem remedia inuenit adhuc</l>
                  <l>Malam: huiusmodi sumus hominibus malum.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This oration so effectually deliuered, and in the publique
assembly audaciously maintained, did not so much trouble
and vex the Duches, as aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who in a manner exanimated, lest his fraud and pestilentiall
enterprizes should not onely bee discouered, but discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
began to be somewhat appaled, and by a fearefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
seemed to discountenance both his honor and the
action, had not the Duches taken the cause in hand with a
more vndaunted courage, and like a true <hi>Virago</hi> raised her
spirits to a higher pitch of reuenge, thus resuscitating her
darling, and answering the Doctor.</p>

but speaking for his fee, and doing another mans errand, he
is the more pardonable, and therefore as neere as I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ember,
I will answer succinctly to euery point deliuered.</p>
            <p>First, whereas you impeach the miraculous and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
preseruation of this Prince. In which yet my credit and
knowledge of the truth, shall be of sufficiency to answer all
other obiections and intercedings, I cannot blame you, nor
him that set you on worke; For he well knowes that sonnes
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re to bee preferred before daughters, and ashamed of the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reachery of his ancestours, he would put off the blame by
a tricke of policy in laying as great faults on the shoulders of
his aduersary, I meane my brother <hi>Richard,</hi> whose tyranny
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:2985:29"/>
and obdurate heart hath onely wrought this relenting in me,
that say &amp; do what <hi>England</hi> can, I will be now the Protectrix
of this euery way distressed Prince, and so to conclude this
poynt, assure your King,
<q>Permanet in voto mens mea firma suo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, whereas you inferre the improbability and
vnlikelihood of sauing the Prince, being in a Tyrants custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
and determining to murther the King himselfe, I answer
in a word: I am of your minde, if euer he had come into his
hands: But it is well knowne, that the Cardinall himselfe
was deceiued, and the childe conuayed away, in despight of
the maleuolent practises of so cruell an Homicide. Yet say
it had not beene so, I hope eldest brothers daughters are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
before a yonger brothers claime; and hee had fiue
Princesses, besides my Nephew <hi>Warwicke,</hi> to wrastle wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall,
before he could goe out of the lists with his owne triumphs.
Therefore it was not the feare of him, that did accelerate his
murther, as you suppose; but his resolution to bee King, in
despight of Heauen and Hell.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, concerning the dispossessing of the Queene their
mother by your Parliament, I am ashamed of your asseuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that euer man, and such a man, whom (as you say) the
Heauens protected, should bee attainted of inhumanity, to
thinke a woman might not bee affrighted with a Tyrant,
when hee himselfe ranne into euery corner from his reaches.
But say there had beene a fault perpetrated (through the
timidity of her sex and tendernesse of her widdow-hood)
would any man marry the daughter, and hate or distresse
the poore mother, in whose behalfe I may well say with
<hi>Ariadne</hi> to <hi>Theseus,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Sinon ego causasalutis:<note place="margin">O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </q>
And therefore if there were no more then to reuenge her
quarrell, I will bee an enemy to <hi>Lancaster,</hi> while I liue, and
am no further mooued with your vnseasonable oratory then
afraid of his menaces.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, whereas you would insinuate with our Nobles
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:2985:29"/>
and trusty friends to desist from my allegiance, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
my Nephew in his lawfull claime: you thinke belike
we are as perfidious as your selues, that seeme glad of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and turmoiles vpon the very sound of innouation: yea,
the least aduantage or disaduantage will cause you leaue
your Prince in the midst of his enemies.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, concerning your exprobration of <hi>Maximilian</hi> for
ingratitude, and not coadiuting your King in his petty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenges
vpon <hi>France:</hi> First, his great dessignes are not to be
compared to your triuiall businesse, and hauing matters of
high consequence else-where, he could not leaue them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
your weaker importunities: Secondly, he well knew it
was but a folly to assist you in any businesse of <hi>France;</hi> for as
fas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as you got it one way, you would loose it another, so that
you cannot now show any Town or Fort, either of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>
conquests, or <hi>Henry</hi> the fifts enterprises except <hi>Calice,</hi>
which lying so neere you, you cannot for shame but defend:
And thirdly, in my conscience he tooke pitty of you, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you had a warre at home to attend, and so were not able
to prosecute both encounters at once: goe back therefore
and tell your politike Prince, that whereas words are but
womens weapons to his imagination, we determine to arme
our selues, and this Prince by Gods assistance: and my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
shall bid him base in his owne Kingdome with speare and
shield, and make an equall combat the decider of both their
Titles.</p>
            <p>Last of all concerning your inuectiue against women; alas,
I smile at your schollership, and am ashamed at your poore
discretion in adapting some poeticall inuention out of fury
or despight, to your present purposes, when both the same
man, and all others of the same condition are as forward to

her, nor was it in their power to let or withstand it: For, she
was an absolute gouernour in her owne territories, and the

through the pride, couetousnesse and malicious wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

for attempting to escape by corrupting his keepers, and so to

busied his Maiesty, that he would often compare it to the
conquering of <hi>Hydra,</hi> a beast so priuiledged by nature, that
as one head was struck off, seuen others grew in the place.
For his turmoiles both at home and abroad encreased, and
he seemed as much tormented with the suspition of bosome
friends, as affrightings of forraine enemies, which so exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
him, that as he supposed to preuent the worst, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<hi>Maximilian</hi> King of the <hi>Romans</hi> had ieofaild with him

alas this was to no purpose, and in truth rather a custome
of anger, then secret of policie, as if a man because his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

for they did the like by vs, whereby the Mart being kept at

rich men murmured and were compelled to lessen their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:2985:31"/>
and abate their retinue, many Merchants felt the
losse, and the Trades-man cried out-right, because the

and the Maior of <hi>London</hi> with the principall Officers
had much adoe to appease the tumult, and this was the ninth
yeares disturbance.</p>
            <p>The King thus turmoiled euery way, repaired for diuers
reasons to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> whither shortly after came
<hi>Sir Robert Clifford</hi> vnto him, partly trusting to the Kings
promise, partly mistrusting his owne company and <hi>Perkins</hi>
weakenesse: But the chiefest polecie of his resiance in the
Tower was to secure himselfe, and lay hold of all others sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
or accused in this conspiracy, who thither resorting
to the Councell, might with ease and without any tumult be
committed to prison, as it presently fell out: For after the
King had admitted Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> and insinuated with him in
excellent positions of Diuinity, and morality by way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation,
vrging the loue and fauour of his Prince in his
true obedience and reconciliation, he not only related the
manner of <hi>Perkins</hi> proceedings, but on his knees with teare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in his eies discouered the matter to be weake and impossible,
if it had not factious supportation from some of powerfull
houses of <hi>England,</hi> and very neere his Maiesties person,
whereof though many were punished, and the rest dissipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and diuided: Yet Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> remained vnsus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and his heart trembled to accuse him: But when the
King heard Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> named,<note place="margin">Sir William Stanley ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused.</note> he started back ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and in a manner confounded, that Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was affraid
he had done him more harme in the relation, then good in
the detection.</p>
            <p>At last he burst out, what my bosome friend? my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor?

me a conquerour in the field, and by his hand I scourged ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie
out of his Throne, therefore it is impossible, and I
cannot belieue it. But when a second reply brought him to

recollected his spirits, and with these verses of <hi>Euripides,</hi>

The same night vpon better consideration my Lord <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlaine</hi>
was restrained from his liberty within the quadrant
Tower, and confined to his owne Chamber for a season:
but when the crime was openly prooued, and the Councell
had as it were with a charming hand of <hi>Hecate</hi> turned his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
outward, and found all his excuses to consist in distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and his reasons of defence manifest astipulations of the
matter, he grew out of all patience, and knew not what to
say, or to doe: For one way like an Noble Prince commise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
his subiects, he feared lest his brother Lord <hi>Thomas
Stanley</hi> the life of his first roialty, as a man should say take it
grieuously. Another way he misdoubted, lest in remitting
the fault, some other might abuse his lenity and mercy, and
be the bolder to runne forward in the dangerous courses of
further treasons: At last by the aduise of his Councell, and
generall vouge of the Court, seuerity (considering the perill
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:2985:32"/>
of those daies) tooke place,<note place="margin">Sir William Stanley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed.</note> and mercy was put backe: so
that after a solemne arraignment, he had iudgement to dye,
and accordingly was brought on the 16. of <hi>February</hi> to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer-hill,
and had his head struck off.</p>
            <p>The principall point of his enditement consisted in this,
that Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi> sware and affirmed, that he would
neuer fight nor beare Armor against the yong man <hi>Peter
Warbeck,</hi> if he knew of a truth that he was the indubitate
sonne of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, whereupon arose a coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
proofe, that he bare no good will to King <hi>Henry.</hi> Again,
the principall motiue of his distasting and murmuring at the
King, was for being denied the <hi>Earledome</hi> of <hi>Chester,</hi> when
his brother Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> was inuested with the sword of
<hi>Derby:</hi> yet the King besides many rewards, &amp; other great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
made him his chiefe <hi>Chamberlaine;</hi> what should I say? it
should seem ambition had blinded his eies, &amp; peruerted his
iudgement. For he still thought on the benefits which the
King receiued from the loue and seruice of his family, neuer
remembring the compensation and gratuities returned back
againe to him selfe, supposing that his vessell of oile should
still be filled to the brims, or else he harped on a Machiuilian
position, thankfulnesse is a burthen, but reuenge is sweete
and reckned as gaine. But it should seeme, that in possessing
King <hi>Richards</hi> treasure at the conquest of <hi>Bosworth</hi> field,
which King <hi>Henry</hi> franckly bestowed vpon him, and the
command ouer the people in the Country, he grew proud
and elated, and so vilepended the King: or from a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
melancholy reuerberating mislike and hate vpon his stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
conceits, he more and more ouer burthened his heart
with rage and despight, which as you haue heard vnpurged,
vented out those words of disloialtie to the losse of his life;
or in a word according to that of our old <hi>Tragedian:</hi>
               <q>Animorum Iupiter vindex est minis superborum,<note place="margin">Eurip, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clida.</note>

and so tooke the Kings cause in hand and vpon good
inforcement thrust him into the house of destruction. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
he could not choose but remember, how not twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:2985:33"/>
yeare before the Law had interpreted the profuse and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uish

signe of the Crowne in Cheapside, who bad his sonne learne
apace, and he would make him heire of the Crowne, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his house he dwelt in, for which he was adiudged to
die: nor forget the Story of <hi>Burdet</hi> the Esquier, within whose
Parke King <hi>Edward</hi> hunting, a white tame Hart was kild by
chance, which he had brought vp by hand, which when <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det</hi>
heard of, he wished the hornes in his belly that had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
the king to come first thither, for which he was drawne,
hanged and quartered. Thus you see there is no iesting with
Princes, nor distasting them in troublesome times, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming
in such cases on their clemency: For our <hi>Ouid</hi> tels vs:

both concerning the landing of the new Duke of
<hi>Yorke</hi> proclaimed all ready in <hi>Ireland, Richard</hi> the fourth:
and the Kings present feare and proceedings, were spread
abroad, which compelled as strange prohibitions, yea,

               </q>
so that he was farther enforced to haue many politike
searches through the whole Realme for such offenders,
and as many strong Guards and Watches for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the whole Kingdome, by which when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
the care, vigilancie and good will of the Subiect,
he entertained a greater fulnesse of contentment, and
shewed a better alacrity of spirit then his former griefes
would remit: Then he aduanced <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbuy</hi>
a man of wisedome, experience and fidelitie, to be the
<hi>Chamberlaine</hi> of his house, and haue the Guard of his

and protestation to looke to it, and all the places of their

tooke care for, was the manning of the Cinqueports, and

Whereupon hee resolued on the necessity of purging and

They arriued in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and disposed of themselues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>Now because the countrey was already infected with a

of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and that the barbarous <hi>Irish</hi> once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:2985:34"/>
they proceeded the more cautelously and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectly
in their businesse. First, assembling the Nobility and
better sort before the new Chancellour, who with all attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue
demeanour and elocution, perswaded them not onely
to persist in obedience to the King, and loyalty to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment,
but to aide and assist his Maiesties forces vnder

against such rebells, as rather through factious malice
and wilfull reuolts, then blindnesse of errour or folly had
adhered vnto <hi>Perkin,</hi> or any of his associates, in which they
knew there was reason and sufficiency of enforcement. For
amongst themselues, the petty Lords would endure no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
of soueraignty, and their Law-Tanist established
him, that for his heroike actions deserued to bee honoured,
and by his worthy endeauors obtained the jurisdiction and
inheritance. So that their owne Priests could tell them, <hi>Ex

what was it in mighty Monarchies and with regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

Therefore to auoyde the imputation of treason, and the
fearefulnesse of reuenge, from a Princes incensed indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
hee aduised them to a tenacity and strong continuance
in their loyalty.</p>
            <p>To this their answer was, as souldiers in a camp after a
mutiny, sad lookes and small repentance: faire words, but
little performance. For they all promised assurance off aith,
but no man determined the due performance, onely the
better sort, or (if you will) such as dwelled within the <hi>English</hi>
pale, or had beene enobled or enabled by the Prince, to liue
in richer forme and eminence then others: answered direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they would acknowledge no King but <hi>Henry,</hi> nor su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame

their intents: so that S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Ed. Poinings</hi> had little to say at
that time, more then hee hoped in the confidence of their
promises, and relied on their worthy integrity: yet I dare
sweare, if hee had beene examined on his conscience, and
brought to the barre of discouery for his thoughts, he would
haue cried out with the Poet:

            </p>
            <p>Whereupon hee prepared all his forces against the wilde
<hi>Irish,</hi> to whom, as hee was enformed, diuers of the rest had
fled for succour. I could heere enlarge this discourse with a
topographicall description of the countrey, and conditions
of the people, because I haue personally ouerlooked their
actions, and beene a passenger euen from one side of the
countrey to the other, but the times are full of the experience
of many men, and diuers explorations haue discouered the

nor pleasant vine-yards to refresh them with wine. Heere
were no plentifull markets to supply the salary of the army,

Corbet, Whight, Bets, Quintine,</hi> or <hi>Geuge:</hi> who were all
brought to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Pechy</hi> high Sheriffe, and so raled in ropes,
like horses drawing in a cart, sent vp to London, and there
executed in diuers places adioyning to the City, whereby
<hi>Perkin</hi> had matter of disconsolation for the time, and time
enough to saile backe againe into Flanders, to entertaine bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
aduice and more company.</p>
            <p>The King (as you heard) vnderstanding of this attempt,
left his progresse and came to London, where assured of this
good successe, he sent S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Richard Guilford</hi> into Kent to thank
the Sheriffe and the people, for their loyalty, obedience, and
valiant circumspection, which had so quickly dissipated his
enemies, and quieted the Countrey, giuing present order to
his Nauy to scowre the narrow seas, to the Prouince to keep
the coasts, to the Watches to fire the Beacons, to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
to prepare their Souldiers, and to all sorts to attend
their seuerall charges, according to the ancient and laudable
custome of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Perkin</hi> and his Captaines were arriued in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and found, how their former delaies had beene a great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacle,
and hindrance to their proceedings, they resolued to
remedy the same in their following courses, and by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
celerity and speedinesse to wipe away the blots of their
weaknesse, and faint proceedings, as if they had learned of
our Poet:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:2985:37"/>

Notwithstanding, because they were now resolued, that the
King taking notice of this on-set and attempt, would forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the Coasts, and be in a readinesse with well prepared for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
they determined to saile into <hi>Ireland,</hi>

their company, and corroborate their pretences, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
was effected, and the entertainment yeilded him
a little comfort and satisfaction: but because he well knew
the Irish were weake and vnarmed, and so vnable to preuaile
against the strength of <hi>England,</hi> and still out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and quickly daunted, when they were drawne from
their bogs, and woods to solid battailes and strong charges,
contrary to their flight, skirmishes, and running encounters,
they thought it more meete and expedient to passe into
<hi>Scotland: Gens semper inuisa Britannis,</hi> and there make triall
of a new friendship, casting vp a forward account of their
happinesse, in this manner: First they were assured of the
naturall and generall hatred betweene the Nations, which
vpon very small occasions and probable opportunite, would
burst out into flames of despight. Next, they proiected,
that the nature of the businesse would allure them to his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance,
vpon hope of vaine-glory, and a reputation of so
charitable a worke, as to help a Prince in distresse. Thirdly,
they relied on this hope, that if no other cause would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductiue
to his supportation, yet the desire of spoile would
quickly incite them to warre against so plentifull a Country.
Fourthly, they perswaded themselues, that the <hi>Scots</hi> had a
good opinion of the house of <hi>Yorke</hi> euer since the cruelty of
the Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> against <hi>Rutland,</hi> for which they vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
<hi>Henry</hi> the sixt and the Queene. And last of all,
they concluded to promise them the surrendring of <hi>Barwick,</hi>
and to enlarge their territories if he preuailed by their assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which was a sure motiue to draw them into any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
whatsoeuer: whereupon he departed from <hi>Corck</hi> and
landed on the West of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence he prepared
himselfe to go to the King with some solemnitie, wherein his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:2985:38"/>
instructions preuailed with his fortune, because for the most
part the masse of people are guided by showes and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
rather then matter of substance and truth, and so he
trauelled to <hi>Edinbourgh,</hi> whose Citizens vnaccustomed to
such glorious showes, began already to commiserate his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
and distresse: yea, the King himselfe assembled his
Lords and Courtiers, as their manner then was to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him and giue him audience; which when <hi>Perkin</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
to fall out to his good liking and hearts desire, he thus
framed his speech vnto him, or if you will reduced his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
to a manner of attracting Oratory.</p>

where there is a duty and necessity of seruice imposed: but
as a stranger subiect to shipwrack, and the hassardous endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances

enduced with your Princely delight in deeds of charitie and

And although I may confesse my selfe to resemble the man

one <hi>Samaritan</hi> to pay the cost and defray the charges of the

and powerfull coadiutement shall open their larger em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces,
considering that you aboue all other Princes haue
beene made acquainted with the distractions of our family,
and from time to time know how the house of <hi>Yorke</hi> hath
beene dilacerated, and torne in peeces by the cruell hand of
Tyrants and home-bred Wolues, which whether it were the
permission of God or the secrets of his diuine Iustice; I will
not now dispute vpon: Only, I must be bold to say, that
when my father obtained the Crowne, and reuenged his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wrongs and death, there were signes of Gods fauour
and assistance in the faire issue prepared, and sweet fruit of
such a flourishing tree, namely two sonnes and fiue daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
who were simply committed to the tutelage and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectorship
of an vnnaturall Vncle, who proued a tyrant and
destroier of our blood and progeny, so that I may well cry
out as <hi>Ariadne</hi> to <hi>Theseus:</hi>
               <q>Mitius inueni, quam te, genus omne serarum:</q>
Notwithstanding, <hi>Most mighty King,</hi> how euer my Princely
Brother miscarried, as swallowed vp in the iawes of cruelty
and slaughter, It should seeme the murtherers were affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
at that they had done already, and desisted from a full
prosecution of the Tyrants command, or confounded with
compunction of spirit spared me, and secretly conueied me
out of the hands of such an homicide and blood sucker (for
so I hope without offence I may rightly tearme him) and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
by this meanes and the supportation of high borne
<hi>Buckingham</hi> he obtained the Diadem: yet did God follow
him with the swiftest pace of wrath and anger, and at last I
must needs say, scourged him with rods of vengeance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
for he presently lost his sonne, and his friend and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adiutor
lost himselfe: what afterwards chanced vnto me, as
my strange deliuerance, my bringing vp in <hi>Tornay</hi> vnder cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

were registred in a scedule, which at your Princely pleasure
you may ouer-looke, with the Duches and Councels of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundies</hi>
hands to confirme the same: so that I confesse when
the King of <hi>France</hi> sent for me out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I was in a

            <p>When he had made an end and giuen them cause of some
amasement at his yeares and tendernesse of experience to
deliuer yet his minde so freely,<note place="margin">The King of Scots resolueth to assist Perkin.</note> and with some illustration of
words and readines of gesture, the King without any further
scruple or diffidence cheered him, telling him plainly he
would assist him, and what-euer he was, or intended to be, he
should not repent him of his comming thither, &amp; so conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with a speech of <hi>Medeas</hi> to <hi>Iason:</hi>
               <q>Hinc amor, hinc timor est, ipsum tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he gaue order for his entertainment accordingly, whereby
he had time with his wearied people to repose himselfe, and
the King, occasion to thinke of many matters: yet rather for
custome then to be diuerted from his resolutions, he called
his Councell and disputed the matter with them; they again,
(as it happened to <hi>Rheoboam,</hi> and shall be withall the Princes
in the World) grew to contradiction, and deuided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seelues,
some standing for their Countrie, some for their
priuate affection, some to please the Prince, and some to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
a good opinion of polecie, and wisedome. The grauer
sort and of greatest experience disannulled all the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
of the Prince, with the impossibility of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:2985:39"/>
as if he were but a bare assumer of titles indeed. The
quieter sort and such as had smarted with the dissentions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> disclaimed any further warr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
and were weary with that which had passed. The yonger
sort apprehended it, as a worthy enterprise, and though it
had but colour of commiseration, yet considering he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended
from the Emperour, King of the Romains, and the
whole state of the Low-Countries, it could not choose but
help them with many friends. There was another sort, who
confessing the pouerty of their Countrie, concluded, that by
this meanes by forraging, spoiling a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d getting good booties
in <hi>England,</hi> much wealth might inrich them without losse or
hindrance of their owne, and so cared not how the warre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
nor how long it continued. The last sort consisted of
such, who because they would haue their credit enlarged
from an opinion of States-men, and high reaching capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
argued (as we say) on both sides, <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> and from
a kind of Enthymema raised profit and emolument to the
Kingdome out of their sophistry: That if the Duke were
assisted and preuailed, <hi>Scotland</hi> was sure to confirme their
owne conditions: If he were countenanced, though not
preuailing, the King of <hi>England</hi> would accord to any offers
or demands, rather then King <hi>Ieames</hi> should take part with
his aduersarie and so strange a competitor.</p>
            <p>Whereupon it was resolued, that without further diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or drawing the Duches of <hi>Burgundies</hi> businesse in
question, the King should entertaine the Prince, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
honored him accordingly, and caused him to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
the Duke of <hi>Yorke,</hi> shewing him all the fauours the
Countrie could afford, and affording him such entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they imagined was both befitting his person and
condition: He againe, as if that <hi>spes bona dat vires</hi> cheered
himselfe, and assumed a new kind of behauiour, both
tempered with grauity, and yet commended for cheerefull
and well becomming: so that by the way of solace and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitation
to pleasure and delight, he hauked and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hunted,
yea, the Ladies of the Country graced the Court, and came
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:2985:40"/>
with all conueniencie and befitting their estates to the Citie.
For vnderstanding so great a Prince; in possibilitie to be one
of the mightiest Kings of Europe; not full eighteene yeares
of age, yong, wise, and in the compleate strength of beauty,
was resident amongst them, they conceiued matters beyond
the Moone, and thought themselues happy if he would
fancy or fasten vpon any of them. What should I say, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
with the Poet:
<q>Tarda solet magnis rebus inesse fides:<note place="margin">Ouid. Epist. Helena Paridi.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Yet heere was no mistrust, nor any way giuen to feare and
displeasure, but as the time, businesse, and place afforded,
shewes, masques, and sundry deuises inuited him to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment,
and the present ouercomming all pensiuenesse: so
he courted with some, danced with others,<note place="margin">The King of Scoss prouideth Perkin of a wife.</note> iested with the
rest, and was acceptable to all, till at last (the King giuing
way to the motion) he fancied the Lady <hi>Katherine Gourdon</hi>
daughter to <hi>Alexander</hi> Earle of <hi>Huntle</hi> nigh kinswoman to
the Crowne: and because she should not thinke him barren
of education, nor heart bound to his ambitious designes, he
tooke an opportunitie thus to discouer his loue vnto her,
and good opinion of her.</p>
            <p>Lady (said he) and the first of Ladies, that euer vsurped
my libertie, or taught my tongue to pronounce the accent
of affection or liking, If I proceed not so passionate as your
sex expects, or you may imagin is the custome of Courtiers,
I pray you impute it to the multiplicity of my businesse and
greatnes of my affaires: besides, it is not seemly with Princes
to betray their high spirits into the hands of deceit and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worki<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

yet, concerning your person, I can say with <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Helena.</hi>

and this kisse, because one witnesse is not sufficient, consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate

in both his hands crosse-wise, &amp; gazed vpon her with a kind
of putting her from him and pulling her to him, and so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and againe rekissed her, and set her in her place with a
prety manner of enforcement.</p>
            <p>The yong Lady pleased as well with the complement of

one of the greatest Diadems in the World) whether as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers,
who in a simpathy of liking, applauding any thing

taught before-hand what to doe, she resolued to cast away
all peeuishnesse and nicety: or indeed rauished with the thing
proposed, she was loath to be silent, considering she was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,

Wherein questionlesse they had gone forward, but that
they perceiued no ayde or succour to come from any parts
of England to restore this titular Duke. Besides, the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
(full of spoile and bloud) would goe no further, till
they had sent their presents to their wiues and children, or
returned themselues to gratifie one another, after such a

            <p>Some remember,<note place="margin">Perkin lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the English slaughters.</note> that at this time (though it was but a

any thing else: whereupon, lest his cozening and illusion

he thus complained to the Scottish King, and (as it were)
exclaimed of himselfe. O wretch and hard-hearted man
that I am, thus remorselesse to forage my natiue countrey,

cruelty and slaughter. For now I see, ere this businrsse can

Me thinkes your care is rather ridiculous then super fluous,
to bee thus dolent for another mans possessions: yea, I see
not, but your claime is so remote and disanulled, that it must
be an Herculean labour to settle you in any of their cities
and petty prouinces. But for calling England your land and
Realme, and the Inhabitants your people and subiects, it
is as wonderfull to me, as displeasing to your selfe, that in all
this time, neither Gentleman, nor man of worth hath exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a daring hand, or (if you will) commisserable arme of
assistance toward you: nay, though the warre was begun in
your name, for your sake, and within your Realme, of which
you say you are the indubitate heire, and inuited to the same
by your owne people and faction.</p>
            <p>Alas,<note place="margin">Perkins answer</note> replied the Prince, I confesse as much as you say:
but if it will please you to acknowledge the truth, the falling
backe of the King of France, yea, when I was in the speed of
my iourney, the failing of many promises to mine aunt the
Duches of Burgundy, and the defect and protraction of
my businesse, by the losse of an hundred Lords &amp; Knights,
some in their liberties, some in their liues, some from their
owne good motiues and intents, and all from their true
hearts and endeauours, by the Kings forces and vigilant eye
ouer them, hath not onely deceiued my expectation; but
(in a manner) peruerted my fortune Besides, you know
with what difficulty the nature of aduersity and men in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse,
attaine vnto any credit and estimation: so that wee
and you both haue had wofull experience of many great

Princes deposed from their thrones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and left friendlesse, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courlesse,
and quite destitute of releefe in the hands of their
enemies: and therefore, as mischeefe and misery are of mine
olde acquaintance, so am I not now vnprepared to entertaine
the same, but must submit to the calamity, and attend the
appointment of the highest God, concerning my lowest
deiection, and so I conclude with an ancient saying of
<hi>Euripides:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Turbam enim recipere me puduit,<note place="margin">Eurip. Helena.</note>

                  <l>Caedit deteriores, eo qui fuit dudum infoelix.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Although this came roundly of, and sauoured some what
better then the former: yet the King replied not at all, but
was content with his first reproofe, being more fearefull
euery day then other, that this intricate businesse would be
a worke of wonder, and to fashion the lump of such defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
to any handsome or substantiall proportion, must be
dangerous and preiudiciall for euer to the Scottish crowne.</p>
            <p>After the Nobles had beene thus startled in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
with the clamours of the people, and saw the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants

their holds,<note place="margin">They prepare in England a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Perkin.</note> mustred their forces, followed the enemies, and
certified the King of all this enterprize and inuasion, who
not a little abashed at the same, as more fearing the naturall
subiect for starting out of the sphere of his allegeance, then
any forraine comet in the greatest radiance, and presages, he
presently tooke order for the repressing of each tumults and
insurrections: but assured of the Scots retreat, and that they
were returned loden with spoiles and great riches, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
vpon another course, hauing in the meane while so great
occasions of displeasure against Scotland, that all men either
to please themselues, or animate the King in his willing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenges,
cried out to armes, to armes, and this was the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth
yeeres worke.</p>
            <p>The twelfth yeere began with a Parliament, both for the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:2985:43"/>
settling the vncertaine affaires of the Kingdome, and the
obtaining a subsidy, or other disbursements of money for
the furnishing an army into Scotland, to which all the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Gentry opened willingly their cofers, and cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
their hearts, exclaiming against their immanity, and
proclaiming their loyalty and endeauours, to prosecute
them with all reuenge, that durst so affright the Kingdome,
and affront the peace and tranquility of the Common-wealth.
Of this army, was <hi>Giles</hi> Lord <hi>Dawbney,</hi> the Kings
Chamberlaine, made Lieutenant Generall, a man of no

of no lesse hardinesse then moderation and gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But see the changes of human life, and the mischeefes
to which the best men and greatest Princes are subiect, as if

As he was marching forward with his forces,<note place="margin">Arebellionin the west diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the army out of Scotland.</note> a strange inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation

to play the wanton with <hi>Perkin</hi> on the one side, and bring

the other side try the Kings patience: A new rebellion in the
West, had like to haue beene as a heauy burthen on his
shoulders, and set in combustion the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
For when the Parliament was dissolued, and that
Commissioners were speedily sent to gather in the money,
this <hi>excande scens populus,</hi> to whom such taxes and impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
was a kinde of drawing bloud from their very life veins,
began to rebell, especially the Cornish men, inhabiting the
remotest parts of the Kingdome westward, who not onely
complained on their owne penurie and wants, as liuing in a
barren and sterile soile, ouercome with labour, watches and
toyles in the mineralls, and getting a poore maintenance
out of the cauerns of the earth, with fearefull endurances:
but threatned the officers, denying the taxes, and began te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meriously
to speake of the King himselfe: yea, when there
seemed by the Iustices &amp; others in authority, a dam to be cast
vp against this fearefull inundation, they desisted from wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manish
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:2985:44"/>
exclaimes, lamentings, and eiulations, and fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately
to malicious calumniation, threatning the
Councell, and naming <hi>Thomas Moorton</hi> Archbishop of
Canterbury, and S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Reinold Brey,</hi> as principall directours
&amp; setters forward of these impositions against them, saying
plainely, it was a shame, that a small incursion of the Scots,
which was not onely customary, but as soone extinguished
as kindled, should raise such exactions, and incite the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
to vnsufferable turmoiles, with a generall warre and
tumultuous hurliburly: to which things, when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners
would haue gently answered, and honestly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Kings purposes and prarogatiues, <hi>Thomas Flamock</hi>
a Gentleman learned in the Lawes, and <hi>Michael Ioseph</hi> a

the disorder, and correction on such persons, as were the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours

to impugne and reprooue these seditious and vnreasonable
courses, affirming plainely, that (from all examples and
times) treasons and commotions haue ended with lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
effusion of bloud, both of the authors themselues, and
many innocents made accessaries, through constrant and
wicked instigation, they were called base dastards, cowards,
fooles, and louers of ease and surquedry, more then renown,
and their countries honour and liberty: so that what with
shame of taunts and rebukes, and what with feare of the losse
of their liues and goods, they vnited themselues to this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious

where they slew the Prouost of Perin, principall Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner

such facinorous attempts, breaking out to finde fault with
men in authority, and audacious inuections against the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment:
Alas, neither can they tell, what to demand, or
what to redresse, when it shall come to true deciding indeed.
For a very confusion will hinder their resolutions, and not
knowing wherein to proceede directly, aske indirectly that
which may not be granted. As for the Gouernours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
let them be neuer so good, they shall bee sure of enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and finders of faults, let them be neuer so bad, they shall
haue flatterers and supporters; let them be indifferent, and
the good which they doe shall not be so well accepted, as the

you will, the persons may be changed, but the faults will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:2985:45"/>
and so the Prince be pleased, and mens priuate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
satisfied, who regarded the Common-wealth, or hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
a poore man for charities sake: yet I must needes say,
that many times honest Gouernours, instead of obedience
haue good will, and whosoeuer loueth his Country without
collaterall respects, may sit downe with a safe conscience, but
not vnscandalized or maligned of some of his owne rancke.
Therefore I would haue all generous spirits, either to loue
vertue for vertues sake, once placed in authority, and (in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of the world) sticke close to the sides of religion and
equity, though persecution and troubles doe follow: or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
the affecting such transcendent places, allaying the
thirst of ambition with a quiet potion of reposednesse and
contentment, and leauing the vanity of foppish obseruation

But to complaine of God or men, would rather aggrauate
his greefe, then procure his redresse, and therefore although
he well knew that Princes were the tennis-bals of fortune,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:2985:45"/>
and subiects of mutabilitie and alteration, whereas he must

there was no iying still in this deploration without the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

great policie and circumspection, not determining to giue
them battaile, or exagitate them at all till he had them farre
from their proper dwellings and flattering friends, till they
were in despaire of reliefe and wearied with long and tedious

before, to be put in practise with aduantage of many peeces
of ordnance both in Southwarke and the Suburbs, and the
strength of the Tower which they knew was reserued for the

of the Citizens being a little disturbed from their quietnesse

King without further disputing against their peeuishnesse, or

and I may truely report of the contrary: neuer was a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
so well fought and so quickly determined. For before
the King was ready to goe to dinner, there were slaine two
thousand Rebels, and many more taken prisoners, the
rest hardly escaped home; who for all their defeature, and
vncomfortable newes to the people, were rather accelerated
to reuenge their companions wrongs, then exanimated from

molestation, shewing sad lookes, but stomachous
hearts, and so remained intoxicated in their braines, and
ready vpon euery occasion to a new rebellion, as you shall
heare hereafter.</p>
            <p>When this battaile was ended, and so delicately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triued
(for the King lost not aboue foure hundred men)
some imputed it to the Kings policy, who appointing the
same on Monday, by way of anticipation fell vpon them on
Saterday, and so taking them somewhat vnprouided, had
the fortune to preuaile and thriue in his aduantage: Such as
were taken and apprehended had their pardon, except the
principall and fire-brands of the mischiefe: For the Lord
<hi>Audeley</hi> was drawne from Newgate to the Tower-Hill in
a Coat of his owne armes painted vpon paper reuersed and
all to torne,<note place="margin">Lord Audeley executed.</note> and there beheaded the 28. of <hi>Iune. Thomas
Flamoch</hi> and <hi>Michael Ioseph</hi> were executed after the order
of Traitors, and their quarters sent into <hi>Cornwall</hi> for
the terrifying of the people, some were dispatched at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Townes as they deserued: amongst whom the Smith,
and diuers others of his immodest friends had no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
to make for this rebellion, but whether they preuailed
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:2985:48"/>
or no, they were sure to be registred to eternity for daring to
doe somewhat in behalfe of their Countries liberty, and bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
battaile to Kings and Princes at their Pallace Gates,
and before the Citie Wals, euen <hi>London</hi> it selfe, that great
Citie, the Chamber for their treasury, and strength of their
roialtie: which makes me remember a saying of <hi>Lucan:</hi>

and this was the end of the twelfth yeare.</p>
            <p>In this time you must know, that the King of Scots lay

Watch and Ward, and stood on the pinacles of a high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
to encounter with the proudest forces of <hi>England;</hi>
yea, to giue defiance if need were to the King himselfe.
Notwithstanding, he now lay a while only at defence, wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
with what warde the English would breake vpon him,
and wondring at my Lord <hi>Dawbneis</hi> retraction, and why he
came not forward as his espials had aduertised: but when
he vnderstood of the Westerne rebellion, he then conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
the truth, and a while reposed himselfe, till a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of these Westerne men came vnto <hi>Perkin</hi> and profered
their obedience and endeuours, if he would come and ioine
his Army with theirs, and so as their Prince and Captaine,
reuenge there wrongs: this was motioned to King <hi>Ieames,</hi>
who for all he confessed, that if they would ioine with the
Cornish men, there might be a gate open indeed to preuaile,
and walke in the fields of Victorie: yet he would by no
meanes aduenture his people so farre, and confessed plainly
he wanted ships for transporting so great an Army into those

parts: Only, because he would be doing to please the suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

word of the siedge, and inuiting the Earle of <hi>Surrey</hi> to come

he furnished a hansome Nauy at Sea, whereof the

should chance: But when the King of Scots and his

Earle of <hi>Surreis</hi> approach, and that the Lord <hi>Dawbenies</hi> army
was also integrat and vnbroken, yea, ready to march for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Thirdly, for the towne of Barwicke, it was none of his, but
the King his masters, which hee would not so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vpon without his consent and aduice, as he himselfe
might well iudge in the affaires of Princes, what was to bee
done. Fourthly, hee thought his owne life worth all the
townes of the world, and so would gladly hazard himselfe;
yea, was proud (as hee said before) that so great a Maiesty
would parallel him in such a kinde, onely he desired pardon
for a little vaine-glory, that if hee conquered the King, hee
would release him freely; if the King vanquished him, hee
would either yeeld him his life, or pay such a tribute and
competency, as is befitting the state and degree of an Earle,
to all which he was the rather induced, because he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
that
<q>Causa iubet melior superos sperare secundos:</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it should seeme, these affronts were meere flourishes:
For neither battell, nor combat, nor any enterprize worth
the recording was put in practise, although the English for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
had layen long in the Countrey to the same purpose:
wherupon the Lord Generall, loth to spend his time so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerately,
and somewhat wearied with the distempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Climate, and vnseasonablenesse of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> weather,
the Countrey affoording nothing but mists and foggs at
this time of the yeere, raised his camp, and retired to Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicke.
But when the truth was further enlarged, the King
commauded him so to doe by his letters of priuate intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.
For now came a time, in which the windowes of
heauen seemed to open, and the God of mercy thought to
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:2985:50"/>
recompence his patience and goodnesse, with a quiet end of
his troubles, and happy successe in his enterprizes, which
fell out vpon this occasion.</p>

as an Embassadour to <hi>Iames</hi> King of Scots by way of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation

clowds of mischeefe and disturbance, which by some effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
heat from the King of Englands breath must bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued
and dissipated, and therefore hee wrote to King
<hi>Henry,</hi> that if it would please him to send some worthy man
to be his associate in this enterprize, he perswaded himselfe,
that an honest oratory would quickly conclude the profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

found by some experience, that

For the King of Scots had already protested, hee was onely
emulous of King <hi>Henries</hi> vertues, and not maligned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spighted
his person, and for <hi>Perkins</hi> title he made it a matter
of conscience and charity. For he knewe him the right heire,
if he were the right creature, and the Cleargy warranted the

it was only the chance and fortune of encounters, the action

               </gap>es
raised, many greeuances vrged, and many conclusions ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued:
but because they failed in the maine poynt, nothing
was determined. For the King of England required <hi>Perkin
Warbeck</hi> to bee deliuered into his hands, as the principall
fountaine of this venomous streame, the cheefe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ccasion of
his vnquietnesse, the perturber of his Realme, the seducer
of his subiects, and the author of many rebeilions. But the
King of Scots (like a Prince indeed) would not buy his peace
with the bloud of Innocents, especially a man comming to
him for succour, shewing all the markes of a distressed and
abused Prince, allied vnto him by marriage, commended by
the Emperor, assisted by the Duches of Burgundy, &amp; in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:2985:51"/>
of faire demeanour, sweet behauiour, and of a most
royall and well esteemed spirit. Therefore (I say) he would
by no meanes betray him into the hands of his enemies, that
was so long admitted into the bosome of his friends, nor
should it bee sayd, that in any such degree, for any wordly
respect whatsoeuer, King <hi>Iames</hi> of Scotland would bee base
or perfidious, which he had learned from the example and
punishment of <hi>Prusias</hi> King of Bithynia, whom the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
deposed, for consenting to betray <hi>Hanibal</hi> into their
hands, though they had promised large rewards, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
seuere vengeance.</p>
            <p>The Commissioners answered directly, that they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not by way of defamation, or contumelious discouery
of the vanity of the man, or impossibility of his businesse to
make him odious or corroborate their owne purposes, by
the destruction of so silly a creature, or discrediting so poore
a businesse: but meerely to shew the truth, and vnfold the
secrets of the deceit, that such a Prince as King <hi>Iames,</hi> might
not be colluded with shadowes and apparitions, but orderly
drawen into this holy and generall league, wherein both
Emperour, France and Spaine desireth a combination of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
with England, onely there wanted himselfe to make
the number compleat, that the horne of <hi>Achelous</hi> might bee
sent from nation to nation, from kingdom to kingdom. For
I can assure you, the Marchants of England haue been recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
into Antwerp with generall procession, the Emperor is
pleased with this combination, the King of Spaine preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
a marriage, the King of France endeauoureth a league,
and all the Princes of Europe seeke after a true confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of quietnesse. Therefore once againe, be not an enemy
to the good of all Christendome, nor so aduerse to this holy
combination, that the world shall rather esteeme you wilfull
and preiudicate, then wise and considerate.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding all this forcible and effectuall intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the King of Scots would not consent to deliuer <hi>Perkin</hi>
               <note place="margin">The King of Scots will not deliuer Perkin.</note>
vpon any condition, but as hee came to him for refuge, hee

worse case then the bruit beasts, or vildest condition of men,
as he had learned long since out of that ancient Tragedian:

                  <l>Non est quicquam perpetuò beatum.</l>
               </q>
Yet with much adoe hee was brought to a truce for certaine
yeeres, and condescended to this, that <hi>Perkin</hi> should bee no
longer succoured, harboured, or maintained by him, or in
his territories and dominions: with which answer, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
ratification of the same, the Embassadours departed,
the Armies retired, the Souldiers discharged, the King of
England satisfied, the Orators of France (who from Do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and of all others the worthy <hi>Peter Hialos,</hi> as principall

recompenced.</p>
            <p>Only poore <hi>Perkin,</hi> whose glorious meteor began now to
bee exhaled, seemed disconsolate and examinated at this
newes and determination, especially when King <hi>Iames</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to expostulate and reason the matter with him. First,
from a repetition of the benefits and fauours receiued by his
Princely liberality and gentlenesse. Secondly, from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanguinity,
in marrying his kinswoman vpon dangerous
hopes and triuiall aduentures. Thirdly, from his many tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls
of sundry conflicts in England, proouing all his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fourthly, vpon the now combination of amity with
all the Princes of Europe, which could not be done without
the King of Englands consent and agreement. Fiftly, vpon
the fatherly regard of his Countrey, which had neede haue
some breathing time of ease and rest, and must questionlesse
take a loue day of consolation and desisting from turmoiles.
Last of al, from the care of the Religion &amp; Mother-Church,
vnto whose obedience and regard hee was now absolutely
sworne: Therfore he desired him to take some other course,
and depart out of his Realme. For (as hee heard) hee was
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:2985:52"/>
now interessed in the confederacy of the peace of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

               </gap>ious
Prince, hee could in no sort infringe the conditions, nor
breake the truce combined by a firme and vnseparable adiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Perkin</hi> had heard him out, although euery word
was worse then the croking of some night-rauen or scrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owle,
and the amazement (for the time) might haue much
disabled him: yet loth to discredit his cause by any demis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
or pusillanimity, and seeing all answers were superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and the very messengers of despaire and disconsolation,
he raised himselfe with some outward cheerefulnesse, and as
well to auoyd ingratitude toward so great a Benefactour, as
to countenance himselfe and his businesse, he thus casting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all feare and abashing timidity, replied.</p>
            <p>Most worthy Prince:

in regard of the many fauours your Princelinesse hath hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped

to bee too too troublesome or offensiue vnto so benigne a

poure out my selfe, and spend my life most profusely for
your sake. Onely this I must entreat at your hands, to giue
me leaue to rigg and calcke vp my ships, and gather together
that dispersed company I haue, or such as would willingly

            <p>He had not beene long in Ireland, but his false fortune
began once againe to play with him, as flattering him with

would welcome and entertaine him, from whom he had this
notice: that they could not forget their former iniuries
and slaughters, nor determined a setled and true obedience
to the Lancastrian family: whereupon because something

running after newfangled toies or painted pictures:
submitted to his princelines, and sware with all allegeance to

company after they had taken the musters of his Army, and
concluded to get some strong Townes into their possession,
that so they might not only augment their forces, but still
haue places of supportation and refuge to retire vnto, they
went directly to <hi>Excester,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Perkin besied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth Excester.</note> and besiedged it. But because they
wanted ordnance to make a battery, and other prouision to
raise their trenches, and approches, or indeed if you will,
were ignorant of martiall discipline, and the secrets of a true
Soldiers profession, they spent the more time against the
Gates, and endeauoured nothing but a forcible entrance,
assaulting the same with great peeces of timber like the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

But the Citizens manfully defended themselues, and held it

&amp; acquaint him with their distresse. In a mean while seeing
a fire made vnder their Gates, and that the enemies fury en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased,
they suspected themselues, &amp; had no other shift but
to put force to force, &amp; with one fire extinguish, or if you will

were compelled to desist from that worke, and apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues

assaulted, but the worthy Citizens defended them with
that courage, and countermanding: that they slew aboue
two hundred Soldiers in that fury, and behaued themselues

<hi>Taunton,</hi> where he mustred them a new, but found a great
want of his company: For many of his desperate followers
were slaine and cut off: many of the honester and ciuiler

that very few resorted vnto him, contrarie to his former flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,

home: many wery of the wars, and coniecturing an impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility,
to remoue a king so firmely established, or terrifyed
with the punishment impending on Treason, and presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
rebellion, left him to his fortunes, and many politike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forecasting for the worst, seeing not one of the nobility or
better sort to afford a helping hand to the lifting vp of this

raise the siege of Exester, which not onely animated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged

            <p>When the King approached the towne of Tawnton,
whether out of policie not to hazard the whole army at
once, or out of suspicion of some reuolters in his company,
or humbly considering there might be a turning of Fortunes
wheele, as still <hi>Rota fortunae in Gyro</hi> in the encounters of a

For poore <hi>Perkin</hi> (desperate of his fortunes, and quite

            <p>O what a God art thou! that canst one way humble settled
Princes, with the very shadowes of perill and danger, making
them confesse their frailty and ticklish estate of mortality, by
the seuerall encumbrances and mischeefes, to which they are
subiect: and another way confound the mightiest proiects,
and annihilate their enterprizes, turning all actions and
mountaines of pride, sedition, conspiracies and ambition,
to powder and dust, and then blowing it away like smoake
and vapour: and another way protect the right of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

they least thinke of it, or know to helpe and aduance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues:
and another way whip with the rods of vengeance,
the freneticall and vaine multitude, who know nothing,
but rudenesse and clamorous outcries, nor practize any

the Treasure house of reward, and honour amongst them,

But as I said he now only recounted the difficult passages
of his former trauailes, the dangers escaped, the deceit
pretended, the perill imminent, and the misfortune too-too
apparant, as being in no securitie in the place, he was
fled vnto, nor hauing any confidence in the persons, he
had chosen: For though he knew there was a reuerence
appropriate to sanctuaries; yet kings, if they pleased, vvill
be tied neither to law nor Religion, but performe what
they list, or vnder colour of their owne security, say they
are compelled vnto: Therefore without any further ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauation,<note place="margin">Perkin submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet, to the King.</note>
relying on the Kings Pardon, and those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
conditions propounded, he voluntarily resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
himselfe, and came to his maiesty, as a messenger
of glad tidings, that now all warres, troubles, and
commotions were by this meanes ended and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>The King not much wondred at him: for he only found
him superficially instructed of a naturall wit, of reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
qualities, wel languaged and indifferent apprehension,
but farre from that highnesse of spirit, or heroick dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to deserue the character of a Prince, or lay claime
to a Diadem: yet loth with any boisterous strength to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:2985:57"/>
handle a bruized arme, or draw the feltow into a new
selfe-loue, or good opinion of himselfe, hee passed ouer
his examination the slightlier, and brought him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to London, being met all the way with great co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of people, who both came to gratifie him and his
auspicious successe, and to see <hi>Perkin</hi> like some strange
meteor or monster: or, if you will, because wee will deale
more cleanlier with him, like a triumphant spectacle, to
mooue amazement, delight and contentment, according
to that saying of our Poet:
<q>Nocte pluit tota, redeunt spectacula manè:</q>
            </p>
            <p>But when they began to capitulate, that being a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and an alien borne, hee durst not onely abuse so many
Princes and Common-wealths with lies, fictions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable
deceit: but euen bid battell to Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
yea, bring Kings and Princes into the field for his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
they fell from wondring at him, to raile and abuse
him, both with checkes and opprobrious taunts: yea, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
dared to put in practise many vndecencies, both of
rage and indignation, had not the reuerence of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
presence diuerted their inconsideration, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
no further rumour, gazing vpon him, or violent
threatnings against him. To conclude, the King brought
him quietly to London, and for all he had giuen him life,
and affoorded him a kinde of liberty: yet did hee set a
guard ouer him, that hee could neither haue free confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
nor doe what he wantonly listed without them.</p>
            <p>By this time you must consider, that Lady <hi>Margaret</hi>
in Flanders, Duches Dowager of Burgundy, was not so
ill befriended, or negligent in her owne affaires, but
shee had both intelligence from England, and espialls
of her owne, to acquaint her with all occurrences and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentures,<note place="margin">Lady Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with this discomfortable newes.</note>
as they chanced. But whether it was a newes
to her of bitternesse, and tormenting despight, or no;
let them iudge, that make their stomackes and inward
faculties a store-house of rankour and malice, and

Premit:</hi> yet was she not tormented so much with the losse,
expences, or disaster of the businesse, which might be the
chance of warre, as in that shee could not preuaile in her
malignant courses, against her enemy the house of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster:
So that shee bemoaned the lamentable successe of
her vnfortunate darling, and (as many did testifie) euen
shed teares againe; but they were so farre from co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or penitency, that they seemed rather signes of
rage, frenzy, and intollerable madnesse, in which shee
cried out on nothing, but reuenge: and repeated an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of <hi>Hermiones</hi> against <hi>Orestes:</hi>

So that if shee had had power to her implacable hatred,
K. <hi>Henry</hi> should haue felt the scourges of her wrathfull
hand, euen to the lowest deiection, and she had question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
shewed him a tricke of a womans will, or (if I might
speake without offence) wickednesse.</p>
            <p>In this while <hi>Perkin</hi> hauing two yeeres liberty to rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
on his businesse, and swell vp his vexed soule with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable
commemoration of precedent misfortunes,
would many times cast out abrupt and vncertaine spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
concerning his distresse, and the maleuolent aspect
of his fate, cursing his miserable life, and complaining on
his vnprofitable <hi>Genius,</hi> that had stood him in no better
steed, wishing hee had beene borne to any mechanicall
drudgery, rather then from the royall bloud of <hi>Plantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:</hi>
Insomuch, that his keepers mistrusted him in these
extasies, and the King was still troubled, that hee could
neither make him confesse the truth, nor disclaime this
high assumption of another dignity and royalty. But at
last, as all such discontentments and eruptions must haue
avent, and so a determination, whether the opprobry of
this kinde of imprisonment greeued him, or the vnquiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his thoughts vexed him, or the basenesse of his
submission abused him, or the losse of his sweet wife
confounded him, or the instigations of others disturbed
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:2985:58"/>
him: or indeede, because the last act of his Tragedy and
Catastrophe was now in hand, he not onely studied which
way to escape; but put the same in practise in despight of
his owne knowledge, that the King was acquainted with
all his discontentments. For alas; Princes haue long
hands and prying lookes, to reach into the furthest parts
of their Kingdome, and search into the secretest close<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>est regions. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
himselfe, his vaine suppositions, as in his former
enterprizes, still flattered him, that he should once againe
finde fuell enough, to set another rebellion and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on fire: and his vexation to bee bereaued of so deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
a creature as his Lady, made him desperate of all,
and set his wits on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>enter-hookes, to put some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in practise to his further contentment. So that one
day reading the story of <hi>Mortymers</hi> escape out of the
Tower, by giuing his keepers a sleepy drinke, he in such a
manner deceiueth his guard, and betooke him to a resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of escaping and flying out of the land, wherein hee
prooued onely like the silly bird, that with striuing in the
net, entangles herselfe the more: or, as Deere that are
hunted, betray themselues to well-sented hounds, by their
faster running away, whereby they make the deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
in their steps: So fell it out with him,
<q>Incidit in Scyllam, cupiens vitare Charybdim:</q>
And by seeking after liberty, hee brought himselfe to a
more straighter and vnkindlier endurance. For when hee
had gone to the sea-coasts, aud heard the exclamations of
the people against him, saw all places debarred, knew
great searches made for him, vnderstood what an indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Countrey had conceiued of his mockeries and
illusions, and found the whole Kingdome vp in his search,
and posting after him, he was quite exanimated, and (like
a man distracted) knew not what to do. At last, vnstable
in his former wilfulnesse, he once againe altred his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
iourney, and came to the house of Bethelem, called
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:2985:59"/>
the Priory of Shene,<note place="margin">Perkin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the Prior of Shene.</note> beside Richmond in Surrey, and
committed himselfe to the Prior, with a long and secret
conference, concluding with an impetration of his charity,
that being a man of God, hee would not thinke it strange
to see Princes subiect to disasters and fatall conclusions of
misfortune. For he well knew the story, both of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of Westminster and the Bishop of Carlile, who in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spight
of King <hi>Henries</hi> vsurpation, who had not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected
the deliuery of <hi>Richard</hi> of Burdeaux; but opposed
the King in his strength of soueraignty, against his wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to destroy the other deposed: and therefore he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him to obtaine his pardon of the King, yeelding for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible
intimation for the same purpose.</p>
            <p>The Prior (glad to haue interest in such a meritorious
worke, and proud to bee seruiceable to his Prince and
Countrey) came with conuenient speed to the Court, and
acquainted his Maiewy with the accident, leauing no cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
of any validity vnrecounted, which ended to
the Kings wonderfull content, and the whole Courts dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
and amazement. But all times are not alike, and
Princes (in their mercies &amp; pardons) are not so flexible, as
presumption buildeth vpon: Yet to please the Prior, hee
gaue him his life, which to a generous and free borne spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was more irksome then death. For hee was first taken
and brought to Westminster with all scorne and repr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

then set in a paire off stockes with contumelious derision,
then carried through all the streets of London like a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious

<hi>Iohn Steinbeck,</hi> with whom I remained a full halfe yeare,
but by reason of the wars I returned to Tourney, where I
was placed with M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barlo,</hi> who within another yeere car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
me to the mart at Antwerp, where I fell sicke awhile,
and so was boorded in a Skinners house much conuersant
with the English nation, whereby I learnt the language,
as you see. From thence I went to Barrow mart, &amp; lodged
at the old man: Afterward, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Barlo,</hi> left me at Middle-borough
with <hi>Iohn Strew</hi> a Merchant, who first made me
beleeue, I was better then I was. From Antwerp I sailed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

sonne to <hi>George</hi> Duke of Clarence formerly in Ireland,
which <hi>Iohn Le Wellin</hi> the Maior maintained, and for as
much as my deniall was contrary to their expectation,
they brought me to the crosse, and made me sweare: which
I did, disclaiming him, or any of his kinred, vntill <hi>Stephen
Poitron,</hi> with <hi>Iohn a Water</hi> came vnto me, as resolued I
was King <hi>Richards</hi> bastard-sonne (then in the hands of the
King of England) perswading mee not to bee afraid or
daunted at any thing: For they would ayd me &amp; assist me,
euen to the obtaining the crowne of England; yea, they
knew of their owne knowledge, the Earles of Desmond
and Kildare were ready to aduenture their liues and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
for my sake: After this they carried mee into Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
to Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Regent and Duches of Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
who preuailed so far with me, that I took vpon me the
person of <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of Yorke, second sonne of King
<hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, and so with reasonable preparation, I
returned backe againe into Ireland, where the sayd <hi>Iohn a

dangerous rebellion, and I was proclaimed by them <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the fourth. From hence the King of France sent for
me by <hi>Loyte Lucas</hi> and <hi>Stophen Frian,</hi> but making peace
with England, he left me to my fortunes: Then I sayled
into Flanders, where my supposed Aunt made more of
me then before, so I attempted England, but was driuen

Scotland, and from thence againe into Ireland, and so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>When the people had heard him out, they wondred

feare of life hee confessed the contrary, being the true

they wondred if any man could bee so base, as to deiect
himselfe to such ignominy and opprobrious disgraces,
when to die had been honorable, &amp; to sell ones life in the
field, far better then to plead on a scaffold, where the many
changes must needs distract him, and make a poore soule
neither fit for life nor death: But whatsoeuer he was, they
could not chuse but deplore his estate and misfortune, as
naturally and ordinarily all men are bemoaned in aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
especially such an one, that was so forward in the race
and iourney to Maiesty, and pulled backe so often by the
sleeue, and turned with a fury into the house of desolation,
and dungeon of disconsolate wretchednesse when to haue
perished at once, had beene a fauour of death and fortune
