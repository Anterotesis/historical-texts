            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>CVCKOLDOM, that bugbear Misfortune, (in former Days, as
terrible to a Courtier as his Prince's Frowns, and more dreadful
to an old Citizen than Popery and Slavery) is now advanc'd to such
Dignity, that it's crept into great Mens Families; and often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the serious Consideration of our grave Senate: and is so far from being
thought Scandalous in this Age, that it's grown the most useful Liberty ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
in a Married State, and serves, upon Occasion, to dissolve that
Gordion-Knot, which the Priest so craftily tyes, to the Misfortune of many
Thousands, who have unwarily fallen under the fatal Conjunction.</p>
            <p>Were it not in a Womans power to recompence the Slavery of her servile
Station, and revenge the Affronts, and cool Neglects, she is under a conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Necessity of enduring from her Husband, what charming Innocence, at
Eighteen, would for the sake of Coach and Horses, or a plentiful Table, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
an old wither'd Hand to crop the Flower of her Virginity, and waste her
Youth and Beauty in the fruitless Embraces, and under the peevish Checks
and Snubs of old Age, Iealousy, and Impotence? What can such a Compound
of Infirmities, made an Eunach in his Age by the Debaucheries of his Youth,
expect from a Wife, possess'd of all the Charms and Perfections that can be
lodg'd by Nature in blooming Iuvenility? Which none but the powerful Nerves
of a strenuous Lover is truly capable of enjoying.</p>
            <p>Would Parents in the Disposal of their Children, but match 'em with as
much care as they do their Dogs or Horses, it would, in a great measure, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
preserve the State of Matrimony from any Adult'rous Invasion; For
what true Northern Breeder will endure an old surfeited Iade, Spavin'd,
Founder'd, and Wind-gaul'd, to Leap his Hunting Favourite? Or suffer his
fine shap'd Greyhound to Bastardise her Breed with an old mangy Mungril?
Yet perhaps his handsome Daughter must be thrown away upon some old mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serly
Curmudgeon, who only Marrys to palliate his Gouty Pains, and cherish his
feeble Carcass in the Winter of his Age, by her warm enlivening Touches, and
counterfeit Embraces.</p>
            <p>It is certainly an unnatural Imposition upon the fair Sex, to be thus dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
on; and though their worldly Interest, Obedience to Parents, or Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
of Relations, may prevail upon 'em to put Nature in Masquerade, and
seem to be well-pleased with their wrinkl'd Fumbler; yet, I do not question,
but the poor young Bride, who labours under these Hardships, will soon find a
way to communicate her Distress to some faithful Confident, who may, without
any great Injury to his Conscience, at once gratify both the reasonable Desires
of Youth, and justly reward the Folly and Lasciviousness of Age who desires
to ingross that Blessing, to which (says the Law of Nature) no Priest can give
<pb facs="tcp:102405:3"/>
him an equitable Title; for if the Disproportion be so great as between Fifty
and Fifteen, the Church may tye their Hands, 'tis true, but their Hearts
are incapable of Vnion. I heartily pity that young Lady, who, either for
want of Discretion in her Parents, or her self, has unhappily cast her Pearl
before a Swine, who, knowing not how to use it, gives her just Provocation to
dispose of the precious Iewel to him, who will convert it to tis natural Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
and to him that it's most Vseful, before it will be most Valuable.</p>
            <p>As to the following Poem, I shall say nothing of it in the Preface; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hope, The Newness of the Subject, and the Pertinency of the Matter, will
be sufficient to recommend it to an ingenious Reader: So having thought fit
to give you this little Hint, I shall proceed to wind up the bottom of the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispiece,
with a Concise Character of a Cernuted Fumbler.</p>

         <div type="introduction">
            <head>A
CUCKOLD</head>
            <p>IS an Artificial Monster, patch'd up between Action and Forbearance,
who by his own Impotence, and his Wife's Incontinence, is soon
brought to Perfection: If he be Jealous, he is always in search of that
which he fears to find; if he be not; his Horns are generally visible to
every body, but himself; he usually lays the Egg of his own Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
and his Wife hatches it; his Fondness makes her Slighting; his
ill Usage, makes her Revengeful; his Imprudence, makes her Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
his giving Opportunity, makes her improve it; his Negligence,
makes her Mistrustful; and his Insufficiency, makes her Insatiate. There
is generally a Mist between his Eyes and his Wife's Failings; he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
foolishly Fond, and can't see; or else prudently Patient, and won't
see; he is very forward to asperse another with the same Calumny, and
will, by no means, believe himself under the like Predicament, tho' he
knows it to be true. If he carrys not his Wife to every public Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
he thinks he breaks an Article of Matrimony: Thus leads
her himself into the Path of Liberty, and is afterward Angry that she
takes it. He is commonly more in Love with the Cuckoldmaker, than
his Wife, and dare trust his Friend any where with her, and 'tis he that
Cuckolds him. He's a Man of Note among both Sexes, and talk'd on
more in the Parish where he lives, than the Parson; if he be a Trader,
and his Wife be pretty, he's sure to have a good Trade, for he has one
Commodity that helps off with the rest. He is either a good-natur'd
Fool, or an ill-natur'd Knave; for Extreams in Fondness, or severe
Usage, are the two main Causes of CUCKOLDOM.</p>
