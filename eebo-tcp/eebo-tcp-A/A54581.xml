            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the <hi>Historian</hi> hath told us of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that long ago while the Arts and Sciences were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally banish'd from the Christian World they were enthroned in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that Men were sent thither from other Parts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom to be improved in Learning; so I have elsewhere observ'd that in some late Conjunctures (and particularly during the turbid Interval of the <hi>Exclusion</hi>) men might well be sent to <hi>Scotland</hi> to learn <hi>Loyalty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I having taken occasion in the first Part of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to shew my self a just honourer of that Country, and (as I may say) somewhat like a Benefactor to it by sending thither the notices of some pass'd great Transactions that might possibly there give more light and life to the Moral Offices of Natural Allegiance or Obedience, did hold my self obliged in Common Justice to address this Part of my Work to your Lordship. For as your Station here quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies you beyond other Subjects to receive what Tribute is offer'd to your Country, so your handing it thither will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily make it there the more acceptable.</p>
            <p>And when I consider with what an incomparable Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for the Monarchy and its Rights so many of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> since the <hi>Year</hi> 1660. have been adorn'd, I am apt to think that any matter of Presidents or Records by me recover'd out of the Sea of time where they lay so long useless and neglected, and now happening to be serviceable
<pb facs="tcp:34919:3"/>
to those Moral Offices before-mention'd, would by the so many in that Kingdom devoted to consummate Obedience and Loyalty, be more valued then if I could have imported into that Realm another such Treasure as that which lay so long buried in the <hi>Ocean</hi> near the <hi>Bahama Islands,</hi> and that whoever Contributed to your Loyal Country any Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Notions that might enrich it in the discharge of the Duties of the <hi>born</hi> and <hi>sworn</hi> Allegiance, would be esteem'd there as some way sharing in the honour of <hi>Arauna,</hi> in <hi>giving like a King to a King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long may your great Master live happy in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the faithful Services of so vigilant a Minister as your Lordship, who by the universality of your Knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd with universal Charity for all Mankind, have appear'd to be born, as I may say, for the time of his most glorious Reign, the time chosen by Heaven for Mercies Triumph on Earth.</p>
            <p>Nothing vulgar was to be expected from a Person of your Lordship's extraordinary intellectual and moral Endowments, and in whom the <hi>Loyalty</hi> and other Virtues of your many noble Ancestors have (as it were) lived <hi>extraduce.</hi> And the World would be unjust to you if it acknowledged not its great Expectation answer'd by your greater Performances, and particularly by your having been so eminently Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial in the Easing both the Cares of your Prince, and of all his Subjects too by the Figure you have made in promoting the Ease of his People's Consciences, and in further enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and endearing the Name of <hi>DRUMMOND</hi> by your Lordship's Prosecuting that by the Bravery of Action, which the <hi>HISTORIAN</hi> of that your Name did by Words, when he transmitted to Posterity the most Christian and Statesman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Speech</hi> of Liberty of Conscience, I know extant, and as spoke by a <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Councellor in <hi>Scotland</hi> to King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Fifth.</hi>

               <p>But how tenderly the <hi>Consciences</hi> of the Roman Catholics in <hi>Ireland</hi> were in the Reign of the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> THEN Protected under the <hi>Wing</hi> of the <hi>Dispensative Power,</hi> contrary to what the <hi>Dr.</hi> observ'd, any one may see who will Consult <hi>my Lord Primate</hi> Bramhal's <hi>Replication to the Bishop of Chalcedon,</hi> where he saith, That <hi>the Earl of</hi> Strafford <hi>Lord Lieutenant of</hi> Ireland <hi>did commit much to my hands the Political Regiment of that Church for the space of Eight years.

                  <hi>ERASTIANISM</hi> (a <hi>Tenet,</hi> or <hi>hypothesis</hi> of Church-Government that the <hi>Scotch</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Presbyterian <hi>Divines</hi> avowed as great an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of as of <hi>Popery</hi> it self; <hi>Erastianism</hi> giving the <hi>Supreme</hi> Power in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticals to the <hi>Civil</hi> Magistrate) and in their Printed <hi>Votes</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> reproved the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Divines for challenging an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power, and which they would not grant, <hi>nor set up ten Thousand Iudicatories within the Kingdom,</hi> as the <hi>Parliaments</hi> words were: referring to the Scots <hi>Parechial</hi> Session, where a competent number of <hi>Lay-Elders</hi> (whom they call <hi>Presbyteri non docentes</hi>) and <hi>Deacons</hi> proportionable to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct and Extent of the Parish are conjoyn'd, and which associate Body thus compacted is the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Parochial <hi>Sanhedrim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this very <hi>first</hi> Point of that Church-Government, the Parliament hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd Presbytery from gaining here, and opposed its moving in that lowest Sphere of the <hi>Parochial</hi> Session of setling so many Thousand Ecclesiastical <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Pye-Powder</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and whereby it could never hope to climb up to the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of a <hi>General Assembly,</hi> which in reality was the <hi>Sphere</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> it self moved in.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> who was one of the greatest Champions for that <hi>Covenant,</hi> was yet an Eminent profess'd <hi>Erastian,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> a Member of the <hi>Assembly</hi> of Divines, another of those Champions for the <hi>Covenant,</hi> was likewise a declared <hi>Erastian,</hi> and a great <hi>Favourite</hi> of the Parliaments, and whose frequent <hi>Sermons</hi> before them for <hi>Erastianism</hi> were Printed by their Order; and which <hi>Sermons</hi> of his,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and likewise his Books writ for it were with great heat impugned in <hi>Print</hi> by Mr. <hi>Gillespy</hi> a <hi>Divine</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and one of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> in <hi>England</hi> for that Kingdom: and who in a Printed <hi>Sermon</hi> of his Preach'd before the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> doth call <hi>Erastus <hi>the great Adversary;</hi>
                  </hi> and in one of his <hi>Pamphlets</hi> against Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> call'd <hi>Nihil Respondes,</hi> mentions how <hi>the Presbyterians and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents were both equally interessed against the Erastian Principles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the greatness of the number of the <hi>Covenanters</hi> out of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> that rejected the <hi>Iure-divinity</hi> of the <hi>Scots</hi> ruling <hi>Elders,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> gives us his Judgment in <hi>p.</hi> 12. of his <hi>Reply to Nihil Respondes,</hi> viz. that 9/10 <hi>of the Assembly, and</hi> 900/1000 <hi>of the Kingdom denyed a Ruling Elder to be an instituted Officer</hi> jure divino.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Heylin</hi> having told us in his <hi>History of Presbytery,</hi> That <hi>Presbytery did never setle its Lay-Eldership in any one Parish in</hi> England: we may easily thence suppose the <hi>National</hi> Violation of that National <hi>Covenant,</hi> without any apparent regret of Conscience on that account.</p>
               <p>How all the <hi>Independent</hi> Clergy and Layety who had took the <hi>Covenant</hi> did in a manner <hi>simul &amp; semel</hi> most notoriously violate it, in setting up the <hi>model</hi> of their Church-Government is not unknown.</p>
               <p>But indeed, as the very sagacious <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi> call'd, <hi>The main Points of Church-Government,</hi> &amp;c. Printed in <hi>London,</hi> A. 1649. hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, <hi>The known sense of the Scotish Nation which framed the Covenant, and for whose Satisfaction the Covenant was here taken, doth include Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency under the name of Schism, or at least under those words contrary to sound Doctrine; and our Independent Divines could not but know this to be their sense of it, and yet we know of none that did protest against it, or explain themselves otherwise at the first taking of the Covenant, if they have done it since.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I might further tell you, that after the <hi>Engagement</hi> was set up of being <hi>true and faithful to the Common-wealth of</hi> England <hi>as it is now Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd without a King or House of Lords;</hi> tho several of the Presbyterian
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34919:8"/>
                  <hi>Divines</hi> out of a sense of their <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and their <hi>Covenant</hi> were so <hi>Loyal</hi> as to refuse it, I have not heard of any of those Independent ones who did.</p>
               <p>But such was the Inundation of Practical Atheism in the Kingdom that our Civil Wars had caus'd, that when the <hi>Engagement</hi> was set up, almost the whole Body of the <hi>Lawyers</hi> in <hi>England</hi> took it rather then they would lose their <hi>Practice.</hi> These men knew the meaning of the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>Oaths</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and yet were abandon'd by a disloyal <hi>Sophistical</hi> Principle of <hi>the want of Power in a lawful Sovereign to protect them, absolving them from their Obedience,</hi> to cancel their <hi>Oaths</hi> in the Court of Conscience.</p>
               <p>And in a word further to shew you how the tender <hi>Regard</hi> of publick Promises was here grown one of <hi>Pancirol's lost things,</hi> I shall tell you, that tho in the Parliament of <hi>Richard Cromwell,</hi> none was allowed to sit but he who had first took a <hi>Recognition</hi> of <hi>engaging to be true and faithful to the Lord Protector,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and not to propose or give any Consent to alter the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as 'tis setled in one single Person and a Parliament,</hi> yet the <hi>Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi> in that <hi>Parliament</hi> were not in the least diverted by that <hi>Recognition</hi> from endeavouring there to <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>Government,</hi> and it was there <hi>avowed</hi> by them, that <hi>a Promise or Oath took without Doors, did not bind within.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at last to bring up the Rear of mens Perjury, after all the <hi>Oaths</hi> legal and illegal had been so much confounded, when the late King's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stauration was almost in sight on the then General <hi>Monk</hi> with his <hi>Army</hi> coming to <hi>London,</hi> a new <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Abjuration</hi> of the <hi>Royal</hi> Line was at that time set on foot in Councel, and which some there would have had impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the <hi>General</hi> himself.</p>

               <p>I believe never, till after all the living here being resolved to dust, and a new Race of Mankind enriching themselves and their Country by the Culture of the Earth and Manufactures, men shall be above Temptations from necessity, to <hi>take</hi> God's <hi>Name</hi> in <hi>vain;</hi> and when the very <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi> Assertory or Promissory, will be <hi>dispens'd</hi> with by Nature.</p>
               <p>I am sure the Spectacle of mangled and slaughter'd Bodies covering a Field immediately after a Battle hath not more horror in it, then the sight of the Consciences mai'md and wounded by the inobservance of <hi>publick</hi> Oaths hath been since the <hi>Aera</hi> of 41.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And it is therefore no wonder that such their Judgment of Charity hath been retaliated by some of the most Renowned <hi>Divines</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> viz. the <hi>Lord Primate</hi> Bramhal, <hi>Bishop</hi> Taylor, <hi>Dr.</hi> Hammond and others, who have deny'd to pronounce the <hi>worshipping</hi> the <hi>Host</hi> to be <hi>formal</hi> Idolatry; that is to say, to be not so at all in reality, since we know that according to the <hi>trite</hi> Rule, <hi>forma dat esse.</hi>

               <p>Your Curiosity (I believe) hath led you to read over his learned <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian,</hi> and to observe what he there saith in his Preface, that <hi>some Men did pervert the meaning of the word <hi>Heirs</hi> in the <hi>Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,</hi> from its common and usual acceptation to another more special, on purpose to elude the force and <hi>Obligation</hi> which otherwise they must have had on <hi>the Consciences</hi> of the <hi>Excluders themselves.</hi>

               <p>I know that during the late <hi>turbid interval</hi> of the Nation, some <hi>Loyal</hi> men of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> were so much <hi>misguided,</hi> as to think that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>de facto</hi> Parliaments <hi>have heretofore directed and limited the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Crown in other manner, then in course it would otherwise have gone</hi> (as the <hi>words</hi> in the Printed <hi>Exclusion-Bill</hi> were) they might therefore of <hi>right</hi> do so again; <hi>notwithstanding</hi> they <hi>knew</hi> that after the <hi>Parliament</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi> to prevent the Right of <hi>Succession</hi> from <hi>fluctuating</hi> any more, had justly recognized and declared, That <hi>the Imperial Crown of this Realm,</hi> and <hi>Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birth-right and lawful and undoubted Succession descend and come to him, as being line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, justly and lawfully next and sole Heir of the Blood Royal of this Realm,</hi> it did afterward by a New <hi>Oath of Obedience</hi> or <hi>Allegiance,</hi> oblige mens <hi>Consciences</hi> both to the <hi>Crown</hi> and the <hi>hereditary</hi> lineal Succession, and <hi>notwithstanding</hi> they <hi>knew</hi> that that <hi>Parliament</hi> had took care of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the Obligation of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> for the <hi>bearing Faith and true Allegiance to the King, his Heirs and lawful Successors, and to assist and defend all Privileges, and Preheminences and Authorities granted or belonging to the King, his Heirs and Successors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I am sensible that as some vain Swearers in common Discourse, will upon their being occasionally reproved for it, be apt to swear that they did not

swear, and that as there are <hi>Fools</hi> that say in their Souls that <hi>there is no God,</hi> and that <hi>there</hi> is <hi>no Soul;</hi> so there is a sort of careless men who having taken this great <hi>Promissory</hi> Oath, will yet by their Actions deny their having sworn to assist and defend some of those Privileges, and likewise be apt to <hi>say</hi> in their <hi>hearts</hi> they have not <hi>invoked</hi> God as <hi>Witness</hi> and <hi>Revenger</hi> in the case of that Oath, and that they are not absolutely bound by it, or but only by their reserved sense; or as if a man representing his Country, he were only to take a kind of formal Oath <hi>in animam Domini,</hi> and not to venture his own Soul.</p>
               <p>But for my part, I account it as <hi>vile</hi> to be <hi>perjured</hi> in a solemn <hi>Promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory</hi> Oath as in a judicial <hi>Assertory</hi> one; and shall hereafter think my self as much bound to use all exactness and tenderness in the recollection o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But as to this thing, that great <hi>Casuist</hi> of the Age, Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> may help to set us right in his Third <hi>Lecture</hi> of <hi>Oaths,</hi> Sect. 17<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where putting the <hi>Case</hi> when Subjects are required to take an <hi>Oath for Preservation and Defence of Laws and Liberties, Privileges, Prerogatives and Preheminences of some Superior Power, as of a King, a Common-wealth, or Lord Paramount, such as are among us, the Oaths of H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Doubtless the Subject to his Power is obliged to defend all Rights which appear either by Law or Custom Legitimate, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defined by the written Law, or in force through long use of time, or prescription, that is, so far as they are known, or may morally be known. But he is not equally obliged to the observation of all those which are Controverted or doubtful, especially since Powerful men are accustomed to stretch their ted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and leap over the Land-marks of their Neighbours, not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within the bounds of their own Right. Nevertheless a Subject ought always to be prepared in Mind so soon as the justness of those things which are doubtful shall appear, to a knowledge and defend them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It may be hence rationally deduced that such who are call'd to the <hi>Helm</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> or are <hi>Members</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> if any Matters relating to any <hi>Iurisdictions, Privileges,</hi> and <hi>Authorities</hi> granted or <hi>belonging</hi> to the Crown shall come in question before them, are by <hi>virtue</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> bound to endeavour to know whether those Jurisdictions, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and Authorities are <hi>granted,</hi> or <hi>do</hi> belong to the Crown, that is, <hi>so far as they are known or may morally be known</hi> before they refuse to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> and <hi>assist</hi> them: and much more before they shall do any act of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or resisting the same, and before they shall entertain any hard thoughts of their Prince for claiming this or that Privilege.

               <p>Yes, the long Parliament of 40 did so.

               <p>Many more then I have now time to name; but cannot forget the fatal Consequences of their outraging one of those uncontroverted Rights which was at the King's Pleasure to Prorogue or Dissolve Parliaments, by putting such <hi>incessant</hi> hardships on that <hi>Pious</hi> King to engage him to pass the <hi>Act</hi> that that Parliament should continue till both the Houses did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

to the dissolution of it; and of which Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi> in his <hi>Behemoth,</hi> saith, that <hi>it amounted to a total Extinction of the King's Right, in case that such a grant were valid, which I think it is not, unless the Sovereignty it self be in plain terms renounced, which it was not.</hi>

And as I am not by <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi> when my Princes Affairs are in a <hi>Sickly</hi> state, or that the Die of <hi>War</hi> hath ran against him abroad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to press and tire him then into a parting with his known <hi>Privileges,</hi> so neither with a <hi>Salvo</hi> to my Oath, which binds me to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> them, can I if I find his Judgment or Mind sickly, lay Temptations before him to buy him as it were out of a <hi>Privilege</hi> that is just and adviseable for him to keep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am neither to <hi>starve</hi> nor <hi>pamper</hi> my Prince out of such a Privilege. Nay more, if my Prince did by any Error part with any such <hi>Privilege,</hi> as not knowing the same to be <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> in the Crown (as in the <hi>Case</hi> of an Answer of the Royal <hi>Martyr</hi> drawn by one of his Ministers not deeply vers'd in the Law, to some of the Parliaments <hi>Propositions,</hi> by which Answer he is acknowledg'd to be <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> Estates) I, who know that the <hi>Privilege</hi> and <hi>Preheminence</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in his Crown is to be <hi>above</hi> them all, and have in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> Sworn that the King <hi>is the only Supream Governour,</hi> and so none <hi>Co-ordinate,</hi> or <hi>equal</hi> to him, I am to take no advantage of that <hi>error,</hi> but am still to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> such his <hi>Preheminence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if ever a Prince did by <hi>fear</hi> part with such <hi>Privilege</hi> or <hi>Preheminence,</hi> there being a <hi>par</hi> between <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>force,</hi> according to that Law of the <hi>Proetor</hi> in the <hi>Digests, Quod vi aut metu factum est ratum non habebo</hi> (and in which <hi>Law,</hi> as <hi>Baldus</hi> saith, the <hi>Proetor</hi> was <hi>inspired</hi> by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God) I am not only not to take any advantage of such act of the <hi>Prince</hi> done by <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> or to upbraid him therewith, but am still to <hi>assist</hi> and <hi>defend</hi> such <hi>Privilege</hi> so derelinquish'd by him, and am to account the same <hi>belonging</hi> to him as the word is in my <hi>Promissory</hi> Oath, and to account him still in Law <hi>possess'd</hi> of the same, according to the rule of <hi>Possessio etiam animo retinetur:</hi> and which is justly apply'd in the Case of any one who in a <hi>Storm</hi> at <hi>Sea</hi> throws his Goods over-board to lighten the Ship.</p>
               <p>His late Majesty therefore did but right to himself, when in his <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> 1660. <hi>Concerning Ecclesiastical Affairs,</hi> he took

                     </gap> Of which we shall say no more, then that the Circumstances by which we were enforced to sign that Declaration, are enough known to the World: And that the worthiest and greatest part of that Nation did even then detest and abhor the ill usage of us in that particular when the same tyranny was exercised there by the Power of a few ill men, which at that time had spread it self over this Kingdom, and therefore we had no reason to expect that we should at this season when we are doing all we can to wipe cut the memor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all that hath been done amiss by other men, and we thank God have wiped it out of our own Remembrance, have been our self assaulted with those rep oaches, which we will likewise forget.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it was <hi>goodness</hi> worthy the great Soul of a <hi>King</hi> to forget the <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages</hi> of such who did <hi>strip</hi> their <hi>Political</hi> Father of his Power, and then <hi>reproach</hi> him with his <hi>nakedness.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I may here likewise tell you (and not <hi>mal a propos</hi>) how much the patience and long-suffering of the same Prince was exercised in a late <hi>Conjuncture</hi> that so much eclipsed his <hi>Prerogative</hi> in the Case of the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Danby</hi>'s Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and when the Commons did set up against it somewhat in his Father's Answer to the 19 <hi>Propositions</hi> before mention'd, that nothing but the <hi>tempest</hi> of the Age in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 40 could have occasion'd, viz. <hi>Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Power legally placed in both Houses of Parliament is more then suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to restrain the Power of Tyranny,</hi> &amp;c. But because a Parliament so <hi>perpetuated</hi> as that was, did prove more then sufficient to restrain pretended Tyranny, and real just Government, will a considerate man say any such thing now, when the <hi>breath</hi> of <hi>Prerogative</hi> can dissolve them in a <hi>moment,</hi> and in that moment <hi>all their thoughts perish,</hi> and all the high-flying <hi>thoughts</hi> that would <hi>soare</hi> above Imperial Power be found <hi>dead</hi> in the Nest?</p>
               <p>And I may here tell you, that in the <hi>Answer</hi> of some Nonconformists to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Sermon (an <hi>Answer</hi> Printed in <hi>London</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1680. during the <hi>ferment</hi> about the <hi>Plot,</hi> and wherein they desire <hi>Indulgence</hi>) I think their attacquing the <hi>Service</hi> on the <hi>Gun-Powder Treason</hi> Plot, in thanking God <hi>for Preserving the King and the Three Estates of the Realm assembled,</hi> by saying, That <hi>the late King made no scruple in his Answer to the</hi> 19 <hi>Propositions to reckon himself one of the three Estates,</hi> was a thing that on recollection they will judge ought not to have been done.</p>
               <p>But I am here further to tell you, that though it may be consistent with our <hi>Oath</hi> in some such case as was mention'd, to endeavour the altering by the Legislative Power some <hi>uncontroverted</hi> Privileges of the Crown, and in such a <hi>way</hi> as I have mention'd, I likewise wish you in your thoughts to make a <hi>distinction</hi> of those <hi>Privileges</hi> or <hi>Preheminences</hi> belonging to the <hi>Crown,</hi> that are absolutely <hi>Essential</hi> to its <hi>Preservation,</hi> and to that of the whole Realm, and which are by <hi>God</hi> and the Law put as a <hi>Depositum</hi> into the hands of <hi>Kings,</hi> and the removing of one of which would have the effect of taking a Stone out of an <hi>Arched</hi> Building, and such as no Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Princes can be without; and such as our <hi>Princes</hi> have in their flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Reigns to the great content and happiness of their People always exercised, and Rights (as the late Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> said of that of the <hi>Flagg</hi>) that our <hi>Princes cannot part with:</hi> and Privileges that are not such: and two of which former sort of Privileges, and which are parts of the Fundamental Laws of the Kingdom, I account we are <hi>expresly</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missory Clause of that Oath Sworn to <hi>defend,</hi> and assist, namely of the

               <p>Alas; as for several <hi>uncontroverted</hi> Rights of the Crown of an <hi>inferiour</hi> Nature, as our Princes have been ready enough in all Ages to part with them for the good of their People, and their own promoted thereby, and have had grateful returns from their Parliaments by <hi>Subsidies</hi> on such an account, so none need fear but that in all future times succeeding Monarchs will that way be as indulgent as the former ones were; and that as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>the King himself is served by the Field,</hi> and the <hi>Plough</hi> having here variously supported the <hi>Throne,</hi> and particularly by the robust <hi>Infantry</hi> it hath yielded to serve the Crown in Arms; the <hi>keeping up</hi> of the <hi>Spirits</hi> of our <hi>Yeomen</hi> (and likewise of those who <hi>Plough'd</hi> the <hi>Sea</hi>) by the <hi>Liberty</hi> our Laws allow'd them, and the <hi>Crowns</hi> being no <hi>gravamen</hi> to the Body of the People, and only to the Royal Heads that wore it, was and will be always necessary in order to the <hi>keeping up</hi> the <hi>being</hi> of the <hi>Nation.</hi>

               <p>A late great <hi>Philosopher</hi> of our Country hath told us, <hi>That every day it appeareth more and more that years and days are determin'd by Motions of the Earth;</hi> and another hath from the <hi>Diurnal</hi> and <hi>Annual</hi> Motion of the <hi>Earth</hi> endeavour'd to <hi>salve</hi> the <hi>Flows</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> of some Seas, illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the same by Waterin a <hi>Bowl</hi> arising or falling to either side, according to the Motions of the Vessel: but perhaps should a <hi>Prince</hi> in his Writings inculcate the <hi>Philosophy</hi> of the <hi>Earths</hi> motion, the <hi>populace</hi> would have <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> of the instability of the Foundations of their Houses and Towns, and of the shaking of their <hi>Property,</hi> and as they have by <hi>Dispensations,</hi> and they would be apt to quote <hi>Scripture</hi> against such <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>

                     </gap>s</hi> and <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> who open'd such great <hi>Springs</hi> of real Learning as refresh'd that noble thirst; so it seems before the <hi>Date</hi> of His late Majesty's <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of <hi>Indulgence</hi> in the 24th <hi>year</hi> of his Reign, and of the <hi>Act</hi> about the <hi>Test</hi> in the 25th <hi>year</hi> of it, and both which were likely to produce among the <hi>Learned</hi> so many <hi>Inquiries</hi> into the <hi>Legality</hi> of the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power inherent in the Crown (and even among the <hi>unlearned</hi> an <hi>Epidemical</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease of <hi>talking</hi> about the same) it came to pass in the course of Providence, that by as Learned <hi>Iudges</hi> as ever sate on the English <hi>Bench,</hi> and as Learned <hi>Councel</hi> as ever appear'd at its <hi>Bar,</hi> the <hi>Learning</hi> about the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power was ventilated and discuss'd in a <hi>Series</hi> of several <hi>years</hi> in the Case of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Sorrell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Cause began in the King's <hi>Bench</hi> 18. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. and was there <hi>argued</hi> by some of the Great <hi>Councel</hi> of the Kingdom, and there again argued on both sides by other <hi>Councel</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas-Term,</hi> in the 19th <hi>year</hi> of his Reign. And in <hi>Hilary-Term</hi> in 25. and 26. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. this Cause for the <hi>weight</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> of it was <hi>adjourn'd</hi> out of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> into the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Chamber, and there argued by others of the Greatest <hi>Councel</hi> of the Kingdom; and many <hi>Law-Books</hi> quoted. And the <hi>Case</hi> was afterward <hi>argued</hi> by all the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>England</hi> at six several Days in <hi>Easter, Trinity, Michaelmas</hi> and <hi>Hilary</hi> Terms, <hi>viz.</hi> by two <hi>Iudges</hi> each day, and the <hi>Iudges</hi> differ'd in several Points, and even about the <hi>definition</hi> or <hi>meaning</hi> of <hi>Dispensation.</hi> For so that learned <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> tells you, and saith, That <hi>some of his Brothers defined it to be</hi> liberatio à poenâ, <hi>and others to be</hi> Provida re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxatio Juris, <hi>which</hi> (saith he) <hi>is defining an</hi> ignotum per ignotius, <hi>and</hi> liberare à poenâ <hi>is the effect of a Pardon, not of a Dispensation,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus (as I may say) there was a <hi>Circumvallation</hi> by the Learning which concern'd <hi>Dispensing,</hi> that encompass'd some time <hi>preceding</hi> that <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

of <hi>Indulgence</hi> in the <hi>24th</hi> year of his <hi>Reign,</hi> and some time <hi>following</hi> both it and the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>Test.</hi> I shall some other time perhaps entertain you with the Learned Manuscript <hi>Report</hi> of the whole <hi>Case:</hi> but shall now tell you that during that <hi>Series</hi> of <hi>years,</hi> there was no angry motion in the <hi>Sea</hi> of the <hi>Populace</hi> occasion'd by any thing said in any of the <hi>Arguments</hi> that propp'd up the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power; no, not by that mention'd in <hi>Keeble's Reports</hi> about <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Sorrell</hi>'s Case to have been said in the <hi>Exchequer Chamber</hi> by <hi>Ellis</hi> the <hi>King's Serjeant</hi> (and whose Opinion was as <hi>Currant</hi> for <hi>Sterling-Law</hi> as any Mans of the long Robe.) <hi>Viz.

               <p>But without their troubling their heads with <hi>Law-Books,</hi> if they would but mind their <hi>English</hi> Bibles, and there consult the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>S.

Or,</hi> 2. <hi>That some Evil greater then the Consequence of the Non-Performance of it will certainly follow: as when David ate the Shew-bread and they that were with him: which depends on that rule of our Saviour, which tho apply'd to the Sabbath, yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all other positive Commands, that man was not made for them, but they for man: Or lastly, in case of incapacity, as the Children of Israels not going up to Ierusalem in the time of Captivity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are other words in a foregoing Chapter of S. <hi>Matthew</hi> that are still applicable to the <hi>Pharisaical</hi> ignorance of <hi>such as reproach DISPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SING</hi> as unlawful, <hi>Go and learn what that means, I will have mercy and not sacrifice.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, It is but natural <hi>when the Just are in Authority, for the People to rejoice (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us)</hi> and for them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to anticipate the Honours of the Prince's affording to a Person heroically just, by wishing them. And this is most properly applicable to your Lordship; and that in your Case may be said what <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Panegyric</hi> mentions of <hi>Nerva's</hi> adopting <hi>Trajan,</hi> That it was impossible it should have pleas'd all when it was done, except it had pleas'd all before it was done.</p>
               <p>My Lord, It was Nature that prompted them to presage with Pleasure the Profit that would come to them from the accessions of Honour to you, and whereby they knew that the height of your Power would be naturally productive of Blessings to them as the height of Hills and Mountains is of Springs for the benefit of the lower Earth, and of those who inhabit it, and which are found wanting in Countrys where there are no Hills. And the Ancient placing of the Statues of Magistrates by Fountains, may be supposed to have been an indication of the Peoples valuing them as the Causers of what did console and refresh them.</p>
               <p>My Lord, when I consider how much your Lordship and other just Persons of the Roman-Catholick Communion have in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the moral Offices of Natural Obedience to your Prince obliged so many of his Subjects by your being helpful to them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Oppressions in their Estates and Consciences, I hope I shall not appear too sanguine in my Conjecture of any ferment soon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ceasing about the exercise of the Dispensative Power being a <hi>gravamen</hi> to Property.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I shall in the former of the two remaining Parts of this my Work (and which are both ready for the Press) entertain your Lordship with such a farther Assertion of those offices of that

But I conceive it here necessary for me to acquaint your Lordship that I have been often put to it as speaking <hi>cum vulgo &amp; grosso modo,</hi> and for <hi>brevity</hi>'s sake to use the aforesaid Expression of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with <hi>Disability,</hi> and with Disability <hi>incurr'd</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that is, with what is generally enacted to be incurr'd, and SEEMS to be alike <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd</hi> by all Persons who perform not what the Act enjoins; and which Dispensing with Disability is frequently used in popular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course for the <hi>pardoning</hi> it, and for the <hi>liberatio à poenâ,</hi> and as the Lord Chief Iustice <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Report by me so much cited men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions dispensing to have been defined by some of the Iudges. But to a judgment so vastly comprehensive and profoundly penetrating as your Lordships, the dispensing with Disability must easily appear to be properly meant of the preventing it, and the <hi>dispensing</hi> with what might <hi>Cause</hi> it (according to the <hi>style</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Letters Patents) or effect the <hi>actual</hi> incurring of what will <hi>reverâ</hi> be incurr'd by the Persons not <hi>exempted</hi> by Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from the doing what the Law enjoins: and which will be made to appear obvious to every man's understanding in one of the following <hi>Parts,</hi> and wherein I shall have occasion to speak less <hi>cum vulgo</hi> and more <hi>closely</hi> and accurately of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing,</hi> and of its effects in either <hi>forum,</hi> then yet I have had.</p>

                  <p>I do herein most fully agree with you: and that the late <hi>zeal</hi> of the same Persons against <hi>papal</hi> Usurpations, and for <hi>popular</hi> ones was a scandal to the Age. I remember you once observ'd to me, how <hi>tender</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants</hi> in the times of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames</hi> the first, were of every <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Privilege</hi> of the Crown with the most <hi>perfect tenderness,</hi> while the Attaques from the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> against those Princes had made the highest Ferment in the minds of the Populace. But I think there never was any Conjuncture of time here, when so many of the declaimers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Popery, and so many of the <hi>fautors</hi> of Plot-witnesses were so much at the same time for <hi>a Plot</hi> and <hi>no Plot,</hi> and for <hi>a King and no King;</hi> that is to say, did so much make a stalking-horse of Popery, whereby to strike at Prerogative.</p>

                  <p>But you know that the <hi>talk</hi> of <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Popery</hi> was before apply'd to that use. You know <hi>Archbishop Laud</hi> in his <hi>Star-chamber Speech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> A 1637. mentions it p. 11. <hi>as the scope of the Libellers</hi> of the Faction <hi>to kindle a jealousy in Mens minds, that there were some great Plots in hand to change the Religion established, and to bring in (I know not what) Romish Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition.</hi> And the history of those times sheweth you how the Men that cry'd up <hi>Plots</hi> then did <hi>decry</hi> Prerogative. And in the Conjuncture of 41. the famous <hi>Protestation</hi> of <hi>May</hi> the 5th that year, begins with Out-cries of <hi>Designs of Popish Priests and Iesuits and other Papists and their PLOTS and CONSPIRACIES,</hi> and the Preface of the <hi>Covenant</hi> runs on in the <hi>style</hi> of <hi>

                  <p>I must then, I see, fairly grant you that by that <hi>Parliament</hi>'s having thus perpetuated the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> contain'd in <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth'<hi>s Admonition,</hi> I am bound in Conscience to take it in that <hi>sense,</hi> and am perjured if I do not so keep that Oath; and must likewise grant that you have shewn how <hi>auspicious</hi> that <hi>Oath</hi> by the Queens <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting</hi> the same, and the <hi>Parliament</hi> about five years after <hi>approving</hi> that <hi>Interpretation,</hi> was to the Assertion of such her Power; and that if any taker of the <hi>Oath</hi> should <hi>gain-say</hi> such Power, you have prepared such a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation</hi> in the case as was used to the old Philosopher who disputed against <hi>Motion,</hi> and whom his Adversary confuted by removing him from his place. But as you are a fair arguer, I am to take leave to tell you, That that <hi>Parliament,</hi> tho they approved the Queen's <hi>Admonition</hi> in general, did not particularly shew their Approbation of the Queen's Power of dispensing with the <hi>Penalties</hi> that she exercised in that <hi>Admonition.</hi>

                  <p>They did sufficiently shew their Approbation of the whole; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you need not question their approving of its parts. But because you seem to lay some stress on that Parliament's not expresly approving <hi>in terminis</hi> the Queen's Power of discharging the <hi>Penalties</hi> (and one of which by the <hi>Act</hi> of 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p>Sir <hi>E.

                  <p>But to return to the Consideration of what you are on the whole matter obliged to by virtue of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the Case now before you: and herein I find that by Virtue of the Queens <hi>interpretation</hi> of that Oath, and the Parliaments <hi>Approbation</hi> thereof, that when in the <hi>Assertory</hi> part of the Oath <hi>you do utterly testify and declare in your Conscience that the King's Highness is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or Causes as Temporal,</hi> you have as in the Presence of God solemnly given your cordial Assent to, and made your most <hi>Religious</hi> acknowledgment that the <hi>SOLE Supreme Government or Soveraignty</hi> and Rule under God over all manner of Persons born within these Realms, is in the King; and you are obliged to judge that tho the <hi>Oath</hi> speaks of <hi>all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical THINGS or Causes,</hi> and the <hi>interpretation</hi> of all manner of <hi>Persons</hi> of what Estate ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ecclesiastical or Temporal soever they be, yet there is no inconsistence between the <hi>Oath</hi> and the <hi>Interpretation,</hi> for that as a Learned man in his <hi>Comment</hi> on that <hi>Oath</hi> hath well observ'd, <hi>there is no Opposition between these two, Persons and Causes; the Principal object of a Law is a Person, and a Person with respect to his Actions, a Person morally Consider'd;</hi> and he there quotes <hi>Suarez de Legibus,</hi> l. 1. c. 8. saying, <hi>Ad leges per se requiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur potestas in personam, secundario in Res alias:</hi> and for that the <hi>Asserto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> clause in the <hi>Oath</hi> declaring the King the <hi>only</hi> Supreme Governor of <hi>this</hi> Realm, doth necessarily imply his being the <hi>only</hi> Supreme Governor of all Persons in it.</p>

the <hi>Queen</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and that that Consideration might therefore be supposed to be the cause of the Queens <hi>interpreting,</hi> being approved or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared</hi> good by the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the <hi>Fifth</hi> year of her Reign.</p>

                  <p>I shall tell you that as to the sufficiency of the <hi>Queen's</hi> Power to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> by her <hi>sole</hi> Authority, it appears not that the <hi>Proviso</hi> in the <hi>Statute</hi> of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> did in the least arise from any such <hi>scruple,</hi> and so <hi>De non apparentibus,</hi> &amp;c. And here without troubling you with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Royal</hi> assent creating the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> and by the words of <hi>le Roy le veult<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> after the <hi>Body</hi> of it hath been prepared by the <hi>three</hi> Estates and that the <hi>three</hi> Estates have nothing to do to <hi>interpret</hi> a <hi>Law</hi> that is once made, and accordingly as Sir <hi>C. Hatton,</hi> formerly <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in his <hi>Treatise of Acts of Parliament and their Exposition,</hi> tells us, That <hi>the Assembly of Parliament being ended, functi sunt officio,</hi> and speaking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of those of the <hi>Lower House,</hi> saith <hi>their Authority is return'd to the Electors so clearly, that if they were all together assembled again for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation by a voluntary meeting,</hi> eorum non esset interpretari, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I shall once for all observe to you, that our <hi>Monarchs</hi> when in the exercise of the Prerogative inherent in them, and inseparable from them, relating to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> the <hi>Coining</hi> of Money, or the <hi>Dispensing</hi> in Matters Civil or Ecclesiastical, they condescend to have the same in particular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But I have before observ'd to you, that the apparent Cause in the <hi>Proviso</hi> of 5<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Elizabethoe,</hi> whereby the Queens <hi>Interpretation</hi> is Enacted, is the better to transmit the obligatoriness of the Interpretation in point of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science beyond her Life, and to the Reigns of her <hi>Heirs</hi> and <hi>Successors,</hi> and to bind us who live now to acknowledge such Power due to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent King over the Persons of all his Subjects, as was in her interpretation challenged to be due to <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth.</p>
                  <p>I shall not trouble you with my Judgment about <hi>Moot-points</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the <hi>Regal</hi> Power of interpreting <hi>Acts</hi> of Parliament, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly such wherein Oaths are founded. My Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> Inst. 3. c. 74. tells us, <hi>That an Oath cannot be ministred to any, unless the same be allow'd by the Common Law, or by some Act of Parliament: neither can any Oath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the Common-Law, or by Act of Parliament, be alter'd but by Act of Parliament:</hi> and saith in the Margin, <hi>So resolv'd,</hi> An. 26. El. <hi>in the Case of the Under-Sheriff.</hi> And then saith <hi>the Oath of the King's Privy Councel, the Iustices, the Sheriffs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was thought fit to be alter'd and enlarged, but that was done by Authority of Parliament. For further proof whereof see the Statutes here quoted</hi> (i. e. those referr'd to in his Margin) <hi>and it shall evidently appear that no old Oath can be alter'd or new Oath rais'd without an Act of Parliament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have only here referr'd you to <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> a Reign that the Royal <hi>Martyr</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 3. of his <hi>Declaration to all his Loving Subjects</hi> of <hi>Aug.</hi> 12. 1642. refers to with so much honour by saying, <hi>We declared our Resolution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and desired that whatsoever mistaking had grown in the Government either of Church or State might be removed, and all things reduced to the order of the time (the memory whereof is justly precious to this Nation) of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and do leave it to you to consider how <hi>Great</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Interpretation</hi> of Laws is in it self; a Power almost infinitely greater then the discharging either the Obligations of some Penal Laws or their Penalties <hi>Pro hic &amp; nu c,</hi> and as to some particular Persons, as any one will grant who hath seen the extent of

                  <p>I cannot help it; but if you will have me speak with the <hi>frankness</hi> of a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> concerning the <hi>Nature</hi> of things, the <hi>disabling</hi> of the <hi>Subjects</hi> must have that effect in <hi>Nature,</hi> and of the <hi>disabling</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi> too. And I think too you gave me a <hi>hint</hi> for some such thought at our last meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. If you do but consider the Services done to Monarchs by that abject Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> (and who by <hi>Tacitus</hi> were call'd the <hi>Vilissima pars ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vientium</hi>) and how in our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s time they were serviceable to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire in the Collection of the <hi>Customs,</hi> and how much they have been since and still are useful to the Grand <hi>Signior,</hi> and to many Christian Princes by gathering in their <hi>Imposts,</hi> you will easily imagine the loss that would redound to Princes by Religionary <hi>Heterodoxy</hi> disabling any to serve them.</p>
                  <p>It is but natural to men of the most <hi>inquisitive</hi> and penetrating thoughts to differ from many Points of <hi>Theology</hi> receiv'd by Princes and their People: and since such <hi>heterodoxy</hi> doth <hi>difficult</hi> their access to Preferment, it is but Natural to them by their working Thoughts and Industry to arrive at the excelling the duller <hi>Orthodox</hi> in whatever course of life they take, and by that means to try to <hi>push</hi> on their way into their <hi>Prince</hi>'s favour, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to have very sharp <hi>regrets</hi> against any Methods that would <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate</hi> them for it.</p>
                  <p>And as if this <hi>Civil</hi> Death were to Men of great Thoughts the <hi>terrible</hi> of <hi>terribles,</hi> and what as hindring them from serving their Prince and Country were like Burying them alive, I shall shew you how a Man of great Abilities, and who had made a great Figure in the Church and State, resen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it in the <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of A. 1640. I mean Archbishop <hi>Williams,</hi> who in his famous <hi>Speech</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> that year against the <hi>Bill</hi> that afterward passed into a <hi>Law</hi> to <hi>Disable</hi> Persons in <hi>Holy</hi> Orders from exercising any <hi>Temporal</hi> Jurisdiction, doth thereupon represent it, that <hi>under a</hi> CAIN'<hi>s mark an eternal kind of disability or incapacity is laid on them from enjoying hereafter any of those Rights, Favours, or Charters of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Princes, and which is the heaviest Point of all without killing of</hi> Abel, <hi>or any Crime laid to their charge, more then that in the beginning of the Bill 'tis said roundly, and in the style of</hi> Lacedaemon, <hi>that they ought not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle,</hi> &amp;c. And what his thoughts were of the Injustice of such <hi>incapacity</hi> put on the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and of the <hi>odiousness</hi> of that <hi>Punishment</hi> of <hi>incapacity,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what he afterward saith, <hi>viz. I come to the 4th part of this Bill, which is the manner of the inhibition every way heavy in the Penalty, heavier a great deal in the incapacity. In the weighing the Penalty, will you consider the small wyers; that is, poor Causes that are to induce the same; and then the heavy load that hangs upon these wyers? It is thus. If a Natural Subject of</hi> England, <hi>interessed in the</hi> Magna Charta and Petition of Right, <hi>as well as any other; yet being a Person in Holy Orders shall happen unfortunately to Vote in Parliament, to obey his Prince by way of Councel, or by way of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner be required thereunto, then is he presently to lose and forfeit for his first offence all his Means and Livelyhood,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This Peradventure may move others most, but it doth not me. It is not the Penalty, but the Incapacity,</hi>

                  <p>It was upon the ground of this <hi>Assertion,</hi> viz.

                  <p>You find it DECLARED in the <hi>Statute</hi> of the <hi>31th.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 10. that <hi>It appertaineth to the King's Prerogative Royal to give such Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Reputation and Placing to his Councellors, AND OTHER his Subjects, as shall be seeming to his most excellent Wisdom;</hi> and so when King <hi>Iames</hi> gave Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> tho <hi>dead</hi> in <hi>Law,</hi> and labouring under the highest <hi>disability</hi> beforemention'd, the Power and Honour of commanding the lives of others, he did but what <hi>appertain'd to his Prerogative.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus when King <hi>Harry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> by his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> like the <hi>Sun</hi> both raising and gilding a poor <hi>Vapour,</hi> made <hi>Cromwel</hi> who was the Son of a Black-smith <hi>Lord Privy-Seal,</hi> and likewise enabled him, tho a <hi>Lay-man,</hi> to to be his <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> for <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> Causes, and however <hi>incapacitated</hi> by some positive humane Laws to make that figure, he did but <hi>uti Iure suo.</hi>

                  <p>And I shall tell you as to the subject of the <hi>weight</hi> of <hi>one</hi> Man, or the consequences of <hi>disabling</hi> one Man, that we were upon; if you consider how much the excesses of the <hi>Papal</hi> Usurpations, and the <hi>over-ballance</hi> of the <hi>Monastic</hi> Revenue in the Nation, were removed by the <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments</hi> of <hi>Cromwel</hi> the <hi>Vice-gerent</hi> in Matters Ecclesiastical, you may easily imagine that if the measures of the <hi>Canon-Law</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> and the long receiv'd <hi>customs</hi> or any <hi>humane</hi> Law had then prevail'd for the <hi>disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> of <hi>Cromwel cum effectu</hi> from bearing <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>intermedling</hi> in <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> Jurisdiction as the Kings <hi>Vice-gerent,</hi> what a <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> we should have at this time enjoy'd.</p>
                  <p>You may well imagine how much the <hi>Disabling</hi> of <hi>Lay-men</hi> from inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medling in ecclesiastical <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> had passed for a <hi>general</hi> Custom here, when Bishop <hi>Downham</hi> in the <hi>Defence of his Consecration Sermon</hi> p. 185. saith that <hi>as for lay-Chancellors or Commissaries, the Bishops in the times of S.</hi> Austin <hi>and S.</hi> Ambrose <hi>had none: and that not so much as the Steward of a Church might be a Lay-man:</hi> and when the <hi>Puritan</hi> Writers did still up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid our Discipline on the account of the incapacity of <hi>Lay-men</hi> to be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Chancellors, as adjudged by the ancient <hi>Canons;</hi> and with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> of <hi>indecorum est laicum esse vicarium episcopi,</hi> &amp;c. and by which <hi>Canon</hi> the Bishop who made a <hi>Lay-man</hi> his Vicar, was declared to be <hi>contemptor Canonum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But it was the <hi>Regal</hi> Power of <hi>Dispensing</hi> with the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> that <hi>disabled</hi> Lay-men from intermedling in <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> Jurisdiction, that laid the <hi>foundation</hi> of the Reformation in <hi>Harry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s time, as it was the same Power of dispensing with the <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> that <hi>disabled</hi> Clergy-men from intermedling in <hi>saecular</hi> Employments, that perfected the <hi>superstructure</hi> of it in the reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi> that young <hi>Iosias,</hi> as was before mention'd.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Legatine</hi> Powers are <hi>de jure Communi,</hi> as the <hi>Canonists</hi> tell us, very great; and allow the <hi>Legates</hi> to visit or cause to be visited by such as they shall think fit, all Churches, Monasteries, Colleges, Universities, Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and do authorize them to make new Statutes and Orders, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to receive Appeals from ordinary Judges and Delegates, but to judge and decide all Ecclesiastical, Civil and Criminal Causes, and that summarily and <hi>sine formâ &amp; figurâ Iudicii;</hi> to make Prisoners of Bishops, and send them in Custody to the Pope, to bestow Benefices that were vacant, to unite Churches, to interpret the Mandates of the Pope: and if the Pope hath entrusted any thing to be done by them, yet to entrust the doing thereof to others, to execute all their Jurisdiction in Places <hi>exempt</hi> as well as not exempt, and to <hi>dispense</hi> in all Cases wherein they are not Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and to exercise the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of granting <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense</hi> with <hi>pluralists,</hi> and with the <hi>incapacity</hi> of <hi>Sons</hi> immediately <hi>succeeding</hi> their <hi>Fathers</hi> in Church-Livings, and to give Absolution to the Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate in many Cases reserv'd to the <hi>Apostolick</hi> See, and likewise in many Causes inflictive of Excommunication <hi>ipso jure,</hi> and in many Cases to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store such as are <hi>deposed</hi> and <hi>degraded,</hi> and to rehabilitate them even by <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing</hi> them to <hi>Fame.</hi>

                  <p>But as that <hi>Statute</hi> intimating that <hi>the Councils and Constitutions Provincial</hi> that ordain'd, <hi>that no Lay-man should exercise or occupy any Iurisdiction Ecclesiastical, did stand and remain in their effect not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd by his Grace's Laws, and did sound to appear to make greatly for the usurped Power of the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and to he directly repugnant to his Majesty as Supreme Head of the Church, and Pretogative Royal, his Grace being a Lay-man, altho such Decrees, Ordinances, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions</hi> were by <hi>the Statute made in the</hi> 25th <hi>year of his Reign, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be utterly abolish'd, frustrate,</hi> &amp;c. but yet that <hi>the contrary thereunto,</hi> being not <hi>used by Archbishops, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> that they had not all that while or since that <hi>Statute</hi> of the 25th of his <hi>Reign</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the exercise of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction to <hi>Lay-men;</hi> did or might give <hi>occasion to some Evil-dispos'd persons to think and little regard the Proceedings and Censures Ecclesiastical made by his HIGH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE and his Uice-gerent, Officials, Commissaries, Iudges, and Uisitors being also Lay and Married men to be of little or none effect, whereby the people gathereth heart and presumption to do evil, and not to have such reverence to your most Godly Injunctions and Proceedings, as becometh them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>I shall therefore here once for all tell you, that the occasion of so many mens <hi>mistake</hi> in thinking so many of those <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th's time prejudicial to Prerogative, as seeming to found it on Statute-Law, is their not considering that such <hi>Statutes</hi> were but <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> of old Laws, and not <hi>introductive</hi> of new ones. My Lord Primate
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:34919:36"/>
                     <hi>Bramhal</hi> in his <hi>Schism guarded,</hi> p. 155. saith, <hi>I profess clearly I do not see what advantage</hi> Henry <hi>the 8th could make of his own Laws, which he might not have made of the ancient Laws, except only a gawdy Title of Head of the English Church which survived him not long, and the Tenths and first<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of the Clergy,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But you may as fully take notice how <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th throughout his great <hi>Declarative</hi> Laws so often <hi>declares</hi> in effect his <hi>Regal</hi> Power to be given him by God. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in his <hi>Caudry</hi>'s <hi>Case,</hi> instanceth in the famous <hi>Statute</hi> of 24<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 12. and calls it <hi>declaratory of the ancient Law,</hi> and you see how it is <hi>declared</hi> there, That <hi>the King is by the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of God furnish'd with Prerogative,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>H.</hi> 8. begins as I shew'd you with the three Estates, DECLARING, <hi>That the King's Majesty is and hath always justly been Supreme Head in the Earth of the Church of</hi> England <hi>by the Word of God.</hi> You know too how the <hi>style</hi> runs in another of his <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> viz. <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>and See Apostolick, contrary to the great and inviolable Grants of Iurisdictions by God immediately to Emperors, Kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:34919:36"/>And here I shall tell you that as <hi>my Lord</hi> Coke <hi>in</hi> Cawdry's <hi>Case</hi> calls the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. beforemention'd, An <hi>Act declaratory</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Law; so he likewise doth the <hi>Act</hi> of the <hi>25th</hi> of his Reign, <hi>c.</hi> 21. that so much props up the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power. And I assure you that they look but at a few things in general, and in that <hi>Statute</hi> in particular, who think that the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power <hi>inherent</hi> in the King lost any ground thereby: and he who takes the <hi>Statute</hi> altogether, will find that that Power if it <hi>seem'd</hi> in any words to go back from it self, was but by such retreat to leap the further forward.</p>
                  <p>For if you will take a <hi>glancing</hi> view of the intent of that <hi>Statute</hi> to that end, you will see that instead of <hi>that</hi> Law making it self to be the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power, it makes the Dispensative Power to be the very <hi>Fountain</hi> of a great part of the Common Law it self: for its style gives you the figure of our <hi>Laws,</hi> as either <hi>devised, made and obtain'd within this Realm for the wealth of the same, or such as by SUFFERANCE of your Grace and your Progenitors</hi> (which is a <hi>Dispensation</hi> by way of <hi>Permission</hi> or <hi>Connivence) <hi>the People of this your Realm have taken at their free Liberty by their own Consent to be used among them, and have bound themselves by long use and Custom to the observance of the same,</hi>
                     </hi> &amp;c. And the King in his Legislative Capacity having with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the three Estates superseded the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Dispensative Power that had so long Usurp'd on the King's Laws, and having provided that the Money that should be paid as <hi>Fees</hi> for <hi>Dispensations</hi> should be <hi>rais'd</hi> and <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated</hi> by their Consent, obtain'd from them a <hi>Clause</hi> in the <hi>Act</hi> containing so great a <hi>deference</hi> to the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power of the <hi>Crown,</hi> as that after the <hi>Act</hi> had authorized the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his <hi>Successors <hi>to grant such Dispensations, Licences and Faculties as were accustomed to be had from the See of</hi>
                     </hi> Rome, <hi>and not grant any others till the King, his Heirs and Successors, or their Councel were first advertised thereof, and determined whether they should pass:</hi> It <hi>Provided</hi> that <hi>if it were thought and determin'd by the King, his Heirs and Successors, or their Councel, that Dispensations, Faculties, Licences, or other Writings in any such Case UNWONT shall pass, that then the said Archbishop or his Commissary having Licence of His Majesty, his Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors for the same shall dispense with them accordingly: and in Case of his refusing to dispense, that any other two Bishops, the King, his Heirs and Successors should nominate, should be appointed to dispense in such Cases.</hi> And this <hi>Act</hi> with all the <hi>Clauses</hi> in it, you find reviv'd by the <hi>1st.</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> c. 1.</p>
                  <p>The Pope's <hi>rehabilitations</hi> did <hi>customarily</hi> extend to <hi>Lay-men</hi> as well as <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> and that particularly in case of <hi>Heterodoxy</hi> in Religion, then call'd <hi>Heresy,</hi> which both by ancient <hi>usage</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> loaded men with various <hi>incapacities.</hi> And his relaxing the <hi>incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> that relate to Clergy-men, any one may see by the <hi>Taxa Cameroe</hi> and the <hi>Fees</hi> thereby payable, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>Age</hi> of those who were to take Orders and were defective in some of their Members, and in the <hi>Case</hi> of Clergy-mens incapacity incurr'd by <hi>irregularity.</hi> But after this <hi>Act</hi> of the 25. of <hi>H.</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> had shew'd the World the Authority the King had to <hi>rehabilitate</hi> and <hi>dispense</hi> here in his <hi>own</hi> Country both as to matters <hi>customarily</hi> dispens'd with at <hi>Rome,</hi> and such as were <hi>not</hi> so, and how <hi>small</hi> the <hi>Fees</hi> were for the same, the bringing <hi>rehabilitations,</hi> and <hi>Perinde valere's</hi> from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> was like carrying <hi>Coals</hi> to <hi>New-Castle.</hi>

                     <hi>Eliz.</hi> and where he saith, <hi>that that Act doth not annex any Iurisdiction to the Crown but what was of right or ought to be by the Ancient Laws of this Realm, parcel of the King's Iurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and which lawfully had been or might be exercised within the Realm. The end of which Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and of all the Proceedings thereupon, that all things might be done in Causes Ecclesiastical to the Pleasure of Almighty God, encrease of Vertue, and the Conservation of the Peace and Unity of the Realm, as by divers places of the Act appears. And therefore by this Act no pretended Iurisdiction ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised within this Realm being ungodly, or repugnant to the ancient Law of the Crown, was or could be restored to the Crown according to the ancient Right and Law of the same.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here I may tell you, that as the <hi>Pope</hi> did often <hi>dispense</hi> with <hi>inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi> incurr'd by his <hi>Positive</hi> Laws, and that even in the use of the Power of the Keys, as by his delegating the Power of Excommunication to Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and to Abbesses as aforesaid; so our <hi>Kings</hi> d d <hi>anciently</hi> by their <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents</hi> and <hi>Charters,</hi> grant <hi>Power</hi> to those who were no <hi>Bishops, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi>

                  <p>It was upon the <hi>Revival</hi> of this <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th, by that <hi>first</hi> of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. that <hi>she,</hi> according to the <hi>Papal</hi> custom of <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with the <hi>Commutation</hi> of <hi>Penance,</hi> did in her Articles in the <hi>Synod</hi> began at <hi>London,</hi> A.

                  <p>I can easily direct you to such a <hi>Writer</hi> of our Church who hath done the thing to the universal Satisfaction of the Inquisitive as to this Point, and that is the Lord Primate <hi>Bramhal</hi> in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Schism Guarded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He saith there, in <hi>p.</hi> 330, and 331. <hi>As our Grievances, so our Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was only of the abuses of the Roman Court. Their bestowing of Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Dignities in</hi> England <hi>to the Prejudice of the right Patrons; Their Convocating Synods in</hi> England <hi>without the King's leave; Their Prohibiting English Prelates to make their old feudal Oaths to the King, and obliging them to take new Oaths of Fidelity to the Pope; Their imposing and receiving Tenths and first Fruits, and other Arbitrary Pensions upon the English Clergy; <hi>and lastly, their Usurping a Legislative Iudiciary and Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sative Power in the exterior Court by Political Coaction;</hi> these are all the branches of Papal Power which we have rejected. This Reformation is all the Separation that we have made in point of Discipline. And for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine we have no difference with them about the old Essentials of Christian Religion: and their new Essentials which they have patch'd to the Creed are but their erroneous, or at the best, probable Opinions; no Articles of Faith.</hi> Thus then according to these measures, you see how much the <hi>hinge</hi> of the <hi>Reformation</hi> turns on the <hi>Usurpation</hi> of the <hi>Papacy</hi> in <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing:</hi> for in all these particulars enumerated, the Pope <hi>dispens'd</hi> with the King's <hi>Laws.</hi> And he had before in <hi>p.</hi> 26. said, <hi>This Primacy neither the Ancients nor we deny to St.</hi> Peter, <hi>of Order, of Place, of Preheminence. If this first movership would serve his turn, the Controversie were at an end for our parts. But this Primacy is over-lean; the Court of</hi> Rome <hi>have no</hi> gusto <hi>to it. They thirst after a visible Monarchy on Earth, an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:34919:38"/>
                     <hi>Ecclesiastical Soveraignty; <hi>a Power to make Canons, to abolish Canons, to dispense with Canons:</hi> to impose Pensions, to dispose of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, to decide Controversies by a single Authority. This was that which made the breach; not the Innocent Primacy of St.</hi> Peter. And afterward in <hi>p.</hi> 149. he saith, <hi>But I must contract my Discourse to those Dispensations that are intended in the Laws of</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8th, <hi>that is the Power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with English Laws in the exterior Court: Let him bind or loose inwardly whom he will: whether his Key erre or not, we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. Secondly, As he is a Prince in his own Territories, he that hath Power to bind, hath Power to loose. He that hath Power to make Laws hath Power to dispense with his own Laws. Laws are made of Common Events. Those benign Circumstances that happen rarely, are left to the Dispensative Grace of the Prince. Thirdly, As he is a Bishop, whatever Dispensative Power the ancient Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, or Edicts of Christian Emperors give to the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>within those Territories that were subject to his Iurisdiction by Humane right, we do not envy him: so he suffer us to enjoy our ancient Privileges and Immunities freed from his Encroachments and Usurpations. <hi>The Chief ground of the ancient Ecclesiastical Canon was, let the old Customs prevail. A possession or Prescription of Eleven hundred years is a good ward both in Law and Conscience against an Human Right, and much more against a New pretence of Divine Right.</hi> For Eleven hundred years our Kings and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops enjoy'd the sole Dispensative Power with all English Laws, Civil and Ecclesiastical. In all which time he is not able to give one instance of a Papal Dispensation in</hi> England, <hi>nor any shadow of it when the Church was formed. Where the Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>had no Legislative Power, no Iudiciary Power in the exteriour Court, by necessary Consequence they could have no Dispensative Power.</hi> He then in <hi>p.</hi> 169. mentions the said <hi>Statute</hi> of 25. <hi>H. 8th.</hi> and having referr'd to the <hi>Proviso,</hi> there to shew, that <hi>its intent was not to vary from the Church of Christ in any other things declared by the Holy Scripture, and the Word of God necessary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> he saith <hi>then followeth the scope of our Reformation; only to make an Ordinance by Policies necessary and convenient to repress Vice, and for good Conservation of the Realm in Peace, Unity and Tranquillity from ravine, and spoil, ensuing much the ancient Customs of this Realm in that behalf: not minding to seek for any relief, succours, or remedies for any worldly things, and Humane Laws in any cause of necessity, but within this Realm at the hands of your Highness, your Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm, which have and ought to have an Imperial Power and Authority in the same, and not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in worldly Causes to any other Superior.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then you see this <hi>Prelates</hi> sense of how much the taking away the Pope's <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power here, and <hi>restoring</hi> that Power to the <hi>Crown,</hi> was the <hi>Soul</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and <hi>tota</hi> in <hi>toto</hi> of it. And this <hi>Act</hi> you see revived by the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> without garbling it in the least; and the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power thereby restored to her, her Heirs and Successors, and a <hi>Declaration, <hi>that no Subjects of the Realm need for any worldly things and Humane Laws in any Cause of Necessity seek for any relief, but within this Realm at the hands of our Soveraign,</hi>
                     </hi> as aforesaid. And I shall tell you that the <hi>Bishop</hi> in the next <hi>Page</hi> refers to the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and saith on his <hi>view</hi> of both <hi>Statutes, Whatsoever Power our Laws did devest the Pope of, they invested the King with it.</hi> And of this, the Power of <hi>Rehabilitating</hi> any of his <hi>Lay</hi> or <hi>Clerical</hi> Subjects is a part, as was beforesaid.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Primate</hi> hath shewn an eminent <hi>Candour</hi> of mind in these <hi>Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> of his you have cited: and <hi>if our Ancestors had but over-reach'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and the truth in some Expressions,</hi> and in any part of a <hi>Statute</hi> but that which <hi>forms</hi> an <hi>Oath,</hi> it had not <hi>much concern'd us, and as long as they had kept exactly to the line and level of</hi> plain Truth in <hi>all</hi> the words of the <hi>Oath:</hi> but <hi>Oaths</hi> being <hi>stricti juris,</hi> and being to be taken <hi>in truth and in righteousness,</hi> and in the common <hi>sense</hi> of the words, may I not here to the <hi>Assertory</hi> Clause of <hi>No foreign Prelate or Person hath or ought to have any Iurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. apply those other words of the Primate, <hi>This might have been express'd in words less subject to Exception?</hi> But according to what he <hi>cited</hi> out of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> it may be said instead of <hi>no foreign Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late hath or ought to have any Iurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. that <hi>Every foreign Prelate hath it,</hi> and not only the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> as claiming a Succession under St. <hi>Peter,</hi> but Thousands of other Bishops in Christendom; who as the <hi>Primate</hi> saith there, <hi>p.</hi> 162. <hi>do not at all derive their Holy Orders from S.</hi> Peter, <hi>or any other Roman Bishop, either mediately, or immediately (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in</hi> Asia <hi>and</hi> Africa) <hi>but from the other Apostles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And suitably to what the <hi>Primate</hi> observ'd out of <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> by which we see that as <hi>there is but one Universal Church, so there is but</hi> Episcopatus Unus <hi>in that Church</hi> and that <hi>undivided,</hi> I find it observ'd in Sir <hi>Geffery Palmer's Reports</hi> in <hi>the Case of <hi>Evans &amp; Kiffin. vers. Ascuith.</hi>
                     </hi> Trin. 3. Car. <hi>B. R. Whitelock. Evesque ad</hi> 3 <hi>Powers. Le Primer est Ordinations: and that comes to him by his Consecration, and not before. By that he can take the resignation of a Church. He can give Orders and Consecrate Churches: and it belongs not to him as he is a Bishop of one place or other,</hi> mais il est universel sur tout le monde. <hi>And therefore the Archbishop of</hi> Spalato <hi>when he was here could give Orders. The Chief Iustice agreed with him herein. The second is</hi> Potestas Jurisdictionis <hi>which is not Universal, but tied to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places, as to take an Oath, to Excommunicate and Punish offences, and this Power he hath by Confirmation. The third is</hi> Administratio rei Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaris, <hi>the Government of his Revenue, and this is gain'd by Confirmation.</hi> By this you see that the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as every other <hi>foreign</hi> Bishop, may have some <hi>Spiritual</hi> Power here, <hi>viz.</hi> what the <hi>Reporter</hi> mention'd as the first. And therefore I could wish that the 37th of our 39 <hi>Articles</hi> to which the <hi>Primate</hi> refers for the <hi>Interpretations</hi> of this <hi>Clause</hi> in the <hi>Oath,</hi> had in those words there <hi>the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath no Iurisdiction in this Realm,</hi> express'd such a <hi>distinction</hi> of his <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> as the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath done: and otherwise that common and trite Rule of <hi>Non est distinguendum ubi lex non distinguit,</hi> being here applicable, you know what is to be thought of an <hi>am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous</hi> Oath; and that as the sagacious Author of <hi>the History of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of</hi> Trent hath told us, <hi>p.</hi> 187, <hi>as one Particular makes false the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory Universal, so one ambiguous Particular, makes the Universal to be ambiguous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover tho you will suppose that he might lawfully take the <hi>Oath</hi> in his <hi>sense</hi> of the Pope's Jurisdiction, yet all his great Learning and Reason could not qualifie him to be an <hi>Authentical</hi> Interpreter of the <hi>Oath</hi> to me. In some parts of the <hi>Oath</hi> that were obvious to <hi>doubt,</hi> you have already given me satisfaction, and particularly in making me by vertue of the <hi>Canons</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi> a <hi>participant</hi> with the <hi>Clergy</hi> in his authentical <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of the 37th <hi>Article.</hi> And since as <hi>Suarez</hi> in his learned Book, <hi>De Legibus,</hi> 4. c. <hi>de Interpretatione humanarum Legum,</hi> saith that <hi>there may be an interpretation of Law which hath the Authority of Law,</hi> and that <hi>qui in eadem potestate succedit, semper potest Praedecessotum leges interpretari,</hi> I shall account King <hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Interpretation</hi> as good as Queen <hi>Elizabeth's:</hi>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:34919:40"/>
and that if he had there declared his mind about the Pope's <hi>spiritual</hi> Power <hi>in foro interno,</hi> being not <hi>renounced</hi> by this <hi>Clause</hi> in the <hi>Oath,</hi> I should then be content with it. But 'tis otherwise: for he there Confirms it in effect as 'tis in the <hi>Article.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now you know how much <hi>Simplicity</hi> becomes an <hi>Oath,</hi> and how requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site it is that it should be conceiv'd in plain and <hi>liquid</hi> terms, and taken in the Imposer's sense and without <hi>mental</hi> reservations, and that you should Swear therein to no <hi>dogmatical</hi> Assertion; and as to which Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> saith well in his <hi>Observations on that Oath, to swear positively to any dogmatical Assertion is not required. It would be a taking the Name of God in vain: for if it be a certain and undoubted truth in it self and to others, as are Principles of Reason and Articles of Faith, an Oath is vain, for it ends no strife. If doubtful and a question whether true or not, tho such an Oath puts it out of question that I believe so, yet not that it is a truth. My belief, tho never so much evidenced and confirm'd, doth not make a doubtful matter in it self more credible; nor is one man's believing an Assertion just ground for another man to believe the same. Such an Oath therefore is in vain, and not a fit</hi> Medium <hi>to end such a Controversy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now how far your <hi>declaring</hi> in your <hi>Oath</hi> that <hi>no foreign Prela<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>e hath nor ought to have any Iurisdiction Spiritual within this Realm,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it <hi>pursuant</hi> to the 37th <hi>Article</hi> delivering the Plain words, <hi>The Bishop of Rome hath no Iurisdiction,</hi> &amp;c. may bring you within the <hi>Verge</hi> of <hi>swearing</hi> what is <hi>dogmatical,</hi> I leave you to judge: but shall take the liberty to tell you, that when I see some of our <hi>Laws,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly this about our <hi>Oath <hi>girdled</hi>
                     </hi> with so many <hi>Interpretations</hi> like new <hi>tender-sided</hi> Ships, I shall be apt to take little pleasure in embarquing my Conscience in such an <hi>Oath,</hi> and am apt to call to mind the <hi>Censure</hi> which Mr. <hi>Milton's Character of the Long Parliament of</hi> 40. fulminates against his Countrymen, and by which he so much disables our understandings as to Political Government; and saith, <hi>that the Sun which we want, ripens Wits as well as Fruits, and as Wine and Oyl are imported to us from abroad, so must ripe understanding,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>But however, tho our <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Oyl</hi> are imported to us from abroad, our <hi>Dispensations</hi> are not, and we have no Occasion to send <hi>Gold</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Lead:</hi> And I assure you, he who shall consider that the English <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosi</hi> were the <hi>last</hi> that did receive the yokes of the old <hi>Imperial</hi> and later <hi>Papal</hi> Power of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>first</hi> that threw them off, will tho we are <hi>Crasso sub aëre nati,</hi> have no cause to vilifie our understandings, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to envy their triumphs over Infallibility so call'd. And perhaps when I shall have told you of another passage of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> P. 59. in his <hi>Schism guarded,</hi> you will think the Eyes of our Ancestors understandings did look out sharp when the two <hi>Statutes</hi> of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliz.</hi> were made; and there he saith, <hi>Suppose any of our Reformers have run into any Excesses or Extremes, either in their Expressions, or perhaps in their Actions (it is a difficult thing in great changes to observe a just mean) it may be out of Humane Frailty, as</hi> Lycurgus <hi>out of hatred to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cut down all the Vines about</hi> Sparta, <hi>or it may be out of Policy, as men use to bend a Crooked rod as much the contrary way, or as expert Masters of Musick do sometimes draw up their Scholars a Note too high, to bring them to a just tone, what is that to us as long as we practice the Mean and maintain the Mean, and guide our selves by the certain line and level of Apostolical and Primitive Tradition?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is no doubt but in the <hi>framing</hi> of the <hi>Statute</hi> of 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the <hi>Oath</hi> therein, regard was had to the <hi>Oath</hi> in the <hi>35th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 1. viz.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:34919:40"/>
                     <hi>I having now the veil of Darkness of the Usurped Power, Authority and Iurisdiction of the See and Bishops of</hi> Rome <hi>clearly taken away from mine Eyes, do utterly testify and declare in my Conscience, that neither the See nor the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor any foreign Potentate hath nor ought to have any Iurisdiction, Power or Authority within this Realm, neither by God's Law, nor any other just Law or means,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that I shall never consent nor agree that the aforesaid See or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of</hi> Rome, <hi>or their Successors, shall exercise or have any manner of Authority, Iurisdiction or Power within this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. And this Oath remain'd the same all the rest of his Reign, and all <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>'s time: and as to which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> changed the Expression of <hi>Supreme Head:</hi> and both <hi>Harry</hi> the 8th, and <hi>She</hi> having their Eyes on the effect of <hi>Papal</hi> Excommunications, and concern'd to have the <hi>nullity</hi> of them believed by their Subjects, might seem according to the <hi>Primate's</hi> Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <hi>to bend the crooked rod of the</hi> Papal <hi>Iurisdiction overmuch the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way in their Oaths,</hi> that so it might come to that just straitness referr'd to according to the <hi>Primate's</hi> measures of it.</p>
                  <p>But after all I shall tell you, that I think no <hi>Political</hi> respects can justifie the putting <hi>doubtful</hi> Expressions into an <hi>Oath,</hi> or the <hi>taking</hi> of one with <hi>mental</hi> reservations of a <hi>sense</hi> different from the <hi>Common</hi> one of the words, and I do therefore joyn <hi>issue</hi> with you in the Point, that the <hi>Clause</hi> in the <hi>Oath, <hi>That no foreign Prelate hath or ought to have any Iurisdiction,</hi>
                     </hi> &amp;c. being the very <hi>same</hi> in the 37th <hi>Article,</hi> (and in the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of which <hi>Article,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Canons</hi> have, as you said, made you a <hi>sharer</hi> with the <hi>Clergy</hi>) you and all others who <hi>take</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> may be thankful for the <hi>benefit</hi> of that <hi>King,</hi> having <hi>further</hi> exercised the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power of his <hi>interpreting</hi> the whole intent of that <hi>Oath:</hi> And that <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of it which hath made the <hi>Coast</hi> of the Oath <hi>clear</hi> to you in this Point, you will find agreeing to what he hath in our Language <hi>Publish'd</hi> to the World, and dedicated to eternity. For he having in his <hi>Premonition to all Christian Monarchs</hi> mention'd how <hi>he caus'd the House of Commons to Reform a Clause they had put into the Oath of Allegiance derogatory to the Pope's spiritual Power,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Pope had no Power to Excommunicate him, and that he was ready to consent that the Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>should have the first Seat, and be Patriarch of the West, and be</hi> Primus Episcopus inter omnes Episcopos &amp; princeps Episcoporum, <hi>so it be no otherwise but as</hi> Peter <hi>was, Princeps Apostolorum,</hi> takes occasion in his <hi>Apology</hi> for the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to let the <hi>World</hi> know his <hi>Royal</hi> judgment of the <hi>intent</hi> of the <hi>OATH</hi> of <hi>SUPREMACT;</hi> and there in <hi>Confutation</hi> of the Pope's <hi>Breves,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> Letter, he saith in <hi>p.</hi> 108. that <hi>the rendring Christian Kings within their own Dominions, Governors of their Church as well as of the rest of their People, in being <hi>Custodes utriusque tabulae,</hi> not by making new Articles of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but by commanding Obedience to be given to the Word of God, by reforming Religion according to his prescribed Will, by assisting the Spiritual Power with the Temporal Sword, by reforming Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by procuring due Obedience to the Church, by judging and cutting off all frivolous Questions and Schisms as</hi> Constantine <hi>did, and finally by making</hi> decorum <hi>to be observ'd in every thing, and establishing Orders to be observ'd in all indifferent things for that purpose, is the ONLY <hi>intent of the Oath of Supremacy:</hi>
                     </hi> and whereby as he effectually <hi>confuted</hi> the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> whose <hi>Letter</hi> charged the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> as tending to this end, <hi>That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Head of the Church in</hi> England <hi>may be transferr'd from the Successor of St.</hi> Peter <hi>to the Successor of King</hi> Henry <hi>the 8th, and to oppose the Primacy of the Apostolick See;</hi> so at the <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>Book</hi> he shews that

                  <p>I hope you have now put a <hi>Period</hi> to the <hi>History</hi> of the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power of the Crown, that was exercised in-the <hi>interpreting</hi> of any <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> or the 37th <hi>Article</hi> thereto relating. You have named to me so many <hi>interpretations</hi> of the <hi>Oath,</hi> that according to the wisdom of our State, and the <hi>Lex &amp; Consuetudo Parliamenti</hi> making a <hi>Bill</hi> to be thrice read in each <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and then receiving the <hi>Royal</hi> Assent to be thought like <hi>Gold</hi> seven times purify'd, may shew the <hi>interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> to be so too. But tho I will account any good Law to be more precious then Gold, yet if like <hi>Gold</hi> it be too far extended by <hi>ductile</hi> interpretation, it may be drawn to such a thinness as to lose all its weight and estimation, and retain only a poor tincture and colour that will signifie little or nothing. And as <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Panegyrick</hi> on <hi>Trajan</hi> said, that by reason of the <hi>multitudes</hi> of sutes upon <hi>Penal</hi> Laws in <hi>Rome,</hi> there was danger till <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time, <hi>ne Civitas fundata legibus, legibus ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teretur;</hi> so a Law whose Obligatoriness is founded on <hi>interpretations</hi> may be endanger'd by the multitudes of them to be destroy'd, and may like the <hi>Papal</hi> Laws of New <hi>Rome</hi> by the infinite interpretations of <hi>Casuists</hi> in the <hi>forum internum</hi> (which is their <hi>Tribunal</hi>) be brought to signifie nothing in either <hi>forum,</hi> and to be only an Engine to make Perplexities.</p>
                  <p>You have given me here such a <hi>Genealogy</hi> of <hi>interpretations,</hi> that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common <hi>Story</hi> of <hi>Arise Daughter,</hi> &amp;c. one may say, <hi>Arise In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, and go to thy Interpretation,</hi> &amp;c. I shall therefore be glad now you have been so largely communicative of your thoughts to me about the <hi>assertory</hi> part of the <hi>Oath,</hi> you will deal as <hi>frankly</hi> with me in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting me with what may in the <hi>Promissory</hi> part of the <hi>Oath</hi> be of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance for me to know in order to the better discharge of my Duty in the <hi>Case</hi> before me.</p>

Eliz. c. 1. <hi>where it is said, that to be reconciled to the See of</hi> Rome <hi>is Treason: but to be reconciled to the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is not Treason; for then every Papist would be a Traytor, being a Member of the Church, and therefore reconciled to it. Now the See of</hi> Rome <hi>is nothing else but the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy or Supremacy of the Pope, whereby by virtue of the Canon,</hi> unam San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctam, <hi>made by Pope</hi> Boniface <hi>the 8th, he challengeth a Superiority of Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Correction over all Kings and Princes upon Earth: and those Persons which take the</hi> juramentum fidei <hi>contain'd in the end of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>which acknowledgeth this Supremacy, are said to be reconciled to this See. The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is nothing else but a number of Men within the Pope's Dominions and elsewhere professing the Religion of Poperty: and that the Clergy had an ill meaning in leaving this Clause in the Oath thus loose, I have some reason to imagine when I find it in their late Books, that they say the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is a true Church, and Salvation is to be had in it.</hi>

                  <p>And considering that a Popish <hi>Parliament</hi> of Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s did give this their august Declarative sense of the <hi>executive</hi> Power, of <hi>punishing all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders against the Regality and Dignity of the Crown</hi> (which is the great <hi>Offence</hi> taken at Popery) <hi>and the Laws of the Realm,</hi> as <hi>belonging</hi> to or inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in our Kings by virtue of their being <hi>Supreme Governors <hi>of the Realm,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>You know how wary and careful our <hi>English</hi> Princes have always been that their Subjects might see them hold the reins of the Executive Power of the Law in their hands, and that none but the <hi>stubborn</hi> and <hi>evil doers</hi> need fear the being over-run by it.</p>
                  <p>And while I happen to think of the memorable <hi>Expression</hi> of a Loyal <hi>Lord</hi> in a <hi>Speech</hi> in a late <hi>Parliament</hi> of the <hi>unreasonableness</hi> of any ones suffering merely by the word <hi>Proditoriè</hi> being put into the charge of a thing that was not in its self <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>as if it were said that such an one did</hi> traiterously <hi>pass over the Thames in a Boat:</hi> I likewise think of the <hi>reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness</hi> of our <hi>Laws</hi> in providing for the common <hi>Safety</hi> by the <hi>Prince</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allow'd to <hi>hold</hi> the <hi>Sail</hi> of the <hi>Executive</hi> Power in his own hands, and which otherwise if ty'd fast about the Boat might cause it upon any sudden gust of wind to be overset.</p>
                  <p>You know therefore how King <hi>Iames</hi> the First in his <hi>Apology for the Oath of Allegiance,</hi> in <hi>Answer</hi> to the <hi>Pope's first Breve,</hi> thought himself obliged in <hi>justice</hi> for the maintenance of that <hi>Executive</hi> Power of the Crown to say as to <hi>the Pope's expressing his sorrow for that Persecution which the Catholicks sustain for the Faiths sake, wherein beside the main untruth whereby I am so injuriously used</hi> (as if he had thought it a personal injury to himself that any one in his Realm should be persecuted for Religion) <hi>I must ever avow and maintain as the truth is, according to mine own knowledge, that the late QUEEN of famous Memory never PUNISH'D any Papist for Religion.</hi> He doth not say, <hi>her Laws,</hi> and <hi>Ministers,</hi> but <hi>SHE never punish'd,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Well, Sir, In fine I leave it to you to consider on the whole matter how far the Contents of that Canon, and particularly what is declared therein about <hi>the care of God's Church being so committed to Kings in the Scripture, that they are commended when the Church keeps the right way, and blamed when it runs amiss, and therefore her Government belongs in chief to Kings,</hi> &amp;c. do shew that Kings not only may, but ought out of a regard to their own Souls to provide that where the <hi>safety</hi> of their Subjects <hi>Souls</hi> is concern'd, their <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power by the <hi>interpretation</hi> of their Laws, and the <hi>relaxation</hi> of their <hi>Rigour</hi> in particular Cases may be exerted.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but you have observ'd many more Cases wherein the Royal <hi>Martyr</hi> to prevent imminent <hi>peril</hi> of <hi>Soul</hi> was put to it to exert such his Power.</p>

Dr.</hi> Burgesse <hi>indeed made an Interpretation of his own Subscription, but there had been no validity in it (as we conceive) unless it had been allow'd by the Superior Powers. And so it was: for (as he saith). It was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by King</hi> James: <hi>and the Archbishop of</hi> Canterbury <hi>affirm'd it to be the true sense and meaning of the Church of</hi> England. He refers there to Dr. <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse</hi> in his <hi>Answer to a much applauded Pamphlet,</hi> Praefat. <hi>p.</hi> 26.</p>

                  <p>Your mentioning that of Dr. <hi>Burgesse</hi> his <hi>Interpretation</hi> of his <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription</hi> minds me of what I have read at the end of his Book call'd <hi>No Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege nor Sin to alienate or purchase Cathedral Lands,</hi> viz. <hi>in his</hi> Postscript to Dr. <hi>Pearson,</hi> and his <hi>No Necessity of Reformation of the Publick Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>Printed</hi> A. 1660. where he saith, <hi>As touching the Regal Supremacy, we own and will assert it as far as you do or dare. Only we had reason to take notice of the improper Expression in the 37th Article that <hi>the Queen's Majesty hath the Supreme Power.</hi> For if the Declaration</hi>

                     <hi>father'd on the late King, and prefix'd to the Articles, had so much Power with his Printer, that he durst not alter the word <hi>Queen</hi> into <hi>King</hi> even in the year</hi> 1642, <hi>and those Articles must be read</hi> Verbatim <hi>without Alteration or Explanation, then we say again there is a Necessity of Reforming that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in the expression of it: and not to talk at random what was indeed the meaning, unless we may have leave when we read it</hi> (Regiâ declaratione non-obstante) <hi>to declare the sense which the Declaration alloweth us not to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the truth is, that exception of the <hi>Doctor</hi> to the <hi>Articles</hi> may well pass for a <hi>Scruple,</hi> or rather a <hi>Cavil:</hi> and at this rate we should be put to it to say, <hi>O King interpret for ever.</hi>

                  <p>You say right. Dr. <hi>Pierson</hi> in that Judicious Book of his, call'd <hi>No Necessity of Reforming the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> England, well observes that the 37th <hi>Article hath express reference to the Queen's Injunctions set forth in the year</hi> 1559. <hi>and those Injunctions take particular care, <hi>that no other Duty, Allegiance, or Bond should be required to the Queen, then was acknowledged to be due to the most noble Kings of famous Memory, King</hi>
                     </hi> Henry the 8th <hi>her Majesty's Father, or King</hi> Edward the 6th, <hi>her Majesty's Brother. <hi>The words of the Article declare that the Doctrine contained in it, concerneth all the Kings as Kings. The title in General is of the Civil Magistrates, and the words run thus.,</hi> where we attribute to the Queen's Majesty the chief Government we give not to our Princes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shewing that what they gave to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> her, they gave to all the Kings of</hi> England. <hi>Which will appear more plainly out of the first Latine Copy Printed in the time of Queen</hi> Eliz. <hi>in the year</hi> 1563. <hi>read and approved by the Queen, the words where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </hi> &amp;c. <hi>Being therefore the Article expresly mentioneth and concerneth the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>as they are the Kings of</hi> England, <hi>the mention of the Queen's Majesty in the Article can make the Doctrine no more doubtful then it doth our Allegiance in that Oath which was made</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Eliz. <hi>where the Heirs and Successors of the Queen are to appoint who shall accept the Oath, the words of which are <hi>that the Queen's Highness is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm.</hi> But I hope the Heirs and Successors of Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>did never appoint that Oath to be taken in the Name of the Queen's Highness, but in their own.</hi>

                  <p>It may be supposed that some such like <hi>Cavilling</hi> or <hi>Scrupling</hi> humour possess'd the fancies of some in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First: and that some occasion was thereby given to that <hi>Prince</hi> in those his <hi>Canons, expresly</hi> therein maintaining the 39 <hi>Articles,</hi> and the Subscription thereunto, and particularly in the 36th <hi>Canon</hi> there to enjoyn a <hi>Subscription</hi> to <hi>three</hi> Articles <hi>in such manner and sort as is there appointed,</hi> and of which the <hi>first</hi> is, <hi>That the King's Majesty under God is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm, and of all other his Highness Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that no foreign Prince, Person, Prelate, HAUE or OUGHT to have any Iurisdiction, Power, Superiority, Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, or Authority Ecclesiastical or Spiritual,</hi> &amp;c. and in which the words <hi>have or OUGHT to have,</hi> might possibly be inserted out of a Royal Complaisance with the Desires of some <hi>Scruplers</hi> in whose behalf the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. <hi>Rainolds</hi> moved the King at the <hi>Hampton-Court Conference</hi> that to the Position in the 37th <hi>Article,</hi> viz. <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Rome <hi>hath no Iurisdiction in this Realm of</hi> England, <hi>might be added nor OUGHT to have:</hi> but which motion the King then rejected as a thing superfluous, and saying, <hi>Habemus quod jure habemus.</hi>

                  <p>I have so: and the last Book I read that so represents it is, the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Dr.</hi> Stillingfleet'<hi>s Sermon by some Non-Conformists,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Printed</hi> A. 1680. and where in <hi>p.</hi> 29. they thus express their desires, <hi>viz.

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:34919:47"/>
                     <hi>Oath, and the Subscription in the Canons be suspended for the time to come.

And this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient we gather from the Lord</hi> Coke, <hi>who hath providently (as it were) against such a Season laid in this Observation,</hi> The form of the Subscription set down in the Canons ratify'd by King <hi>Iames,</hi> was not express'd in the Act of the 13th of <hi>Eliz.</hi> 4. <hi>Inst.</hi> c. 74. <hi>And consequently if the Clergy enjoy'd this freedom till then, in reference to the particulars therein contain'd, what binders why they might not have the same restored in reference also to others?</hi>

                  <p>It was the second <hi>Article</hi> enjoyn'd by that Canon to be <hi>subscribed,</hi> viz. That <hi>the Book of Common-Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>containeth in it nothing contrary to the Word of God, and that it may lawfully be used,</hi> &amp;c. at which they took so much offence, and to which the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> required not their Subscription.</p>

                  <p>But one may guess that by the Authority of some of the <hi>Lords</hi> the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> there was before the making of this <hi>Canon</hi> of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and after the <hi>Act</hi> of 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> in her Reign, some <hi>Subscription</hi> under <hi>disabling</hi> Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <hi>required</hi> of <hi>Ministers</hi> beyond what that <hi>Statute</hi> required, by what the <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Certain Considerations tending to promote Peace</hi> mentions, in p. 4. viz. <hi>That in the 30th year of the Reign of Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>the House of Commons presented to the Lords Spiritual and Temporal a Petition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining divers particulars, for the redress whereof they desire, that no Oath or Subscription might be tender'd to any at their entrance into the Ministry, but such as is expresly prescribed by the Statutes of the Realm, except the Oath against Corrupt entring, that they may not be troubled for the omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of some Rites, or Portions prescribed in the Book of Common Prayer: that such as had been suspended for no other Offence, but only for not subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing might be restored.</hi>

                  <p>It seems those Bishops then did as your Expression was, <hi>Dispensare in lege,</hi> and were (as I may say) <hi>Non-conformists</hi> to it, by going <hi>beyond</hi> it. For they were obliged <hi>sapere ad Regulam;</hi> and all <hi>Conformity</hi> is <hi>respectu regulae,</hi> and he who doth <hi>over-shoot,</hi> or who over-does what is enjoyn'd, is a <hi>Non-conformist.</hi>

                  <p>You here put me in mind how some of our <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> have been thus <hi>Non-conformists</hi> in over-shooting their mark, at the same time that they have with undistinguishing severity executed the rigour of the Laws against all who did <hi>shoot</hi> short. The Royal <hi>Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all his Loving Subjects, Publish'd with the Advice of his Privy Councel,</hi> A. 1641. refers to some <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in our <hi>Church <hi>which have been used without any legal Warrant or Injunction, and which already are, or speedily may be abolish'd.</hi>

                  <p>I do not wonder at it at all. For <hi>Conjunctures</hi> having happen'd when some <hi>Non-conformists</hi> having been <hi>tender</hi> of the Peace of the Government,

you need not wonder at any tenderness in it for them.

                  <p>I am highly pleas'd with your further bringing any thing to me like <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> that may strengthen the Regal Power of <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> or of <hi>dispensing</hi> with <hi>disability.</hi> We have discours'd of the Subject a pretty while together at this Meeting, and I must acknowledge you have entertain'd me with an account of many <hi>Statutes</hi> that have propp'd up the <hi>Regal</hi> Power of <hi>dispensing</hi> with <hi>disability:</hi> and that too (tho you observ'd it not to me) not only in their <hi>Preambles,</hi> but in their <hi>enacting</hi> parts, the which I account more momentous.

                  <p>Not in the least. The King thought fit in his <hi>Legislative</hi> Capacity, and with the Concurrence of the three Estates to issue forth such interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to the end it might be perpetuated. But you will find that they were so tender of that branch of Prerogative, namely of the Regal Power of interpreting <hi>out</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> that having referr'd to the King's <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the 25th of <hi>October,</hi> 1660. (<hi>i. e.</hi> that concerning <hi>Ecclesiastical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs</hi> we spoke of before) and mention'd that according to that <hi>he had gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Commission to several Bishops and other Divines to review the Book of Common Prayer, and to prepare such Alterations and Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as they thought fit to offer, and that afterwards the Convocations of both the Provinces of</hi> Canterbury <hi>and York, being by His Majesty called,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His Majesty hath been pleas'd to Authorize the Presidents of the said Convocation, and other the Bishops and Clergy of the same to review the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of the form and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the making and consecrating of Bishops, Priests,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that they should make such Additions and Alterations in the said Books as to them should seem meet, and should present the same to His Majesty for his further Allowance or Confirmation,</hi> and then setting forth that the same was accordingly done, and that some <hi>alterations</hi> were inserted into those Books by the <hi>Convocations,</hi> and by them <hi>Presented</hi> to His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and <hi>all which His Majesty having consider'd hath fully approved,</hi> it then follows, <hi>that His Majesty hath recommended to this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Books of Common Prayer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with the Alterations and Additions which have been so made and presented to His Majesty by the said Convocations, be the Book which shall be appointed to be used,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in all Parish Churches and Chapels,</hi> &amp;c. And it is upon the <hi>foundation</hi> of what His <hi>Majesty</hi> did as before-mention'd, that the following <hi>enacting</hi> Clauses with their Sanctions and Penalties are built.</p>
                  <p>And you may if you will take notice of a <hi>Proviso</hi> toward the end of the <hi>Act,</hi> being very tender of not hurting what King <hi>Iames</hi> by his Prerogative did in <hi>Uniting</hi> the <hi>Prebendship</hi> to the <hi>Professor</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> in <hi>Oxon</hi> for the time being, and whereby that <hi>King</hi> dispens'd with the <hi>incapacity</hi> of <hi>Lay-men,</hi> as to the enjoyment of such <hi>Prebendship:</hi> but the <hi>Act</hi> and the <hi>Proviso</hi> takes care to perpetuate the King's Professor's enjoying the same, and leaves the <hi>Prerogative</hi> at liberty to <hi>dispense</hi> with such <hi>disability</hi> in the Case.</p>
                  <p>In short, you see how <hi>tender</hi> that <hi>Parliament</hi> was of <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and tho they thought it not fit to give such loud <hi>Applauses</hi> to his late Majesty's <hi>Declaration</hi> of <hi>October</hi> the 25th, <hi>A.</hi> 1660. before-mention'd, wherein so much of the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power was exerted, yet you find they <hi>refer</hi> to it with respect.</p>

                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:34919:50"/>
&amp;c. <hi>we have thought it necessary to make known by Proclamation our authorizing of the same, and to require and enjoyn all men, as well Ecclesiastical as Temporal to Conform themselves to it, as the only publick Form of serving God, establish'd and allow'd to be in this Realm. And the rather for that all the Learned Men who were there present, as well of the Bishops as others, promised their Conformity in the practice of it, only making sute to us that some few might be born with for a time. Wherefore we require all Archbishops, Bishops, and all other publick Ministers, as well Ecclesiastical as Civil, to do their Duties in causing the same to be obey'd, and in punishing the Offenders according to the Laws of the Realm heretofore establish'd for the Authorizing the said Book of Common Prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You see there that all the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the great <hi>Parade</hi> of the <hi>literati</hi> present at that famous <hi>Conference,</hi> did <hi>implore</hi> the King for the exercise of his <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power for a while to some <hi>few.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is more considerable is, that the <hi>King</hi> here doth make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>relaxation</hi> of the <hi>Bond</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's Act</hi> of <hi>Uniformity</hi> in some things; and instead of inserting an express <hi>Clause</hi> of <hi>discharging</hi> from the <hi>Penalties</hi> of that <hi>Act,</hi> all that use the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> with the King's <hi>Alterations</hi> or <hi>Explanations,</hi> as Queen <hi>Elizabeth's Admonition</hi> did in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those who <hi>took</hi> the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the <hi>sense</hi> of her <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> (a thing indeed not necessary for either of them to have done when they had <hi>loosen'd</hi> the <hi>bond</hi> of the <hi>Observance</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi>) he enjoyns the <hi>uniform</hi> usage of the <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> as by him interpreted or <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd</hi> (the title of the Proclamation being A <hi>Proclamation for the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing an Uniformity of the Book of Common Prayer to be used throughout the Realm</hi>) under the <hi>disabling</hi> Punishments of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's Act</hi> of <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity;</hi> the <hi>Bishops</hi> all this while being ministerial to the King in his Power of thus interpreting, and <hi>explaining</hi> an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and the <hi>loosening</hi> of its <hi>Obligation</hi> both as to themselves and others.</p>
                  <p>I am to tell you, that in that <hi>Proclamation</hi> of <hi>March</hi> the <hi>fifth,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> refers to a <hi>Proclamation</hi> he had before Publish'd on the 24th of <hi>October</hi> then last past, wherein he gave the <hi>Puritan</hi> Divines an intimation of the <hi>Conference</hi> he intended to have: and in which he reflects on <hi>the heat of their Spirits as tending rather to Combustion then Reformation, which</hi> (saith he) <hi>if there be Cause to make, is more in our hearts then theirs,</hi> &amp;c. and afterwards saith, <hi>we are not ignorant that time may have brought in some. Corruptions, which may deserve a review and amendment, which if by the Assembly intended by us, we shall find to be so indeed, we will therein procéed according to the Laws and Customs of this Realm by Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Councel, or in our High Court of Parliament, or by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of our Clergy, as we shall find reason to lead us: not doubting but that in such an orderly proceeding, we shall have the Prelates &amp; others of our Clergy no less willing and far more able to afford us their Duty and Service, then any other whose zeal doth go so fast before their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the <hi>Proclamation</hi> in <hi>March</hi> following shew'd you how the King's reason lead him in his <hi>Proceeding</hi> in the Affair <hi>according to the Laws and Customs of this Realm,</hi> and how loyally his <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesced therein.</p>

                  <p>I remember I have read both these <hi>Proclamations:</hi> and I doubt not but that <hi>Hampton-Court Conference</hi> made a great <hi>ferment</hi> in the Body of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, tho none in the <hi>Orthodox</hi> Clergy. But I should be glad to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it made any <hi>fermentation</hi> in the Body of the People <hi>Representative,</hi>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:34919:50"/>
and what was the <hi>Result</hi> of it? Did the <hi>Parliament</hi> acquiesce in what the King had done as aforesaid? For if so; they had done as Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Parliament in publickly <hi>approving</hi> what she by her own Ecclesiastical <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> did in discharging the <hi>disabling</hi> Penalties in her first <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and in <hi>relaxing</hi> by her <hi>interpretation,</hi> the <hi>vinculum</hi> for its observance in that sense that many had before put on it.</p>

                  <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>Parliament</hi> did in effect, the very self-same thing. And I shall give you the account of it out of his <hi>Proclamation</hi> of the <hi>16th</hi> of <hi>Iuly,</hi> A. 1604. in the Second <hi>year</hi> of his Reign: for there having spoke of that <hi>Conference</hi> and of his having <hi>Publish'd</hi> by <hi>Proclamation</hi> what was the <hi>issue</hi> of it, and <hi>his hoping that when the same should be made known all reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Men would have rested satisfy'd with that which had been done, and not have moved further trouble of Speech of Matters whereof so solemn and advised deliberation had been made,</hi> His Majesty's following words are, <hi>Notwithstanding at the late Assembly of our Parliament, there wanted not many who renew'd with no little earnestness the Questions before determin'd, and many more as well about the Book of Common Prayer, as other Matters of Church Government, and importuned us for our assent to many Alterations therein: but yet with such Success, as when they heard both our own Speeches made to them at sundry times, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reasons of our former Proceedings in those Matters, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise had had Conference with some Bishops, and other Lords of the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per House about the same, they desisted from further Prosecution thereof, finding that of all things that might any way tend to the furtherance of Religion and of Establishment of a Ministry fit for the same, we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the Advice of our Councel, had such Consideration as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent state of things would bear, and taken order how the same should be prosecuted by such means as might be used without any publick distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance or innovation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in how vigorous a State the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power as to the <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists</hi> afterward continued in the Reign of that Prince appears by what I have before cited of an Application made to him by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons for the exercise of the same to the Non-conformists, in the 10th <hi>year</hi> of his Reign.</p>
                  <p>Moreover how by <hi>Tacit</hi> Dispensation he <hi>dispens'd</hi> with the <hi>Disabilities</hi> that Roman Catholick <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> had incurr'd by his <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> I have told you.

               <p>Thus far Mr. <hi>Prynne;</hi> who verifies the Facts above-mention'd, not only from my Lord <hi>Cottington</hi>'s Papers, but from the <hi>Mercure Francois,</hi> Tom. 9. <hi>A.</hi> 1624. <hi>p.</hi> 25, 26, 27. and on which <hi>Author</hi> he in <hi>p.</hi> 47. bestows the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of <hi>one of the truest Historians of this latter Age:</hi> and whom Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> had before in <hi>p.</hi> 40. cited for the truth of the general <hi>Articles</hi> referring to <hi>Tom</hi> 9. p. 11. and 28. And I shall here observe to you, that what Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> hath set down as aforesaid, to be the <hi>Form</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> took by the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Councel</hi> to the <hi>former</hi> Articles, doth appear to be referr'd by him to <hi>both</hi> sorts of <hi>Articles,</hi> viz. both the <hi>general</hi> and the <hi>private</hi> ones. For tho toward the end of the <hi>general</hi> Articles it appear'd only that <hi>the King and Prince were to be Sworn that all the Privy Councellors should sign those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles under their hands,</hi> and that the King <hi>Subscribed</hi> those <hi>Articles,</hi> and was <hi>sworn</hi> to them in the <hi>presence</hi> of those <hi>Bishops</hi> and other <hi>Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors</hi> before named; yet the <hi>first</hi> of the <hi>private</hi> Articles agreeing that <hi>the Councel should take the Oath as far as pertain'd to them, and belong'd to the Execution which by the hands of them and their Ministers is to be exercised,</hi> that the <hi>Penal</hi> Laws should not be <hi>executed</hi> against <hi>Roman-Catholicks,</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it appears according to Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> that the Privy Councellors were Sworn to both Articles together: and that by the words of <hi>IURO ETIAM,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>private</hi> Articles were referr'd to; and the which will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear the more manifest, if you consider that the <hi>general</hi> Articles had not one word therein for the <hi>tolerating</hi> of more <hi>Papists</hi> then those of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta</hi>'s Family, and such who particularly belong'd to her. Nor was there any thing more as to the <hi>Privy Councellors</hi> agreed to in the <hi>general</hi> Articles, then their signing them. And both the <hi>general</hi> and <hi>private</hi> Articles bearing
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:34919:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the same Date, it may be the rather supposed that <hi>pursuant</hi> to the first <hi>private</hi> Article, containing the King's Covenant for the Privy Councel's being <hi>sworn</hi> to them, that the <hi>Bishops</hi> and the other <hi>Privy Councellors</hi> might then be <hi>sworn</hi> to them, as well as their having then particularly signed or <hi>subscribed</hi> the <hi>general</hi> Articles appears: for so Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s words are, p. 44. <hi>The King and the Embassadors went to the Councel-Chamber, where all the Lords of the Councel seal'd and subscribed the general Articles of the Marriage,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

But <hi>Heylin</hi> in his <hi>History of the Presbyterians,</hi> represents this as a Sham-Letter, and put upon the Archbishop: and saith, that <hi>the Archbishop could not be so ill a Statesman (having been long a Privy Councellor) as not to know that he who sits at Helm, must steer his Course according to Wind and Weather, and that there was a great difference between such Personal Indulgences as the King had granted in the Case to his Popish Subjects, and any such Publick exercise of their Superstitions as the word</hi> Toleration <hi>doth import.</hi> And so he giveth Judgment, <hi>that</hi> Abbot <hi>was only the reputed Author of this Bastard Letter, and not the natural Parent of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the various Editions of this <hi>Letter,</hi> I have observ'd no <hi>date</hi> to it: and it is in that Book of Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> before his mention of the <hi>general</hi> or <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> Articles, and before the <hi>Match</hi> was resolv'd on by the King. And if notwithstanding that <hi>Letter,</hi> the Archbishop was afterward Sworn to the <hi>Articles,</hi> his altering his judgment on grounds of Reason, was both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, and <hi>exemplary:</hi> and worthy of that mutual <hi>Confidence</hi> between the King and him and the other <hi>Bishops</hi> in the <hi>Councel,</hi> and his Privy Councel in general; and which was such, that in a lawful Matter the King could <hi>stipulate</hi> for their Obedience in the first <hi>private</hi> Article as was before mention'd.</p>

                  <p>I might here observe to you, that we are told in <hi>The Regal Apology</hi> (that the <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Antiquities</hi> mention'd to have been writ by Dr. <hi>Bate</hi>) that <hi>A particular Toleration had a former President even in Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>in those Articles of Marriage which were consented to with the Duke of</hi> Anjou: <hi>and if it were true that an Universal Toleration was agreed on by King</hi> James, <hi>it was</hi> intuitu majoris boni. <hi>The Palatinate was to be restored again, and the Protestants of</hi> Germany <hi>to be re-enstated in their Possessions on that Condition.</hi>

                  <p>Now have you set me a <hi>longing</hi> to know what the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> did in the Case of that <hi>Petition</hi> about <hi>removing</hi> those <hi>disabled</hi> Persons from <hi>serving</hi> the <hi>King</hi> in those great <hi>Stations.</hi> And since the Judgment of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was always had in such great veneration, I think if the result of the <hi>desire</hi> of the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> was that the Lords had <hi>joyn'd</hi> with them in the <hi>Petition,</hi> and had urged that the King could not <hi>dispense</hi> with that <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> and Pardon <hi>Disability,</hi> it may make a notable <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident</hi> in the <hi>Case</hi> we have been discussing.</p>

                  <p>You will find that the <hi>Commons</hi> urged nothing to the prejudice of <hi>Prerogative</hi> in the <hi>Prayer</hi> of their <hi>Petition.</hi> Their <hi>style</hi> there was, <hi>We humbly beseech your Majesty graciously to vouchsafe that the said Lords and Gentlemen here under-named for this important Reason, and for the greater Safety of your Majesty and of your Realm, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all your Majesty's Commissions of great Charge and Trust, Commissions of Lieutenancy,</hi> &amp;c. And the <hi>important</hi> reason did refer to the <hi>great Countenance hereby given to Popery, the great grief and offence to all his best affected and true loving Subjects by putting the Power of Arms into such mens hands as by former Acts of His Majesty's Councel are adjudged Persons justly to be suspected,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But to let you see what the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> did hereupon, Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> tells you, <hi>p.</hi> 69. <hi>That this Petition being read, the House did defer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate thereof at this time, for that the day was far spent. And answer was given to the Commons (who attended for the same in the Painted Chamber) that the Lords will send them an Answer of this Petition, hereafter when they are resolv'd thereof.</hi> Whereupon Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> concludes his <hi>account</hi> of this <hi>Transaction</hi> thus, <hi>Whether any of these were displaced upon this Petition, I find not in any Memorials; it being certain some of them were not, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still in these Offices of Trust.</hi>

                  <p>I shall here afford your <hi>Curiosity</hi> a recompence by observing it to you with allusion to some of the words of the Royal <hi>Martyr</hi> in his <hi>Answer</hi> to the 19 <hi>Propositions, That the ancient, equal, happy, well poysed, and never enough commended Constitution of the Government of this Kingdom having made this Nation so famous and happy to a great degree of Envy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the Lords being trusted with a Iudicatory Power are an excellent Screen and Bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince and the People, to assist each against any Encroachment of the other,</hi> &amp;c. that the Wisdom of that House in acting as it hath done, in many <hi>Conjunctures</hi> hath put an end to many ferments accidentally occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd by others mistakes about <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and whereby that <hi>august</hi> Assembly did sometimes <hi>Cunctando restituere rem,</hi> and by its forbearing out of <hi>tender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>I shall for this purpose observe to you, that I once reading to the late <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Anglesy</hi> when he was Lord <hi>Privy Seal,</hi> what I had in a <hi>Manuscript</hi> of mine set down, as the <hi>Fact</hi> of what had passed between the late <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> concerning his <hi>Declaration of Indulgence</hi> on <hi>March</hi> the 15th, 1671. and the <hi>Penal</hi> Laws being thereby <hi>suspended</hi> (and the <hi>suspension</hi> of <hi>which</hi> the <hi>Commons</hi> then urged could not be but by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and whereupon they <hi>apply'd</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> for the <hi>Vacating</hi> that <hi>Declaration</hi>) his Lordship did <hi>dictate</hi> to me in order to my <hi>Compleating</hi> the <hi>state</hi> of that <hi>Fact,</hi> and which I writ from his Mouth, as followeth, <hi>viz. But it is to be observ'd upon this whole Transaction between the King and the House of Commons, that the Lords had no hand in the Address to the King about this great Point; altho it be uncontroverted that the Lords are the only Iudicatory that can determine any controverted Point without an Act of Parliament, and either the King or the Commons might in a particular Case have had this Point brought by Appeal to the Lords, if they had pleas'd, and consequently might have effected the judicial decision of the same.</hi>

                  <p>No, but only against the <hi>Suspending</hi> them, which are things of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Nature. The same <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> by having <hi>Iuly</hi> the 10th, 1663. resolved, <hi>That His Majesty be humbly desired to issue forth his Proclamation for the punctual and effectual Execution and Observance of the Act of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation without any Dispensation whatsoever, whereby the Act may be in the least violated, and to recal such Dispensations as are already granted,</hi> &amp;c. did <hi>virtually</hi> shew a Deference to His Majesty's <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Dispensing.</hi> Nay, let me tell you, that the very many <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> which <hi>expresly</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against the Crown's <hi>dispensing</hi> by <hi>Non-obstante</hi> in some <hi>particular</hi> Cases, may all be cited as <hi>Presidents</hi> or <hi>Iudgments</hi> of <hi>Parliaments</hi> for the propping up the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power, and of Parliaments having <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> that <hi>Power</hi> in our Kings, the exercise of which they provide against and desire to take away in such particular Cases.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>And which is more, I can tell you that long afterward, <hi>viz.</hi> A. 1640. the <hi>Lords</hi> highly resenting both the <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Bishoprick</hi> he had obtain'd, and calling to mind the <hi>Sentence</hi> they had pronounced against him, did on the 18th of <hi>April</hi> that year, <hi>refer</hi> the <hi>Consideration</hi> thereof to their Grand <hi>Committee</hi> for <hi>Privileges, it being also moved, that what can be alledged on the Lord Bishop of St.</hi> David'<hi>s part, either by Pardon, Licence or otherwise, may be produced and seen at the Sitting of the Lords Committees for their full and clear understanding, and better expedition in the business:</hi> and on the <hi>21st</hi> of <hi>April</hi> that <hi>year, order'd, that on the following</hi> Monday, <hi>the Records be brought into the House, that the House might determine the Cause,</hi> and on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> following, <hi>order'd the Cause to be heard the next day,</hi> and upon which day some such <hi>fatal</hi> Sentence being <hi>expected</hi> against the <hi>Bishop,</hi> as, <hi>And his Bishoprick let another man take,</hi> by reason of his having been <hi>judicially</hi> disabled; His Majesty commanded that Bishop not to Sit in Parliament, nor send any <hi>Proxy</hi> thither: and the <hi>serment</hi> of the debate went off without any <hi>Iudgment</hi> given by the <hi>Lords</hi> that might touch <hi>Prerogative</hi> in the Point.</p>
                  <p>And if in the <hi>year</hi> 1640. when the <hi>air</hi> of mens <hi>fancies</hi> was so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the <hi>Pestilence</hi> of <hi>Faction,</hi> so much <hi>tenderness</hi> was shewn to <hi>Prerogative</hi> (and that too in the Case of a <hi>Criminal</hi> whom the <hi>Commons</hi> had for so many years made the great object of their anger, as one whom they look'd on as a <hi>Proditor</hi> or Betrayer of his Country, and Betrayer of their <hi>Properties</hi>) the Loyal may well say <hi>quid non speremus,</hi> as to any future <hi>ferment</hi> that can rise in Parliament, being allay'd without <hi>Prejudice</hi> to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Iournals</hi> of Parliament in the Beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First do tell us of the great ferment about the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Bishop <hi>Montague,</hi> whom the <hi>Commons</hi> had <hi>impeach'd</hi> before the <hi>Lords,</hi> and who after the <hi>Parliament</hi> was <hi>Prorogued</hi> to the 4th <hi>year</hi> of the <hi>reign</hi> of that <hi>Prince,</hi> had obtain'd his <hi>Pardon</hi> in the time of the <hi>Prorogation,</hi> and that such <hi>Pardon</hi> was by the Commons <hi>question'd,</hi> and that such <hi>questioning</hi> soon evaporated.</p>
                  <p>But according to that <hi>Great</hi> Saying of Sir <hi>Harry Martin</hi> in his <hi>Speech</hi> at a <hi>Conference</hi> between both Houses (as you will find it in <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But there is a difference between those Statutes and the Laws and Statutes whereon the Petition is grounded. By those Statutes the Subject hath no interest in the Penalties which are all the fruit such Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes can produce, until by Sute or Information he become entituled to the particular Forfeitures; whereas the Laws and Statutes mention'd in our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are of another Nature. There shall your Lordships find us to rely upon the good old Statute called</hi> Magna Charta, <hi>which declareth and confirmeth the ancient Common Laws of the Liberties of</hi> England: and there he speaks afterward of <hi>other Statute Laws not inflicting Penalties upon Offenders</hi> in malis prohibitis, <hi>but Laws declarative or positive, conferring or confirming</hi> ipso facto <hi>an inherent Right and Interest of liberty and freedom in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Realm, as their Birth-rights and Inheritances descendable to their Heirs and Posterities, the Statutes incorporate into the Body of the Common Law; over which (with reverence be it spoken) there is no Trust reposed in the King's Soveraign Power or Prerogative Royal to enable him to dispense with them, or to take from his Subjects the Birthright which they have in their Liberties, by virtue of the Common Law.</hi>

                  <p>I refer you to the <hi>Book</hi> it self, and where you will see that that Great <hi>Statesman</hi> did then assert the <hi>extent</hi> of <hi>Prerogative</hi> in that Point, with as much strength of <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> as if he had been then <hi>fitting</hi> at the <hi>Helm of State:</hi> and where he further shews <hi>the Necessity of a standing Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme executive Power to mitigate or wholy to SUSPEND the execution of any Penal Laws,</hi> &amp;c. But I shall best entertain you with his Lordship's own words as so great a <hi>Narrator</hi> as Mr. <hi>Marvell</hi> relates them, and who (as he saith) telling his Lordship that <hi>the Declaration of Indulgence assumed a Power to repeal and SUSPEND all our Laws, his Lordship <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>eplyed, that he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd at his Objection, there being not one of these in the Case. For the King assumed no Power of repealing Laws, or suspending them contrary to the will of his Parliament, or People; and not to argue with me at that time the Power of</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:34919:57"/>
                     <hi>the King's Supremacy, which was of another Nature then that he had in Civils, and had been exercised without exception in this very Case by his Father, Grandfather, and Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>under the Great Seal to foreign Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants become Subjects of</hi> England, <hi>nor to instance in the SUSPENDING the execution of the two Acts of Navigation, and Trade during both this and the last</hi> Dutch <hi>War, in the same words and upon the same necessity, and as yet without clamour that ever we heard. But to pass by all that, this is certain, a Government could not be supposed whether Monarchical, or other of any sort, without a standing Supreme executive Power fully enabled to mitigate, or WHOLT to SUSPEND the execution of any Penal Law in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of the Legislative Power: which when assembled there was no doubt, but wherever there lies a Negative in passing of a Law, there the Address or sense known of either of them to the Contrary (as for instance of either of our two Houses of Parliament in</hi> England) <hi>ought to determine that Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and restore the Law to its full execution. For without this the Laws were to no purpose made, if the Prince could annul them at pleasure, and so on the other hand without a Power always in being of dispensing on occasion, was to suppose a Constitution extremely imperfect, and impracticable, and to Cure those with a Legislative Power always in being, is when consider'd no other then a perfect Tyranny.</hi>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I find that his <hi>Lordship</hi> doth not in the least <hi>distinguish</hi> between the Right of Prerogative in <hi>suspending</hi> the <hi>Disabling</hi> or <hi>incapacitating</hi> Penal Laws, and others.

For 'tis obvious to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by how many accidents a <hi>suspension</hi> of Penal Laws <hi>revocable</hi> on an <hi>Address</hi> from the Parliament, may happen to be not so <hi>revoked.</hi>

                  <p>You say right. The King may thus according to his Lordship's <hi>Opinion</hi> suspend all Penal <hi>Disabilities</hi> as well as other <hi>Penalties</hi> incurr'd by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and particularly by the <hi>Test-Act</hi> of 25<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p>But I suppose his Lordship there has nothing that may favour the <hi>repealing</hi> of the <hi>Test,</hi> or any of the <hi>Penal</hi> Laws against the <hi>Papists.</hi>

                  <p>None would expect from him anything to be moved for the repealing of the <hi>Test;</hi> however he allow'd <hi>Prerogative</hi> to <hi>suspend</hi> it. But at that time that all People of narrow Souls and ignoble Thoughts were with so much clamour hunting down all <hi>Roman-Catholicks</hi> without <hi>distinction,</hi> and when the most devout among them by being (as it were) <hi>ad bestias dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati</hi> and devoured by <hi>Informers,</hi> appear'd as a <hi>spectacle</hi> of delight to many inhumane Protestants, his Lordship's <hi>humanity</hi> was so great as to incline him in <hi>p.</hi> 6. there to give them somewhat like a <hi>Quietus</hi> from all <hi>Pecuniary</hi> Laws. And the truth is when I consider how little <hi>Wool</hi> the <hi>fleecing</hi> of <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> or any <hi>Heterodox</hi> Religionaries at home or abroad hath brought to the Exchequer of any <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> and only to <hi>Informers,</hi> and that the Consciences of peaceable Men have been burden'd by Men of no Conscience, and by the <hi>turba gravis paci</hi> who are indeed burthens of the Earth, I tremble to think what occasion may have been taken by Male-contents to say in their Hearts as to any such Prince or State, according to those words of the Psalmist, <hi>Thou sellest thy People for nought, and dost not encrease thy Wealth by their Price,</hi> or <hi>and takest no Money for them.</hi> I shall at some other time of our meeting give you some account cut of the <hi>Records</hi> of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> of the inconsiderable <hi>Sums</hi> of <hi>Money,</hi>

The same thing likewise hath been my <hi>aim</hi> in the several <hi>Presidents</hi> I have given you of the <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Power by Queen <hi>Elizabeth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> exercised in <hi>suspending</hi> Penal Laws.</p>
                  <p>The expression of <hi>tenderness</hi> for the <hi>Rights</hi> of our <hi>Princes</hi> hath been much <hi>used</hi> by the loyal <hi>Patriot'y</hi> Writers in the late Reigns: And here <hi>I</hi> shall <hi>à propos</hi> apply it, as the <hi>Resuscitatio,</hi> Part. 1. p. 37. mentions it as used by my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in a <hi>Speech</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> to the <hi>Question</hi> now before us in the <hi>Reign</hi> of King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Second.</hi> His Lordships words are, <hi>Since therefore we have a Prince of so excellent Wisdom and Moderation, of whose Authority we ought to be TENDER as he is likewise of our Liberty, let us enter into a true and indifferent Consideration how far forth the Case in question may touch his Authority, and how far forth our Liberty. And to speak clearly, in my opinion, it concerns his Authority much, and our Liberty nothing at all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Expression concerning <hi>tenderness</hi> for the <hi>Regal</hi> Rights was very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> when his <hi>late</hi> Majesty in his <hi>Letter</hi> to them from <hi>Bredagh, April</hi> 14. 1660, thus made use of it, <hi>viz. We have not the least doubt but you will be as TENDER in and jealous of any thing that may infringe our Honour and Authority, as of your own Liberty and Property, which is best preserv'd by preserving the other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Remember therefore that your <hi>tenderness</hi> for <hi>Property</hi> is best preserv'd by your <hi>tenderness</hi> for the Regal Authority: and if you would have your <hi>thoughts</hi> adorn'd by a constant <hi>Idea</hi> of true <hi>English</hi> Loyalty like a noble <hi>Picture</hi> retain'd there, let me direct you to a Saying, which like an <hi>Original</hi> drawn by a great Master, may be fit for you to <hi>Copy</hi> after, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Saying</hi> of the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi> in a <hi>Speech</hi> in the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Lords,</hi> viz. <hi>Some would have the King's Prerogative rather tall then great; others</hi> è contra. <hi>But none can be truly loyal, but he that is a good Patriot, and none can be a good Patriot, but he that is truly loyal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor need it be further insinuated to you, that without your keeping up a <hi>tenderness</hi> for the <hi>Regal</hi> Rights, you cannot maintain your tenderness for <hi>Oaths.</hi> And here I must take occasion to tell you that one of my <hi>aims</hi> in entertaining you with the <hi>Queries</hi> relating to <hi>Oaths</hi> out of that <hi>Book,</hi> was to lay before your thoughts a <hi>tenderness</hi> as to <hi>Oaths</hi> in general, both in <hi>keeping</hi> the lawful ones you have taken, and in not <hi>imposing</hi> unlawful, doubtful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, or <hi>inexpedient</hi> ones on others; and on such as our <hi>Prince</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the several Constitutions of their minds both as to firmness and infirmness, hath thought fit to exempt from taking such <hi>strong Physick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover if you will think that another of my <hi>aims</hi> was to mind you that the same <hi>Queries</hi> might have been as ingeniously and ingenuously put in the <hi>year</hi> 1673. before the passing of the <hi>Test-Act,</hi> as they were in debating the <hi>Test-Bill</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1675, I shall allow you so to do.</p>
                  <p>You may too (if you will) here <hi>occasionally</hi> consider how soon <hi>God</hi> in the course of his Providence doth sometimes turn the Tables, and make such who were lately so active in imposing on others <hi>Oaths</hi> that seem'd doubtful and oppressive to them, to be in danger of suffering by the like Impositions. Mr. <hi>Burrough</hi>'s a Pious Independent <hi>Divine</hi> (who lived in the late times) referring in his <hi>Irenicum</hi> to the Impositions and Persecution de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd by the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> against those of his Perswasion, saith there, <hi>but</hi>

                     <hi>the Tables may turn one day, wherein the Sufferers shall have the greatest Ease, and the Inflicters the sorest Burthen. But God forbid that their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should lay it upon them, tho it were put into their Power to do it.</hi> And you may take notice that the <hi>Book</hi> we before spoke of, owns the Activity of the <hi>Roman-Catholick Lords</hi> then in hindering that <hi>Test</hi>'s being brought on <hi>Protestants:</hi> the Consideration whereof may (I think) justly incline all, who account it their Happiness to have been freed from that design'd <hi>Oath,</hi> not to grudge at the favour that hath been extended by the <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>So tender was the Government in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> about the not making the <hi>Consciences</hi> of the People uneasie by <hi>Oaths,</hi> that you will find it in the <hi>Reformation of the Ecclesiastical Laws</hi> begun in <hi>Harry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi>'s Reign, and carry'd on in his, that the <hi>Magna nomina</hi> who were employ'd to make a New Body of <hi>Laws,</hi> did in Compassion to the Consciences of those who took the usual <hi>Promissory</hi> Oaths for the observance of the <hi>Statutes</hi> of <hi>Universities,</hi> Collegiate Churches, and such like Societies and Corporations, order this <hi>Clause</hi> to be added to the <hi>Oaths,</hi> viz. <hi>Haec omnibus partibus servabo, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>
                     <hi>The School-men</hi> (saith one) <hi>would be thought most tender and most curious in the point of Oaths. They mince them out so fine, that a whol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Notwithstanding what I told you out of my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> that an <hi>Oath can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ministred to any unless the same be allow'd by the Common Law, or by some Act of Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither can any Oath allow'd by the Common Law or by Act of Parliament, be alter'd, but by Act of Parliament;</hi> yet as you know that the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> in the 30th <hi>year</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> desiring <hi>that no Oath or Subscription might be tendred to any at their entrance into the Ministry, but such as is expresly prescribed by the Statutes of this Realm, except the Oath against Corrupt entring,</hi> did thereby however <hi>approve</hi> of the tendring of that Oath, so my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> likewise, <hi>Inst.</hi> 3. c. 71. viz. <hi>Of Simony</hi> seems to <hi>approve</hi> of that <hi>Oath,</hi> in saying that <hi>Simony is the more odious, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is accompany'd with Perjury, for the Presentee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is Sworn to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Simony, referring there to</hi> Lynwood, and had before in that <hi>Chapter</hi> referr'd to <hi>Canon</hi> 40. 1 <hi>Iacobi</hi> 1603. <hi>The Oath against Simony.</hi>

                  <p>Your having (as it were) <hi>diverted</hi> me by the thought of that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition</hi> of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> brings to my mind the pleasant Entertainment you once gave me by lending me a <hi>Book</hi> writ long ago, call'd <hi>A brief Treatise of Oaths exacted by Ordinaries and Ecclesiastical Iudges to answer generally to all such Articles or Interrogarories as pleaseth them to propound: and of their forced and Constrained Oaths</hi> ex officio, <hi>wherein is proved that the same are unlawful.</hi> And I remember much of the matter in that Author being dull, I came to somewhat at last recited by him, that had in it some <hi>Sales,</hi> or what I may call some drops of <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and which were but necessary to give a grateful <hi>acidity</hi> to his <hi>Apozeme,</hi> when he toward the end of that <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Oaths,</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 56. and 57. thus brings in a <hi>RATIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NALE</hi> of the <hi>Ceremonious</hi> manner of giving an Oath, and of the Manufa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of it as some men do <hi>fidem facere</hi> by it, <hi>viz. For in this matter of an Oath they have devised according to their toying fantasie a certain foolish figurative Ceremony in the ministring thereof. For the Deponent for sooth must lay his three middle Fingers stretch'd outright upon the Book in significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Trinity and Catholick Faith, and his Thumb and little Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he must put downward under the Book, in token of Damnation both of Body and Soul, if he say not the truth. The Thumb belike as the greater, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the heavy mass of the Body: and the little Finger the light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corpo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>eal substance of the Soul. How superstitious also they were concerning this Ceremony of the Book (little regarding the true use and end of an Oath) as appears by the Allegorical Exposition curiously set forth by one of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonate and Counterfeit Prelates, who saith that the Circumstances in the Act of an Oath are very great and weighty, inasmuch as he that Sweareth by a Book doth three things: First as tho he should say, Let that which is written in the Book never do me good, neither the new nor the old Law if I lye in this mine Oath. Secondly, he puts his Hand on the Book, as tho he should say, Nor the good work which I have done profit me ought before the face of Christ, except I say the truth which is founded in Christ. Thirdly, he kisseth the Book, as tho he should say, Let never the Prayers and Petitions which by my mouth I have utter'd, avail me any thing to my Soul's health, if I say not truly in this mine Oath. Yet you must take this as meant only by this Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Father where Lay men, or the baser sort of the Clergy take an Oath. For that blessed</hi> Bonner <hi>not long since hath taught us this trick of his Law, that a Bishop may Swear (such is his Privilege</hi>) inspectis Evangeliis &amp; non tactis; <hi>bare sight of the Book without touch or kiss, will well enough serve his Lordship's turn.</hi>

                  <p>Well Sir, throwing out of our thoughts the <hi>minutioe</hi> of all formal tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> let us not at the same time try to make men <hi>laugh</hi> and weep by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing Oaths on them. And let the Consideration of this, namely that the <hi>Noble</hi> Morals enjoyn'd by the <hi>Christian</hi> Doctrine have not prevailed all this while to secure <hi>Christians</hi> against one another without the <hi>Garranty</hi> of Oaths, or by the <hi>Christianus sum</hi> not being still judged <hi>oequi-ponderous</hi> with an Oath, impress a solemn grief on our Minds. And considering that both the <hi>Verbum Regium,</hi> and the <hi>verbum Sacerdotis</hi> have been so much allow'd <hi>equal</hi> to <hi>Oaths,</hi> and that all <hi>Christians</hi> ought to <hi>value</hi> themselves on being <hi>A Royal Priesthood,</hi> and on their great <hi>Chief</hi> having <hi>made them Kings and Priests to God and his Father,</hi> let us bemoan the present State of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and <hi>Christians,</hi> having (as it were) <hi>Decreed</hi> it that they cannot take one anothers words. And let the thought likewise of the <hi>insufficiency</hi> of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34919:60"/>
the <hi>Security</hi> of Oaths themselves to keep up <hi>Governments,</hi> work in us such a serious Mortification and Profound sense of the <hi>degeneracy</hi> of Mankind, and such an inclination to place our chief Confidence in somewhat above the words, or Oaths of men, as becomes us.</p>
                  <p>But I shall give you an <hi>instance</hi> of this at <hi>home</hi> too pregnant with hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Our thoughts have had a long melancholy <hi>walk</hi> in the <hi>Peristyllium</hi> of the many <hi>Interpretations</hi> that supported our Great <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and as to which Oath it being probable that a <hi>vulgar</hi> Error having prevailed among many of the <hi>Faction</hi> for some time before the <hi>year</hi> 1640. namely <hi>that the Oath of Supremacy was intended to bind only in opposition to Popery,</hi> occasion was thereby given to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> to procure the last <hi>Authentick</hi> Interpretation of the <hi>Assertory</hi> part of the <hi>Oath</hi> in the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> of 1640. and cautioning us there in the first <hi>Canon</hi> against any <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Coactive Power whether <hi>Papal or Popular.</hi>
                     </hi> But after our view of the orderly and necessary placing of all these polish'd and strong <hi>Pillars</hi> of <hi>Interpretation</hi> erected between the time of <hi>Primo Elizabethoe</hi> and the <hi>year</hi> 1640, and after Providence so ordering it at last, that the <hi>Consciences</hi> of the <hi>Loyal</hi> who were then reserv'd as <hi>Lyons</hi> to guard the <hi>Throne,</hi> had then a clear <hi>Oath</hi> to guard their Loyalty, and after their having then cause to say <hi>Tantoe molis erat</hi> to render the Oath both acceptable to Conscience and adequate to its first reasonable intention, the Land was punish'd with a dreadful <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and the <hi>sacred</hi> Obligations of the <hi>Oath</hi> and all its <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations</hi> could no more quench the raging Flames of the <hi>Civil</hi> War then the sprinkling of a little Holy Water could save a Town on fire.</p>
                  <p>You may therefore here again more particularly take it into your thoughts, that there is somewhat beside or beyond <hi>Oaths</hi> necessary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline Heaven to Preserve States and Kingdoms and Ecclesiastical Polities therein, namely the trusting in God, and offering to him what the 51. <hi>Psalm</hi> calls <hi>the Sacrifices of God;</hi> and without which the thought of the <hi>tantoe molis</hi> and the endeavour'd piling <hi>Interpretation</hi> upon <hi>Interpretation,</hi> or Oath upon Oath as high as Heaven, and thereby designing to keep men together embody'd and united in the external Profession of any State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Religion, will prove as insignificant as did the old <hi>Politicks</hi> I shall refer you to in the <hi>Sacred</hi> Story, and when <hi>the whole Earth was of one Language, and of one Speech,</hi> and the <hi>Vogue</hi> was, <hi>Let us build a City and Tower whose top may reach to Heaven, and let us make us a Name, least we be scatter'd abroad on the face of the whole Earth.</hi> But Heaven confounded their <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> and their City was call'd <hi>Babel,</hi> and their feared Dissipation was their Punishment. They were so diffident of the Divine Promise whose <hi>garranty</hi> they had, that they were resolv'd by their own hands to provide against all Dangers of a future <hi>Deluge,</hi> and having built their <hi>Tower</hi> with <hi>Brick,</hi> they thought 'twould defend them from the Power of <hi>Fire,</hi> concerning which they had heard the <hi>Tradition</hi> that a general Destruction of the World should proceed from the fury of that <hi>Element;</hi> and they vainly endeavour'd to secure themselves against the anger of Heaven rather by a lofty Pile, then by lowly Minds.</p>

                  <p>That wretched <hi>vulgar</hi> Error you referr'd to, did shew that the <hi>line</hi> of <hi>Confusion</hi> was <hi>stretch'd</hi> forth on Men's understandings as well as on the Realm in that <hi>Conjuncture:</hi> and I have observ'd that that vulgar <hi>Error</hi> did last to the very time of the <hi>ferment</hi> about the <hi>Exclusion,</hi> and long before which time as well as then some have talk'd and writ at this rate, <hi>viz. That the Oath of Supremacy was expresly made (as the title of it shews) to shut out the Usurpation of foreign Powers and Potentates, and was</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:34919:61"/>
                     <hi>not meant to provide against any popular Usurpations or Diminutions of the King's Supreme Authority.</hi>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>O God! But to <hi>speak</hi> or <hi>write</hi> at that rate to <hi>Conscience,</hi> is <hi>Chicanerie.</hi> And I have elsewhere mention'd what one whom I cannot too often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be as <hi>fair</hi> a <hi>dealer</hi> with <hi>Conscience</hi> as any the <hi>Age</hi> hath had, told us in his <hi>sixth Lecture</hi> of <hi>Oaths,</hi> about the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> binding in this Case. You know I mean Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> who there shews, that <hi>tho Popes Usurpations or arrogating to themselves the Supreme Iurisdiction in</hi> spiritualibus <hi>throughout this Kingdom, was the Cause of the Oath of Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet the Oath is obligatory according to the express words in the Utmost Latitude: the reason is, that the intention of a Law is general to provide against all future inconveniences of the like kind, or nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover the words in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s <hi>Admonition</hi> referring to <hi>the Persons call'd to Ecclesiastical Ministry in the Church,</hi> as the doubters, and the tenour of all the subsequent <hi>Interpretations</hi> as speaking them <hi>principally</hi> occasion'd by the doubters in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> do further shew the Vanity of that Objection.</p>
                  <p>And if you will more particularly think of the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Authentick <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> of that <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>approved</hi> in <hi>Parliament,</hi> you will find the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> to be an <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and that it may be so-likewise <hi>properly</hi> termed. For in the beginning of the <hi>Admonition</hi> you will <hi>thus</hi> find it, <hi>viz. <hi>The Queen's Majesty being inform'd that in certain places of this Realm, sundry of her native Subjects being call'd to Ministry in the Church, be by sinister Perswasion and perverse Construction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to find some scruple in the form of an Oath, which by an Act of the last Parliament is prescribed to be required of divers Persons for the recognition of their ALLEGIANCE to her Majesty,</hi>
                     </hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>As one may perceive by what the Queen's <hi>Interpretation</hi> in the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition</hi> refers to, that there was a great <hi>ferment</hi> in the Kingdom about the <hi>sense</hi> of the <hi>Oath,</hi> so suitably to what you mention'd of the <hi>Prudence</hi> of our <hi>Ancestors</hi> that caus'd various <hi>ferments</hi> to <hi>go off</hi> so <hi>insensibly,</hi> the next <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> in <hi>approving</hi> her <hi>Interpretation</hi> without troubling themselves to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion the <hi>Authentickness</hi> of it, doth corroborate your observation of the Excellence of the <hi>English</hi> understandings.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>It doth so. The <hi>fermentation</hi> in the minds of the People you speak of had been <hi>Epidemical.</hi> And tho one might fancy by the <hi>Proem</hi> of the <hi>Admonition</hi> that the <hi>Interpretation</hi> as well as the <hi>Dispensing</hi> with Disability had an eye but on an inconsiderable number of People there referr'd to in the foremention'd words of <hi>sundry of her Majesty's Native Subjects in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places of this Realm,</hi> &amp;c. yet any one who knoweth the <hi>History</hi> of those times will find the <hi>Interpretation</hi> and <hi>Dispensation</hi> (as I may say) <hi>Calculated</hi> for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of all <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Interpretation</hi> having an eye on all <hi>Christendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was then in the <hi>Morning</hi> of that <hi>Queen</hi>'s Reign, and of the restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Reform'd Religion, such a thick <hi>mist</hi> of causeless <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Iealousies</hi> that had generally o'erspread the minds of <hi>Protestants</hi> and <hi>Papists</hi> shortly after the Birth of the Statute of 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                     <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. that nothing but the <hi>Supremacy</hi> both of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> that shone in her authentick <hi>Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of that <hi>Statute</hi> could disperse, and that too not suddenly. For as Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> in his Book of <hi>Two Acts of Parliament,</hi> or <hi>Observations on that Oath,</hi> tells us, <hi>It is mention'd in the Admonition that the Queen's Ecclesiastical Power is the same that was challenged and used, by</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8th, <hi>&amp;c. which is supposed by some to be the same that was in the Pope, the Person only and</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:34919:61"/>
                     <hi>not the Power changed: so that our Princes are but secular Popes. This Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction was strengthen'd by the subtlety of</hi> Gardiner <hi>abroad: and at home by a Sermon Preach'd at</hi> Paul's Cross <hi>in the year</hi> 1588. <hi>by Dr.</hi> Bancroft, <hi>who calls Q.</hi> Eliz. <hi>a Petty Pope, and tells us her Ecclesiastical Authority is the same which the Pope's was formerly:</hi> and in the Margin opposite to what he had said of the subtlety of <hi>Gardiner, strengthening the Objection abroad,</hi> hath these words, viz. <hi>Whom</hi> Calvin <hi>terms Imposterille.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Nye</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward goes on to shew how the 37th <hi>Article</hi> did remove the Objection suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>The true Grounds of Ecclesiastical Regiment,</hi> Printed in <hi>London,</hi> A. 1641. doth in <hi>p.</hi> 53. mention some mens objecting it against the Ecclesiastical <hi>Supremacy</hi> of our Monarchs, <hi>that it may descend to Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Age, as it did to King</hi> Edward <hi>the 6th, or to Women as to Queen</hi> Mary <hi>and Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and that whatsoever we may allow to men, such as</hi> Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>the 8th; yet it seems unreasonable to allow it Women and Children. The Papists think this Objection of great moment, and therefore</hi> Bellarmine <hi>in great disdain casts it out, that in</hi> England <hi>they had a certain Woman for their Bishop; meaning Queen</hi> Elizabeth: <hi>and she knowing what an odium that word would draw on her both among Papists and many Protestants also, Consults her Bishops about it, and by their advice sets forth a Declaration, certifying the World thereby, that she claim'd no other Headship in the Church, but such as might exclude all dependency on foreign Headships, and secure her from all danger of being deposed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Bishops in this did as warily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for their own Claim as the Queen's.</hi> And the Roman-Catholick <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Advocate for Conscience Liberty,</hi> discoursing of the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 181. <hi>&amp; seq.</hi> saith, <hi>That</hi> Luther, Calvin, Knox, Gilby <hi>disliked it:</hi> and mentions <hi>that a Iurisdiction purely spiritual was communicated to</hi> H. <hi>the 8th by his Supremacy, and assumed by him, and that he wanted his Spiritual By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title of Supremacy to justifie his Divorce, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>d his taking the Church Revenue into his hands: and that the Protectorship in</hi> E <hi>the 6th's time by virtue of the Oath of Supremacy continued to make new Church-Laws, Institutions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and that Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>reassumed this Iurisdiction, having a greater neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity for it then her Brother, because her Marriage was declared null by the Pope.</hi> So then the state of <hi>Protestancy</hi> abroad and at home call'd on the <hi>Queen</hi> to <hi>distribute</hi> or <hi>dispense</hi> her <hi>Supreme</hi> Power in her <hi>Law</hi> by her <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> making a <hi>change</hi> not <hi>of</hi> it, but <hi>in</hi> the body of it: and which had it been <hi>changed</hi> by a <hi>repeal</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> for another, would have seem'd to blemish her figure of <hi>semper Eadem,</hi> and have reflected on the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings and Consciences of those who had before took the Oath.</p>
                  <p>There was then in that Conjuncture an universal <hi>outcry</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> that <hi>Sin lies at the door,</hi> a thing worse then <hi>Hannibal ad Portas;</hi> a burthen that hath caus'd all the <hi>Groans of the Creation</hi> that ever happen'd. And where there is <hi>Periculum animae</hi> there is always <hi>Periculum in morâ,</hi> and which the Queen's authentick <hi>Interpretation</hi> did remove, and which was <hi>approved</hi> by the next Parliament: and no <hi>noise</hi> made or <hi>complaining</hi> heard <hi>in our streets</hi> about any seeming <hi>Alteration</hi> made in the <hi>Law</hi> or <hi>Oath</hi> it self, by the Prerogative of interpretation or acquittal from the disabling Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then exercised. And it is but congruous to <hi>humane</hi> Nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Policy in men when they see any thing not ill in it self done that hath eminently conduced to make the World <hi>easie,</hi> not to <hi>embarass</hi> such thing with litigious scruples about the <hi>fieri non debuit,</hi> nor to adventure to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the World again when it is inclined to and resolv'd upon its rest. Some thoughts of this Nature probably inclined my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> to shew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaisance he did, not only to King <hi>Iames</hi> his <hi>incapacitating</hi> Canon about
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34919:62"/>
the <hi>double</hi> Subscription, but as to the <hi>Oath</hi> against <hi>Simony</hi> &amp; that of <hi>Canonical</hi> obedience, and which inclined Judge <hi>Croke</hi> to be pleas'd with the <hi>Canons</hi> of 1640. tho containing the <hi>Oath</hi> with an <hi>Et caetera,</hi> and which made the <hi>Iudges</hi> so apt to over-rule some of Sir <hi>E. Coke</hi>'s Exceptions to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Oath, as I have mention'd.</p>
                  <p>You may indeed find that some among the <hi>Puritans</hi> in some Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, did presume to reproach the Government of the <hi>Church</hi> with her having <hi>dispens'd</hi> with the <hi>disability</hi> of some Persons incurr'd by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament.</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>famous</hi> Book publish'd in her Reign, call'd, <hi>An Abstract of certain Acts of Parliament,</hi> hath in the <hi>Conclusion</hi> these two factious <hi>Queries,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether a mere Lay-man, no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the Civil Law, may be a Bishop's Chancellor, and so may Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? Whether a mere Lay-man no Doctor of the Civil Law, may be a Bishop's Register, contrary to an Act of Parliament?</hi> The <hi>Author</hi> intendeth there to referr to the <hi>Statute</hi> of 37<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 17. and as he had before expresly done in <hi>p.</hi> 196. <hi>&amp; Seq.</hi> and of which <hi>Statute</hi> we have so much discours'd; and he in <hi>p.</hi> 201. instanceth in <hi>many Lay-men who were not Doctors of the Civil Law, and yet then exercised Ecclesiastical Iurisdiction.</hi> He had too in <hi>p.</hi> 196. took notice that as that <hi>Statute establish'd and confirm'd to the King and his Successors, and so unto our most Gracious Soveraign the Queen's Majesty that now is, lawful Preheminence, Power, Superiority and Lordship over all Persons within her Dominions of what state or Condition soever, touching Punishments for any Heresies, Errors, Vices, Schisms, Abuses, Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, Hypocrisies and Superstitions springing or growing by means of any her disobedient and disloyal Subjects; so hath her Majesty by her Injunctions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd, that her Highness did never pretend any Title or challenge any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to punish any of her Subjects for any of the said Offences by Censure Ecclesiastical in right belonging to her Royal Person; but that her Highness meaning and intent is and always hath been to commit the execution thereof always to the Ecclesiastical State of her time:</hi> and he then sets down her <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation</hi> in the <hi>Admonition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But had that <hi>Author</hi> consider'd how it was <hi>declared</hi> by that <hi>Statute,</hi> that <hi>by Holy Scripture all Authority and Power is given to His Majesty, and all such Persons as His Majesty shall appoint to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all manner of Causes Ecclesiastical, and to correct Uice and Sin whatsoever;</hi> and that this <hi>Statute</hi> was <hi>revived</hi> by the <hi>1st</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> he would not have wonder'd at the <hi>Queen's</hi> allowing that <hi>Statute</hi> to be <hi>dispens'd</hi> with as it was. Nor would any one therefore wonder at the Royal Martyr in the 12th and 13th <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>A.</hi> 1640. <hi>Condescending</hi> to humour the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the <hi>Puritans</hi> by an equal <hi>Interpretation</hi> of that <hi>Statute</hi> of 37<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> in his first <hi>Argument</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> concerning the <hi>Canons</hi> thus reflects on the <hi>Clergy</hi> for those <hi>two</hi> Canons, <hi>viz.

                     <hi>Coke,</hi> Inst. 4. c. 74. writing of the <hi>High Commission</hi> in Causes <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> saith, <hi>There is no question but the Commissioners for such Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses as are committed to them by force of this Act, may, if the Commissioners be Competent, proceed to deprivation of the Popish Clergy which was the main object of the Act, or to punish them by Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question if the Commissioners be COMPETENT, that is, if they be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men, they may proceed to Sentence of Excommunication, which may right well be Certify'd as well as Excommunication before Commissioners Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates: both of these Authorities being under the Great Seal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication certify'd ly Commissioners Del gates hath been allowed as it appeareth in</hi> 23.

                  </p>
                  <p>And yet you see my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> shews you how the <hi>Government</hi> then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiesced in such <hi>Nomination;</hi> and <hi>assisted</hi> the <hi>execution</hi> of the <hi>Sentences</hi> given by such as he thought <hi>incompetent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor are we therefore to wonder at what Mr. <hi>Bagshaw</hi> mentions of <hi>the Civilians in the House of Commons not objecting that the King had done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to an Act of Parliament in taking from Bishops, Chancellors and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials the Power of exercising Church Censures given them by the Act:</hi> and which by the Power <hi>declared</hi> in that <hi>Act</hi> to be given him by <hi>Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> he might have either continued to them, or abridged or taken away the exercise thereof from them, if he had pleas'd. And considering that the <hi>Lex Scandali</hi> doth equally <hi>oblige</hi> Kings as well as Subjects in <hi>Point</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> it is not to be wonder'd that that <hi>Tender-conscienced</hi> King did in that Conjuncture think himself obliged so equitably to make his <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation</hi> of that <hi>Statute</hi> as in complaisance with some of his Subjects who had <hi>took</hi> offence at <hi>Lay-Chancellors</hi> Power of Excommunicating, to disable them to it.</p>
                  <p>I told you before how that Pious Prince did in complaisance with the <hi>Fathers</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> think himself obliged to exercise his <hi>Regal</hi> Power of interpreting or <hi>declaring,</hi> and when in <hi>A.</hi> 1637. he issued out his <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation Declaring that the Bishops holding their Courts and issuing Process in their own Names were not against the Laws of the Realm,</hi> and that the <hi>Iudges</hi> resolutions were notify'd therein to that purpose, and that the <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:34919:63"/>
about that Point was setled, and the Bishops <hi>issuing</hi> out their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses,</hi> was setled too; the which <hi>Proclamation</hi> too you will find Mr. <hi>Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaw</hi> mentions in his <hi>second Argument,</hi> where <hi>p.</hi> 40. he tells you of <hi>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's having procured a Proclamation,</hi> A. 1637. <hi>declaring the Opinions of the Iudges, that the Statute of</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Edw. 6. c. 2. <hi>is repeal'd and of no force at this day,</hi> and <hi>that Bishops may keep Courts in their own Names.</hi> And I shall now tell you, that as in the <hi>year</hi> 1637. the <hi>Bishops</hi> were in so <hi>full</hi> and <hi>peaceable</hi> possession of their Privilege of <hi>issuing</hi> out of their <hi>Processes</hi> in their <hi>own</hi> names, by means of what His <hi>Majesty</hi> had <hi>declared</hi> pursuant to the <hi>Resolutions</hi> unanimously given by all the <hi>Iudges</hi> and the <hi>Barons</hi> of the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer</hi> (and of which Sir <hi>E.

                  <p>That is a thing I would gladly hear of; for one would think that the exercise of the Regal Power of <hi>Declaring</hi> or <hi>Interpreting</hi> what relates to an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> might occasionally heighten a <hi>ferment</hi> in stead of abating it.</p>

                  <p>You will find little or no cause if you consult our ancient <hi>English</hi> Story (and there see how the mutual <hi>Confidence</hi> between King and People hath in several Ages supported the Government) to fancy that <hi>Declaratory</hi> Proclamations relating to <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> did make any ferment. The <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the <hi>Statutes</hi> hath in all <hi>Causes</hi> between Party and Party, and wherein <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> are concern'd, been by ancient usage under our Kings still left to the <hi>Iudges:</hi> and the <hi>Proclamations</hi> of our Princes on great <hi>emergent</hi> occasions in the State <hi>declaring</hi> or <hi>interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> their Laws pursuant to the <hi>Supreme</hi> Power committed to them by God for the good of their People, hath still been observ'd to tend both to the good of the <hi>People</hi> and the <hi>Laws</hi> too. If you will look on all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claratory <hi>Proclamations</hi> in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames,</hi> of which you have a <hi>Collection,</hi> you will (I believe) find none but what were acceptable among all their Loyal Subjects.</p>
                  <p>But as to this Declaratory <hi>Proclamation</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd, you will find it (as I told you) <hi>approved</hi> in Parliament. And if you will please to consult in your <hi>Statute-Book</hi> the <hi>Act</hi> of 13<hi rend="sup">o</hi>

                     <hi>Car.</hi> 2. hath in it three <hi>Proviso's.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is concerning the <hi>High Commission-Court:</hi> the <hi>second <hi>Proviso</hi>
                     </hi> is concerning the taking away the Oath <hi>ex officio.</hi> And the <hi>third <hi>Proviso</hi>
                     </hi> is, to limit and confine the Power of Ecclesiastical Judges in all their Proceedings to <hi>what WAS and by Law might be used before the <hi>year</hi>
                     </hi> 1639, which plainly includes, allows and <hi>approves</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi>'s <hi>Proclamation</hi> in the <hi>year</hi> 1637.</p>
                  <p>In the time of a former disloyal long Parliament, the <hi>Regal</hi> Power of <hi>Interpreting</hi> or <hi>declaring</hi> was by them represented as a <hi>Gravamen,</hi> and while yet they <hi>usurp'd</hi> that Power themselves. If you will look on the <hi>Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lords and Commons, in</hi> Husband's <hi>Collections,</hi> p. 686. you will there find they say, <hi>It is high time for the whole Kingdom now to understand that His Majesty's Authority is more in his Courts without his Person then in his Person without his Courts, when the Power of DECLARING Law shall be deny'd to the whole Court of Parliament in particular Causes before them,</hi>

                  <p>But the <hi>Bishop</hi> in his before-mention'd Third <hi>Book</hi> and 6th <hi>Chapter,</hi> viz. <hi>Of the Interpretation, Diminution and Abrogation of Humane Laws,</hi> brings in but <hi>seven</hi> ways of the <hi>changing</hi> of <hi>humane</hi> Laws, so that the <hi>Obligation</hi> of <hi>Conscience</hi> is also <hi>changed;</hi> whereof his <hi>first</hi> is by <hi>Equity.</hi> His <hi>second</hi> is by <hi>Interpretation.</hi> His <hi>third,</hi> by a <hi>Contrary, or a ceasing reason.</hi> And his <hi>fourth</hi> by <hi>Dispensation,</hi> &amp;c. and of which <hi>latter</hi> he saith, <hi>If we use the word improperly, Dispensation can signifie a Declaration made by the Superior that the Subject in certain Cases is not obliged, that the Law-giver did not intend it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but when Dispensation signifies Properly, it means an Act of mere Grace and Favour proceeding from an extrinsick Cause; that is, not the Nature of the thing, or the merit of the Cause, but either the merit of the Person, or some degrees of reasonableness in the thing, which not being of it self enough to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the favour of the Law, is of it self enough to make a man capable of the Favour of the Prince,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But as here in this <hi>nice</hi> distinction, he is enforced to make him who doth <hi>dispensare</hi> to do that which the <hi>Canonists</hi> make the <hi>ratio nominis</hi> of it, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>diversa pensare,</hi> and in the Scales of <hi>Equity</hi> to <hi>weigh</hi> and <hi>interpret</hi> the degrees of the reasonableness of the thing, so in his handling of the <hi>Prince</hi>'s Power of <hi>interpreting,</hi> he makes <hi>Equity</hi> Co-incident with it, and refers to the Law in the Code, viz. <hi>Inter aequitatem jus<expan>

When a Law determines that under such an Age a Person shall be UNCAPABLE of being the General of an Army, the Supreme Power can declare the meaning of the Law to be, unless a great excellency of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and maturity of Iudgment supply the want of years: in which very Case,</hi> Scipio Africanus <hi>said wisely, when he desir'd to be employ'd in the</hi> Punick

                  <p>I shall sometime at our meeting again observe to you what the <hi>Bishop</hi> hath there asserted, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 3. that <hi>Kings have a Legislative Power in the Affairs of Religion and the Church,</hi> and where he saith, <hi>that the LEAST part of this Power is to permit the free exercise of it, and to remove all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, and to give it Advantages of free Assemblies, and Competent maintenance, and Publick Encouragements,</hi> &amp;c. And shall then shew you what Power <hi>Circa Sacra</hi> the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> with great Prudence and Justice allow'd our <hi>Princes</hi> in the introducing the <hi>Reformation,</hi> (and which its Constitutions and <hi>Canons</hi> have since owned) and from the <hi>allowance</hi> of which <hi>Power,</hi> our great Church-men then knew there could be <hi>vestigia nulla retrorsum</hi> in the Case of a <hi>Prince</hi> of any other Religion coming to the Crown.</p>
                  <p>But I shall at present tell you that as to what I have mention'd to you out of <hi>Suarez</hi> and that <hi>Bishop,</hi> altho you need neither now nor at any time to charge your memory with the subtlety of Distinctions, and of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priè</hi> and <hi>minus Propriè</hi> when you are in eager pursuit of the substance of things; you will find in both those Authors what is very substantial about the Doctrine of Dispensing: and what I have cited of their rendring <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing</hi> and <hi>Interpreting</hi> thus Co-incident is <hi>à propos,</hi> and may mind you of Princes being both empow'red and obliged in Justice in their administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>executive</hi> Power of their Laws to <hi>declare</hi> or <hi>interpret</hi> their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gionary <hi>Penal</hi> Laws as dispensable in relation to particular times and Persons. And you may therefore here call to mind that passage in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> viz. <hi>That on Fryar</hi> Adrian'<hi>s</hi> vociferating there about the Pope's <hi>dispensing</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:34919:65"/>
being an Arbitrary favour, <hi>Verdune</hi> the famous <hi>French</hi> Divine took him down with saying, <hi>that it is a fond Perswasion that Dispensing is a mere favour: for it is as good distribute Iustice as what is most so. And the Priest sins if he giveth it not; for it is nothing else but a right Interpretation of Law.</hi> You may very well suppose that thoughts arising from those words in the <hi>Ordination</hi> of <hi>Bishops,</hi> viz. <hi>That you have your Authority not to destroy, but to save: not to hurt, but to help,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be so merciful, as not to be remiss: so to administer Discipline, as not to forget Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. have formerly inclined our <hi>Bishops</hi> in the Reigns of King <hi>Iames</hi> and King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> to think themselves obliged to interpret and declare the Laws about Church disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline as dispensable, and to <hi>dispense</hi> with them in the <hi>Cases</hi> of Mr. <hi>Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham</hi> and Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> as I told you at our last meeting.

                     <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. c. 12. in the beginning of which 'tis said, <hi>Nothing being more Godly, more sure, more to be wish'd and desired between a Prince the Supreme Head and Ruler, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, whose Governor and Head he is, then on the Prince's part, great Clemency and Indulgency, and rather too much indulgency and remission of his Royal Power and just Punishment, then exact Severity and Iustice to be shew'd,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But as when we were near the end of our former Conference, you rightly observ'd that many perverse People would be <hi>crying out</hi> that <hi>any lawful Dispensing with the Laws establish'd,</hi> was <hi>Contradictio in adjecto,</hi> so I shall now observe to you that any who to the diminishing from a Prince's <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter</hi> of being <hi>just,</hi> presume to insinuate it that a <hi>Prince</hi>'s valuing himself on that <hi>Character,</hi> and yet shewing <hi>mercy</hi> to some in releasing them from the <hi>Bonds</hi> and <hi>Penalties</hi> of some of his Laws, is a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> do appear to me great objects of Compassion in so erring. And for this I shall refer you to the <hi>Happy future State of</hi> England, where in <hi>p.</hi> 233.

But when I come to entertain you with the learned <hi>Notions</hi> about it out of some of our <hi>Church of</hi> England-<hi>Writers,</hi> I believe you will not in the least <hi>startle</hi> at the thoughts of your Prince's <hi>dispensing</hi> with <hi>disability.</hi>

                  <p>One of those Writers writ of the Subject before <hi>Suarez,</hi> and whose Book I suppose that our Excellent Bishop <hi>Taylor</hi> happen'd not to have read, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I met with no references to it in his <hi>Ductor dubitantium,</hi> and where probably there had been many, had the <hi>Bishop</hi> read it. The <hi>Book</hi> speaks the <hi>Author</hi> to have been profoundly knowing in the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> Law, and not unacquainted with the <hi>Lex terrae,</hi> and one who (I think) made a great <hi>figure</hi> in the Administration of the <hi>Discipline</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and whose great <hi>talents</hi> might probably cause our great <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> then to engage him for their <hi>Champion</hi> against some of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Writers, who look'd with an <hi>evil</hi> eye on the Regal <hi>dispensing</hi> with disabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or <hi>incapacity</hi> in many of our Clergy-men. And as when of old some of the <hi>English-understandings</hi> were employ'd in the writing of <hi>School-Divinity,</hi> they penetrated as far into the Subtleties of it as those of any Nation, so I may tell you that (in my poor opinion) that <hi>Author</hi> hath writ of the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Dispensations</hi> both with all the <hi>subtlety</hi> and <hi>solidity</hi> requisite, and more substantially then <hi>Suarez.</hi> I shall lay the Book before you at our next meeting, but shall now tell you, that as to some Points we have been discoursing, he observes that <hi>There is a Dispensation call'd of Iustice, as it were, an Interpretation or Declaration of the true meaning of the Law</hi> juxta aequum &amp; bonum: <hi>and he cites the Canon Law to prove that Dispensation is a due, for that the Precept of Mercy is common to all.</hi> And I may tell you here, that if you will look on your <hi>Durand</hi>'s <hi>Speculum</hi> in his first <hi>Volume,</hi> where he writes so copiously of <hi>Dispensing,</hi> his <hi>style</hi> is, <hi>Dispensatio sive mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sericordia.</hi>

                  <p>Truly I do not suppose that any <hi>knowing</hi> man can have an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against it, and that this Learning <hi>non habet inimicum nisi ignorantem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that you may continue in your judgment of any <hi>ferment</hi> about the <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power being soon over, I can refer you to another <hi>Iudgment of Parliament,</hi> wherein a great tenderness for this branch of <hi>Prerogative</hi> is shewn, namely in the <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Octavo Elizabethae,</hi> c. 6. and to which that Excellent and Learned Person, and great Ornament of the Law, Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Atkins</hi> (as you will find it in <hi>Keble,</hi> Vol. 3.) referring in his <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in <hi>Chomas and Sortell's Case</hi> saith, 8. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 6. <hi>takes notice of Licence to dispense with such Laws as were</hi> pro bono publico; <hi>yet doth not forbid it, but rather compounds the matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been the luck of <hi>Dispensation</hi> to meet with an ill name from some of our famous <hi>Writers,</hi> who tell us that there were no such things as <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> or <hi>Non-obstante</hi> heard of till they came from <hi>Rome</hi> here in the <hi>year</hi> of our Lord 1240. <hi>and that afterward Kings learn'd from Popes to dispense with their Laws, whereas before they caus'd their Laws to be observ'd like those of the</hi> Medes <hi>and</hi> Persians; as the <hi>Irish Reports</hi> tell you in the <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendams,</hi> and whereupon Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> on the <hi>Fourth Part of the Institutes,</hi> c. 22. treating largely of <hi>Non-obstantes</hi> calls them <hi>Papal Engines.</hi> And our old <hi>Monkish</hi> Writers have been quoted for bestowing the terms of <hi>legum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera, infames nuncii,</hi> and <hi>repagalum,</hi> &amp;c. on <hi>Dispensations</hi> and <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obstantes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I shall at our meeting again shew you that the practice of <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> may easily be traced to the <hi>Imperial</hi> Laws: and this you may soon find, if you will look on Dr. <hi>Donne's Pseudo-Martyr</hi> that you have by you, and where you may guess at the age of <hi>Dispensations,</hi> by his referring you in <hi>p.</hi> 40. to the <hi>Divinae Indulgentiae,</hi> in the <hi>Digests,</hi> and his telling you out of the <hi>Code</hi> that <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian making a Law with a</hi> Non-obstante <hi>did praeclude all Dispensations which the Emperors themselves might grant, in these words,</hi> Si coeleste proferatur oraculum, aut divina pragmatica Sanctio.</p>
                  <p>And if you will look on <hi>Gothofred</hi>'s Notes on the <hi>L. Iubemus. C. De Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crosanctis Ecclefiis &amp; de rebus &amp; Privilegiis earum,</hi> cited by the Doctor there, you will thus find it in those <hi>Notes: Caeleste oraculum quid est? Principis dispensatio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is another thing I have not had time now to Discourse with you about, and that is of the <hi>Nature</hi> of Laws <hi>in terrorem,</hi> as I intended, and which suitably to the Wisdom of a Father in menacing a Child with cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off his Head if he doth this or that thing, are by the <hi>Pater Patriae</hi> and the Estates of the Realm sometimes lawfully made to <hi>intimidate</hi> men grown childish and vain, by Sanctions of Punishments not intended to be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to the general <hi>tenour</hi> of such <hi>Laws.</hi> But as what may make for my purpose of shewing you how worthy it is of the <hi>Majesty</hi> of <hi>Princes</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> in the <hi>beginning</hi> of his <hi>Proclamation</hi> having profess'd his <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> by Law <hi>Establish'd,</hi> and his <hi>constant Resolution for the maintenance and defence thereof,</hi> said, <hi>Of which our purpose and determination, beside all other our former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings (since our Entry into this Kingdom) we have given a new and certain Demonstration by such two Acts as have been passed in this Session of our Parliament, both tending to prevent the Dangers and diminish the number of those who adhering to the Profession of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>are blindly led (together with the Superstition of their Religion) both into some points of Doctrine which cannot consist with the Loyalty of Subjects toward their Prince, and oft-times into direct actions of Conspiracies and Conjurations against the State where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they live, as hath most notoriously appear'd by the late most horrible and almost incredible Conjuration,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>two Acts</hi> there referr'd to are those that you will find in your <hi>Statute-Book,</hi> Anno tertio Jacobi Regis, <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>An Act for the Discovering and repressing Popish Recusants</hi> (and in which the Oath of Allegiance is contain'd) and <hi>Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>An Act to prevent and avoid dangers by Popish Recusants,</hi> and whereby Popish Recusants Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict are <hi>disabled</hi> from bearing <hi>Office.</hi> But here you see how that wise Prince so soon after so horrid a real <hi>Plot</hi> did by <hi>distinguishing</hi> in his <hi>Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> between the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>some</hi> Roman-Catholicks and <hi>others</hi> as to Loyalty, and alluring the Loyal by the avow'd <hi>Dispensative</hi> Power of his <hi>Mercy,</hi> and hiding them under the <hi>wings</hi> of his <hi>Mercy</hi> from the <hi>terror</hi> of his Laws and affording to <hi>all his Subjects</hi> who should afterward <hi>behave</hi> themselves <hi>well,</hi> a <hi>Tabula post naufragium</hi> as to the <hi>expectance</hi> of making up their <hi>fortunes,</hi> think himself obliged then to cause <hi>his Moderation to be known to all men.</hi>

                  <p>The truth is you now put me in mind how I having long ago spent much time in considering the <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Traffick</hi> of our Country, and of other Parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and finding that shortly after His late <hi>Majesty's</hi> Restoration, one of his <hi>Ministers</hi> had in a Publick <hi>Speech</hi> intimated it to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that <hi>His Majesty had setled a Councel of Trade, consisting of some of the Lords of his Privy Councel, and of some Gentlemen of Quality and Experience, and of some Principal Merchants of the Principal Companies,</hi> I had the curiosity to look over their <hi>Iournals</hi> and their <hi>Advices,</hi> and <hi>Reports</hi> to the King, and there I found somewhat of the same <hi>notion</hi> with yours in one of their <hi>Reports</hi> to His Majesty. For there in one of their Papers of <hi>Advice</hi> addressed to the King, taking notice that what they conceived fit to be done for the <hi>advancement</hi> of the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Realm,</hi> was <hi>Prohibited</hi> by <hi>divers</hi> ancient <hi>Statutes,</hi> they make them <hi>imply</hi> that the thing might be done by the King's <hi>licence</hi> or <hi>dispensing,</hi> and whereupon they thus go on: <hi>And therefore finding this Dispensation to be your Majesty's Prerogative preserv'd entire to the Crown through so many of your Royal Progenitors, we have not thought fit to touch further upon this Matter, as being humbly confident that your Majesty's Subjects shall upon all occasions be indulged the like, if not more ready relief and accommodation for their Trade from your Majesty's Royal Grace and Bounty: only because the Observation was obvious, that perhaps all former Parliaments purposely left this door open to the People by the Grace of the King to be reliev'd with those dispensations, as foreseeing how difficult, if not impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or how inconvenient at least it might be altogether to restrain</hi> what those <hi>Statutes</hi> prohibited, <hi>we could not omit the same in this place,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>And you have put me in mind how a very Loyal and judicious <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman</hi> of that <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trade,</hi> (and whom I look on to be as deeply <hi>study'd</hi> in the business of Trade and Traffick as any one of the age) was pleas'd once to give me his opinion in Discourse, that a <hi>vast</hi> number of our <hi>Statutes</hi> made for the <hi>advancement</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi> did really <hi>depress</hi> it; and he then told me, that the making of one new <hi>Law</hi> against the giving <hi>Alms</hi> to <hi>Beggars</hi> in the High-way, would enrich the Nation almost more then all our <hi>old</hi> Statutes.</p>

Yet if one meet with such a one in so cold weather and so light apparel, that if he have no Clothes given him he shall die before he comes to any Town, if a man giveth him apparel, he offends not the Law.

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34919:69"/>
Case, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are dead Men, <hi>that a Person uncapable is as a dead Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> and whereby he giveth us a Magisterial <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> or a <hi>Petitio Principii</hi> instead of what might deserve the <hi>name</hi> of a <hi>Reason,</hi> or what might prove that the <hi>King</hi> could not <hi>dispense</hi> in the <hi>Case</hi> of one <hi>Politically</hi> dead, or one <hi>dead</hi> in <hi>Law.</hi> I have formerly told you of the <hi>Saying</hi> used by <hi>Magerus,</hi> and other <hi>Civil Law-writers,</hi> that <hi>Mors civilis naturali non aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratur nisi in casibus in jure expressis.</hi> And there are Cases enow express'd there, that shew how the Prince who is according to the style of <hi>Seneca,</hi> viz. <hi>Animus Reipublicae, illa Corpus suum,</hi> and <hi>ille spiritus vitalis quem haec tot millia trahunt,</hi> and who in the <hi>Scripture</hi> Phrase is <hi>the breath of our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strils,</hi> can according to the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Land</hi> as <hi>I</hi> told you in the <hi>Case</hi> of Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> animate a Person <hi>dead</hi> in <hi>Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And none need question why King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> cannot thus <hi>raise</hi> the <hi>dead</hi> as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did, and King <hi>Iames</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> or our following Princes, and I may say as well as any who went before him. <hi>Infames di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur civiliter mortui</hi> is a common Saying, but you see that <hi>Fas est cuivis Principi maculosas notas vitiatae opinionis abstergere</hi> is as common. Thus too <hi>Magerus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Banniti pro mortuis reputantur,</hi> and we know that the <hi>Excommunicate</hi> may in some respect by reason of their temporary <hi>disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> be termed so too.</p>
                  <p>And if you will look on the Book call'd <hi>Reformatio legum Ecclesiasticarum,</hi> under the title <hi>De excommunicatione,</hi> you will there in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Denunciation of the Excommunicate,</hi> find the <hi>Minister</hi> enjoin'd to <hi>tell</hi> the <hi>People that they must all abstain from the Excommunicate Person,</hi> tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam à Putri &amp; Projecto membro, <hi>&amp;c. that an Excommunicate Person is to be thrown out of the Church as a dead Carcass:</hi> but you will there find in the <hi>Formula reconciliationis excommunicatorum</hi> with what tenderness it is said <hi>reum hunc charissimum fratrem membrum assumamus &amp; agnoscamus Communis in Christo nostri corporis: &amp; intimus ut no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster affectus in hoc corporis nostri recuperato membro testatior sit,</hi> &amp;c. and that the Pastor in the Absolution of that returning <hi>Prodigal</hi> who was <hi>dead</hi> and is <hi>alive again,</hi> must in the administration of the <hi>King</hi>'s Ecclesiastical <hi>Laws,</hi> say <hi>tibi rursus pristinum in Ecclesiâ tuâ locum, &amp; plenum jus restitue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus too at the <hi>end</hi> of the <hi>Canons,</hi> A. 1571. you will find the same <hi>style</hi> of <hi>tenderness</hi> in <hi>Vogue</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time that was in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th's,</hi> as likewise of the powerfulness in <hi>raising</hi> the <hi>dead.</hi> You see there a Form of the <hi>Sentence</hi> of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> viz. <hi>Fratres quoniam quicunque profitemur nomen Christi sumus omnes membrum ejusdem corporis, &amp; par est ut unum membrum alterius membri sensu &amp; dolore afficiatur,</hi> &amp;c. And it being afterward mention'd, that <hi>the Person having been accused of such a Crime, and having been contumaciously absent,</hi> it followeth, <hi>the Bishop in God's Name and by his Authority hath Excommunicated such a one from the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Christ's Church,</hi> &amp; tanquam membrum emortuum amputasse à Christi corpore, &amp;c. <hi>that you may shun his Company:</hi> tamen ut Christiana charitas nos monet, <hi>let us pray for him to God who is a merciful God, and who can</hi> lapsos etiam à morte revocare.</p>
                  <p>And you may take notice of what is said in <hi>Croke</hi> 2d, and <hi>Coke</hi> 8th <hi>Report, Trollop's Case</hi> about the King's <hi>Pardon</hi> raising the <hi>Excommunicate</hi> from this <hi>civil</hi> death, and that a man need not be <hi>Absolved</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> if the King <hi>Pardons.</hi> And thus <hi>Hobart, Serle</hi>'s Case, <hi>p.</hi> 294. shews you that after the <hi>discharge</hi> of a <hi>Clerk Convict,</hi> he shall never be <hi>question'd</hi> in the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical</hi> Court for <hi>deprivation.</hi> You may likewise see it in <hi>Coke</hi> Inst. 3.

                  <p>I shall be glad to hear you discourse of this, and the rather for that 'tis so Customary to many when they find the <hi>Prince</hi> exercising this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> of <hi>Pardoning,</hi> to be apt too much to busy their heads with those <hi>two</hi> places in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, to their neglect of others there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Well Sir: As for this <hi>objected</hi> Dead-man, <hi>requiescat in Pace.</hi> I have done with him: and since from some things you have said, I gather that the <hi>dispensing</hi> with <hi>disability</hi> by <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors and <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> did never by any <hi>ferment</hi> disturb their Governments; and moreover, since no men of sense here have ever troubled themselves or the Government with any vexatious <hi>Question</hi> about the King's Power in discharging a man from a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> but not from a Penal <hi>disability</hi> incurr'd, whereas by <hi>a Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> shews us, <hi>Inst.</hi> 3. c. 54.) <hi>men are put out of the Protection of the King, and DISABLED to have any Action or Remedy by the King's Law or the Kings Writs,</hi> and exposed to many other dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

                  <p>I shall frankly tell you what I think hath occasion'd it.

For it is a Maxim of Law, That a man of full Age shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be receiv'd to disable his own Person:</hi> and for which he cites Sir <hi>E.

And you and others who think that <hi>Oath</hi> of importance for the securing the Peace of the <hi>Government,</hi> may thank the Prerogative of Regal <hi>Interpretation</hi> for supplying the <hi>Lamp</hi> of it with the <hi>Oil</hi> that hath made it <hi>last</hi> so long, and which otherwise would soon have gone out in a <hi>snuff,</hi> as I shew'd you by the <hi>offence</hi> that was <hi>taken</hi> at it at home and abroad when it was first <hi>set</hi> up, and which now may perhaps help to <hi>illuminate</hi> the <hi>English</hi> World in the measures of Loyalty so long <hi>as the Sun and Moon endure:</hi> that is, if you suppose that the <hi>use</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi> would <hi>endure</hi> so long.

                  <p>And it here coming into my mind that you in your somewhat <hi>airy</hi> way of discoursing of the Oath, resembled it to a <hi>tender-sided</hi> Ship <hi>girdled</hi> with so many interpretations, I shall take occasion further to impress it on your thoughts, that it is still <hi>THE SAME OATH,</hi> tho partaking of all those <hi>Interpretations,</hi> and as we say of <hi>eadem navis toties refecta:</hi> and the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral interpretations are not by you to be resembled to <hi>girdlings,</hi> but to its main inward <hi>beams</hi> and <hi>timbers</hi> that are become <hi>parts</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Moreover you know that a girdled Ship by reason of the incompactness of its <hi>adventitious</hi> parts with the other, cannot last the fourth part of the time that another will.

                  <p>Yet I shall here take occasion from my having just now <hi>minded</hi> you of the <hi>Interpretations</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> inclining Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> Roman-Catholick to judge of it as they did, to tell you that I have often wish'd that in the times of the three last <hi>Reigns</hi> the Power of <hi>Interpretation</hi> had further <hi>exerted</hi> it self in the further clearing of any thing in that <hi>Oath</hi> and in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> at which <hi>offence</hi> was by so many <hi>taken,</hi> however by the <hi>Oaths</hi> not <hi>given:</hi> and that such <hi>Interpretations</hi> had been <hi>approved</hi> in <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and particularly that the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of the word <hi>HERETICAL</hi> in the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as being meant of <hi>Contrary to the Word of God,</hi> had brought all our Roman-Catholick Brethren to the <hi>taking</hi> of that <hi>Oath,</hi> as I told you that <hi>F.

                  </p>
                  <p>And I shall be glad if those <hi>Interpretations</hi> relating to the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy</hi> which succeeded those that Sir <hi>Iohn Winter</hi> and the other <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> took notice of, may in the event Conduce to render it more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

                  <p>But to go on according to the freedom you gave me, I remember you told me that you would not trouble me with any <hi>Notions</hi> or <hi>Moot Points</hi> about the Power of <hi>Interpreting</hi> Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and about which you cited Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi>'s Book <hi>Of Acts of Parliament and their Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition:</hi> but I remember you have <hi>Sparsim</hi> variously spoke of it, and you mention'd to me what King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First</hi> told both Houses shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the granting the <hi>Petition of Right,</hi> that <hi>to the Iudges only under him the Interpretation of the Laws belong'd, and that none of the Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, joint or separate either could make or declare a Law without his Consent.</hi> I suppose you intend here to lodge no <hi>Snake</hi> in the <hi>grass</hi> of this <hi>Regal</hi> Power of interpretation, whereby we may be <hi>interpreted</hi> out of our <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right,</hi> and out of our <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Property.</hi>

                  <p>Your <hi>Supposal</hi> doth but right to my intentions. I have referr'd you only to <hi>Facts,</hi> and leave you to make a <hi>due</hi> use of them, and shall when we meet again shew you further why <hi>I</hi> have thus referr'd you to these <hi>Facts</hi> of the <hi>Regal</hi> interpretation: And in the mean time you may take notice, that as to what <hi>I</hi> have mentioned as a <hi>Notion</hi> out of the Lord Chancellor <hi>Hatton,</hi> (of which the intent and substance was, <hi>That if all the Parliament were voluntarily assembled again and not by Writ, Eorum non esset interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tari dubium Statutum,</hi> as the words are in the <hi>Table</hi> of his <hi>Book,</hi> Chap. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with which the <hi>Chapter</hi> agrees) I told you I would not <hi>trouble</hi> you with it, and you may give it its <hi>transeat</hi> as a kind of curious <hi>impossible</hi> Case. Nor need you <hi>amuse</hi> your self about any Consequences by me meant in what I told you of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi> telling the three Estates as they were <hi>feasting</hi> themselves with the noble <hi>Concessions</hi> of the <hi>Petition of Right.</hi> I know nothing asserted by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> in <hi>Inst.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>Of the High and Honourable Court of Parliament,</hi> but wherein I own my agreeing with him, and particularly as to what he speaks <hi>of Iudicature.</hi> And I doubt not but every one accounts that what he said <hi>Inst.</hi> 3. c. 73. was very <hi>Orthodox,</hi> viz. <hi>NOTE, Proclamations are of great force, which are grounded upon the Laws of the Realm.</hi> Nor considering the <hi>exuberance</hi> of that great thing call'd <hi>bona fides</hi> that is to be expected from Princes, need any man fear that there
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34919:73"/>
will be an Exposition of <hi>abrogamus</hi> for <hi>statuimus</hi> in any of the <hi>Declaratory</hi> Proclamations that ours shall make.</p>
                  <p>But because you have named <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> I shall take occasion to <hi>cite</hi> to you a very <hi>popular</hi> Authority to shew you that any <hi>Proclamations</hi> our <hi>English</hi> Monarchs shall make for the <hi>Dispensing</hi> with <hi>Penal</hi> Religionary <hi>Laws,</hi> will be but <hi>Declaratory</hi> of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and of the <hi>Petition</hi> of <hi>Right.</hi> You know we have often spoke of the <hi>Arguments</hi> in the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 40. made by Mr. <hi>Bagshaw,</hi> who was <hi>Pars magna</hi> of the <hi>Faction</hi> then regnant, and by which those <hi>Arguments</hi> of his were much celebrated. You may find some account of his <hi>Character</hi> in <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who mentions his being chosen <hi>Reader</hi> for the <hi>Lent Vacation</hi> by the <hi>Middle-Temple</hi> in the year 1639. And he in his <hi>First Argument,</hi> viz. <hi>Concerning the Canons,</hi> p. 11. saith, <hi>Liberty of Religion and Conscience are (as I take it) within the words of MAGNA CHARTA granted to me as mine Inheritance,</hi> Cap. 29. <hi>Nullus liber homo imprisonetur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>test Liberty. It is by a necessary Consequence and deduction within the words</hi>
                     </hi> imprisonetur. <hi>For put the Case that the Clergy make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons to which I never assented, and I break these Canons, whereupon I am Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and upon a</hi> Significavit <hi>by the Bishop, my Body is taken and imprison'd by a Writ</hi> de excommunicato Capiendo, <hi>now shall I lie in Prison all the days of my life, and shall never be deliver'd by a</hi> Cautione admittenda, <hi>unless I will come in and</hi> parere mandatis Ecclesiae, <hi>which are point blank against my Conscience.</hi> And he had before said, <hi>A Comparatis: by an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> à minori ad majus; <hi>if Property of Goods cannot be taken from me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my assent in Parliament, which is the fundamental Law of the Land, and so declared in the Petition of Right, why then Property and Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science which is much greater, as much as</hi> bona animi <hi>are above</hi> bona fortunae, <hi>cannot be taken from me without my assent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This it seems pass'd as <hi>Currant</hi> Coin for <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> in behalf of <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> in the <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of 41, the <hi>year</hi> in which his <hi>Book</hi> was Printed: and if it were so then allowable, you may well think that a <hi>Prince</hi>'s owning the Religion that flourish'd here in the time of <hi>Magna char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> (and which inspired the Virtue that produced <hi>Magna Charta</hi>) and indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some others of the same Religion to profess it without Punishment, is not likely to occasion any <hi>durable</hi> ferment.</p>
                  <p>And what <hi>I</hi> have here referr'd to concerning <hi>the Petition of Right,</hi> minds me of the great <hi>effort</hi> of Pious zeal in our famous Bishop <hi>Hall,</hi> and his laudably making use of the <hi>Popularity</hi> he had among the <hi>Protestants</hi> in send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Letter</hi> to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons, April</hi> the 28th, 1628. during the great <hi>ferment</hi> about that Petition, and in which he gives so much <hi>fatherly</hi> and Prudent <hi>advice</hi> to the great <hi>Agonists</hi> for <hi>Property,</hi> that they should consider when they were at the end of their <hi>race,</hi> and then to sit down and rest. He hath in it these <hi>tender</hi> Expressions, <hi>Gentlemen, For God's sake be wise in your well-meant zeal,</hi> and <hi>our Liberties and Proprieties are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to be sure and legal,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>let us not in suspicion of Evils that may be cast our selves into present confusion. If you love your selves and your Country, remit something of your own terms. And since the Substance is yielded by your noble Patriots, stand not too rigorously upon Points of Circumstance. Pear not to trust a good King, who after the strict Laws made, must be trusted with the Execution,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>relent or farewel welfare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may hence easily imagine how passionately that good Bishop would have been concerned if he had then seen among the <hi>Patriots</hi> any unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able heats about the not <hi>trusting</hi> the <hi>King</hi> with the <hi>Executive</hi> Power of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34919:73"/>
                     <hi>Penal</hi> Laws, and <hi>Laws in terrorem,</hi> and such <hi>Laws</hi> as Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi> in the '<hi>Month</hi> after the <hi>Date</hi> of the Bishop's Letter, said in a full <hi>Committee</hi> of both Houses, <hi>That the Commons must and ever will acknowledge that it is in His Majesty's ABSOLUTE and undoubted Power to grant Dispensations in,</hi> as I told you.</p>
                  <p>In God's Name, often think of that great <hi>Patriotly</hi> saying of <hi>Tully</hi> so often with just Applause cited by <hi>Sir</hi> E.

                  </p>
                  <p>Think often with honour of our <hi>Ancestors,</hi> who by so many <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and lawful <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> since the <hi>Refo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Cast your Eye with Pleasure about the Realm, and see if you can find any one who fears that any one will ever <hi>move</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> for <hi>leave</hi> to <hi>bring</hi> in any <hi>Bill</hi> to take away the least part of your <hi>Property</hi> in your <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> But then consider how Savage a thing it is in any to take excessive <hi>delight</hi> in the Execution of <hi>Penal</hi> Laws. <hi>Ferus est qui fruitur paenâ:</hi> and remember too that your <hi>Prince</hi> hath a <hi>Property</hi> in the <hi>Executive</hi> part of the <hi>Law,</hi> and in <hi>distributive</hi> Justice and in shewing <hi>Mercy.</hi> And when you hear any one telling you of a <hi>Snake in the grass</hi> of the Prince's dispensing with <hi>Penal</hi> Laws, and that therefore there may be <hi>danger</hi> of your Prince's <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> in <hi>Laws</hi> that are <hi>leneficial;</hi> you may tell him of the notorious <hi>Non-sequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> and that you have a <hi>Property</hi> in not being punish'd, and in having the benefit of the <hi>Rule</hi> as to <hi>favourable</hi> Statutes, being made more so by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation: <hi>Favores sunt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>But consider that since you have so much cause to depend on the glorious and <hi>consummate</hi> justice inherent in the nature of our great Monarch for his defending you in the security of all the <hi>Declaratory</hi> Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> that maintain your very Property in your Religion; both <hi>Iustice</hi> and Common <hi>Ingenuity</hi> call upon you to own his Power of <hi>Dispensing</hi> (and even with <hi>disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>) for which I have shewn you so many <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>incontestable</hi> decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative <hi>Iudgments</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and shall direct you to more when we meet again.</p>
                  <p>And let me tell you that you ought to have the greater <hi>tenderness</hi> for this <hi>Prerogative</hi> of our <hi>Prince;</hi> for that in his <hi>Administration</hi> of it, he hath in some Points shewn a greater <hi>tenderness</hi> to his <hi>Laws</hi> and People then our Princes since the Reformation have done.

                  <p>I shall carefully take notice of all these Matters wherein you have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd me: but am here occasionally on the account of some things you said about the <hi>Interpretation</hi> and the <hi>Acquittal</hi> from Penalties in the <hi>Queen's Admonition</hi> being <hi>perpetuated</hi> by their being <hi>declared</hi> good in <hi>Parliament,</hi>

                  <p>I do not in the least doubt but they may; and I shall hereafter evince the thing to you: but shall at present out of a <hi>Manuscript Report</hi> I have of the great <hi>Case</hi> of <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Sorrell,</hi> tell you that by one of the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel who argued in <hi>it,</hi> it was <hi>asserted</hi> with great Learning, <hi>That the</hi> Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obstante <hi>in that Case remain'd good after the King's death.

And in this Point he cited</hi> Trin. 2. Jac. C. B. Rot. 2835. Wright <hi>versùs</hi> Radcliffe, <hi>and</hi> Trin. 2. Jac. Norris <hi>v.</hi> Mason. C. B. <hi>as Cases adjudged in this point.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I shall then shew you how the same thing was then by others asserted: but you may now for this purpose remember how the <hi>instances</hi> I have given you of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Parliaments <hi>approving</hi> and <hi>declaring</hi> to be good, what she did of this kind, and the <hi>instances</hi> of what others of our <hi>Princes</hi> did by their own <hi>Authority</hi> and out of <hi>Parliament</hi> being valid, and being afterward approved in Parliament, have supported the <hi>extent</hi> of the Regal Authority of this kind, as to point of <hi>time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But because according to the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Unumquodque dissolvitur eo modo quo colligatur,</hi> many <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and <hi>Injunctions</hi> and <hi>Dispensations</hi> being <hi>revocable</hi> by Kings themselves and by their <hi>Successors,</hi> and because <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> cannot be <hi>repeal</hi>'d but by other <hi>Acts,</hi> common Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence doth suggest it to all to endeavour the <hi>perpetuating</hi> to themselves by the <hi>Legislative</hi> Power what they account beneficial. And if you will, you may use the term of having it <hi>confirm'd</hi> by that Power; that is, if you will allow it to have been <hi>firm before,</hi> you may call it <hi>confirm'd</hi> by the Prince, and the three Estates afterward <hi>enacting</hi> it, and making its <hi>firmness</hi> perpetual.

                  <p>Well Sir: we have had a great deal of <hi>frank</hi> Discourse, and I will now take the freedom to put one <hi>Question</hi> more to you. You have entertain'd me with the several <hi>Interpretations</hi> of our <hi>Oath,</hi> and have shew'd me how the obligatoriness of them all hath been perpetuated: and you have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>salved</hi> the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> in the <hi>Iustice</hi> of the <hi>Government</hi> as to the Laws <hi>in terrorem.</hi> But you know the Story of one who being Lord of a place did leave a <hi>Pit</hi> long open too near the <hi>High-way,</hi> and who at Night erected Lights about it to prevent its being mischievous: and he afterward, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that sometimes poor Blind men who were Travellers fell into it and that at other times by various accidents the <hi>Lights</hi> were not helpful to other Passengers, as being took away, or going out too soon; and he therefore at last very fairly removed both his <hi>Nuisance</hi> and <hi>Lights</hi> together. And now may it hot be wish'd that the <hi>Prince</hi> and the three Estates would <hi>remove</hi> the Laws about our <hi>Oaths</hi> and the <hi>Interpretations</hi> too, and so likewise all the Laws <hi>in terrorem,</hi> (among which <hi>I</hi> suppose you reckon the <hi>Test-Acts</hi>) at which so many have taken <hi>offence?</hi>

                  <p>You may easily guess that till we have both of us at another meeting discours'd of the <hi>Obligation</hi> resulting from the <hi>Promissory</hi> part of the <hi>Oath,</hi> I will not engage your thoughts in any matter of <hi>Controverfie</hi> that may in the least perplex them. But as soon as we have fully discours'd that, I shall frankly give you my thoughts at large relating to the question about <hi>Repealing</hi> of the <hi>Test-Acts</hi> in a Parliamentary manner: but do at present wholly forbear to mention what I think thereof. And I have before told you my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the likelihood of the continuance of our great Oath as a great <hi>lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary</hi> that may perhaps enlighten our <hi>English</hi> World in the measures of <hi>Loyalty</hi> to the end of time; and as I have told you the Oath <hi>giveth</hi> no <hi>offence</hi> to the Considerate, so I will hope none will be taken at it.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>I</hi> must here tell you, that <hi>I</hi> have a greater veneration for the <hi>Oath,</hi> because <hi>I</hi> look on the serious <hi>Consideration</hi> of the <hi>assertory</hi> part of it as likely to be very <hi>Instrumental</hi> in allaying the ferment we have been speaking of.</p>

                  <p>You remember what <hi>I</hi> hinted to you about the <hi>Clause</hi> whereby you <hi>testify'd and declared that the King is the only Supreme Governor of this Realm as well in all Spiritual or Ecclesiastical things or Causes as Temporal,</hi> (and from whence it follow'd by way of natural Consequence, that <hi>no foreign Prince,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>hath any Iurisdiction within this Realm)</hi> being the <hi>Corner-stone</hi> on which the great <hi>And therefore, <hi>I</hi>
                     </hi> mean, <hi>your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking foreign Iurisdiction</hi> was built. And <hi>I</hi> assure you that the same <hi>first <hi>Declaration</hi>
                     </hi> doth bind you to the like AND THEREFORE to <hi>renounce</hi> the belief of any <hi>Power</hi> on <hi>Earth</hi> being able to <hi>dissolve</hi> your King's <hi>right</hi> of <hi>Commanding</hi> your Obedience, and your <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>obey</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>And indeed if <hi>I</hi> had produced to you no <hi>Iudgment</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> for the purpose <hi>I</hi> have done but that which is contain'd in the <hi>assertory</hi> part of the <hi>Oath,</hi> (and which is unanimously interpreted by <hi>Divines</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> as expressive of the King's right <hi>jure naturae</hi> to <hi>Command</hi> the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>all</hi> his Subjects) it might have sufficiently satisfy'd you therein: and if at our next meeting you will have me dilate more on what our Lawyers have said about the Point of the debt of our <hi>Natural</hi> allegiance, <hi>I</hi> shall do it.</p>

                  <p>Our great Lawyers Judgments in that Point being known may be variously useful, and directive to the many illiterate and presumptuous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecters on the exercise of Prerogative; and especially if so learned and so <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> a <hi>Lawyer</hi> as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> shall be by you further cited in such a Case. And so what you shall acquaint me with as from any such one of them shall be kindly welcome.</p>

                  <p>What you have now said brings it into my mind how that Great <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular</hi> Man Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> was cited for this purpose by that great <hi>popular</hi> Man Sir <hi>William Iones</hi> in his learned <hi>Argument</hi> in <hi>Thomas &amp; Dorcel's Case,</hi> and where he did so much right to the <hi>DISPENSATIVE</hi> Power.</p>

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>What? Did Sir <hi>William Iones</hi> maintain the <hi>King's</hi> Power of <hi>Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> with <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and (<hi>I</hi> believe) was never censured for so doing by any one.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> pray tell me what was said by him in his <hi>Argument.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>B.</speaker>
                  <p>Then according to the very Learned and Judicious and Candid <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script Report</hi> I have of the Case, thus it was, <hi>Among the three Points made, the first being if the</hi> Non-obstante <hi>in the Patent of King</hi> James <hi>was good against the Statute of</hi> Edw. 6. Jones <hi>agreed that the King may by</hi> Non-obstante <hi>dispense with a thing Prohibited by Statute if the thing were lawful before the Statute were made.</hi> And he afterward said, that <hi>a Dispensation to one and his Heirs was never good but only in that of a Sheriff.</hi> 2. H. 7. 6. <hi>Grant of a Shrievalty in fee</hi> Non-obstante <hi>the Statute. But</hi> Coke 7. R. 14. <hi>Calvin's Case; the Reason of that is because the King hath interest to have the Service of all his Subjects by the Law of Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the truth is, that on this noble and great Consideration it is that our <hi>Divines</hi> who have <hi>treated</hi> of the <hi>OATH</hi> of <hi>SUPREMACY</hi> have fix'd the reasonableness and intent of that Oath, and of the <hi>King</hi>'s having a <hi>right</hi> to Command the <hi>Obedience</hi> of <hi>all</hi> his Subjects, upon the <hi>basis</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as on the Divine Law <hi>Positive.</hi> And thus too the <hi>style</hi> of the <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> about the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Allegiance</hi> runs, and which <hi>Acts</hi> you may Consult if you want any more <hi>Iudgments</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> about the <hi>indissolubility</hi> of the King's right to Command the <hi>Obedience</hi> of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and of the Subjects duty to <hi>obey,</hi> before we meet again. The reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of the words in that <hi>Oath</hi> contain'd in the <hi>Statute</hi> of 3<hi rend="sup">tio</hi>. <hi>Iacobi,</hi> viz. Of <hi>declaring that the Pope hath no Power to discharge any of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Subjects of their Obedience,</hi> appears from its being call'd in that <hi>Statute <hi>their Natural Obedience.</hi>
                     </hi> And <hi>the putting in Practice the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading or withdrawing any of the King's Subjects from their Natural Obedience to his Majesty, or to reconcile them to the Pope or See of Rome</hi> is there made <hi>Treason.</hi> We will speak more of other <hi>Statutes</hi> of this nature at our next meeting.</p>
                  <p>And in the mean time let me observe to you how as in the <hi>Conjuncture</hi> of the <hi>Exclusion</hi> so many were <hi>infatuated</hi> as for fear of <hi>Popery</hi> to come, to run upon the very <hi>Court of Rome-Popery</hi> at present, namely that of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium fundatur in Gratiâ,</hi> so likewise many mens fear of the belief of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some Religionary <hi>Tenets</hi> of <hi>Popery</hi> gaining ground for the future, hath hunted them upon the <hi>Popery</hi> of thinking <hi>that Subjects CAN in part, or in whole be discharged from their Natural Obedience to their Prince.</hi>

                     <hi>I</hi> thank you <hi>Sir,</hi> for suggesting that to me: for the truth is the <hi>tenet</hi> of thinking it lawful so to <hi>discharge</hi> Subjects from such their <hi>Natural Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> is the very <hi>odiosa materia</hi> charged by so many on the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Lateran.</hi>

                  <p>You say right. But however let me occasionally advise you not to charge the <hi>odious</hi> matter in that <hi>Councel</hi> on the Communion of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> For <hi>I</hi> shall tell you that the great <hi>Writers</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> did after the <hi>real</hi> Plot of the <hi>Gun-Powder-Treason</hi> pursue such noble <hi>Methods</hi> of Christian <hi>Charity,</hi> as with an intent of improving the Principles of Loyalty and Allegiance among all our <hi>Roman-Catholick</hi> Countrymen, to endeavour to prove with all their Learning that the <hi>Decrees</hi> of that <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel</hi> obliged no <hi>Papist</hi> in point of Conscience. King <hi>Iames</hi> in his Works

calls it but <hi>a Pretended Councel,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Donne</hi> in his <hi>Pseudo-Martyr</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to prove it no <hi>Councel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover Bishop <hi>Bilson</hi> in his learned Works for maintaining the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Supremacy,</hi> saith that <hi>Nothing was Concluded in the Councel of</hi> Lateran. <hi>I</hi> have here on the Table his <hi>Book</hi> call'd, <hi>The Difference between Christian Subjection, and Un-christian Rebellion,</hi> Printed <hi>A.</hi> 1586, in which his <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Iudicious</hi> Assertions and Explications of the Regal <hi>Supremacy,</hi> and of our Moral <hi>Offices</hi> to <hi>defend</hi> the same are comprised: and there in <hi>Part</hi> 3. p. 6. you will find what he saith of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councel.</p>

                     <hi>I</hi> pray take it along with you. And <hi>I</hi> am the rather desirous you should do it, because in this <hi>Crooked and Perverse Generation</hi> many who <hi>strain</hi> their <hi>Consciences</hi> by the inobservance of the <hi>Oath,</hi> may be so vain as to fancy that others strain the <hi>Oath</hi> who endeavour (as <hi>I</hi> have done) to build the <hi>Right</hi> of our Kings to Command the <hi>Services</hi> of their Subjects, on its so firm Foundation. He was trusted by the Government to write on the Subject of the <hi>Oath,</hi> and so his Authority is of the more weight: and <hi>I</hi> shall here at parting read to you what he saith in <hi>Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 183. where he so well insinuates it, <hi>that the Prince can freely permit, safely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, generally restrain, and externally punish within the Realm:</hi> but in <hi>p.</hi> 328. having spoke of the true <hi>Supremacy of Princes,</hi> he saith, <hi>This is the Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy which we attribute to Princes, that all Men within their Territories should obey their Laws, or abide their Pleasures, and that no man on Earth hath Authority to take their Swords from them by Iudicial Sentence, or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Violence.</hi> And he there had before said in his Margin, <hi>the Sword of Princes is Supreme, in that it is not Subject to the Pope; and must be obey'd of all in things that are good.</hi> What he saith likewise in <hi>p.</hi> 346. there is worth your reading, where he makes the word <hi>Supreme</hi> to be <hi>a plain and manifest deduction out of the 13th of the</hi> Romans, <hi>Let every Soul be subject to the Superior Powers. If all Men must be subject to them,</hi> ergo <hi>they are Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all: and Superior to all is Supreme.</hi> He then thus goeth on in his <hi>Dialogue-way,</hi> Phil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>S.</hi> Paul <hi>maketh them Superiors over all Persons, but not over all things.</hi> Theop. <hi>That Distinction is ours,</hi> (meaning Protestants) <hi>not yours: we did ever interpret Supreme for Superior to all men within their Dominions.</hi> Phil. <hi>And so we grant them to be but not in all things. For in Temporal things they are Superior to all men, in Spiritual they are not.</hi> Theop. <hi>That restraint comes too late: the Holy Ghost charging you to be subject to them simply without addition. It passeth your reach to limit in what things you will, and in what things you will not be subject.</hi> And he there saith, <hi>Out of all Question where Princes may by God's Law Command, all men must obey them not only for fear of wrath, but for Conscience sake.</hi> To this purpose too he <hi>asserts</hi> the <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the following <hi>Page: All men are bound to be subject to the Sword in all things, be they Temporal or Spiritual, not only by Suffering, but also by Obeying: but with this Caution, that in things that are good and agreeable to the Law of God, the Sword must be obey'd, in things that are otherwise, it must be endured.</hi> At the same rate you will find him writing in his <hi>Third Part,</hi> p. 7. <hi>The Word of God bindeth you to obey Princes, the words of men cannot loose you.</hi> But if you will there take notice of the <hi>fire</hi> of his <hi>Zeal</hi> breaking into a <hi>flame</hi> at the thoughts of the <hi>displacing of Princes from their Thrones,</hi> and of the <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging</hi>

                     <hi>of the People from the Oath and Obedience toward Princes,</hi> he saith that <hi>they who will go to that, turn Religion into Rebellion, Patience into Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Words into Weapons, Preaching into Fighting, Fidelity into Perjury, Subjection into Sedition, and instead of the Servants of God, which they might be by enduring, they become the Soldiers of Satan by resisting the Powers which God hath ordain'd.</hi>
