         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Licenſed according to Order.</p>
            <p>SUch has been Their Majeſties Incomparable Clemency, ſince their Acceſſion to the Throne, that among the many Lives Forfeited by the Law, on the account of Treaſonable Books and Pamphlets, their boundleſs Mercy has taken but One: (as a great Lawyer has excel ently obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) It was only Their Majeſties Goodneſs toward many others, to call that a <hi>Miſdeamenor,</hi> which the Law calls Treaſon. The Treaſonable Libels that this Man ſuffer'd, more particularly for, being but two, of above two Score ſeveral ſorts that have been diſperſt, ſince the Year 1691, in divers of which are contained as many and great Treaſons as it was poſſible either for the Malice of the Devil or the Corrupt and Treaſonable thought of Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty Men to invent; <hi>Containing 'Treaſons againſt the King in his own Royal Perſon; againſt his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, both Eccleſiastical and Civil, full of Treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Queen, Scandals againſt all manner of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions both in Church and Kingdom, of Magiſtracy and Miniſtery:</hi> It is therefore no more wonder to find thoſe People <hi>Diſtemper'd,</hi> that are entertain'd with <hi>Poyſon,</hi> inſtead of wholeſome <hi>Nouriſhment,</hi> than to ſee the Sea Rage when the Winds blow.</p>
            <p>Thus much ſaid, may ſeem to give the Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fected and Murmuring Party a greater Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then Convenient, were it not that their main Deſign, of ſhooting theſe <hi>Paper Pellets,</hi> (according to Old <hi>Prines</hi> Phraſe), has lately ſuffered ſo fatal a Diſappointment, that many of them are at this Inſtant under a <hi>Courſe of Juſtice;</hi> Others in <hi>Cuſtody</hi> and Expecting it: And the <hi>Reſidue</hi> neither in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,</hi> nor <hi>condition</hi> to <hi>Proſecute the Quarrel;</hi> being ſo fully ſatisfied of the <hi>Vigelance, Power</hi> and <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> of their Majeſties Friends, (which in Effect, are as many, as either, Love the Publique, or themſelves) that they find it morally Impoſtible for them ever to bring any <hi>Villany to perfection upon ſo deſperate a Bottome:</hi> Beſides they have Undeceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the World, and made appear to their Sacred Majeſties, that all Mercy is loſt upon them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Anderton,</hi> The Subject of this Narrative was by Birth, a <hi>North-Countrey Man,</hi> and tho' but of Indifferent <hi>Eſtated Parents,</hi> yet he was well E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated as to Grammar Learning. From the School he was put Apprentice to a <hi>Printer,</hi> ſerving his time with one Mr. <hi>Miles Fletcher,</hi> a Perſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Note of that Trade, after which for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Years: From a Printer, he became a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of the Preſs, which Imploy he chiefly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, till the late <hi>Abdication</hi> and <hi>Revolution,</hi> after which he took to his Printing again, but in Holes and by Corners only.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> has been known to have been an <hi>Old Offender againſt the Government,</hi> in <hi>Printing Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious and Treaſonable Libels</hi> being generally thought to be concern'd in moſt of the moſt <hi>Treaſonable Pamphlets</hi> that have been Diſperſed for ſome Years paſt, Notwithſtanding he was Indicted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed but of two of them; the manner of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending was as followeth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Robert Stephens,</hi> Meſſenger of the Preſs; having formerly taken many Private Preſſes, wherein our Mr. <hi>Anderton</hi> was a Chief Manager, more particularly one at <hi>Hogſdon</hi> near <hi>More Fields,</hi> and another near <hi>So-ho</hi> Yet <hi>Anderton</hi> had the good Fortune always to Eſcape with his Perſon. But on the 2d. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, <hi>Spying two Journty-Men Printers, whom he had miſſed from publick Printing Houſes, for above ſix Months before; he followed them, and ſaw them go exactly into the Houſe of one</hi> Skuda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more (<hi>where</hi> Anderton <hi>was found) and where be had reaſon to think he worked privately:</hi> So having the <hi>Beadle</hi> and ſome other Perſons to his aſſiſtance, he Apprehended <hi>Anderton</hi> there, but not without a great deal of trouble and abuſe: Mr. <hi>Stephons</hi> and the others, made a particular Search, and in the Chamber where <hi>Anderton</hi> Lodged at the back of his Bed they t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
