            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in his owne desert must needes haue beene ouertaken with this iudgment: And therefore was it not the free mercie of the Lord that wee were not vtterly consumed.</p>
            <p>Were wee not plucked euen as a brand out of the fire? were wee not wonderfully redeemed euen by the mightie power of God, from that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible pit?

And shal we not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take vp the cup of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, &amp; giue thanks vnto the name of the Lord. Surely as there remaines no more sacrifice for sin, for such that do treade vnder foote the blood of the Son of God. So I am perswaded that if we shall despise so great saluation, and forget this wonderfull worke which our God hath done for vs, we shall in vaine hope of the like deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.

And therfore howsoeuer it may seeme both needlesse, and preiudiciall, after so many graue, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall rules concerning sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to adde any more in this kinde: yet seeing it hath pleased God to direct mee to a further la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour herein: weigh with me I pray thee in equitie these reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:</p>
            <p>First, I doe hereby professe my thankefulnesse vnto God for those excellent labors of his Saints, that now rest from their labours and their fruits follow them.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I would haue thee know that I am not ashamed of this foolishnesse of preaching, and practicke Diuinitie, which is such a mystery to the world, and stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke vnto the wisedome thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, howsoeuer I do professe that I am not able to attaine such perfection, as I haue here in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued,
<pb facs="tcp:24012:6"/>
yet I would haue thee know further, that I would rather haue a rule to condemne sinne in the flesh, and so to confound the old man, that thereby the new man may follow hard after the marke: then not to giue testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie to that light, which hath shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned so gratiously vnto me, then to conceale my iudgement, though it may condemne my practise.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, May it please thee to consider with me: Can a man walk in the Sunne, and not bee warme, and where two lie together, will there not be heate? and can the light be hidden, nay, ought it to be hidden? Ought we not, being conuerted, conuert our brethren: doth not the light shine vnto vs, and can we hold our peace? Is not the night coming fast on vs when none can worke?</p>

purging and triall. And is it not more then high time that wee should gather our selues before the decree come forth? Is it not certain that our master wil not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g deferre his comming and shall not that seruant be blessed, whom his master comming shall finde so doing, euen freeing himselfe and departing from euill. Shal not the wise man see the plague and hide himselfe, &amp; the foole run on &amp; be punished?

comming. Doe the times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in regard of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of plentifull meanes, that by this time thou shouldest haue bin a teacher of others, and yet art thou to learne the grounds of thy faith? Behold here then the grounds of Sanctification pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and opened vnto thee: that thou maist be soundly entred into the schoole of Christ Iesus, that thou maist trie thy selfe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou hast laide a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or no? hast thou built hay and stubble vpon the foundation? hast thou gone a stray from that perfect rule, and therefore hadst need to returne backe againe?</p>
            <p>Behold, <hi>The doctrine of repentance</hi> to sustaine thy iudgement aright: here maist thou trie thy selfe, whether thou hast repented or no, hereby maist thou approue thine interest in Iesus Christ. And to this purpose is <hi>the doctrine of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> proposed before the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith. Not that it is or can be in nature before it: for how can
<pb facs="tcp:24012:8"/>
the fruite be before the tree? can we loue God vnlesse hee loue vs first? can wee forsake our sinnes, vnles the loue of Christ constrain vs? must we not beleeue sinne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable before we can forsake it: Is not our sufficiencie of God through Iesus Christ to subdue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquitie? Is not Iesus Christ aswel-the authour and finisher of our faith? And is it not sinne before God, though it seeme neuer so glorious among men, whatsoeuer is not of faith? And without faith is it possible to please God? Must we not first be in Christ before we can be new creatures? and do we not liue by faith in the Sonne of God? And doth not the death of Christ daily kill sinne in vs? doe wee not dayly rise vp in him to newnesse of life? And do wee not approue our selues hereby liuing members of his body? Is it any more wee but Christ that now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth in vs? Is not this to liue by faith in the Sonne of God? Loe here our repentance being a fruit
<pb facs="tcp:24012:8"/>
of our faith in Iesus Christ, is also an euidence vnto our soules, that we are in the faith: and so our faith which in nature is before repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance hath, yet repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in order acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying the same, and by this liuely fruit is discerned of vs: and thus hast thou in the next place a gratious direction how to <hi>discerne</hi> and <hi>reuiue</hi> thy most pretious faith that so thou maist bee sure that thou hast not laboured in vaine.</p>
            <p>Now seeing the work of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is begun in weaknes, rather in the purpose of the heart, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny constancie of outward practise, and hypocrisie wil be sure to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it selfe with our best endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours if it be possible to blast the the verie blade.</p>
            <p>Therefore art thou informed in the next place how to <hi>prepare</hi> thy heart in the seruice of God, how to comfort thy selfe in the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony thereof, notwithstanding thy dayly failings in the practise of weldoing.</p>
            <p>And seeing the heart of man is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful aboue al things, &amp; the cause
<pb facs="tcp:24012:9"/>
of all thy failings ariseth from the not guiding of thy heart. Therfore art thou taught how to <hi>arme</hi> thy heart with that <hi>complete armor of a Christian souldier.</hi> And so thou art instructed in the vse of each <hi>seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peece</hi> therof, that so thou maist be ready at all assayes.</p>
            <p>To this end in the next place are propounded vnto thee, those two maner occasions and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of thy whole life: namely, to prosecute good, and forsake euill: and so thou art instructed how to performe the one, and leaue the other, how to discerne sinceritie in either.</p>
            <p>And because the true Christian life is a continuall growth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art thou further informed how to discerne this growth in grace, thou art furnished with meanes, wherby thou maist grow, and thou art comforted in the weakenesse and hinderances of thy growth.</p>
            <p>And seeing <hi>thankefulnesse</hi> is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial badge of our loue vnto Christ &amp; a principal means to renue our
<pb facs="tcp:24012:9"/>
right in him, that so from him we may renue strength and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of grace to grow forward perfection: therefore art thou taught also <hi>how to bee thankefull,</hi> thou art informed in the truth and right vse of this dutie.</p>
            <p>And as by these meanes thou art hastning to perfection: so art thou further prouoked to <hi>constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> &amp; <hi>perseuerance.</hi> And gratiously informed how thou maist con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to the end, not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in thy greatest fayling that thou shalt recouer, but instructed also gratiously how thou maist hold out. Namely,</p>
            <p>By holy <hi>watchfulnesse,</hi> and iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie ouer thy heart and wayes, that so thou maist preuent securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and presumption, and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously goe on and perseuere in weldoing.</p>
            <p>And that thou maist not bee ouercome with the cares of the world, not be to seeke at any time of the present assistance of thy God: therefore thou art enformed
<pb facs="tcp:24012:10"/>
aboue all things to <hi>make thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests manifest vnto God,</hi> and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted so to aske that thou maist re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue.</p>
            <p>And so thou art informed how to maintaine <hi>thy peace with God,</hi> and to repose thy selfe sweetly in the bosome thereof.</p>

                  </note>Hence, first appeareth the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference btweene the Essence of God, and the Persons of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Essence. As</p>
               <p n="1">1 By the Essence we vnderstand
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:24012:40"/>
whatsoeuer is common to the three persons in regard of their nature and absolute being, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered seuerally by themselues, and in themselues.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By Person we must vnderstand that relation which is betweene them, being compared together, and the maner of their existence therein. Briefly thus:</p>
               <p>The Essence signifies that God is, or rather that there is one, and that eternall Deity.</p>
               <p>The person is the manner, by which that diuine Essence subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth in each seuerally. As</p>
               <p>The Father is that Essence which is of himselfe, and not of another.</p>
               <p>The Sonne is the same Essence but not of himselfe, but of the Father.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghost is the same Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, not of himself, but of the Father and of the Sonne: so that</p>
               <p>The diuine Essence is one &amp; the same, to, and in these three: but</p>

                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:24012:41"/>
to bee either of <hi>One,</hi> or of <hi>two</hi>: that is, to haue that one diuine essence, either of it selfe, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated from another; either of <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two</hi>: this is the manner of subsisting, which is three-fold:

                     <item>1 To be of it selfe.</item>
                     <item>2 To be generated.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The essence is absolute and communicable, but the person is relatiue &amp; incommunicable. And this differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is to be maintained</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the vnity of the true <hi>God</hi> be not distracted: or that</p>

               <p>And therfore here first we must beware.</p>
               <p n="1">1 That by the person wee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not simply either a bare Relation or Office, as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellius</hi>

               <p n="2">2 The person is not a thing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted or separated from the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, which is common to them; neither is the essence a fourth thing separated from the persons; but euery person is the same en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire essence of the Deity, onely the persons are distinguished from each other: the essence is common to the three.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The diuine essence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hath not that respect vnto the persons, as the 1 <hi>Matter to the effect,</hi> because <hi>God</hi> is not compounded of matter and forme; and therefore it is not

But God is a more common name; because the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Diety is common to the three persons; and may bee affirmed of each alike. And the name of Father, Sonne, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost is more straight, because the the persons are truly distinct, &amp; cannot bee affirmed of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Essence, Nature, Diuinty; again, They are of the same Essence, Nature, &amp;c. And yet it is not well said they are of one God, because there is none of these Persons which is not very God, whole and perfect.

                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:24012:43"/>The Father is the <hi>First Person,</hi> because hee is the Fountaine of the Diuinitie, of the Sonne,<note place="margin">Order of Persons.</note> and Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>The Sonne is the <hi>Second Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> because the Deitie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto him, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the eternall genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Holy Ghost is the <hi>Third Person,</hi> because the Deitie is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated vnto him from the Father and the Sonne by Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inspiration. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.5.7.</p>
               <p>And yet the Father is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sonne, nor the Father and the Sonne before the Holy Ghost <hi>in time,</hi> but in the <hi>manner</hi> of existence.</p>
               <q>And so, as is the order of the Persons, such is the order of their outward workes.</q>
               <p>For though they are done by the common will,<note place="margin">Order of workes.</note> and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Father, and the Sonne, and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>: yet is
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:24012:44"/>
the same order of Persons kept in the doing thereof, which the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons haue in their existence: So</p>
               <p>The <hi>Father</hi> is the Fountaine, as of the Person, so of the operation of the Son, &amp; of the Holy Ghost; and doth all things, not as if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrought by him, as if the will of another went before, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating power and efficacie vnto him, but as of himselfe as existing, so vnderstanding and working of himselfe.</p>
               <p>Now the Sonne and the Holy Ghost worke not of themselues, but the Sonne of himselfe, so as that the will of the <hi>Father</hi> goeth before, and the Holy Ghost so of himselfe, as that the will, both of the <hi>Father</hi> and of the <hi>Sonne</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth. The <hi>Father</hi> worketh by the Sonne, and holy Ghost; so, as that he sendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; is not sent of them. The <hi>Sonne</hi> worketh by the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> sends him into the hearts of the beleeuers from the <hi>Father,</hi> and is not sent of him: but of the <hi>Father.</hi> The <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:24012:44"/>

               <p>And yet when the <hi>Sonne</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are said to be sent, this is not meant of any <hi>locall motion,</hi> or any <hi>mutation</hi> in God. But 1. of the <hi>Eternall Will</hi> &amp; decree to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme some thing by the Sonne and holy Ghost. And 2. of the <hi>Reuealing and execution of that will,</hi> by the working of the Sonne and Holy Ghost: so saith the Sonne, <hi>That he is sent of the Father into the world,</hi> that he came downe from heauen, and yet that he is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, euen when hee was vpon the earth. So is the Holy Ghost saide to be sent vnto the disciples at Pentecost, when as yet he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and dwelt with the Apostles. So both are sent into the world; not as if they had receiued their existence elsewhere, where they were not before, but because they accomplished in the world the will of the <hi>Father,</hi> which was

not done before, and so, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that will, expressed their presence and effectuall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of what we shall haue, as also in respect of any thing, as of our selues, furthering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:24012:54"/>
but especially emptying our selues of all confidence therein, or glory thereby, that the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone might bee honoured in his onely worke.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that man was made of the dust of the earth, we learne,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Not to be puffed vp in regard of nature, seeing it came from no better then the earth.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Neither to despise the most vnlikely &amp; contemptible meanes for our good, seeing the Lord made vs of such.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Neither to seeke after great matters in the world, seeing our originall was so meane.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Neither to set vp our hearts in this life, but rather to prepare to death, seeing to the earth we must.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:24012:54"/>
the marke, if by any meanes we may attaine to the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the dead: looking by faith a farre off for the changing of these vile bodies. And comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selues in our better part; that the soule is immortall, and therefore labouring to haue our conuersation in heauen, and to be made meete for that glorious inheritance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that man was made a liuing soule, immediatly breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Lord, eternally to liue with him.</p>
               <p>This teacheth</p>
               <p n="1">1 That the soule is immediatly subiect vnto God, ought onely to bee bound by him, principally must depend on his blessed will.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That it must be exercised in heauenly things, agreeable to the nature and end thereof.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That it is subiect to eternall punishment for sinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought to saue it selfe from that fearefull vengeance, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:24012:55"/>4 That eternall hapinesse is due thereto for wel-doing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should not faint, nor be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereof.</p>
               <p n="5">5 That as the creation is imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate from God, though the body be from man: so also is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation and Renuing of the soule immediatly from his meere mercy in Christ, without any help or concurrence from man.</p>
               <p n="6">6 And therefore we are not to rest in any naturall faculties of the soule, as if they were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to saluation, or could further thereto: but rather discerne wee wisely, <hi>That the wisedome of the flesh is enmity against God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7 And so let vs deny our selues, that we may be found in Christ, not hauing our owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.9. Yet so</p>
               <p n="8">8 As that seeing we haue free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in naturall and morall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, concerning the outward act, though not for the truth, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or end of well-doing; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do we what is ours, in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

the meanes of saluation: As, come wee to the word; and though we cannot discerne it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, neither propose the right end therein, least if wee forsake God in not doing so farre as wee may, he may iustly forsake vs in denying a blessing to the means, that so our condemnation may be iust and inexcusable.</p>
               <p n="9">9 That the soule was breathed into the nostrels, not into the eares, or mouth, or eyes, this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth the imbecillity and frailty of our life, as if it depended on our nostrels, <hi>Esay,</hi> 2 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus of the matter..</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, consider we the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our creation, and therein the <hi>Excellencie</hi> and ends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>For the manner, we were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Gods Image, not that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee were made of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, or that God must bee like to vs, hauing humane shape (although if we respect the second person in Trinity, it might

               <p n="7">7 Destinated to eternall life in heauen.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Which should haue propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an immortall kinde, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Image of God.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Yet all this mutably,</p>
               <p n="1">1 That so if Man had ouercome the Tempter, his glory had beene the greater.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That way might bee made hereby to the reuelation of the eternall mercy of God to his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in Iesus Christ, as also of his Iustice in the condemnation of the wicked for the refusall of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and in him of their saluation.</p>
               <p>And hence ariseth the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Man; 1 By the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his creation, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that in respect of the mutability thereof: hee was to be interessed in the <hi>Messiah,</hi> &amp; so to be restored &amp; preserued by him

vnto saluation.</p>
               <p>Hence also arise the ends of mans creation.</p>

               <p n="3">3 That Man might haue the dominion ouer all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p n="4">4 That also he might bee, as it were, a sweet Companion with the Lord in eternall glory and happinesse. And</p>

               <p>Whence we may learne</p>

               <p n="2">2 To magnifie his admirable wisedome in making our estate such, as in regard of our free-will to be subiect to change; and so to rest content with the will of God in things more contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and vnlikely for our God, seeing the Lord out of this muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate raised so much good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to aduance his holy sonne Iesus; and in him to renue and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish our formerly mutable condition.</p>

               <p>Lastly, seeing the Lord, as hee ordained the fall of man muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so hee ordained a Redeemer before the fall to recouer the

Therefore let this comfort vs in all our troubles, whether vpon vs, or expected, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly we may expect a good issue therein; seeing we were first apointed to glory, &amp; so to deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and so appoynted to afflictions to make vs sit for glory: And we are here taught to loue the person of man, as bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Gods Image, though we may hate the sinne.</p>

                  </note>First then, let vs consider the ends why the Lord bestow, those outward blessings in this life vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon his children, which are these:</p>
               <p n="1">1 To try whether wee will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him before them, and can loue him better then them, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore,</hi>

               <p n="1">1 We must not esteeme basely of them,<note place="margin">

               <p n="2">2 Neither must we be secure in this slippery estate, seeing the same giuer is also the taker a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Take heede we despise not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in regard of them.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nor thrust our God, and set them vp in our hearts. <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.</p>

               <p n="7">7 We must not tye, nor measure God onely by them, <hi>Psa.</hi> 30.6.</p>

               <p>Secondly, because the ouer-high conceit of these things is no small occasion to be-witch our hearts with them, therefore let vs labour to rectifie our iudgments concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning prosperity, that so our ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening opinion thereof may bee abated, and our affections rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein.</p>
