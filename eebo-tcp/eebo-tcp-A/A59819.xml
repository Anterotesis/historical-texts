            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <div type="introduction">
               <head>The Introduction.</head>
               <p>IN the Preface to <hi>the Vindication of some
Protestant Principles of Church-Unity
and Catholick Communion, from the
charge of Agreement with the Church
of</hi> Rome, I promised a Discourse about the Church,
and intended to have discharged that Obligation,
which has been very importunately demanded of
me, long before this; and indeed had finished,
what I now publish, several months ago: I shall
not trouble my Reader with the Reasons why I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42307:3"/>
then laid it aside; I hope <hi>The Preservative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Popery</hi> will satisfie him, that I have not
been idle in the mean time: but the true and only
reason why I have delayed to publish this Part,
which has been so long finished, was because I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to finish the whole before I published it,
which would have given more general satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to my Readers: But I have not leisure for
that now, and think it more advisable to publish
a part than none at all, especially since what I
here publish is an entire Discourse concerning the
Nature and Vnity of the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>It is sufficiently known, that there is no Argument
of greater consequence in our Disputes with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> than the Vnity and Authority of
the Catholick Church. Nothing will serve them but
to make the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> the Catholick Church,
and then no body is a Member of the Church Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,
who is not in Communion with the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> and since no body can be saved but in
the Church, all Hereticks and Schismaticks, who
are not in Communion with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
must be damned, and there is a sad end of us all.</p>
               <p>Thus the Catholick Church is an Infallible
Teacher of Faith: for who dares say, that the
Catholick Church can fail, or err in Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals?
since Christ himself has promised that the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42307:3"/>
Gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church:
and therefore the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the
Catholick Church and Principle of Catholick Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
must be Infallible; and no Christian ought to
dispute any thing which she has determined in
matters of Faith.</p>
               <p>The Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Head of this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, St. Peter's Successor, and Christ's
Vicar upon Earth, and therefore he is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Governour of the Church, from whom all
other Bishops derive their Authority, and to whom
all Christian Princes and Emperours themselves
are subject <hi>in Ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> which will
go a great way to a Temporal Soveraignty, and
Vniversal Empire.</p>
               <p>These pretences indeed have been sufficiently
baffled by Protestant Divines, ever since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Reformation; but we have to deal
with men who have confidence enough to be baffled
and not to own it, to see all their Arguments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
an hundred times over, and to repeat them
again with a good grace, without replying to those
Answers which have been so often given them,
or so much as taking notice that there ever had
been any Answer made to them.</p>
               <p>But after all that is said on one side and t'other,
I am very sensible there never will be an end of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42307:4"/>
these Wranglings, without setling the true Notion
of the Catholick Church; which, though a great
many good things have been said about it, I think
was never thoroughly done yet: what my present
Performance is, I must leave other men to judge;
but if my Notion be right, I am sure there is an
end of all the vain and arrogant Pretences of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as will appear to any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Reader, who peruses this Discourse with
Care and Judgment.</p>
               <p>The foundation of all I have laid in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
into the true Notion of the Vnity of the
Church Catholick; which gives occasion to state
the true Notion of the Church, and most of those
Controversies which depend on it. I have here
only considered what is meant by the Vnity of the
Catholick Church, as that signifies the whole
Church of Christ both in Heaven and Earth, and
the whole Church of Christ on Earth. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to the Nature and Vnity of particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
their Government, Vnion, and Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
into one Catholick Communion, must be reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for a Second Part.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Vnity of the whole Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church in Heaven and Earth.</head>
               <p>IT is acknowledged by all Christians, that Christ
has but One Church, which is his One Body:
but then we must consider the intent of this
One Church. The Church on Earth indeed is
but One, but this One Church on Earth is not
the One Church and One Body of Christ, but only a
very little part of it. Christ has but One Church and
One Body in all, and therefore it must comprehend the
whole Church from the beginning to the end of the
World, at least from the first planting of a Church by
Christ and his Apostles till the last Judgment, for they
all belong to this One Church, and, this One Body of
Christ; so that for the greatest part of this One Church
is already translated into Heaven, and the Church on
Earth is but a very little part of the whole: for the
Church in Heaven, and the Church on Earth, are but
One Church, and One Body. Here we must lay the
foundation, if we would rightly understand, what
makes One Church; for since this Unity comprehends
the whole Church, we cannot argue meerly from the
Churches being One, to infer any other kind of Unity,
but what makes the whole, but what unites the whole
Church in Heaven and Earth into One Body, for that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42307:5"/>
only is the true Unity of the Church, because the whole
Church in Earth and Heaven is the One Church. And
therefore to place the Unity of the Church in any thing,
which can concern only one part of the Church, but
not the whole, as suppose, that part only which is on
Earth, not that which is in Heaven, is manifestly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd,
because it does not give an account, how the
whole Church is One, and yet the Oneness of the
Church properly relates to the whole, not to a part:
for a part be it never so much One, can be but One
part, not the One Church. Now hence we may learn,
wherein the Unity of the Church does not consist, and
wherein it does.</p>
               <p>1. Wherein the Unity of the Church does not consist.
As 1. The Unity of the Church does not consist in its
being One organized Politick Body, under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of One visible Head on Earth: for tho a visible
Head on Earth might make the Church on Earth One,
yet it cannot unite the Church on Earth and the
Church in Heaven into One Body, unless this visible
Head on Earth be the Head of the invisible Church in
Heaven too: for if the Unity of the Church consists
in being united under One Head, that Head must
be the Head of the whole Church, or else the Church is
not united in the Head, if the Head, which is the principle
of Union, be not the Head of the whole. Now I suppose,
no Papist will say, that the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is the Head
of the invisible as well as of the visible Church, and
then the Church is not one, by being united under the
Bishop of <hi>Rome;</hi> tho there are some things, which
would make one suspect, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> did
believe the Pope to be the Head of the invisible as
well as of the visible Church; for if his Authority
be confined to the Church on Earth, one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42307:5"/>
whence he should pretend to canozie Saints
in Heaven, or to release Souls out of Purgatory, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
his being Christ's Vicar on Earth makes him his
Vicar in Heaven, and in Purgatory also; but this by the
way.</p>
               <p>If they say, that when they speake of the Unity of the
Church, they mean only the Unity of the Church on
Earth, and that the Pope is the visible Head of this
Unity.</p>
               <p>I answer, 1. That they must grant then, that they
speak very improperly; for the Church on Earth is not
that One Church, which is the One Body of Christ,
and therefore the Unity of the Church does not consist
in the Headship of the Pope; but they ought only to
say, that the Unity of the Church on Earth consists in
its Union to the Pope.</p>
               <p>2. And therefore they must quit all their Arguments
for the Pope's Headship, taken from the Churches being
<hi>One,</hi> the <hi>One Body of Christ;</hi> for the Church on Earth
is not this One Body of Christ, and therefore it does
not follow, that because Christ has but one Body,
therefore the Church on Earth must have one visible
Head.</p>
               <p>3. Nay they must confess, that the formal and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Unity of the Church on Earth does not consist in
its Union to the Pope. For the Church on Earth is
One with the Church in Heaven, they being both but
One Church, and therefore must have the same essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Unity; for how they should be one by two sorts of
Unity, that is, be one without the same formal Unity,
is very mysterious, and near a kin to a contradiction.
And therefore since the Unity of the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
does not consist in its Union to the Pope, no
more does the Unity of the Church on Earth, the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42307:6"/>
Unity being the same in both. And thus all their
Arguments from the Unity of the Church on Earth, to
prove an Universal Visible Head of the Church, are
lost too.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Nor does the Unity of the Church consist in
joyning together in the external and visible Acts of
Worship, or in maintaining mutual intercourse and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence
with each other; these are Duties which
result from Church-Unity, when they are practicable,
(as I shall shew more hereafter) but the Unity of the
Church cannot consist in them, for the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth are one without them; and so may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Churches on Earth be one Church without any
such visible correspondence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> Nor can the Unity of the Church consist in such
Articles of Faith as have not always been the Faith of
the Christian Church. For since the whole Church in
all Ages is but One, it can have but One Faith, and that
cannot be the One Faith, which has not been the Faith
of the whole Church. And therefore it is ridiculous to
talk of such a Power in the Church of every Age, as to
make or declare new Articles of Faith, unless there be
Authority to make a new Church too in every Age;
but then how the Church should change its Faith in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Age, and yet continue one and the same Church, is
worth inquiry. As far as any Church has altered the
Faith of the Apostles and Primitive Christians, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a new Church, and a new Church, I think, is not
the same with the old; the Unity of the present Church,
considered as a Church, does not consist only in its U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
with it self, but with the Church also of former
Ages; for unless it be one with the Apostolick Churches,
it cannot be the One Church of Christ: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thô all the Christian World should at this Day
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42307:6"/>
unite in the Faith and Worship of the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi>
it would be as much divided from the One Church of
Christ, as it differs from the Faith and Worship of the
Primitive Church.</p>
               <p>I shall only observe here by the way, what a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
the Worship of Saints and the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> is to
the belief of One Church. For if the Church in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and in Earth be but One Church, then the most
glorious Saints in Heaven, not excepting the blessed
Virgin herself, are but Members of the same Body
with us, which makes it as absurd to Worship them
in Heaven, as it is for one Member of the same Body
on Earth to Worship another, for they are the same
Body still, and thô there is a great difference in honour
between the Members of the same Body, yet that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that is between them will not admit of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of any Member. For it is no Act of Communion
in the same Body, for one Member to Worship ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
To pay Divine Honours, to erect Temples and
Altars to the greatest Saints, advances them above the
degree of fellow-Members, and if they be not Fellow-Members
of the same Body, then the Church in Heaven
and in Earth is not One Church. From whence we may
learn who they are who divide the Unity of the Church,
they who command the Worship of Saints and the
Virgin, or those who refuse it. We believe the Church
in Heaven and Earth to be the One Body of Christ,
and that the most glorious Saints are but Members of
the same Body with us, and therefore not the Objects
of our Worship, but of our Brotherly Love and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
but those who Worship Saints destroy the Unity
of Christ's Body, by dividing the Church on Earth and
the Church in Heaven, for nothing is more contrary
to the sense of Mankind than to Worship those of our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42307:7"/>
own Communion. And therefore the natural Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of that Worship they pay to Saints is, that they
are not Members of the same Body with us, but are as
much above us, as the Object of our Worship is and
ought to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly,</hi> This Notion of Church-Unity, that it must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the whole Church, from the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
to the end of the World, as well that part of it,
which is already transplanted into Heaven, as that which
still sojourns on Earth, which is all but one Body, may
direct us, wherein to place this Unity of the Church,
which to be sure can consist in nothing, but what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the whole Church: any Notion of Unity,
which does not explain, how the whole Church is but
One, must be false, because the Unity of the Church
properly belongs to the whole, and not to a part. Now
as this Unity respects the whole Church, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
there should be any other Head of Unity, but
Christ; any other <hi>medium</hi> of Unity, but the Gospel-Covenant,
nor any other kind of Unity, but the Unity
of one Spiritual Body, Communion, or Society: that
we are all united by the Gospel-Covenant in One Body
to Christ, the one and Onely Head of the Universal
Church.</p>
               <p>1. The Unity of the Church must consist in its U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to some one Head. This is acknowledged by all
Christians, and therefore I need not prove it; and it is
as evident, that none can be the Head of the Universal
Church, but only Christ, and that for this plain rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because it is Union to Christ alone, which makes the
Christian Church. The Church is the Church of Christ,
and therefore he alone is the Head of his own Church:
This the Romanists themselves grant, that Christ
alone is the Head of his Church, and that the Bishop
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42307:7"/>
of <hi>Rome</hi> is only a vicarious Head, Christ's Vicar on
Earth. But when we speak of the Unity of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, part of which is translated to Heaven,
and part still militant on Earth, it must be united in
Christ alone; for as he needs no Vicar in Heaven, where
he himself is immediately present, so there can be no
Vicar on Earth, as a common Head of Unity for the
Church on Earth and in Heaven; and therefore the
Unity of the whole Church cannot consist in its U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to such a vicarious Head, as I observed before;
and then there can be no other Head of Unity but only
Christ.</p>
               <p>2. It is as evident also, that the only <hi>Medium</hi> or
Bond of this Union between Christ and the Church,
is the Gospel-Covenant: for that is the Foundation of
our relation to Christ: He is our Head and Husband,
our Lord and Saviour, we his Subjects, Disciples, Spouse,
and Body, by Covenant. And therefore the Sacraments
of the New Covenant, Baptism and the Lord's Supper,
are the Federal Rites of our Union to Christ: Baptism
is our Regeneration, or New Birth, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated
into his Body; in the Lord's Supper we spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
eat his Flesh and drink his Blood, which signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
and effects as intimate an Union to him, as there is
of our Bodies and the Food we eat; and this proves,
that there can be no other Head of Unity, but only
Christ, because the Gospel Covenant unites us to none
else: which I take to be St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s meaning, when he
reproves the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Schism: 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 12, 13.
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of
Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were
ye baptized in the name of Paul?</hi> That is, that there is
no other Head, to whom we can be united but
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42307:9"/>
only Christ, who purchased the Gospel-Covenant by his
Death, and into whose Name we are baptized; His
alone we are to whom we are united by Baptism, we
are in Covenant with none else, and therefore belong
to him alone: if they might have owned any other
Head besides him, who died for them, and into whose
Name they were baptized, if Christ had made <hi>Peter</hi>
the vicarious Head of Unity, as the Romanists pretend,
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument, against these Sidings and Factions,
that one said he was of <hi>Paul,</hi> another of <hi>Apollos,</hi> a third
of <hi>Cephas</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> had not been good, for at least those
who were united to <hi>Peter</hi> were in the right: but
St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew no other Head of Unity, but only Christ,
because the Gospel-Covenant, which is the only <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
and Bond of Union, unites us to no other Head,
and therefore those, who said they were of <hi>Peter,</hi> or
belonged to him, as their Head and Center of Unity,
which is the case of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> at this day,
were as great Schismaticks, as those who said they were
of <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Covenant extends to the whole Church,
and therefore unites the whole Church to Christ. For
those who are translated into Heaven are still united to
Christ by the same Covenant with the Church on
Earth. There are several Duties indeed of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
which the Saints in Heaven are exempted from,
because their state and condition there is above them.
Their Faith and Hope is turned into Sight and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
their Spiritual Warfare is accomplished, for
there is no Devil, nor Flesh, nor World to tempt them;
the Mystical Supper of our Lord is celebrated by them
not in external Symbols and Figures, but in a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
manner, in the immediate presence of the Lamb;
but thô the Duties of the Covenant change with their
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42307:9"/>
state and condition of life, yet the Covenant is the
same still; by this Covenant it is, that they are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and still expect the completion of their happiness
in the Resurrection of their Bodies immortal and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;
and by the same Covenant it is, that we hope,
when our Warfare is accomplished also to get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and to rise together with them, at the sound of the
last Trumpet: And therefore the whole Church in
Heaven and Earth is One, by being united to the same
Head by the same Covenant.</p>
               <p>3. The Unity then of the Universal Church can
consist in nothing but this, that the whole Church,
both in Heaven and Earth, is united in One Body to
Christ. For since there is no other Head of Unity
for the Church, but Christ, the formal reason of this
Unity must consist in the Union of the whole Church
to Christ, which makes the Universal Church the
<hi>One Body</hi> of Christ, and this is the Unity of the
Church. For I think it is no less than a demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the Unity of the Universal Church, which
is part in Heaven, and part on Earth, cannot be the
Unity of an organized Body, which must consist in
a regular Subordination of different Ranks and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of men, as the Church on Earth does: For the
Church on Earth and in Heaven, which is the One
Church of Christ, is no such one common governed
Society; and therefore the Unity of the Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
consist in the Unity of one External Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But how then is the whole Church but one Body?
Truly I know no other way, but that they are all u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
to Christ in the same Covenant, and all who are
thus united to him, Christ accounts his <hi>One</hi> Body.
Thus Christ, as bearing his Church, is compared to a
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42307:10"/>
Vine, all whose Branches, we know, are united only
in the Stock or Root, 15 <hi>John</hi> 1. and to an Olive-Tree,
11 <hi>Rom.</hi> 17. and to a Sheepfold, which consists
of single and individual Sheep, which are one Fold
only, because they are under one Shepherd, 10 <hi>John
16.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed, the Church is called also the Body,
and the Spouse of Christ, but as that relates to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal
Church, it does not signifie an organical Body
(though that the Church on Earth is also by Christ's
own institution, of which more hereafter) but it is so
called for mystical reasons, which I shall briefly explain
to you.</p>
               <p>1. Now I first observe, that the Relation between
Man and Wife is but an Emblem and Figure of that U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
which is between Christ and his Church. Hence
the Apostle exhorts Husbands <hi>to love their Wives even
as Christ loved his Church;</hi> and tells us of Marriage, <hi>It is
a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and his Church,
5</hi> Ephes. 25. 32.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>That to be the Body and the Spouse of Christ,
signifies the same thing. Hence the Apostle argues,</hi>
That men ought to love their Wives as their own bodies,
28 <hi>v. For</hi> no man ever hated his own flesh, but nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the Church, 29.
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his
bones, 30. <hi>So that the Wife is the Body, the very
Flesh of the Husband, and so is the Church of
Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. To understand this matter, why the Church is
called the Body and Spouse of Christ, we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
why the Wife is called the Body of the Man,
Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone; and the
reason of that is, because the Woman was formed out
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42307:10"/>
of the Man. God at first formed Man with an entire
humane Body, of the Dust of the Earth; and out of
Man, while he slept, he formed the Woman; who
though a distinct separate Person, yet was part of
the Man, Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone:
And this was a natural Marriage, for two were by
nature one Flesh; and this was the natural and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
reason of the Matrimonial Union. <hi>For this
cause shall a man leave his Father and Mother, and
cleave to his Wife, and they two shall be one Flesh.</hi>
For though other Women are not made as <hi>Eve</hi> was,
no more than other Men are made as <hi>Adam</hi> was,
yet the Woman being originally of the Man, the
reason holds as to the whole kind; and in subsequent
Marriages, a legal Ceremony and Contract does,
what a natural Formation did at first, that is, unites
two into one Flesh.</p>
               <p>Thus the blessed Jesus, out of great pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to fallen man, intending to marry us unto
himself, and thereby to recover us out of a state of
sin and misery, first marries our Nature to himself
by an hypostatical Union, as Man was created first,
and then the Woman formed out of him. Christ
took a humane Body of the substance of a pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
which signifies that it was an Espousable Nature
which he took, and was a Pledge, and Earnest, and
Medium of our Marriage to him. For though we
cannot be married immediately to the Divinity, yet
to a God Incarnate we may. For Marriage requires,
that Husband and Wife be of the same nature.</p>
               <p>But this is not enough, that the Husband and Wife
partake of the same Nature, but the Woman must
be formed out of the Man; which makes her Flesh
of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone. And thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42307:11"/>
the Church is formed out of the Body of
Christ, and is in a mystical sense his very Flesh and
Bones, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>We are members of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
of his flesh, and of his bones.</hi> For the Sufferings
of Christ in the flesh, gave life and being to the
Church; he purchast to himself a Church by his own
Bloud, that is, he formed to himself a Church out of his
broken Body, as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Body was broken, and a
Rib taken out of him to form the Woman. And
therefore as the Woman was made of the same Flesh
with <hi>Adam,</hi> so the Sufferings of Christ in his humane
nature purchased a Church not of Angels, but of Men,
of the same nature with himself; as the Apostle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves,
2 Heb. 16<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>For verily he took not on him the
nature of Angels, but he took on him the Seed of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham;
and therefore is not the Saviour of Angels, but
of men, is not married to the Angelical, but to the
humane nature.</p>
               <p>And to make the Analogie still more compleat; as
the Woman was formed out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s side, so was
the Church out of Christ's side; for when he was
pierced with the Souldiers Spear, there came out of
his side both <hi>Water and Bloud,</hi> 19 John 34. and the
Evangelist sets a peculiar remark upon it: <hi>He that
saw it bare record, and we know that his record is true:
and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe,
35</hi> v. and this is especially observed, and great weight
laid on it; 1 John 5. 6. <hi>This is he that came by water
and bloud, even Jesus Christ; not by water only, but by
water and bloud.</hi> This some think signifies no more,
but that it was a demonstration that he was truly
dead; in that his heart was wounded, where there is
a <hi>Capsula,</hi> called the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> which contains wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which being pierced, water came out together
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42307:11"/>
with bloud; but the water and bloud came out
distinct though from the same wound, which was
never known before, and cannot be done again by
the greatest Artist; and though this might be a
reason why St. <hi>John</hi> might take notice of it in his
Gospel, where he gave an account of his death, yet
it does not seem a sufficient reason why he should
lay such weight on it in his Epistles; <hi>This is he who
came by water and bloud, not by water only, but by
water and bloud:</hi> and therefore I doubt not but
the ancient Fathers were in the right, who tell us,
that the two Sacraments of the new Covenant flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of his side, which are the formation of this
spiritual Spouse his Church, the birth and the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of it; Baptism, and the Lords Supper,
which came from his wounded body, and have both
of them a peculiar respect to his Death and Passion.</p>
               <p>Thus we see the Church is called Christ's Body
and Spouse, for mystical reasons, because it is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of his broken Body, his Death and Sufferings
giving life and being to the Church: and therefore
it is but one Body, because all those who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
by his Bloud, and united to him by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
which is a kind of Marriage-Vow and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
are his Body and Spouse. And therefore the
Sacraments of the new Covenant, Baptism and the
Lords Supper, do no otherwise unite us to each
other, than they unite us all to Christ, which
makes us all one Body; or as the Apostle speaks,
with respect to the Lords Supper, <hi>For we being
many, are one bread and one body, for we are all
partakers of that one bread.</hi> We all partake of the
same Body of Christ, which is therefore called the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42307:12"/>
                  <hi>Communion of his Body and Bloud;</hi> and therefore we
all are but one Body: so that it is a vain thing to
inquire after any other Principle of Unity for the
whole Church, but the Union of all Christians to
Christ, who are one Body by their Union to one
Head.</p>
               <p>But it may be objected against this, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
the Church to the company of the Elect, who
are the mystical Body of Christ; that according to
this Notion, there can be no visible Church upon
Earth; for no man can tell who belongs to the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Body of Christ, which is made up only of true
and sincere Christians, and no man can see who they
are, without seeing their hearts. Now this is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
prejudice against any Notion, if it destroys the
visibility of the Church, which is so plainly taught
in Scripture, and does, for ought we know, unchurch
the greatest Member of visible Church-Members;
if the Church consist only of those who were elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from all eternity, and are in time called by the
Grace of God to a state of real Holiness and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and made the living Members of Christ's
Body, I cannot possibly see how there can be a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church on Earth; for this internal Grace which
makes a Church-Member is invisible, and therefore
Church-Members are invisible too, and then I fear,
the Church it self must be invisible, if all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it are invisible; for invisible Members cannot
make a visible Society: and to say, that the Field in
which the Corn and the Tares grow together, is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
will not make the Church visible, unless this
visible Field, as visible, be the Church, and then the
Tares as well as the Corn must be Church-Members:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42307:12"/>
for to see where the Corn grows, if we cannot see the
Corn, does not make the Corn visible; and if the
Corn only be the Church, invisible Corn cannot
make a visible Church. Which has made me often
wonder that some learned Protestants, and that of late
too, have so much insisted on this Notion, which
gives manifest advantage to their Adversaries; and
serves no end, that I know of, but what may better
be served without it.</p>
               <p>But the Union of the Church to Christ, which I
have now explained, is a visible Union; for we are
united to Christ by the Gospel-Covenant, and the
Covenant is visible, the Sacraments of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Baptism, and the Lords Supper, are visible;
the profession of Faith, and obedience to Christ, made
by these visible Sacraments, is visible also; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Church, which is united to Christ by a visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Covenant, visible Sacraments, and a visible Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
is visible also.</p>
               <p>But you'll say, can wicked men then be Members
of Christ's mystical Body? yes, no doubt but they
may in this World, if they can be in Covenant with
him. We are united by Covenant, and those who
are thus united, are Members of his Body, and Christ
has but one Body, which is his Church, and mystical
Spouse. And what absurdity is there in saying, that
men may be in Covenant with Christ, and not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
the conditions of the Covenant, nor obtain the
rewards of it, This no man will deny, but that
bad men, who live in visible Communion with the
Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who are baptized in the name of Christ, and
feast at his Table, are visibly in cove<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ant with him
for if the Sacraments of the Covenant do not prove
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42307:13"/>
that we are in covenant, no man can tell whether
he be in covenant or not. Now all that are in cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with Christ are his Body, and unless we can find
two Covenants and two Bodies for Christ, we must
grant that good and bad men in this World, are in
the same Covenant, and Members of the same Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
Our Saviour tells us, that there are some bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
in him which bear no fruit, but they are in
him for all that, though they shall be taken away,
and separated from him, 15 <hi>John</hi> 2. St. <hi>Paul</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> from Fornication, by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
that they are the Members of Christ:
<hi>Know ye not, that your bodies are the members of
Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and
make them members of a harlot? God forbid, 1 Cor. 6.
15.</hi> Which supposes, that such a thing may be done,
that the Members of Christ may be made Members
of a Harlot; and that supposes, that very bad men
may be Members of Christ's Body.</p>
               <p>But are not all the Members of Christ mystically
united to him? and can there be such a mystical U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between Christ and bad men? I answer, if by
mystical Union be meant, being united in the same
Life and Spirit, it is plain, that bad men are not thus
mystically united to Christ, for they are not living,
but dead Members of his Body, they are branches
that are in the Vine, but bear no fruit; and yet may
be Members of his mystical Body, which is so called,
not upon account of any mystical Union, (which
some men <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>alk of, of but no man could ever explain) but
for mystical reasons, as I have already shewed you.
Now if those mystical reasons, for which the Church
is called the Body of Christ, include wicked Professors,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42307:13"/>
and concealed Hypocrites, as well as truly good Men,
then I hope bad Men may be said to be the Members
of Christ's Mystical Body without such a Mystical
Union to him.</p>
               <p>Now I observed before, the Mystical Reason why
the Church is called the Body of Christ, Flesh of his
Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, is because he purchas'd
the Church with his own Blood; the Church is
formed out of his broken Body, as <hi>Eve</hi> was formed
out of the Body of <hi>Adam.</hi> And therefore if bad
Men; who are in Covenant with Christ, are the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
of his Blood, and have a Covenant-right to the
expiation of it, and all the benefits procured by it,
then they are the Members of his Mystical Body,
Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone. And me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
no man should deny, that those who are in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with Christ, should have a Covenant right
to the Expiation of his Death, and all the Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
purchas'd by his Blood; for otherwise we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, what it is to be in Covenant, if it confer
no right to the Priviledges of it: and yet no man
has a right to the Purchase of Christ's Blood, but
those, who are his Body; and therefore if bad
men may have such a Covenant-right, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they have, if they be in Covenant, then
they are by Covenant united to his Mystical
Body.</p>
               <p>If you object, that by this reason all Mankind
are Christ's mystical Body, for He died for all Men,
and therefore they are all the Purchase of his Blood,
and consequently they are his Mystical Body, which
is formed out of his broken Body: I answer, it is
true indeed, that in some sense Christ died for all,
<gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:42307:15"/>
because none are excluded from the Benefits of his
Death, who unite themselves to his Body by Faith
and Baptism; but yet he died for none, so as to give
them an immediate Right and Title to the Purchase
of his Blood; for his Purchase is confined to his
Church, which is his Body; <hi>He is the Saviour of
the Body; He loved his Church, and gave himself for
it.</hi> And therefore his Church only is his Mystical
Body, Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, and
the Sufferings of his Natural Body extend no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than his Mystical Body: and therefore Christ is
said to have <hi>reconciled both</hi> (Jew and Gentile) <hi>to God
in one body by the cross, 2. Ephes.</hi> 16. That is, he
has reconciled all both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who by
Faith and Baptism are united in his one Mystical
Body, to God by his Sufferings on the Cross. So
that we are not the Body of Christ, and cannot
be said to be the purchase of his Blood, till we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him by Covenant.</p>
               <p>This we may learn from that Analogy there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Law and the Gospel. The legal Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
especially that great Sacrifice on the Day of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation,
were typically of the Sacrifice of Christ, and
the Carnal <hi>Israel</hi> was a Type of the Spiritual <hi>Israel,</hi>
or of the Christian Church, now as the Virtue and
Expiation of Legal Sacrifices was applicable only to
the Carnal <hi>Israel,</hi> so the Expiation of Christ's Death
extends only to the Spiritual <hi>Israel,</hi> the Christian
Church, which is Christ's Mystical Body; which
one thing, if well considered, would answer all the
Difficulties, and silence those fierce Disputes, about
Universal Redemption. However this shews, what
difference there is between bad Christians, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42307:15"/>
world of Infidels; the first are visibly in Covenant
with Christ, and are the Purchase of his Blood, and
have a Covenant-right to the redemption of it, and
therefore are Members of his Mystical Body, for
none else have any right to his Sacrifice; the other
have no interest in him, nor relation to him. And
if we will not allow of this, I desire to know, who
those <hi>Children of the Kingdom</hi> are, that at the last day
shall be shut out.</p>
               <p>But is not our Mystical Union to Christ then an
Union of Spirits, a participation of his Nature and
Life, having his Spirit dwelling in us, being led by
the Spirit, and walking in the Spirit? I answer,
this is our Spiritual Union to Christ, this is to live
in him, to be quicken'd by him, but it is not our
Mystical Union, as that signifies such an Union, as
makes us Members of his Mystical Body; for that
in a strict proper sence is only a Covenant-relation:
every Member of Christ's Mystical Body ought to
partake of his Life and Spirit, or else they are
onely dead and rotten Members, which shall be
cut off, and shall never inherit Eternal Life;
but such dead Members are Members still, till
they are cut off, either by Church Censures in
this World, or by the Sentence of Christ in the
next.</p>
               <p>This Participation of the Life and Spirit of Christ
is not our Mystical Union to Christ, but the effect
of it. We cannot receive the influences of Life
and Grace from Christ, till we are united to him,
and made the Members of his Body; for his Spirit
onely quickens and animates his own Body; and
we are united to his Body by Covenant, and by the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42307:16"/>
Sacraments of it, which convey this Divine Life
and Spirit to us; and therefore Baptism is our
Regeneration, or New Birth, the beginnings of a
New Life, because it incorporates us into Christ's
Mystical Body, which puts us under the influences
and communications of his Life and Spirit: as when
a branch is engrafted into a stock, it receives nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
and life from it. So that these divine and
supernatural influences are consequent upon our Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to Christ, and tho' all, who are united to Christ,
have these influences of Grace, as the root naturally
communicates its sap and juices to all its branches,
yet all do not improve it, do not digest it into prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of life and action, do not bring forth fruits
worthy of it, like dead and withered branches, who
cannot receive the sap and nourishment, which
ascends from the root, and would quicken them,
were not its entrance stopt and hindred; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this, they are members and branches
still, though dead and fruitless: There is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
indeed had of them, Christ knows them not,
and does not reckon them as his, and therefore the
Description and Characters of the Church in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
are such as belong onely to living Members, to
those who are renewed and sanctified, and quicken'd
by the Divine Spirit; but yet they do belong to
Christ's Mystical Body, tho' they are in it onely, as a
dead Branch is in the Vine.</p>
               <p>But how can the Church on Earth, and the Church
in Heaven be one Church and one Body, if the
Church on Earth has such corrupt and rotten Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in it? for the Church in Heaven has none but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
and holy Members. I answer, the same Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42307:16"/>
makes them the same Church, and the same
Body of Christ, and that there are bad Men in
the Church on Earth, and none but Saints in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
does not prove, that they are two Churches,
but that they are in two very different states. Of
right, none but sincere believers, and truly pious
men, ought to be Members of the Church on Earth,
as well as in Heaven; but the government of the
Church, the receiving in, and casting out of the
Church, being intrusted with Men, who cannot see
the Heart, or who are not careful in the Exercise of
Discipline to preserve the Purity of the Church, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Hypocrites may be received into the Church, and
those, who are openly Prophane may not be cast
out of it; but in the other World Christ makes the
distinction, and separates the Chaff from the Wheat,
and therefore the Church in Heaven can consist only
of good Men, because bad Men can find no admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
there. And besides this, it is agreeable enough
to the state of the Church on Earth, and indeed
cannot well be otherwise, that good and bad Men
should be intermixt in it; because it is a state of
Tryal and Discipline, of Growth and Improvement:
Tho' bad Men, as that signifies Hypocrites and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers,
if they were known, ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the Church, yet if they be, by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of Grace, and the Instructions of the Word,
and the Prayers of the Church, and the Examples
and Conversations of good Men, and the prudent
Exercise of Discipline, they may be reclaimed to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and become living Members of Christ's Body;
those who were dead before may recover a New Life
by being engratted into this Heavenly Vine: nay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42307:17"/>
tho' all men are not equally wicked, yet no
Man has this Divine Life, but onely from Christ, and
the communications of his Grace, which he cannot
receive from Christ, till he be united to him; and
therefore the Apostles required no other qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Baptism, but onely Faith; the very worst
of Men, who believed in Christ, and profess'd obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him, were received into the Church by
Baptism, and put under the Influences of Grace,
without expecting till they had first reformed their
Lives; which, besides the Authority of the Apostles,
seems to me much more agreeable to the Gospel-Dispensation,
than that Discipline which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
used in the Church, when they did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
baptize those, who profess'd to believe in
Christ, but kept them in the state of Catechumens
a great while, till they were instructed in the
Principles of Christian Faith, and had given proof of
a holy and vertuous life; which is to expect, that
men should become new creatures, before they are
born again, that they should walk in the Spirit,
before they have received the Spirit in Baptism, that
they should bring forth Fruit, before they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted
into this Spiritual Vine. Now if Men,
who have lived very wicked Lives, may be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Baptism, upon their profession of Faith and
Repentance, that in this Laver of Regeneration they
may wash away all their Sins, and become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and receive the Spirit of Grace and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to reform their Lives, this shews, that the very
Constitution of the Church on Earth is such; that
there may be very bad Men in it, unless all, who
are baptized should infallibly prove good Men: For
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42307:17"/>
bad Men, who profess the Faith of Christ, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
of their Sins, have a right to Baptism,
where they must receive Grace to mortifie and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
their Lusts, and renew their Natures, and yet
if after Baptism they resist the Grace and Spirit of
God, they will continue bad Men still, and this the
Ministers of the Church can never know, whether
they will or not. Nay the Gospel-Covenant admits
the Children of Christian-Parents to Baptism, and it
is impossible to know, how those, who are baptized in
their Infancy, will prove, when they are Men: and yet
these are all Members of the Church, and the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Body of Christ, at least till they are cut off
by the Censures of the Church: and there is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
in this, if the Governours of the Church
were but so strict in their Discipline, as to prevent
all Publick Scandals: for since the Church on Earth
is the School and Nursery of Vertue, where bad Men
may be reformed, and become Saints, since Christ is
that Spiritual Vine, from whom alone we can receive
the communications of a Divine Life, it is very fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that all believers should be received into the
Church, and incorporated into Christ's Body, for it
cannot be known, whether they will prove good or
bad Men, fruitful or barren Branches, till they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the sap and fatness of the Root, till they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such communications of Grace, as my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
them into a Divine Nature. And therefore to
say, that none but real Saints are Members of the
Church on Earth, is to make no difference between
a School of Tryal, Exercise, and Discipline, and
the state of perfect and consummate Souls; between
a state of Warfare, where the Victory is doubtful,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42307:18"/>
and the triumphant company of Conquerors; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those, who run in a Race, and those, who
have won the Prize; for such a difference there is
between the state of the Church on Earth, and in
Heaven. We cannot run this Spiritual Race, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
we be in the Church, for there is no Prize, no
Crown, to run for out of it. And therefore those
who lose, as well as those who win the Prize, must be
in the Church, and Members of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They are all in
the same Covenant, that if they overcome, they shall
receive the Crown: good men conquer in this
World, and triumph in Heaven; bad men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered,
and they lose their Crown, and this makes
the separation and difference between the Church in
Heaven and Earth; in Heaven there are none but
those, who have conquered; on Earth all, who run
in the same Race, and are engaged in the same War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
are mixt together in the same Body and Society:
those who conquer, and those who are conquered, are
of the same Company on Earth, but none but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors
are crowned in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus I have shewed, wherein the Unity of the
Church consists, that the whole Church both in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth are united to Christ in the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
which makes it his One Mystical Body: and
it was necessary to lay the foundation here; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
this it is impossible to understand, what the Unity
of the Church on Earth means, most of the mistakes
in this matter being plainly owing to that first and
fundamental mistake about the true Notion of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Unity, as that includes the Unity of the Universal
Church, part of which is translated to Heaven, and
part still militant on Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:42307:18"/>
Those who have been aware of this, that the
Church in Heaven and Earth is but one Church, have
hence concluded, that the Catholick Church is only
the number of the Elect; that none but truly good
men, who are renewed and sanctified by the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
are Members of Christ's mystical Body; which
makes the Church on Earth as invisible to us, as the
Church in Heaven. Others, when they talk of the
Unity of the Church, never think of the Church in
Heaven, and therefore advance such a Notion of
Church-unity, as excludes the Church in Heaven, as
if the Church on Earth were the whole Church of
Christ; or that the Church in Heaven and Earth
were not one Church, or that the Notion of Church-unity
must not relate to the whole Church, but only
to one part of it. Thus, as I observed before, the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi>
do, who place the Unity of the Church in its
Union and Subjection to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> which can
concern only that part of the Church which is on
Earth, for the Church in Heaven is not under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Others considering that the Unity of the
Church consists in the Union of all the parts and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of it to Christ, have no regard at all to the Unity
of the Church on Earth, as that also is one Body and
Communion; and therefore it will be time now to
apply this Notion of Church-unity to the Unity of
the Church on Earth.</p>

               <head type="sub">Concerning the Vnity of the Catholick
Church on Earth.</head>
               <p>IF the whole Church be one, to be sure every part
of it must be one with the whole, and therefore
one with it self, with that same kind of Unity which
belongs to the whole. So that the Essential Unity
of the Church on Earth, that which makes a Church
and makes it one, is that all true Churches are Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the One mystical Body of Christ, as being all
united to him, as to their Head, by the same Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
So that whatever makes a Church a true
Church, makes it a Member of the One Catholick
Church, or of the One Body of Christ. And here
comes in what the Apostle makes essential to this
<hi>One Body; One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism,</hi> 4 Eph.
5. which signifies what I said before, being united to
Christ in the same Covenant. For Christ is the <hi>One
Lord,</hi> to whom we are united; the <hi>One Faith</hi> is the
condition of this Covenant, and the <hi>One Baptism</hi> is
the faederal Rite of it, or the Sacrament of our Union
to Christ. Where this is not, there is no Church;
and where this is, there is but one Church; how
many particular Churches, or distinct Communions
soever this Church is divided into: From whence it
as evident, that there never can be more than one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42307:19"/>
Church in the World: for those Nominal Churches,
which have not the same Lord, the same Faith, the
same Baptism, are no Churches; and all that have,
are but one: Which makes it a ridiculous Triumph
of the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> as if we Protestants did not
believe one Catholick Church, or could not tell where
to find it, when we profess to believe but One
Church, and that all true Churches are Members of
this One Church.</p>
               <p>For it is plain from this account, that though all the
Churches in the World were united in one Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Body, yet this external visible Union is not
the thing which makes them the one Body of Christ:
They are one Body by being all united to one my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Head, the Lord Jesus Christ, not by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
and visible Union to each other; this external
Union is a Duty which all Christians and Christian
Churches are bound to observe, as far as possibly
they can; but all true Christians and Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
are the One Body of Christ, whether they be
thus visibly united or not. But for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
this matter, we must consider,

                     <item>II. What the Nature and Unity of a particular

                     <item>III. What that Unity and Communion is, which

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:42307:20"/>
I. The true Notion of the Catholick Church on
Earth: Now it is evident from what I have already
discoursed, that the true Notion of a Church is the
<hi>caetus Fidelium,</hi> or the company of the Faithful, of
those who profess the true Faith of Christ, and are
united to him by Baptism. There can be no other
Notion of the Universal Church in Heaven and Earth,
but the whole company and family of the Faithful,
who are united to Christ by covenant, and are his
mystical Body in the sense above explained: And if
the Universal Church in Heaven and Earth be the
whole company of the Faithful, the Catholick Church
on Earth must be the whole number of the Faithful
on Earth; for we must still retain the same Notion
of a Church, where the whole consists of universal
parts, for there every part has the same nature with
the whole.</p>
               <p>I know indeed of late the Clergy have in a great
measure monopolized the Name of the Church,
whereas in propriety of Speech, they do not belong
to the definition of a Church: They are Members of
the Church, as they are themselves of the number of
the Faithful; and they are the Governours of the
Church, as they have received Authority from
Christ the Supream Lord and Bishop of the Church;
but they are no more the Church, than the King is
his Kingdom, or the Shepherd his Flock: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
St. <hi>Paul</hi> expresly distinguishes the Church from
the Apostles and Ministers of it; 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. God
hath set some in the Church, first Apostles, secondarily
Prophets, thirdly Teachers, after that Miracles, then
Gifts of Healing, Helps, Governments, diversities of
Tongues.</hi> These are placed in the Church, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42307:20"/>
edification, and good government of it;
and therefore are of a distinct consideration from the
Church in which they are placed. Thus 4 <hi>Eph. 11,
12. He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and
some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Teachers, for the
perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for
the edifying of the Body of Christ;</hi> that is, the Church
of Christ: which is therefore distinguished from the
Pastors and Teachers of it. Thus in directing his
Epistles to several Churches, he gives us the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2. Vnto the Church of
God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in
Christ Jesus, called to be Saints, with all that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
place call upon the Name of Jesus Christ our Lord,
both theirs and ours:</hi> that is, the whole company of
the Faithful. 1 <hi>Ephes. 1. Paul an Apostle of Jesus
Christ by the will of God, to the Saints which are at
Ephesus, and to the Faithful in Christ Jesus:</hi> Which
is the true definition of a Church. 1 <hi>Col. 2. To the
Saints and faithful Brethren in Christ, which are at
Coloss.</hi> And 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. he expresly distinguishes the
Saints or Church, as that signifies the company of
the Faithful from the Bishops and Deacons: <hi>To all
the Saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with
the Bishops and Deacons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Learned <hi>Launoy</hi> has produced various Texts
of Scripture for this definition of the Church,<note place="margin">Johan. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noius Nicolao Gatinaeo, Ep. 13. <hi>Vol.</hi> 8.</note> that
it is the company of the Faithful; and has proved
by the Testimony of the Fathers in all Ages, even
down to the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> it self, that this was
the received Notion of the Church, till it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by <hi>Canisius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine; Canisius</hi> puts Christ's
Vicar into the definition; that the Church is the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42307:21"/>
visible collection of all baptized Believers, under one
Head, Christ in Heaven, and his Vicar on Earth;
which makes the Church a Monarchy. <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
defines the Church to be a company of men united
together by the profession of the same Christian
Faith, and the Communion of the same Sacraments,
under the government of lawful Pastors, but chiefly
of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the one Vicar of Christ
on Erath; which makes the Church a kind of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tempered Monarchy; the government of
Bishops, and the Pope as Supream Vicar: whereas
before these men, neither Pastors nor Bishops, much
less the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> were ever put into the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
definition of a Church: for as for St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
definition, I shall account for it hereafter.</p>
               <p>And indeed it stands to reason, that they should
not, for Pastors and Bishops are set over the Church,
are Overseers of the Flock, to instruct and govern
it, and therefore must be distinguished from the
Church which they govern: The Church is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Body of Christ, which is in subjection to Christ
the Head; but the Bishops and Pastors of the Church,
considered as such, represent the Head, and not the
Body; for they receive their Power and Authority
from Christ, and act in his place and stead: as he
tells them after his Resurrection, <hi>As my Father hath
sent me, so send I you,</hi> 20 John 21. And, <hi>He that
receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth
me, receiveth him that sent me, 10 Matth.</hi> 40. and
13. <hi>John</hi> 20. And therefore as Christ the Head is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from his Body, so are those also who act
under the Head, and represent and exercise his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in the Church; as private Believers, they are the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42307:21"/>
Members of the Church; as Church-Governours,
they are the Vicars of Christ.</p>
               <p>Now from hence I shall observe some few things,
the use of which we shall afterwards better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
               <p>As 1. That Bishops and Pastors are not the
Church, but the Governours of the Church: and
therefore the Promises made to the Church, do not
belong to the Bishops of the Church; as that <hi>the
gates of Hell shall not prevail against it:</hi> which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
proves, that the Church shall never totally fail,
but does not prove, that the Bishops, or any Bishop
of the Church, shall be Infallible. For the Bishops
are not the Church: there are distinct Promises to
the Church, and to the Pastors and Ministers of it,
and they ought to be kept distinct; which will put an
end to a great many Controversies between us and
the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus if St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim.</hi>
3. 15. calls the Church <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth,</hi>
whatever that signifies, it belongs to the Church, or
to the company of the Faithful, not meerly to the
Pastors and Bishops of it: and therefore the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of the Pope or General Council can never be
proved from it, though <hi>the Pillar and Ground of Truth</hi>
should signifie Infallibility.</p>
               <p>Thus whatever Authority Popes or General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
may challenge in matters of Faith, yet if they
decree any thing contrary to the common Faith of
Christians, their Decrees are not the Faith of the
Church, but the Faith of Popes and General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
who are not the Church, though they are the
Governours of it: and yet under this venerable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42307:22"/>
Name of the Catholick Church, every packt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle
challenges an indisputable Authority to its
Decrees.</p>
               <p>2. Nay, as Bishops are not the Catholick Church,
so neither are they the Representatives of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; much less is any one Bishop the whole
Catholick Church virtual. The Office of a Bishop
is not to represent, but to govern the Church, and
therefore Bishops are not the Churches Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
by Institution, no more than the King is the
Representative of his Kingdom: How then do they
come to be the Churches Representatives? Did all
the Christians in the World, who are the Catholick
Church, ever intrust them with this Power? Did
they ever resign up their Faith into the hands of their
Bishops? This never was done, and yet no man has
a Representative but by his own consent; and if it
could be done, Bishops then must sit in Council, not
only as Bishops, but as Lay Representatives, if two
such different capacities are not inconsistent; and yet
Bishops have challenged this Authority only as Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
and excluded the Laity, nay Presbyters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
from any Votes; and therefore such Councils
of Bishops, who acted only as Bishops, could not be
the Representatives of the Catholick Church. In
matters of Discipline and Government, Bishops act
not as Representatives, but Governours of the Church,
by that Authority which they have received, not
from the People, but from Christ; and their Decrees
and Constitutions about such matters, have a sacred
and venerable Authority, when they do not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
any divine Laws and Institutions. But Bishops
have no Authority over the Faith of the Church,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42307:22"/>
nay the Church herself has no Authority to alter the
Faith, and therefore can give no such Authority to
her Bishops; however, if she could, she never did,
and therefore no Council of Bishops can be the Church-representative
in defining Articles of Faith. As Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are the Supreme Pastors and Teachers of the
Church, they may declare, what the Faith is, and
agree what Doctrines shall be taught in their Churches,
and consent to censure and excommunicate those,
who will not profess to believe as they do; but if
they make any Decrees contrary to the common
Faith of Christians, no Christian is bound to believe
them, nor is ever the worse for their Anathema's
and Excommunications; and it is a ridiculous thing
for them to call this the Faith of the Catholick Church,
which is only the Decrees and Definitions of some
Bishops in it; who are far enough from being the
Catholick Church. And this I think sufficiently
proves, that the most general Council, that ever was,
may err, and yet the Catholick Church not err; for
Bishops are not the Catholick Church, nor so much
as the Representatives of it: and therefore could
it be proved, that the Catholick Church could
not err, this would not prove the Infallibility of
a General Council, which is not the Church; for
the Faith may still be preserved pure and uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
among private Christians, even when General
Councils err.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> I observe farther, that the whole Catholick
Church on Earth is not one organized Body; for it is
only the whole company of the faithful, and no Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Ministers or Pastors belong to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it; and yet unless some Oecumenical Pastor
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42307:23"/>
be essential to the Notion and Definition of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, it cannot be one organized Body.
The Catholick Church indeed is organized by parts,
that is, the whole Company of the Faithful are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed
into particular Bodies under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of particular Bishops, which makes a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church, and is essential to the definition of it,
of which more presently; but the Catholick Church
itself is the whole Company of the Faithful, who are
united in one Body to Christ only, who is the only
Head of his Church. Now hence it evidently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</p>
               <p>1. That no organized Church can be the Catholick
Church, nor the Bishop of it an Oecumenical Pastor;
because the Catholick Church is not organiz'd, but
every organized Church is a particular Church. Which
shews how vain the Pretences of the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
are to be the Catholick Church, and of the Pope of
<hi>Rome</hi> to be the Universal Bishop.</p>
               <p>2. It as evidently follows, that there neither is,
nor can be any visible Tribunal of the Catholick
Church, which shall be the Center of Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
and have Authority over all particular
Churches in Matters of Faith, and Worship, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
For the Catholick Church being no orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
Body, it has no Authority, and can have no Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.</p>
               <p>1. It has no Authority. For the whole Company
of the Faithful, which is the true Notion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, are the Mystical Body of Christ, and
in subjection to him, as a Wife is subject to her
Husband. The Catholick Church is made up of
particular and individual Christians, who are all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42307:23"/>
immediately united to Christ their Head, and are
made one in him; and though Bishops as the
Ministers of Christ, have received Authority from him
to govern the Church, which they exercise in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Churches, over which they are placed, yet
as Members of the Catholick Church, they are not
considered as Bishops, but as private Christians: for it
is not their Authority in the Church, but their Union
to Christ, which makes them Members of his Body,
and thus they are united to Christ no otherwise then
all other private Christians are. Now if the Chatho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church be only a company of private and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Christians, united immediately to Christ, and
made one Body in him, the Catholick Church has no
more Authority, than particular Christians have,
which is none at all. The Catholick Church is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christ by a belief of his Gospel, obedience to
his Laws, and a participation of his Spirit, which is a
state of perfect and absolute subjection to him, and
therefore can have no Authority to alter the Faith, to
make a new Creed, or a new Gospel, which would
be to have power over Christ, not to be subject to
him. To be sure, unless we will grant this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to every particular Christian, the Catholick
Church cannot have it, which is only the whole
multitude of particular Christians, who are united
singly to Christ, and made One Body in him; and
therefore are not such a Body, as can make a new
Faith, and new Laws, but are made One Body by
embracing the same Faith, which they must receive
from Christ, but have no Authority to make; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their receiving this Faith unites them into One
Body in Christ, and they continue One Body in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42307:24"/>
Christ, no longer than they profess this Faith, and
therefore never can have Authority to change it:
where a multitude of Men unite themselves into
One Body or Civil Society, to form and model
their own Government, and to make Laws for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
there the whole Authority is in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and they may make and alter and repeal Laws
as they please: but where a Society is formed by a
voluntary submission of single and particular Persons
to known and stated Laws, and no man can be of
this Society without submission to these Laws, nor
continue longer in it, than he does submit to them,
it is a contradiction to say, that such a Body of Men
have any power over the Laws, because it is only
their submission to such Laws, which make them
such a Society: The whole Society in this case have
no more Authority than a single Man, for they are
not a Society for Government, but for Obedience
and Subjection.</p>
               <p>Christ indeed has placed an Authority in his Church
for the Instruction and Government of it, but an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<hi>in the Church,</hi> and the Authority <hi>of the Church,</hi>
are two very different things. The first signifies the
Authority of Christ, who is the Head; the second
is the Authority of the Body, which is the Church,
the Head has Authority over his Church, and may
appoint what Ministers he pleases to exercise this
Authority, but the Church has no Authority at all,
no more than the Body has, which is subject to the
Head.</p>
               <p>This may be thought a very nice distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Authority <hi>in the Church,</hi> and the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<hi>of the Church,</hi> but it is as useful, as it is true.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42307:24"/>
For thô the Authority of Christ must be much more
sacred and venerable, than the Authority of the
Church, whatever Authority it were supposed to have,
yet the name of the Catholick Church is thought
much more venerable than the name of Bishops, thô
they are the Ministers of Christ; and therefore those,
who would impose upon the Faith of Christians,
talk of nothing less than the Authority of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, which sounds very big, and frights
people into a submission. While they pretend only
the Authority of Christ's Ministers, private Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
make bold to examine their Commission, and
how far their Authority reaches, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d whether they
do not prevaricate in the exercise of this Authority,
as it is possible Ministers may do; but the name of
the Catholick Church strikes all dead, for who dare
oppose the Decrees of the Catholick Church? which
is to condemn the whole Catholick Church of Error
or Heresie; who dares separate from the Catholick
Church? which must be an unpardonable Schism, and
a state of Damnation; since it is universally agreed,
that there is no salvation to be had out of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church; and thus when a packt Conventicle of
Schismaticks and Hereticks usurp to themselves the
name of the Catholick Church, they impose upon
Christians under so venerable a disguise, and enslave
them to their own Dictates; but now all these A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>musements
vanish, when we remember, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church has no Authority; that whatever the
Authority of Bishops in or out of Council be, it is
not the Authority of the Church, but the Authority
of Christ, and it is not his Authority neither, when
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42307:25"/>
they exceed their Commission, and teach such things
as he has given them no Authority to teach; and
therefore we may reject such a Council of Bishops,
without condemning the Catholick Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their communion, without separating from
the Catholick Church.</p>
               <p>And this very consideration, that the Catholick
Church has no Authority, and therefore cannot inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
in Matters of Faith, nor alter the Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions
of our Saviour, is little less than a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that there is no Authority <hi>in the Church</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do it. For the Bishops and Pastors of the
Church, as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 words">
                     <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Christ's Ministers, so they are
themselves Members of the Catholick Church; now
as they are Members of the Catholick Church, they
must receive nothing but what Christ has taught; for
the Church is founded on the Faith of Christ, and
has no Authority to alter it: Now is it imaginable,
that Bishops as private Christians and Members of
the Catholick Church are obliged to believe nothing
but what Christ has taught, and yet as Bishops, or
Christ's Ministers, have Authority to teach, what
Christ has not taught? that is, that as Bishops they
have Authority to teach that, which as private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
they themselves must not believe, if they will
continue Members of the Catholick Church: nay,
can we imagine, that Christ has given Authority to
his Ministers to teach that, which the Catholick
Church must not receive? for if the Catholick
Church has no Authority, it must no more receive
new Doctrines, than make them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:42307:25"/>
I know indeed, no body will pretend to an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of making new Articles of Faith, but only of
declaring what the Faith is; but this is the very
same thing, if this Authority of Declaring be such
as to oblige all people to believe such Declarations
without any Dispute or Examination; for then
they may make a new Faith under a pretence of
declaring the old; as we see the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> has
done, which has declared such Doctrines, as the
Christian Church was a stranger to before: and there
is no difference, that I know of, between declaring
and making an Article of Faith, which was neither
declared, nor made before.</p>
               <p>And therefore Christian Bishops and Pastors have
no such Authority either to make or to declare Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Faith, as can oblige all Christians to believe
it meerly upon their Definitions and Declarations:
It is their Office to Preach the Gospel, to convince
and perswade gainsayers by Scripture and Reason,
which obliges all Christians diligently and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
to attend to their Instructions, but yet
leaves every man at liberty to judge, whether
they Preach the Gospel of Christ, or their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> That the Catholick Church has no Authority,
is evident from this also, that it has no visible Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
wherein to exercise this Authority. For the
Catholick Church is nothing else but the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
or multitude of individual Christians, who are
all singly united to Christ, and made One Body in
him, and considered as the Catholick Church are not
the One Body of Christ, nor can be, under any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:42307:26"/>
notion. So that had the Catholick Church any
Authority, it could be exercised only by the whole
multitude of Christians, for nothing else is the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and this is as impossible, as it is for
the whole multitude of Christians to meet together
in one place.</p>
               <p>But cannot the Catholick Church meet and act by
its Representatives, as Kingdoms and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths
do?</p>
               <p>I answer; I have already proved, that all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of the Church, much less any one Bishop, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
represent the Catholick Church; for as Bishops
they are not the Church, but the Governours of it
under Christ; and no man ever yet thought of any
other Representatives for the Church; and it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>de facto,</hi> that there are no other Representatives;
for the whole multitude of Christians never did make
choice of any such Representatives, and no man can
be represented but by his own consent: and if there
could be any such Representatives made by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous
Vote of all the Christians in the World,
(which I think is morally impossible) yet then
the highest and most soveraign Authority in the
Church would be derived from the People, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I
suppose, the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> will not very well like.</p>
               <p>Nay indeed it is absolutely impossible, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church should be represented; for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church is the whole multitude of Christians,
considered as the whole company or multitude; now
a multitude as a multitude can never be represented
by any thing but itself, there can be no formal, nor
virtual multitude, but the whole entire number.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42307:26"/>
The Catholick Church signifies all Christians, and
if you leave out any of the number, it is not all,
and therefore is not the Catholick Church. Now
if the Catholick Church have any Authority, it
must have it as it is the Catholick Church, that is,
as it is the whole company of Christians; for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Christians have no such Authority, as all
men grant; and therefore that which destroys the
Catholick Church, must destroy its Authority too,
and any thing less than all, makes it cease to be
Catholick; and therefore the Catholick Church can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be represented by a few of the whole number,
because a few are not all, and therefore not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church. It is a different case indeed, when
every particular man has an original right and share
in the Power, and the whole power is not formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seated in the whole Body, for then it may by
common consent be contracted into one or more
hands, by particular mens giving up their share in
the Government, as some fancy that civil Societies
were first formed; but where the power is formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seated in the whole, and not in particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
as the Authority of the Catholick Church must
be, if it be the Authority of the Church considered as
Catholick, there it is evident the Authority must
continue in the whole, and can by no consent be put
into a few hands; and then it is impossible that the
Catholick Church can have any Representatives, nor
consequently any visible Tribunal.</p>
               <p>And yet that Dispute between the <hi>Church of Rome</hi>
and some Protestant Divines, which is managed
with so much warmth and zeal, about the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42307:27"/>
visibility of the Church, issues in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
about a visible Tribunal of the Catholick
Church; for nothing else will do the Protestant
Cause any hurt, or the Popish Cause any good.
We do say, and we may safely say, that there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
has been, and ever will be a Visible Church;
for while there are any men, who visibly profess
Christianity, there will be a visible Church: And
what then? what then? Why then you must hear
the Church; then you must submit to the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church; then you must believe as the
Church believes, and receive your Faith from the
Decrees and Definitions of the Church: But pray
why so? Has every visible Church this Authority?
No; but the Catholick Church has. Suppose that;
but how shall I speak with the Catholick Church,
which is dispersed over all the World, and is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the whole number of Christians all
the World over? Now it seems impossible for me
to speak with all the Christians in the World, and
to know what their Belief is in all matters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
and though the Catholick Church is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
and part of it is to be seen in <hi>England,</hi> and
part in <hi>Holland,</hi> and part in <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c. yet no
man can see it all together, nor speak with all the
Christians in the World together; and therefore tho'
the Catholick Church be visible, it cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
any one controversie, unless there be some
visible Catholick Tribunal, from which we must
receive the Faith of the whole Church: This the
Papists assert, and make the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> to be
that visible Catholick Church, or visible Tribunal
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42307:27"/>
of the Catholick Church, to which all Christians
are bound to submit. Now besides what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved, that the Catholick Church neither
has, nor can have any such visible Tribunal, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
such a thing might be, yet this Dispute about
the visibility of the Church, is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
for though the Church be visible, it does not
hence follow, that the Catholick Church has such
a visible Tribunal, to which all Christians must
submit; and if the visibility of the Church does
not prove one Supream Catholick Tribunal, what
do the Papists get by the Churches visibility, or
what do the Protestants lose by it?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is a visible Church, and so
is the <hi>Church of England;</hi> and if meer visibility give
this Authority to a Church, the <hi>Church of England</hi>
has as good Authority as the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> because
it is as visible a Church.</p>
               <p>4. In the next place I observe, that the essential
Unity of the Catholick Church is not an external
and visible Union of an organized Body, because the
Catholick Church it self is not an organized Body.
There is and can be but one Catholick Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the whole company of Christians is this Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church; but then the essential Unity of the
Catholick Church does not consist in an external
and visible Union of all Christians, which is the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of civil Societies, of Kingdoms, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
and other inferiour Corporations, which
are united under one visible Government, which
knits and tyes them together, as Nerves and Sinews
do the Members of the natural Body; but though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42307:28"/>
there be an external and visible Union in and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
particular Churches, of which more presently,
yet the Unity of the Catholick Church consists only
in the Union of all Christians to Christ, which makes
them his one mystical Body.</p>
               <p>This is a very material point in opposition to the
Pretensions of the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who will needs
be the Supream and Oecumenical Pastor, and Head
of Unity to the Catholick Church; and though the
Christian World never owned him so, as has been
abundantly proved by learned men, especially by
the Learned Dr. <hi>Isaac Barrow</hi> in his Treatise of the
Popes Supremacy, which is a sufficient confutation
of such a Claim, yet it will be of great use to shew
from the Nature of the Catholick Church, and the
essential Unity of it, that it cannot be so; and there
are several considerations, which will make this very
evident.</p>
               <p>1. That there is no other Head for the whole Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church on Earth to be united to, but only
Christ: for the Catholick Church is the whole
company of Christians; and to whom can the
whole company of Christians be united, but only
to Christ? For the whole Clergy, as well as Laiety,
are included in the Notion of the Catholick Church,
in the whole company of Christians; and therefore
unless you can find out a Bishop who is not of the
number of Christians, (and such an one would be a
very monstrous Head for the Christian Church) he
cannot be the Head, because he is a Member of the
Catholick Church, and must himself, with the rest
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42307:28"/>
of Christians be united to the Head: Which I think
is a demonstration that no Bishop can be the Head
of the Catholick Church, because it is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be the Head and a Member of the same
Body. A Bishop is the Pastor and Governour of a
particular Church, and a Member of the Universal
Church; but to be the Head of the Universal Church,
of which he himself is a Member, is a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>2. Nor can the essential Unity of the Church
consist in our Union to any other Head but Christ,
because it is our Union to Christ alone, which makes
the Church; and that which makes the Church,
must make it one; for what does not belong to
the essence of a thing, cannot be the principle of
an essential Unity. It is the Church of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is united to him, and to him only, by Faith
and the Christian Sacraments; and therefore it is
the One Church of Christ, because the whole Church
is united to him, and to him only, as it must be,
if no other Union can make a Church; and where
there is but one Head of Union, there can be but
One Body. No other Union can make a Church,
and therefore no other Union can be essential to the
Unity of the Church.</p>
               <p>3. And therefore though our Saviour had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
an Universal Pastor, as the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
pretends to be, yet he could not have been the
Head of Unity to the Catholick Church; he had
in that case been the Supream Governour, whom all
Christians had been bound to obey, nay more than
that, he had been the Center of Church-Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42307:29"/>
to all Christians; which is the external and
visible Unity of the Church, when all Christians
live in the same Communion, like one Houshold and
Family. But there is a vast difference between the
essential Unity of the Church, and the external Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of it in a visible Communion among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
between being one and living in Unity; U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
to Christ alone makes the Church one, but the
exercise of this Unity in a visible Communion, is a
Duty which results from our Unity, and must be
expressed in such ways as Christ has prescribed, of
which more anone; and had Christ appointed an
Universal Pastor, communion with, and subjection
to, this Universal Pastor had been necessary to the
external Unity of Church-communion, but yet had
not been that which makes the Church One, which
is one before and without it; the not distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of which, has occasioned great mistakes in this
matter, as will appear in the process of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>4. I observe farther, that there is a wide difference
between being a Supream Pastor, and a Vicarious
Head of the Church, a Title which is given to the
Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> not without great injury to Christ
our Head. Christ, had he pleased, might have
appointed a Supream Pastor for the Government
of his Church; but as he is Head of the Church,
he cannot have a Vicar, or Vicarious Head: for
though a Head signifies a Supream Governour too
in Scripture phrase, yet Christ is not meerly a Head
of Government, but of Union; and though a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
Head may have a Vicar or Lieutenant, yet
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42307:29"/>
a Head of Union cannot, no more than a natural
Head can; for the Union between Christ and his
Church, is as immediate, as between the Head and
the Members, between the Husband and the Wife,
which will admit of no intermediate Vicars.</p>
               <p>The Church is called the Body and Spouse of
Christ, as I have already observed, for mystical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
because it is formed out of his broken and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Body, as <hi>Eve</hi> was out of the Body of <hi>Adam;</hi>
upon which account we are said to be Flesh of his
Flesh, and Bone of his Bone; that is, the Church is
redeemed and purchased by the Bloud of Christ: and
thus he is the Head of that Body which he himself
has bought at the price of his Bloud. We are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Christ by Faith in him, by being baptized in
his Name, by feeding on the Sacrament of his Body
and Bloud; the effect of this Union is, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
from him the pardon of our sins, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
of his Grace and Spirit: Thus Christ is our
Head, and thus none but Christ can be the Head, not
so much as the Vicarious Head of the Church, as I
think I need not prove. We are redeemed by no
other but Christ, and therefore the Church is his
mystical Body only; we are united to no other by
Faith and Sacraments; our Union to no other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
can entitle us to the pardon of sin, and the grace
of the holy Spirit, and therefore Christ alone is the
Head of Union to his Church; it is a Church, and
it is one Church, not by its Union to the Supream
Pastor on Earth, if there were such an one, but by
its Union to Christ: for the Unity of the Church
consist in its Union to its Head, and it is evident
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42307:30"/>
that the Church can have no other Head but Christ;
and therefore can have no other principle or center of
Unity.</p>
               <p>Now from hence it plainly follows, that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
can separate from the Catholick Church (in
this sense of it, as it signifies the whole company
and family of Christians, which is the true Notion
of the Catholick Church) while he continues a
Christian; for that is a contradiction, to be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
and not to belong to the whole number of
Christians; that is, to be a Christian, and to be no
Christian: for if he be a Christian, he belongs to the
number of Christians, and then he is a Member of
the Catholick Church, and consequently not a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratist
from it: Nothing can separate us from the
Catholick Church, but what forfeits our Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
either a final Apostacy, or such Heresies as are
equivalent to Apostacy: Which shews how vainly
the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> charges us with Schism and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
from the Catholick Church, because we
disown the Authority of the Pope, their pretended
Head of the Church, and reject a corrupt Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
though we are Christians still, and we hope
of a much purer Communion than they are. Schism
and Separation is a breach of the external and visible
Communion of the Church, not of the essential U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of it; the Church is one Church still, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Breaches and Schisms there are in its external
Communion; for the Unity of the Catholick
Church consists in the Union of the whole to Christ,
which makes them one Body in him, not in the
external Communion of the several parts of it to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42307:30"/>
each other. And therefore it is not a Separation from
one another, but only a Separation from Christ,
which is a Separation from the Catholick Church.
But what the true Notion of Schism is, I shall discourse
more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p>5. I observe further, that the Indefectibility of the
Catholick Church does not depend upon the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectibility
of any organized Churches; for the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church does not consist of organized Churches,
as organized, but is made up of particular Christians;
and therefore while the whole Race of Christians does
not fail in the World, the Catholick Church cannot
fail. There is no Promise, that I know of, to any
particular Church, that it shall not fail, and all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Churches are particular. Several of them
have totally failed, others have been very greatly
corrupted both in Faith, and Manners, and Worship,
but had these Failures and Corruptions been much
greater and more general than ever they have
been yet, while there are a number of good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
preserved in the World, though not united
in one visible Body, the Catholick Church does
not fail; for since the Catholick Church is not
an organized Church, nor made up of organized
Churches, as such, though all the particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Churches in the World were so corrupt,
as not to deserve the Name of True Churches, if
there be a number of good Christians preserved
among them, though unknown, and concealed, as
it was in the time of <hi>Elias,</hi> the Catholick Church
is safe, amidst all the corruptions of particular
Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:42307:31"/>
I am abundantly satisfied, that there always has
been, since the first planting of Christianity in the
World and I believe always will be to the end of the
World a true visible Church, but yet I do not think
the Indefectibility of the Church necessarily requires
a perpetual Visibility; that the Church must needs
be owned to fail, if there should be no visible orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized
Church, with whom we could hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
This indeed would mightily eclipse, but not
extinguish the Church; for it is certain the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church subsists in single and individual Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
who may lie concealed from publick not notice,
and therefore it is not sufficient to prove that the
Church has failed, though there were no visible So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
of Christians, but what were corrupted with
damnable Practices and Errors.</p>
               <p>It is very true were there no visible Society of
Christians, no Administration of Baptism, by which
Men are made Members of the Christian Church
and this State should continue so long till the whole
Race of baptized Christians were lost in the World,
there would be too much reason then to say, that
the Church had failed too, for I cannot see; how the
Church can subsist without a number of baptized
Christians; but this never was the state of the
Church, and I believe never will be; for Antichrist
himself sits in the Temple of God, which supposes,
that even in his reign there is a visible Society of
Christians. Now how corrupt and degenerate soever
the External state of the visible Church may be,
while there is a Society of baptized Christians, though
so corrupt in their External Policy and Government,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42307:31"/>
Faith, and Worship, that it may admit or a dispute,
whether they are a true Christian Church or not, yet
tho' the visible state of the Church may be Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
there may be an invisible number of Christians
among them, who may preserve themselves from the
Corruptions, Superstitions, Heresies, and Idolatries, of
the visible Church, and in these men the Catholick
Church is preserved from a to al failure.</p>
               <p>Indeed this is the only difference between Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Divines in this Matter: they all agree, that the
Catholick Church shall not fail, because Christ has
promised it shall not fail, that the gates of Hell shall
not prevail against it; but some doubt, whether there
shall be always a true visible organized Church in the
World. They agree, that there shall be always a
visible Society of Christians in the World, who shall
profess the whole Christian Faith, and administer the
true Christian Sacraments, but they differ, whether
such a Church may be called a true Christian Church,
if together with the true Christian Faith and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
they set up an Antichristian Hierarchy, and
impose an Antichristian Faith and Worship. Those,
who affirm, that such a Church is a true Christian
Church, do consequently teach, that the true Church
shall be always visible, tho it may be corrupt, even
to the degree of Antichristianism; those who affirm,
that such a corrupt Church is not a true Church, do
also consequently affirm, that the true Church may
be sometimes invisible, and consist only of such pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Christians, as preserve themselves from those
corruptions, which unchurch the visible Church: I
may have occasion to consider this more hereafter,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42307:32"/>
all that I observe at present is, that this does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the case, as to the indefectibility of the Church;
for while there is a visible Society professing the
Christian Faith, and administring the Christian Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
the Catholick Church may subsist in an
invisible and unorganized number of Christians, who
profess the true Faith without such corrupt and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian
Mixtures. Were the Catholick Church
an organical Body, then indeed it must be always
visible, and the Church would fail, if ever it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
invisible; but if the Catholick Church be an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>organized
Body of Christians, who are united only in
Christ, it is possible, that it may be unknown and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible,
as great numbers of private Christians may
be, and yet the Church not fail.</p>
               <p>Now this shews the weakness and fallacy of several
Arguments used by the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi> As 1. That
the perpetual visibility of the Roman Church proves
it to be that indefectible Church, of which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
promised, that the Gates of Hell should not
prevail against it. A Promise, which all men grant,
our Saviour made to the Catholick Church, not to
any particular Church, that is, to the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Christians, that there should never want a
succession of true Believers in the World, not to any
particular organized Church, or Body, of Christians,
such as the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> is. And therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defectibility
of the Church cannot prove, that it
shall be always visible, and then the uninterrupted
visibility of any Church cannot prove, that it is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible;
for if the indefectible Church may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
invisible, then that visible Church may not
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42307:32"/>
be always indefectible; when the indefectible Church
is invisible, to be sure that Church, which at that
time is visible, is not the indefectible Church, and
thus I am sure it may be, whether it has been
or not, but if it may be, the Argument is
naught.</p>
               <p>2. And so is that Argument to prove the Church
to be infallible, because it is indefectible. That it
cannot err, because it never shall so grievously err
as to cease to be a Church. The indefectibilty of
the Church, as you have already heard, does not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
prove, that there shall be any one visible,
organized Church, which shall never fail; for the
Church does not fail, while there are any true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
in the World; it may be preserved in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of single and concealed Christians, who are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
known to one another, nor much less to the
World. And therefore if indefectibility proves infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility,
it proves only, that there shall be some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
infallible Christians, not that there is any visible
infallible Church. For it can prove only those to be
infallible, who are indefectible, and therefore since it
does not necessarily prove, that any visible organized
Church shall be indefectible, it cannot prove any
such Church to be infallible neither. The infallibility
of private Christians the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and yet if indefectibility prove infallibility, this
is all the infallibility which the indefectibility of the
Church can prove, that there shall always in the
greatest degeneracy of the Church be a number of
private infallible Christians, who shall continue in the
true Faith and Worship of Christ. When our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42307:33"/>
says, that the Gates of Hell shall not prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
his Church, we may consider it either as a Promise,
or a Prophecy, or both, that there always shall be some
sound and orthodox Believers in the world, who in the
greatest degeneracy of the Church shall be the Seeds
of a Reformation, and a new visible resurrection of
it; now I hope Christ can make good such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
(if we consider it as a Promise) without bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infallibility upon any Christians, for men may
be orthodox Christians without being infallible; and
if we consider it as a Prophecy, I hope Christ can
certainly foretel things, which have no necessary
causes, and then he can foretel, that there shall never
want true Believers, tho' it is possible, there might
be none; that all Christians shall not err, tho' they
are all fallible, and therefore may err; and then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Promise nor the Prophecy can prove the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of any Christians: and this is all that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants
can mean, when they say, that the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church cannot err in Fundamentals, not that
there is any visible Society of Christians, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
in its definitions of fundamental Doctrines,
but that the Catholick Church or the whole number
of Christians shall never err fundamentally, that is,
that there shall always be some true and orthodox
Believers in the Church.</p>
               <p>3. Nor is it a good Argument to prove any Church
to be a new upstart Church, because after some time
of concealment it reassumes its visibility, and appears
openly in the World. The stabbing Question, as the
<hi>Church of Rome</hi> thinks, to the Reformed Churches is,
Where was your Church before <hi>Luther?</hi> Those who
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42307:33"/>
own the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> with all her Corruptions to
be a true Church, have a plain and easie Answer to
this, That the Church was before <hi>Luther,</hi> where it
was afterwards; for they did not make a new Church,
but only reformed that part of the old, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to such a reformation; they profess the same
Faith still, have the same Sacraments, and the same
Christian Worship, but purged from those Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Corruptions, which had deformed the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Communion of the Roman Church, which can
no more make a new Church, than a man's washing
off the dirt makes a new-Face. And I confess, I
think, those who deny the visible organized <hi>Church
of Rome</hi> to be a True Church, do not want a good
Answer neither. For during the degeneracy of that
Church, the Church might subsist in those private
Christians, who preserved themselves in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
from the corruption of that Church, which might
more easily be done before the Reformation than
since; for many of their Doctrines and Practices were
not then so peremptorily decreed by their Councils,
nor so strictly imposed upon the consciences of men,
as the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> has since done. And there are
Evidences enough, that there never wanted some in
all Ages, who have condemned their Innovations, and
that profound Ignorance, wherein that Church brought
up honest and devout men, was the true reason, why
there were not more; now all these men may be
reckoned the Seeds of the Reformation, out of which
a visible Church would spring, as soon as a new light
broke in upon the World. There was no failure of
the Church, tho' it was obscured and concealed; we
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42307:34"/>
may as well say, that it is a new Sun, which rises eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Morning, not that which set at Night, as make a
new Church of the visible Resurrection of old and
primitive Christianity, the Profession of which was
never lost, thô the Professors of it were not so visible.
If the true Church be indefectible and never fails, it
can never be new again; and if the indefectibility of
the Church may be preserved in some private and
unknown Christians, the want of a visible Society of
such pure and orthodox Christians cannot prove, that
the Church has failed, and then when the old Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Church appears again with a new glory, it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous
to call it new, only because for some years
it has been concealed.</p>
               <p>Thus I have considered the true Notion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church on Earth, which there is so much talk
of in our Disputes with the <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and I
hope have made it appear, how little Service this
can do them.</p>
