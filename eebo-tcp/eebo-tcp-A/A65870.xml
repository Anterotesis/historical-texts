            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Introductory Epistle. To my beloved and tender-hearted Friends, called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are lovers of Peace and Unity in our Lord Jesus Christ; Greeting in the holy Spirit of Life.</head>
            <p>IF I did not feel the Lord my God laying a real necessity upon me to be publickly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Controversie (and that for the sake of simple Hearts and poor Lambs, to warn them against such grievous Wolves as seek to prey upon them, rend and tear them; and that the weak of the Flock may not be hurt, scattered or perverted by those that speak perverse things, to draw Disciples after them) I would chuse rather to sit down mute, and silently bear the Revilings, Outrage and fierce Despisings of crooked Spirits, than spend time in Controversie with them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. But the Lord has laied the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, and knows best my Conscientious concern, and for what end, and to what effect, and for whose sakes. And in discharging my Duty, I neither consult Events, nor fear Effects, but leave all to God; for I feel his divine Power and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel; In whose Name, and in the Patience, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, Long-suffering and Bowels of our Lord Jesus Christ, my Soul hath had a share in deep
<pb facs="tcp:102665:3"/>
Travail and Exercise (with many more of his faithful Servants, my Brethren) for a quiet Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of this Breach; <hi>1st,</hi> With Respect to <hi>Truth's Reputation: 2dly,</hi> With respect to that <hi>Compassion</hi> that's to be had on some, where a difference ought to be made for the regaining and delivering them who have been at unawares taken captive by the Enemy. I have no self-Interest nor end, but the Churches Peace and the Salvation of Souls, and Prosperity of the Lord's Work in the Earth. God doth bear me Record, I have not been awanting in Christian Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, private and friendly, with divers princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally concerned in this <hi>Opposite, Rending, Self-Separating Spirit.</hi> Christian Patience and Forbearance have not been awanting in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of my Spirit and Testimony. But when all our Christian Endeavours on these accounts have been rejected by some <hi>Conceited, Exalted, Pufft up Luciferian Spirits, Despisers</hi> and <hi>Mockers,</hi> that have of late time lusted to be Contentious, and at open War and Defiance against many of the faithful <hi>Ministers</hi> and <hi>Servants of our Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> who have kept their Garments and Stations in <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Uprightness,</hi> and whom they have most grosly abused in Print in their Books and Pamphlets: On this extream Occasion and Offence given against the Truth and Gods Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, I find my Spirit stirred and moved within me by and in the same Long-suffering tender Spirit and Power of Christ Jesus my Lord, (saying,
<pb facs="tcp:102665:3"/>
               <hi>Why should God's Heritage lie under their publick Lyes and Defamations, without open Rebuke?</hi>) and to withstand, oppose, weaken and repel these their Wicked Attempts and Insolent Abuses, and to vindicate the peaceable Christian People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> in their blessed <hi>Society, Order</hi> and <hi>Church-Discipline, &amp;c.</hi> from the cruel Envy, Scorn, Outrage, Madness and Confusions of certain Persons turned <hi>Apostate Informers, Treacherous Hypocrites, False Brethren,</hi> and <hi>Deceitful Workers, Betraying Judases, Devils Incarnate (for Christ called</hi> Judas <hi>a</hi> Devil) who having lost their First Love to Truth, and gone out from us, are become <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, without Natural Affection, Dogs that are without, Wolves, and Raging Waves of the Sea, that foam out their own Shame;</hi> whom the strength of Truth is turned against in Judgment, and <hi>God in ten Thousand of his Saints is coming to execute</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>Judgment upon them,</hi> as the Patience of Christ in his Saints comes to be fulfilled towards them, and their Iniquity ripened for open Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and Condemnation, as they have not spared publickly to defame the Innocent. [But they that are at unawares betrayed, deceived or only mistaken, (and not willful &amp; contentious) are to be had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of, and distinguished from the other.] And in Righteous Judgment will the great Judge of all decide the Controversie with all them who would be counted true <hi>Jews</hi> and are not, <hi>Christian-Quakers,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:102665:4"/>
and are not, but of the Synagogue of <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Antichrist;</hi> whose Works the Day of Christ our Lord will yet more clearly declare and fully manifest, and the Day and Time hastens, blessed are they that watch, and keep their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that their Nakedness appear not, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ingenuous Reader,</hi> Note, that the Contents of the ensuing Treatise are mostly placed before each Chapter, respectively in several Sections, directing to the Passages therein. And also please to take notice, That <hi>William Rogers,</hi> (who is first concerned in this Treatise) is not ignorant what great Labour and Pains I have taken with him more privately, to inform his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding and allay his Heat, by divers large Answers in Manuscript, (unto his Gain-saying, Accusing and Reviling Letters and Papers) amounting to much more than what's herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Answer to his seventh Part of his <hi>Christian-Quaker;</hi> but instead of any fair ingenuous Reply, or acknowledgment of the Truth from him, he hath slighted me and my <hi>Christian-Labours</hi> and <hi>Endeavours,</hi> sometimes casting Dirt upon me, yet giving the <hi>GO-BY</hi> to the greater part of my Writings, seeming rather desirous to be some-body in Print against us, as one affecting <hi>Popularity</hi> (though in a perverse Work) the more publickly to manifest his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful Spirit, in Abusing, Scandalizing and casting undeserved <hi>ODIUMS</hi> upon those whom
<pb facs="tcp:102665:4"/>
his Spight and Malice is most bent against; and I expect no better Treatment from him, and such exalted Spirits; I expect the Hatred of Scorners for rebuking them, and for this my <hi>Christian Conscientious Labour.</hi> Howbeit, I doubt not but this shall have its Effect, for the clear Information and Advantage of many simple honest Hearts. And I can say, <hi>Surely my Judgment is with the Lord, and my Reward is with my God,</hi> Isa. <hi>49.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Several Testimonies and Answers are already extant in Print against <hi>William Rogers</hi>'s wicked Books, as by <hi>Thomas Ell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> (his <hi>ANTIDOTE</hi>) and divers others. Surely it would be more reputable for him to desist and lay aside his daring Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and evil Attempts against the Servants of Christ, and ingenuously and humbly submit to the Truth; for our God (n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doubt) will finally and signally rebuke that Rebellious, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Spirit of Strife and Contention.</p>
            <p>To him who is the Righteous Judge of all I freely commit my Cause (with my Friends) in this Concern, for 'tis his own. And I do tenderly refer the spreading of this Treatise to the Discretion of faithful Friends, where they shall see a Necessity and Service for the Truth. I not designing nor desiring this may
<pb facs="tcp:102665:5"/>
be otherwise or farther exposed to the view of the World, but where any of these Adversaries or their Party have given (or do give) occasion by spreading theirs; as there are some busie Agents among them, that neither regard the Fear of God therein, nor the Reputation of his Truth or People, in spreading their defaming Books and Pamphlets: for which Treacherous Injurious Work, I am assured the Righteous Judge of all will Reckon with both the Authors and Spreaders thereof. To each of whom this Scripture appears justly applicable, <hi>viz.</hi> Jer. <hi>2.19. Thine own Wickedness shall Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee, and thy Back-sliding shall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee; Know therefore and see that it is an Evil thing and bitter, that thou hast 6forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</hi> I wish they may yet find a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Forgiveness, before the Judgment be executed which hangs over their Heads.</p>

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. AS concerning <hi>William Rogers</hi>'s <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> after the Name of the <hi>Pen-man</hi> of a Treatise entituled, <hi>The Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of our Brethren cast down</hi>; and that this <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> is in pursuance of his Name, because not subscribed thereunto, <hi>page</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>How Insincerely and Fallaciously does he herein begin with a silly Boast, an empty Flourish and Vapour, containing also an
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102665:6"/>
unjust Reflection, compared with his false Scoff, (pag. 21.) i. e. <hi>That the Pen-man was ashamed that his Name should be publish'd with the great Bull, entituled,</hi> The Accuser, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is a falshood also. And why an <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> after his Name? He is not fled into Obscurity, nor any Criminal, Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable or Fellonious Person in any sense, that an <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> need to be divulg'd in Print after his Name. Nor has he either deny'd or conceal'd his concern in that Book which <hi>W. R.</hi> falsly terms <hi>The great Bull,</hi> when modestly asked. But why is <hi>W. R.</hi> so very ignorant of his Name, that he must needs make the noise of an <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> after it? when but in pag. 25. he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a Description of the Person, and of his Habit, to wit, As being one that <hi>hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten his low and mean Estate, and arrived to a Beautiful City-dress, &amp;c.</hi> And this is not all; but in pag. 34. he queries about the <hi>Pen-man,</hi> as having been that <hi>no mean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (viz.</hi> of our Society) <hi>that hath solicited the Powers under which we have peaceably lived, &amp;c.</hi> Could he so positively describe the Pen-man's dress and condition, and yet not find out his Name without an <hi>Hue-and-Cry</hi> in Print after it? What empty Flourishes does this Person dress himself in? But what <hi>Beautiful City-Dress</hi> is that he reflects upon the <hi>Pen-man,</hi> that becomes not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102665:7"/>
Humility, or his Call to the work of the Ministry, or his soliciting the Powers on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of suffering Friends? And wherein is he condemnable of Excess in that case of his Habit or Dress? And wherein does he exceed all W. R's Brethren, even them he has counted Honourable? I would have him speak out plainly in this matter, and not to mutter and smite in the dark.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. He says, <hi>He will not conclude the Pen-man to be a Vagrant, a Night-Bird, a Wanderer,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>because his Name is not to his work,</hi> pag. 1. And what, if he'l not thence conclude him such an one, what better Character does he give him, both by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and comparing <hi>his or his Brethren's Actions to the ugly Vizzard of a Night-walker?</hi> pag. 3. Thus he detracts and reviles.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. He affirms it <hi>A notorious Vntruth, that his Book contains Reproach against the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called</hi> Quakers <hi>in general; and that the Pen-man quotes not a word to shew it so,</hi> pag. 2. But his Affirmation we may rather justly conclude a notorious Untruth. For in his Preface, p 6. to the first part of his (falsly stiled) <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> he thus reflects upon the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> (which was quoted by us) viz.
<q>These kinds of Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions frequently publisht amongst the aforesaid People, viz. <hi>Let's exclude the Wisdom,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102665:7"/>
and have an Eye to the Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cannot but be full of Jealousie, that these things have a tendency to insinuate Submission without Conviction, and nurture up Ignorance instead of Wisdom, as much as ever was, where this Maxim, to wit, <hi>Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion,</hi> is, &amp;c.</q>
By all which 'tis apparent, that his Book con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains unjust Reproach upon the People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, as being under such a Popish blind Ministry. For what means [<hi>the aforesaid People</hi>] but the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in general? See now, that which he calls a notorious Untruth, is proved ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently true from his own Reflection on the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and therefore he himself thereby proved in the notorious Untruth. Was it not a Reflection upon the Church of <hi>Thyatira</hi> to suffer the woman <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabel</hi> to teach and seduce, &amp;c? And what better doth his Reflection on the said People render them?</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. He says, <hi>He finds what's cited out of his Book of above Eighty Sheets, is less than Two, and one considerable part thereof acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be Concessions to the Truth, so that the Light sometimes interposeth.</hi> But then he judges this <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with that sense, viz. <hi>That his way of writing is void of Conscience, Reason and Religion.</hi> From whence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers upon the <hi>Pen-man</hi> (as he calls him) <hi>Is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102665:8"/>
it not hence plain, that such a sense renders those very things acknowledged to be interposed from the Light it self, to be void of Conscience, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion?</hi> And then crys out at an hideous rate, as if he had wholly knock'd down his Respondent; <hi>O notorious Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my! —The Pen-man acted in the Dark, shown himself unworthy of the name of a Man —May without abuse be numbred amongst such sort of Beasts at</hi> Ephesus—<hi>Vnreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able men —I have already prov'd the Pen-man Vnreasonable and Blasphemous; yet he may be termed a man, though a very Wicked one, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 2, 3. with more Aggravations. This is the Person that complains of a <hi>great Bull against him</hi>; but observe his <hi>furious Bull</hi> here, and what a wild one! and how out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously mad and false in his Inference! What's the matter with him on which he is so furious? It is <hi>that his way of writing is deemed void of Conscience, Reason, Religion, &amp;c.</hi> because it has been confest, <hi>That the Light sometimes interposeth and makes him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede to Truth.</hi> But does it hence follow, that these very things interposed by the Light, are esteemed void of Reason or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in themselves? No such matter: The major part of this work appears such, and he is measured by the major part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A man may justly be adjudged a Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Person, when the greatest part of his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102665:8"/>
life is such, though he may both speak and act some right things, when the Light comes over him, and convicts him, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, and some of the wicked Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> with many others: Yea, and the Devil himself, though a Lyar from the beginning, yet is made to grant and speak some Truths, when over-powered, though contrary to his Nature. Besides, we do not believe our Adversary to be Conscientious in what the Light interposeth through him, any more than that <hi>Balaam</hi> was a good man, when his heart was evil: Nor can the Devil's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to Truth at any time render him a good Devil, nor of tender Conscience, his Nature being contrary to Truth and Goodness.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. But there lies another great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection in the case upon <hi>W. R.</hi> in his charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Pen-man</hi> (suppose my self or any other of our second day's Meeting) with <hi>Notorious Blasphemy, acting in the dark, being unworthy the name of a Man, numbering him among the Beasts at</hi> Ephesus, <hi>with whom</hi> Paul <hi>fought; having already proved him Vnreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Blasphemous,</hi> as boastingly and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he pretends; comparing this also with what he saith of the said Treatise entituled, <hi>The Accuser of our Brethren cast down,</hi> viz. <hi>'Tis with me to take a little notice thereof; I say again, a little notice, that so the Reader
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102665:9"/>
may not think me so Impertinent as to trouble the Press with so great a Volumn, as a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to every Impertinency, &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>W. R.</hi> p. 14. chap. 2.</p>
            <p>See now, at what a Villifying and Insult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rate this man writes, and how Wicked and Despicable he has rendred the <hi>Pen-man,</hi> (as his term is.) Now [<hi>W. R.</hi>] supposing thou takest my self, or any other of my Brethren to be the Person thou chiefly smites at, how consistent art thou in thy work to spend so much Time, Labour and Cost in writing and printing against such a mean, inconsiderable and undeserving Person, in thy account, as <hi>unworthy the Name of a Man, but rather to be numbred among unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Beasts?</hi> One would think it should be far beneath a Person of thy Hight, Rank and Quality, as thy flourishing Vaunts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speak thee, thus to abase thy self, as to spend so much time and cost upon such an Inferior, Irrational and Inconsiderable Person in thy high Thoughts. But art not thou a great Defamer and Opposer in thy said Charge of <hi>Notorious Blasphemy,</hi> and of being <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Name of a Man, &amp;c?</hi> Is this thy Christianity? Who will believe thee, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou, that are not of thy own Party? And seeing thou art pleased to signifie <hi>what little notice 'tis with thee to take of our Treatise,</hi> we cannot but take notice of thy lofty and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102665:9"/>
slighty way of writing. However, we have no reason to take this thy <hi>little Notice</hi> for an Answer; for thou hast collected and replied to so little of the matter, and hast so much given the GO-BY to the principal and greatest part of our said Treatise, as one that has found out the craft of Evasion, that 'tis a little notice indeed thou hast taken, and thy work deserves but little notice to be taken of by others, unless to evince thy Envy and its Falshood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thy pretence of <hi>Vnreasonableness</hi> in thy Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, will not hide thy Loftiness and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, nor excuse thy shifting Evasions from those things that are most material and weighty upon thee; which every Ingenuous <hi>Reader</hi> may easily perceive, in comparing our said Treatise against the <hi>Accuser of the Brethren,</hi> and thy <hi>Seventh Part</hi> against ours together.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Thou writes much in thy own Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and to clear thy self of giving judgment on Reports and Jealousies, though frequent in thy great Book: Thou on thy own behalf sayst, <hi>I can in Truth delare, that I have not at any time positively asserted any thing, but what I either know, or have had sufficient proof, as may render my Pen blameless therein,</hi> pag. 3.</p>
            <p>Upon which I would seriously ask thee, What sufficient proof hast thou that that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102665:10"/>
was <hi>E. Burrough</hi>'s Epistle, which thou hast cited for his Epistle, and positively asserted it two or three times to be <hi>E. B</hi>'s Epistle in thy first part of the <hi>Christian-Quaker</hi> (falsly so called?) which I and many more do not believe it to be <hi>E. B</hi>'s for divers causes; having seen <hi>John Parrots</hi> Name only to a Transcript of it in a Persons Hand, writing, i. e. <hi>J. Batho</hi>'s, that was for a time an Admirer of <hi>J. P.</hi> How durst thou be so positive in asserting it to be <hi>E. B</hi>'s? I dare Challenge thee to produce it under <hi>E. B.</hi>'s own hand, to any of us that knew his hand, if thou tookest it not up upon an Implicit belief, trust and report. As we can prove, thou hast written many things from thy own Jealousies and Reports, only with this provision in some other things, <hi>If Reports be true,</hi> &amp;c. to save thee from the censure of drawing a positive Conclusion; and then what weight or credit does this add to much of thy Work?</p>
            <p>And I would know, what sufficient proof thou hast of thy Story, <hi>That a Friend of known credit did declare, that twelve pence was paid in</hi> London, <hi>on demand of so much for a Certificate, in order to the Accomplishment of his Marriage, which otherwise might have been obstructed,</hi> p. 5. I pray thee produce thy Author and Informer for this Story, and what Friend of known Credit did so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare?
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102665:10"/>
for 'tis not credited by many. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, thou art positive in it, by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, <hi>viz. This being done under the form of Government contended for,</hi> &amp;c. Which I am sure is a positive Lye; for we have no such Action under the form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment contended for among us, as to obstruct any Marriage for Non-payment of twelve Pence for a Certificate. Such practice is so far from relating to Church Government among us, that 'twas never own'd by us, as to obstruct any Marriage on that account.</p>
            <p>And what positive Proof hast thou, <hi>That the Manuscript of the Primmer, subscribed by</hi> G. F. <hi>and</hi> E. H. <hi>was sold for thirty Pound?</hi> Enquiry has been made about this Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and 'tis positively deny'd by the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son concerned; though these Stories thou hast instanced as <hi>tokens of Apostacy and Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> p. 5.</p>
            <p>And what if <hi>E. H.</hi> was a Clark for his yearly Salary, does that hinder his Credit in his signing our said Treatise on behalf of our Meeting? Or was his yearly Salary to extend to pay for all the many Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates relating to Marriages, and the Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereupon, who many times was known to be deprived of his natural Rest, in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to serve Truth and Friends? And was't not lawful for him to have a Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood for his great pains in Truth's service,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102665:11"/>
who lost his place and livelihood for Truth, and ended his dayes in Peace? One would think, that <hi>W. R.</hi> should be ashamed to asperce or cloud his Reputation after his Death.</p>

And <hi>W.

the Reader, <hi>We seem to dislike the latter part thereof</hi>—And in other parts, <hi>seem to dislike the wording thereof,</hi> p. 4, &amp; 28. But is not so honest as to give the Reader a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Citation and Notice of our real judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our own words in that case.

            <p>And in dislike of their <hi>subscription,</hi> we sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,

               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:102665:12"/>Now let the serious and impartial judge; Is not here a manifest Dislike shown, and Judgment given? And therefore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Injustice in our Adversary to cite the Paper from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> either to prove us guilty of <hi>Aiming at Dominion and Lordship over Faith, Conscience and Property,</hi> pag. 4. or that <hi>the said Paper is one part of the fruits of the pretended establisht Government,</hi> as he most falsly saith, p. 27.

He would deceitfully insinuate and charge upon us <hi>sewing Pillows under their Armholes,</hi> calling them <hi>dear Friends,</hi> with other tender Expressions; which when he has cited, without the words containing our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to Fact, he then says, <hi>THIS shews no dislike to the said Paper.</hi> Which is a very deceitful and unjust way of writing in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie: I would not deal thus by the worst Adversary in the World, to entitle him to that which he has disowned, and to leave out the words of <hi>Dislike</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> on the Mistake or Error so disown'd, and to pick and take up those other words which are tender, relating to the Persons, and not to the Fact; and then to cry, <hi>This shews no dislike thereof,</hi> &amp;c.

O Dis-inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Person, (<hi>W.R.</hi>) I am ashamed of thy Partial, Unconscionable &amp; Unjust dealing!

            <p n="8">§. 8. That <hi>We have given occasion to be rendred in some things as bad as</hi> Papists (or as <hi>having a Papistical Countenance,</hi> p. 5.) is a notorious Slander: And that <hi>in some other things we have given occasion to be rendred</hi> MUCH WORSE <hi>in our Practices and Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than the very Papists themselves,</hi> (p. 6.) is also a foul Reproach. And his excusing Pope <hi>Leo</hi> his Bull against <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> rather than our Friends, is no Proof, but rather shews himself more on the Popes side than on our Friends, having spoken more for Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth than our
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102665:13"/>
Friends, <note n="†" place="margin">A Pope reputed no better than an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist, a Prophaner of the holy Scriptures, a Person careless of Religion and Piety; an Avaritious Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Person, who made great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his impious Indulgencies &amp; Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, <hi>&amp;c</hi> How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just &amp; impious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is our Adversary <hi>W R.</hi> to rake so many Instancies (as he hath done) out of the <hi>History of the Council of Trent,</hi> of Wicked Popes and their Agents, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, brand and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize Us or any of our Friends withal, who abhor Popery and all the Popes Corruptions.</note> on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance he gives, to wit, <hi>That in the Popes Bull forty two Articles of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, held by the said</hi> Martin, <hi>were mentioned, and declar'd Erronious; by which the World was notified of the reputed Crimes laid to his Charge.

And is not this matter of Fact, to set up a standard of Separation? Where then is his Comparison between Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, and us? And how were the <hi>Pope's proceedings in that respect, far
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102665:13"/>
more just than our Friends?</hi> (as he signifies) p. 6. See what Favour and Charity he has for the Pope, more than for our Friends. The causing or making Divisions and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the Apostles days was then such matter of Fact, as that they were to be marked and avoided that did so; though our Adversary does not own this to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed <hi>particular matter of Fact</hi> laid down, when plainly mentioned in writing.</p>
            <p>Thus I have considered him on his own terms, and taken notice how he justifies the Pope's proceedings, as far more just than our Friends, whilst he would be reckoned against Popery.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. That <hi>we would not be rendred like Papists,</hi> is true; <hi>but that the Pen-man seems to marr it all again</hi> (in refering the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to a short Tract, writ by our Friend <hi>R.

R.</hi> would like it well to be so reflected upon (<hi>Argumentum ad hominem</hi>) as resembling a <hi>Papist</hi> in his quoting Pope <hi>Leo's</hi> Bull against <hi>Martin Luther, as having some more pretended ground whereon to place a Judgment, and as far more just in his proceedings than</hi> C. M. <hi>and sixty five
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102665:14"/>
Friends more.</hi> As also in his quoting the Parliament of <hi>Papists</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> p. 31. Does not this then by his own reflection, render him more like to a <hi>Papist</hi> than a strict <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi>? Whilst he'l needs have <hi>R. R.</hi> &amp;c. like <hi>Papists</hi> for quoting <hi>Heathenish, Papistical</hi> or <hi>Protestant</hi> Authors; yet he himself quoting Pope <hi>Leo</hi>'s Bull against <hi>M. Luther,</hi> and the said Parliament of <hi>Papists</hi> against our Friends: Let him wind himself out from a Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation in this, and other points of like nature, if he can.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. He seems much to upbraid us with the words, <hi>Learned Friend R. R.</hi> he throws them over and over upon the Pen-man: he often twits us with them, and yet but in his 8th page he tells us of the Memory of the <hi>Learned Samuell Fisher.</hi> See how the man makes work to his own Confutation. Though our words in the Copy were <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Truth</hi>; how the words [<hi>in the Truth</hi>] were left out, I know not. And yet a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son being <hi>Learned</hi> in any respect, it can be no sin to say, <hi>He is Learned</hi>; whilst 'tis not to admire <hi>outward Learning</hi> or <hi>Acquirement</hi> above its place; which I am sure was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on our parts.</p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. Of our saying, That it is at least suspected for a great Slander, viz. <hi>That some do look upon</hi> G. F. <hi>as that Prophet, whom the Lord by</hi> Moses <hi>prophesied, he would raise up:
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102665:14"/>
Aad that he is not ignorant, that such there are, &amp;c.</hi> Our Adversary in his inference has perverted the words from [<hi>at least suspected</hi>] to [<hi>only suspected,</hi> and <hi>bear suspicion</hi>] when as [<hi>at least suspected</hi>] implies more than a bear Suspicion: And therefore his suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition thereupon (and his Jealousie) <hi>That the secret Reason was, that on Conference with</hi> G. F. <hi>he could not in Truth deny the same; And that he will not deny it,</hi> p. 9, 10. This is a Presumptious Imagination: for I affirm, <hi>G F.</hi> does deny the same, in reference to himself, as a particular Man or Person, whose days and years are limited; only the Truth of the Immortal Seed, Christ in him, (as he is in every true Believer, Male and Female) he stands to maintain, against all Opposers, and persecuting Gain-sayers and Apostates. And therefore his Jealousie, <hi>That at length this Controversie, as mannaged, &amp;c. will occasion the discovery of great Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> pag. 10. shews, that he suggests false things still upon Jealousie, to render <hi>G. F. &amp;c</hi> Odious and Obnoxious.</p>

                  </gap>uilty of sordid and foul Abuse against</hi> John Blaikling, p. 10. is a sordid &amp; foul Untruth; see our Treatise against the Accuser of our Brethren, pag. 246. where we offer what he says against <hi>J.

him to a Parasite, to an Earthly Prince:</hi> Here's more than one word offered to prove <hi>W. R</hi>'s foul Abuse against <hi>J. B.</hi> &amp;c. who to add to his Abuse, now saith, J. B. <hi>has acted the part of a Sycophantizing Parasite in writing touching</hi> G. F. And what's this but to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him a meer <hi>Tale-bearer</hi> and <hi>Flatterer,</hi> or an <hi>Informing Flatterer</hi> for his own Ends and Advantage? This still appears sordid and abusive, thus infamously to brand any Friend or Person Conscientious towards God.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. As for his ascribing <hi>Eternal Honour</hi> either to <hi>G. F</hi>'s Life, or to him or his Soul, as joyned to the Spotless Life; wherein <hi>J. B.</hi> can mean no other than the Life of Christ Jesus in him, I do not understand that this can prove him a <hi>Sycophantizing Parasite.</hi> For that Christ is our Life, the Life of every true Believer, is plain; that <hi>Eternal Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> belongs to him, is not disputed. In the next place, <hi>He that Honours me,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>him will I Honour.</hi> The Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, Whether this <hi>Honour</hi> is not <hi>Eternal, (a parte post)</hi> that is, <hi>Everlasting</hi> to the Souls of the Righteous, whom God never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes? Then how can any such ever loose that Honour that God gives? And does our Adversary believe, that nothing may be said to be <hi>Eternal,</hi> that had a beginning, as to Man? Had not <hi>Eternal Salvation</hi> and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102665:15"/>
               <hi>Eternal Redemption</hi> a beginning, as to the Creature, yet <hi>Eternal?</hi> But <hi>W. R.</hi> notes in the Margent, That <hi>Eternal Honour is due to none but God, who alone, and not the words of Mortal Man, is able to nourish the Soul which is Immortal:</hi> And all this to confute <hi>John Blaikling.</hi> Wherein he greatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts J. B's Intention, and misrepresents his words; for he spoke of the <hi>dropping of his tender words in the Lords Love</hi>; and <hi>W. R.</hi> tells of the <hi>words of mortal man.</hi> When the Apostle said, <hi>Hitherto I have fed you with Milk, and not with strong Meat</hi>; Was this a <hi>Soul's feeding</hi> or <hi>nourishing,</hi> yea or nay? And was the Apostle's preaching the Gospel in a living Ministry only the words of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal mam? No sure: <hi>For our Gospel came not unto you in word only, but in Spirit and in Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His charge against <hi>G.F. that he hath descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed himself one unto whom Infallible Judgment hath been committed in all things,</hi> is denyed by <hi>G. F.</hi> though he owns the <hi>Judgment</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him of God in matters of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and things Spiritual, to be <hi>Infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. His Marginal Note appears mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly untrue, viz. <hi>That he has not written one word to shew that such a sense is his sense,</hi> to wit, <hi>That he and some others of his party seem to be only for a select company of Elders and Deacons to order in Church Affairs about the Poor,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102665:16"/>
Marriages, &amp;c.</hi> p. 11. What then means his exclaiming so much against our Meetings about Church Affairs, as being <hi>an uncertain number of uncertain qualified Persons?</hi> and his Brethrens Paper of Separation in <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merland,</hi> quoted by him, plainly limiting to <hi>Chosen men, Chosen, Imployed and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Churches?</hi> see our said Treatise, pag 119, 120. Now if his sense was not for a select company, then he and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Subscribers of the said Paper, are of contrary senses. But then how does he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist therein with himself, in his charging us with <hi>Vsurpation,</hi> and upbraiding us, p. 19. with <hi>such a form of Church-Government, as hath admitted of no rightful Succession or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution by Election, &amp;c?</hi> What Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Certainty can we find in this mans writing? One while he is comparing us with the <hi>Pope,</hi> another while he charges us with <hi>Vsurpation, for want of rightful Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Constitution of any Supream Person or Persons,</hi> pag. 19. This is the man that would seem to oppose <hi>Popery</hi> so much, whilst he is bringing a <hi>Popish plea</hi> of <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> against us. But this is like much of his Work: I wish he were better com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed.</p>
            <p n="14">§. 14. He pretends greatly to be for an <hi>Amicable Conference,</hi> p. 12. whilst he is so far from <hi>Amity,</hi> that he has appeared an
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102665:16"/>
               <hi>open Enemy,</hi> abusing and reviling us in Print</p>
            <p>And what, if his Letter was not read publickly at our yearly Meeting, at the time of its being delivered? What reason had Friends to interrupt their publick and weighty concerns of Truth with the then reading of an Adversary's letter? especially seeing divers of us took care to answer him therein so soon as the Meeting was over; and were not wanting afterward to give him a Meeting thereupon.</p>
            <p>His charging us with a <hi>piece of meer Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and Deceit for pretending to Amicable Conference,</hi> is a sordid Abuse to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: For many of us have not been awanting in that case, but have been ready to Amicable Conference, before <hi>W. R.</hi> and some of Party with him, turned open Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, Gain-sayers and Enemies to us, whose Enmity has made them, (especially him) uncapable of Amicable Conference. And he may be ashamed of his pretended <hi>seasonable</hi> Hue and Cry <hi>after the Name of the Pen-man</hi>; his <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> shews his own Complexion and Image not to be innocent.</p>
            <p>And his Charge of the <hi>Fruits of manifest Injustice, that his Letter was not read in our yearly Assembly, being</hi> (he says) <hi>a Letter from a Friend, especially when not Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated.</hi> This is unjust and untrue in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102665:17"/>
first place, and shews an imperious, Lordly, Exalted Spirit, thus to charge us with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Injustice: And why so? but because we did not serve his turn, we did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his time and manner in reading his Letter, when and where he would have had us: We did not lay all the weighty Affairs of Friends and Truth aside presently to read <hi>William Rogers</hi>'s Letter; we did not gratifie his Irregular interposing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we must now be censured in Print, charg'd with <hi>Irregularity, Answering with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out order of the Meeting, Lordship and slavish Submission, fruits of manifest Injustice, &amp;c.</hi> He seems very hot on this occasion, and a Person very strict and zealous for <hi>Regularity</hi> and <hi>Order of the Meeting,</hi> when he thinks it may serve his own turn: But at other times he hugely exclaims against <hi>Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Vniformity, Orders, outward Rules, Prescriptions, Directions, Imposition, &amp;c.</hi> But now it seems, it is against such as are not of his own setting up or imposing. And yet he most highly justifies <hi>whatever he has written; which we either pretend to answer, or to shew dissatisfaction in, as remaining unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and in no respect unbecoming a Christian Pen,</hi> p. 14. We have only his own Self-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for this; wherein his Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and wilful Blindness is to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at.</p>

            <p n="1">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102665:18"/>§. 1. HIs questioning the Credit of <hi>Ellis Hookes, A Clark for his yearly Salary</hi> (as he calls him) and insinuating against the <hi>Meeting,</hi> for whom he was a witness, as <hi>not meriting the Name of Sober Conscientious</hi> Quakers; and as <hi>being infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, &amp;c.</hi> cap. 2. p. 15. And why so, but because they wrote in the Name of publick Meetings, &amp; in the Name of the People call'd <hi>Quakers?</hi> Does this prove them Infatuated, or unworthy the Name of Sober Conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Quakers?</hi> 'Tis a wonder he is not ashamed thus manifestly to scandalize and abuse so many Conscientious, Sober and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding Persons, when he knew not who they were in particular. Have we not often writ in the name and behalf of our Friends &amp; People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> in their Vindication from the opposition and abuses of Opposers and Gain-sayers of Truth, in matters known to be universally own'd by them; and this both with their tacit Consent and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Must we seek for a Deputation from the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> throughout <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> in all Cases wherein there is a present necessity of their Vindication, when generally abused in Print by Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries of divers sorts? For I tell <hi>W. R.</hi> he merits not so much as the Name of a <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> in abusing at least the major part of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102665:19"/>
them in Print, as he has done, to render them <hi>Popish, Odious</hi> and <hi>Infamous,</hi> and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther justifying the <hi>Pope, and Lords of the</hi> Spanish <hi>Inquisition,</hi> p. 21. than many of them. And his <hi>disaffected</hi> Party are not so numerous as he would have us think, p. 23. far short (to be sure) of those he writes against and abuseth in Print; for his smiting at the publick and faithful Ministers (who are approved of most generally by the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) is a Reflection and Scandal upon that People.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Our observation on the 42d <hi>Disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> shews, that our Objection lies not against the <hi>outward Government</hi> under which we live, nor yet against the <hi>inward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; for Christ's inward Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his Church, and his spiritual Kingdom and extent thereof, as also our innocent Conversations towards the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government, we have plainly asserted in our Treatise against the Accuser, pag. 114, 115, 116, &amp; 118. Though <hi>W. R</hi>'s words are cited at large, more fully to shew his sense and distinction upon the <hi>inward Government of Christ,</hi> where he adds, <hi>viz. Which is not represented by Persons visible by carnal Eyes, invested with Power from him to execute outward Laws, Prescriptions, Orders, Edicts or Decrees, in an outward form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment visible.</hi> Wherein we reasonably
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102665:19"/>
took his Objection to lie as much against <hi>visible Persons</hi> being so invested with Power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions, &amp;c. and against an <hi>outward Form of Government, visible in his Church,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Christ's Government being</hi> Represented <hi>by Persons visible.</hi> But now he pitches his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection upon the word [<hi>REPRESENTED</hi>] questioning, <hi>Whether it is not a Contradiction in common sense, to conclude, That Persons visible can be the</hi> Representatives <hi>of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government of Christ?</hi> Which was not our Assertion; nor did we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that Persons visible are the <hi>Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives</hi> of Christ's inward Government, in a strict sence, absolutely or solely as in Christ's stead: And therefore his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction supposes that to be our position, which we never asserted. Yet not to loose nor lessen any part of Christs Government, we have plainly asserted,
<q>That 'tis exercised by him both <hi>Immediately</hi> and <hi>Instrumentally</hi> in his Church: <hi>Immediately</hi> and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally by himself; and <hi>Instrumentally</hi> (in some measure) by his Ministers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, as well as he teaches and instructs both Immediately and Instrumentally;</q> as in our first and second unanswered Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions about Church Government.
And therefore as we prefer Christ's inward and immediate Government by himself as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102665:20"/>
               <hi>Principal,</hi> and his governing <hi>Instrumentally</hi> by his Servants: But in <hi>some Measure</hi> (as our words are) this shews, that we do not render them the absolute <hi>Representatives</hi> of his inward Government and spiritual King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; though we may truly and tenderly assert, They do by the inward Assistance of the Power and Spirit of Christ, in some measure livingly <hi>represent</hi> or <hi>signifie, declare and shew forth the inward and spiritual Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Christ,</hi> as being his faithful Servants and Ambassadours; yea, some are called <hi>Ambassadours in Christ's stead,</hi> in and through whom Christ ministers, instructs, commands, orders and rules. And the holy Ghost made some Overseers, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Helps and Governments in the Church (as we have laid down in our third <hi>Proposition</hi>)
<q>Especially for the sake of the younger and weaker Members, Children and such as are of under Age, as to Truth and experience in the work of the Lord.</q>
Our Adversary answers not this Proposition, which is so plain, tender and submissive to Christ, in his behalf and preference: And therefore <hi>W. R</hi>'s inferring and charging <hi>the fruit of a confused Anarchical Principle</hi> on us (in reference to our said <hi>Disaffection</hi>) follows not in Truth, but rather shews it to be the fruit of his own Prejudice and Enmity. From whence also his scornful Question
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102665:20"/>
proceeds, viz. <hi>Whether the Pen-man hath known, and hath in pivate a Catalogue of the Names of such visible Persons, whom he may esteem the Representatives of Christ's inward Government?</hi> pag. 16, 17. He fallaciously obtrudes and imposes his word REPRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SENTATIVES still in this case upon us, extending it beyond our Intention, and what our words will bear; craftily evading and giving the <hi>GO-BY</hi> to our Propositions in the Case, where we signifie, <hi>That</hi> IN SOME MEASURE <hi>Christ governs Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, &amp;c.</hi> see our five <hi>Propositions</hi> in our said Treatise against the <hi>Accuser of the Brethren,</hi> p. 114, 115, 116.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Whereas we took his opposition to be <hi>against visible Persons being concerned in an outward form of Government, and order in the Church of Christ.</hi> Hereupon he shews himself very angry, and exclaims against the <hi>weight of the Pen-man's Iniquity,</hi> charges him with <hi>Prevarication, insinuating, as if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Principle</hi> (says he) <hi>there were not visible order and form of Government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Christs Dominion, nor any visible Persons exercised in any outward Order under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> p. 43. Whereby he has now plainly granted, that according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>there is both visible Order, and a form of Government under Christs dominion, and Visible Persons exercised in an outward order
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102665:21"/>
under his Government</hi> (for in the two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, his disowning the one, owns the other; his opposing the Negative grants the Affirmative herein.) But he then should have writ more distinctively, consistently and plain, in telling us, What <hi>visible and outward form of Government and Order</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he would set up? And what has he so much exclaim'd against, and not to have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so general in his opposition to <hi>outward Orders, Forms, Rules, Prescriptions, Decrees,</hi> &amp;c. as he has done in divers passages of his Book; and particularly, that in his first part of his <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> p. 73. in his opposing the Establishment, or giving forth of <hi>outward Orders, Prescriptions, Sentences</hi> or <hi>Decrees, as a Bond on the Consciences of Believers,</hi> rendring this <hi>more like the Old than the New Covenant.</hi> And his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Visible Persons being invested with Power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Prescriptions, Orders, Edicts or Decrees in an outward form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment visible</hi>; as 'tis plain in the Title-page of his third part. The frequent Reiteration of these and such like passages and Words, shew his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection was against <hi>Visible Persons being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by Christ to execute</hi> (or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:102665:21"/>
               <note n="†" place="margin">By [<hi>Execute</hi>] I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand <hi>minister</hi> or <hi>put in Practice,</hi> and not in the common Law sence of inflicting <hi>corporal or pecuniary Punishments</hi>; for that's not consistent with the Government of a Christian Church.</note> 
               <hi>outward Laws, Orders,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in a visible and outward form of Government</hi>; else what needed he write so slightily &amp; frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>visible form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, outward Laws, Edicts, Prescriptions, Orders, Decrees,</hi> &amp;c? What's all his Noise come to on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? Now he would not be thought, that his Principle is against <hi>visible Order</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government under Christ's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi>; Nor against <hi>some visible Persons being exercised in some outward Order under his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:</hi> Thus far the point is granted and gain'd upon him, and his Concession thereto the farther confirm'd, in deeming our rendring his great Book to be against <hi>Church-Government, outward Methods, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Rules,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A false Assertion</hi>; Though we cannot reckon that Book of his to look with a better Face in the mian pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and <hi>Series</hi> of it, especially considering his <hi>Third part,</hi> from what's mentioned in the Title, and against <hi>R. Barclay's</hi> Book <hi>for Church-Government,</hi> and in many other places and passages of that Book, and in his Epistle in this his 7th part he is smiting at <hi>Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an outward Vniformity, outward Things,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102665:22"/>
outward Directory,</hi> &amp;c. But now we must take his meaning and principle to be not against <hi>visible Order</hi> and <hi>visible Form</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under Christ's dominion,</hi> nor against <hi>visible Persons being exercised therin</hi>; How then shall we understand his meaning and principle? Why did he not then more plainly distinguish it first, and brought the Controversie into a more narrow compass, and not have writ thus confusedly and shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teredly, one while <hi>against,</hi> another while <hi>for visible outward Order</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> under Christs Dominion in his Church. [As in this Treatise the matter is further Evinced against him hereafter.]</p>
            <p>But wherein lies his Charge of <hi>Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation?</hi> He gives us to know, it is in twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Word REPRESENTED into CONCERNED, pag. 43. We are yet to seek and study, how to find this <hi>Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> pretended, considering the purport, tenure and conexion of his Words. For though now he owns <hi>visible Persons</hi> to be exercised or concerned in an <hi>outward Form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> under Christ's Dominion; yet not that his <hi>inward Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is represented by them; yet his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction before excluding visible Persons not only from representing Christ's inward Government, but also from being invested with Power <hi>to execute</hi> (i. e. to minister,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102665:22"/>
give forth, or put in practice) outward <hi>Laws, Edicts,</hi> &amp;c. in an <hi>outward Form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> Visible, appears to bespeak his sense than to exclude them from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in an outward <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in the Church of Christ under his Dominion. For if they do in no sense or degree represent <hi>Christ's Government,</hi> how are they concern'd in it? And if they have no power to execute (minister, or put in practice) <hi>outward Order</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment visible:</hi> How are they either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised or concerned in an <hi>outward form</hi> or <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Government under Christ's dominion</hi>? But this is now granted us in the Affirmative So then, wherein must we understand <hi>W. R</hi>'s opposition to lie against <hi>outward Order, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form</hi> of <hi>Church-Government, outward Laws, Edicts, Rules, Prescriptions,</hi> &amp;c? I presume, not against any of his own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but against such as he calls <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s, &amp;c. as he has told us of <hi>a slighting</hi> G. F<hi>'s Rules, Methods and Orders, with respect to Church-Government</hi>; see the <hi>Accuser,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 83. But then I would know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is against <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>some,</hi> that <hi>G. F.</hi> has writ or given out? If he says, <hi>not against all,</hi> but <hi>some</hi>; then I intreat him to let's know, what SOME they are particularly? What <hi>Instructions, Rules</hi> or <hi>Methods</hi> they are he Condemns, and that he deems condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102665:23"/>
as evil or unlawful in themselves? We have divers times prest for a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them, that the <hi>Controversie</hi> might be more plainly distinguishable, and brought into a narrow compass, which now lies not only prolix and tedious in <hi>W. R's</hi> Books, but also <hi>scattered, confused</hi> and <hi>ambiguous</hi> in his Writings, wanting in many places the supplement of his latter Thoughts and Meanings: So that when he has write one Book, it wants another to declare its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; he has taken a great compass to write a very little matter in.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. For his distinction between the words <hi>Represented</hi> and <hi>Concerned,</hi> he says, That <hi>many thousands are exercised in an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Order, under the Government of the King, who if they should thence declare, that they are the</hi> Representatives <hi>of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'twould be deem'd a Mood of Speech, tending to the annihillating of the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative:</hi> And concludes the like <hi>in relation to Christ's Prerogative,</hi> p. 43. But herein the man is under a Mistake; in this Allusion, his skill in the Law, and the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative and Government has fail'd him in this point. For the King's Government is represented in all Courts of Judicature, legally acting in his Name and by his Power, whereby the King is look't upon to be present in all his Courts: Yea, every
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102665:23"/>
legal Minister and Conservator of the King's Peace, even from the Justice to the Sheriff &amp; Constable or Peace-Officer does in his place and legal Office in some degree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Kings Government, in the doing Justice and Conservation of his Peace: And this no ways lessens, but promotes the King's legal Prerogative. For the King in the Eye of the Law is <hi>Justitiarius Capitalis,</hi> the Head or chief Justice, and hath his subordinate Ministers and Justices under him, legally impowered by him, according to his just and legal Prerogative. Now seeing <hi>W. R.</hi> is so much out, and has lost his aim in his Comparison, these things are mentioned to rectifie his Judgment; And the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, as now stated, may be better applied to Christ's Kingdom and Government, who though he be the chief Overseer and Shepherd, the great Apostle and Minister, the great Ruler and Governour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he has his Overseers, his Apostles, his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Servants and Helps in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is none other than <hi>Christ's Government</hi> in his Church and Kingdom, and under his Dominion; which I hope our Opposer dare not deny, however he differ with us in the Application.</p>

Thus thou at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts it, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st, <hi>'Tis affirmed of the Pope, that he is Christ's Vicar on Earth—Accounts himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with Power to execute outward Laws, Edicts and Decrees: Herein</hi> (sayst thou) <hi>I place not much difference between the Pope, on the one part, and the Pen-man and some of his the Brethren on the other.</hi> And why so? <hi>The Pen-man and his Brethren</hi> (sayst thou) <hi>account themselves the</hi> Representatives <hi>of Christ's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government over the Conscience,</hi> p. 18. That's an Untruth by the way, and none of our words, but a scornful Pervertion: Where did we so account our selves? 'Tis improper and unsound to say, <hi>That visible Men or finite Creatures are the</hi> Representatives <hi>of Christs inward spiritual Government over the Conscience</hi>; which is endless, and where Christ himself reigns. Where did we ever assume a Government in Christ's stead over the Conscience? But only as his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Witnesses, by his Spirit do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102665:25"/>
our selves to every mans Conscience in the sight of God, and thereby only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present or shew forth by sound Doctrine and good Conversation, That Christ must rule and be obey'd as the Head of his Church; which vastly differs from the Pope's false sence of his being <hi>Christ's Vicar or Representative on Earth.</hi> Thou addest, <hi>viz.</hi> And <hi>that they are invested with Power to execute outward Laws, Edicts and Decrees.</hi> And what follows on thy discovery and similitude? Therefore <hi>the Pope and</hi> G. F. <hi>and his Party seem to be in Vnion, and run Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralel with the Church of</hi> Rome: That's false. The true Apostles and primitive Christians had outward Laws, Commands, Decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they practised: So hath the Pope and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (though not the same.) What follows? Did they therefore seem to be in Union? Thy Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and Inference are fallacious. We differ in the Power and Manner of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and our Laws and Decrees, which Christ hath given us, differ from the Popes. The Popes Power is Carnal and Coercive: Ours, Spiritual and Perswasive. The Popes Ecclesiastical Laws, Edicts, Canons and Decrees are to promote a false Church, Idolatrous Worship and Superstition: Our Laws and Decrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are first writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in our Hearts, and taught us by Christ

Jesus, enjoyning us to eye, believe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, as our Rock, our Way and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Holiness and Purity of Life and Conversation. Therefore thy Comparison is silly and abusive here, as well as Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: The Pope claims a succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,</hi>

            <p>Again, thou proceedest in thy Similitudes, <hi>viz.</hi> 2dly, <hi>The Pope likewise affirms, that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is the true Church, and —in the true Faith: The</hi> Romish <hi>Clergy teach, that we must believe as the Church believes. Herein I cannot justly place much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Popish Clergy and Pen-man, if he approved this Doctrine</hi>; viz.
<q>The true Church is in the true Faith that is in God; and we must either believe thus as the true
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:102665:26"/>
Church believes, or else it were but both a Folly and Hypocrisie to profess our selves Members thereof, <bibl>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 18.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus thou wouldst make me (whom I presume thou intendest) to resemble the Pope and his Clergy, and to seem to be in union with them: But dost thou not own the Doctrine to be true in it self, viz. 1<hi>st,</hi> That the true Church is in the true Faith that is in God; And darest thou deny this? What sayest thou to it? Speak out man, and be plain to the Point. 2<hi>dly,</hi> That we must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe THUS (<hi>i. e</hi> in God) as the true Church believes, or else 'twere Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie to profess our selves Members there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. If thou canst not deny the Doctrine in it self, why hast thou made this an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our seeming to be in union with the <hi>Popish</hi> party? For thou knowest in thy Conscience; <hi>first,</hi> That it was not spoken of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> but in general of <hi>the true Church, whose Faith is</hi> IN GOD, which we neither believe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor does the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believe so of us. Where's then our seeming Union? <hi>secondly,</hi> To believe in God as the true Church doth, herein the true Church is made an instance and example of Faith in God, not to make the Church's believing this or that, the sole Reason and Cause of my (or our) believing the same, this were Implicit; 'tis <hi>as,</hi> not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102665:26"/>
               <hi>because</hi>; for Christ, who is God, is the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal &amp; efficient cause both of the Church's and my <hi>Faith,</hi> which is in him, which is the one, living, substantial Faith, wherein is Unity. Whilst thou canst not confute the said Doctrine, behold thy <hi>Similitude,</hi> what an empty FALSE SHEW it is: What real <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> could escape thy Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Resembling the Pope and his party (nay, how canst thou escape thy self) upon such Fallacious Similitudes as thou hast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented against us? The Pope and his party believe there there is a God, a Christ, a Heaven, a Hell, Immortality, future states: So do all true <hi>Protestants.</hi> What follows according to thy Similitude? <hi>Ergo,</hi> all true <hi>Protestants</hi> seem to be at union with the Pope and his party.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102665:27"/>
and more resembling them, than thou hast resembled <hi>G. F.</hi> and his party to the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> How like a silly Sophister hast thou argued?

            <p>Thou proceedest in thy Similitudes, <hi>viz.</hi> 3dly, <hi>The Popish Clergy think it not fit that the Laity should undertake to treat on points of Divinity, or concern their heads with that, otherwise than to receive those things in the sence the Clergy teacheth. This bespeaks little of any difference at all between the Pen-man and the Popish Clergy</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <q>This man who is thus discomposed in his work, should not have medled so much with points of Divinity, which he appears so little skilful in, <bibl>p. 18.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What was thy design in this Instance, but to render the Pen-man and our second days Meeting so far at unity with the <hi>Popish Clergy,</hi> as not to allow the Laity to treat on points of Divinity? Thou mightst as well have said, that we think not fit that any Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102665:27"/>
should preach among us, which were notoriously false, and against our selves and Practice, and contrary to our constant Testimony, who are no <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> but <hi>Lay-men</hi>

            <p>But to proceed on thy Fallacies, <hi>viz.</hi> 4thly, <hi>Some have esteemed the Authority of the Pope above the Authority of an Oecumenical or General Council, but some others the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; yet both have agreed, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity accompanying the one of them, hath been the highest in the Church, from whence no appeal on Earth In this I cannot of knowledge place much difference between my Adversaries and the</hi> Romish <hi>Church, because I know not but that</hi> G.

the General Meeting may be by others esteemed to be invested with greater Authority than he,</hi> p. 19.</p>
            <p>See now, what amounts thy Similitude unto here? <hi>Thou canst not of knowledge place much difference, &amp;c.</hi> because <hi>thou knowest not but that</hi> G. F.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102665:30"/>
Popes, &amp;c. which thou hast gathered out of the History of the Council of <hi>Trent?</hi> And how easie is it to make Books at that rate? Thou hast known better things of the Ministers of Christ's Light among us, than thus to represent them with thy false Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litudes; and mayest remember, that our frequent Testimony has been (as still it is) to excite People to Christ's Light within, as being <hi>that true Light which is come into the World,</hi> and to his Counsel that proceeds from his Light; and not to the Pope nor any of his Councils. And thy pretended Godly Jealousie, <hi>That</hi> G. F. <hi>hath been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to exhalt his own Imaginations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Christ's Light,</hi> appears Ungodly and False, as many more of thy Jealousies (which are no Proofs) do.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. And now thy Similitudes of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union or difference between the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>G. F.</hi> and his Friends, p. 21, 22. to render him and them worse than the Pope, are as scornful and wicked as thy former; as for instance, to thy saying, <hi>The Pope publisheth his Bull or Decree in his Name; and doth not usually say, 'tis not for want of freeness in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that I desire my Name should be hid: But it appears to me that the Pen-man was</hi> ASHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MED <hi>that his Name should be publisht with the great Bull, entituled, The Accuser of the Brethren cast down.</hi> [Thus thou] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102665:30"/>
thou hast told a gross Perver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Untruth; for the Pen-man neither said, <hi>I desire my Name should be hid,</hi> nor yet was he ASHAMED that his Name should be publisht with that Book thou falsly and scornfully callest, <hi>The Great Bull</hi>; nor doth he or any others concern'd therein, find any Cause to be ashamed thereof, but to stand by it against thy Malice and Abuses in thy <hi>Great Bull,</hi> as it may be rather term'd, for thy attempting therein to Unchristian and Unchurch a great number of faithful Servants of Christ.</p>
            <p>Again, the Reason thou givest, why thy <hi>Adversaries</hi> (as thou callest us) <hi>have not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht thy Body, nor taken away any of thy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, is, But blessed be the Lord, they have no Power so to do.</hi> Herein thou accountest is <hi>some little</hi> difference between them (thou smites at) and <hi>the Lords Inquisitors of the</hi> Popish <hi>Inquisition,</hi> p. 21. I must tell thee, I think this a very Uncharitable censure and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, implying that <hi>they would both punish thy Body, and take away thy Estate, and so be as bad as the Lords of the</hi> Spanish <hi>Inquisition, if they had but Power so to do.</hi> Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks great Prejudice and Darkness to have entred thee. And then, to aggravate the matter, thou turnest it about again, That <hi>they (i. e.</hi> thy Adversaries) <hi>have not suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee to see the Faces or know the Names of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102665:31"/>
thy Judges: In that respect</hi> (sayst thou) <hi>the Lords of the</hi> Spanish <hi>Inquisition have been ore just,</hi> p. 21.</p>
            <p>How odiously and grosly hast thou here represented thy Opposers, who have not divulg'd their Names against thee, of whom I take the Pen-man (and thee to mean my self) to be one; And if so, I must tell thee, thou hast insinuated a gross Slander, to render the Lords of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition more just; and by a Lye justifiest the <hi>Papists,</hi> who clap men up in Prison all their dayes, never letting them know their Accusers; (see the <hi>History of the Inquisition</hi>) for though the name of the Writer was not divulged with that Treatise entituled, <hi>The Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser,</hi> &amp;c. Many others have given their Names in the same judgment concerning thee and thy work of Discord and Enmity, and many more also do own and stand by that Judgment and Treatise: And I must farther tell thee in the sight of God, I see no cause to retract, but to stand by that Treatise, and own my share in it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing thy opposition to the contrary, picking, and nibbling, and quarrelling here and there, but giving the <hi>GO-BY</hi> to the most material parts thereof, wherein the Controversie is most fully opened and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished.</p>

               <p>§. <hi>1. W. R</hi>'s Accusation of endavouring to take away his Credit: Next, to depriving him of his Estate, examined; and the just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our dealing with him, vindicated. What sore Reflection he has brought upon himself by his Complaint, and his acting the part of a <hi>Persecuting Informer,</hi> to render his antient Friends call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> Obnoxious in the Eye of the Law and Authority. §. <hi>2.</hi> His bitterly Inveighing against <hi>C.

R</hi>'s severe and seditious Inferences. §. <hi>4.</hi> W.R. called in question upon his own Principle, for writing in the name and behalf of (and representing) divers Persons, who never chose nor gave him Power, nor allowed him so to do (and his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102665:33"/>
abuse of <hi>E. Burroughs</hi> and <hi>I. Pennington</hi>) whereupon his severe Charge and Inference is all returned upon his own head. §. <hi>5. W. R.</hi> and <hi>F.

W.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. TO prove <hi>that thy Adversaries would cause thee to suffer in Body and Estate, if they had Power</hi>; thou sayst, <hi>They have endeavoured, as much as in them lies, to take away thy Credit, which is next to depriving thee of thy Estate.</hi> And wherein to take away thy Credit? Thou sayest, <hi>The Pen-man hath given thee this sort of Treatment, either in relation to thy self or thy Book,</hi> viz.
<q>Hellish Iealousies, Fiery Agent &amp; Incendiary, his Heart is filled with Pride and Envy. As for <hi>William Rogers's</hi> Book against Church Government, 'tis outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously Wicked, Clamorous and Abusive.</q>
               <hi>I cannot suppose,</hi> (sayst thou)
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102665:34"/>
               <hi>what he means by these his very words <q>[He is here treated far more mildly than his work deserves]</q> unless he believes that my work deserves corporal Punishment, or Confis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Estate. I cannot but again say, Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be the Lord, that the Rigid Vncharitable Pen-man hath not Power so to do.</hi>
  [Thus far thou] p. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>To all which I say, and that in the sight of the Righteous God, who is Judge of all, that I know no Treatment given thee, in these and the like Passages in our Book, than what thou and thine justly deserve, though in much else of ours thou art treated far more mildly, yea, more kindly than thy work deserves. And dost thou indeed judge, that we have endeavoured to take away thy Credit by such kind of Treatment? And that 'tis next to taking away thy Estate? What hast THOU then done against us; yea, against many of the peaceable People called <hi>Quakers?</hi> Hast not rendred us <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> in <hi>notorious Blasphemy, Apostates, Innovators, Imposers of blind Obedience, Popish, Papistical Track, in Vnion with the Pope and his Party, more unjust than the Lords of the</hi> Spanish <hi>Inquisition</hi> (Yea, and at such a time as this, when I presume thou canst not be ignorant, how that many of our Innocent Friends are under severe prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and suffering, both in their Persons
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102665:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Estates) <hi>in the reign of Q.</hi> Elizabeth <hi>and K.</hi> James? How Uncharitable and Unjust? How persecuting Informer-like (all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances considered) is thy Treatment? And how Inhumane, tending to add to these our Afflictions? And yet complainest of our Endeavours to take away thy Credit, and consequently thy Estate, when thou art but justly reprehended, and no other Characters placed on thy Work and Envious Spirit, than what are just, and naturally belong thereunto. Hath it not been our practice from the beginning, to testifie against our Persecutors, and to reprove their Envy and Cruelty? Did we therein go about to bring corporal Punishment and Confiscation of Estate upon them? No sure. Canst thou take liberty to abuse and villifie so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Servants of Christ in Print, and think they must all be mute under thy Abuses, and none to reprehend thee? No such matter. They that have but the least spark of holy Zeal, or but any Life or Soul for God, must needs be kindled in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against thy abominable Abuses and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious persecuting Work. It seems, thou valuest thy own Credit and Estate at a high rate above others: Thou seemest little to value the Credit, Liberty or Estates of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, (even of thy antient Friends, called <hi>Quakers</hi>) to brand and stigmatize
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:102665:35"/>
them, as thou hast done, with as Infamous Characters, yea, and as Obnoxious in the Eye of Law and Authority, as thou easily canst, and yet complainest of Endeavours to destroy thy Credit and Estate, when thou hast given the first occasion of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension and Judgment given upon thee and thy work of Malice. Thou hast begun the Fray publickly, and broke the Peace; now complainest of <hi>Vncharitable Treatment.</hi> First thou art Barking, Snapping and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then art Complaining and Why<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when a little Whipt for thy Folly, thy Pievish and Ugly Behaviour. Oh! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and Partial Man! Hast thou done as thou wouldst be done by? For shame give over thy malicious and fruitless At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. Again, 'tis observable how bitterly thou still inveighs against <hi>Charles Marshall</hi> and the Sixty five Persons more, about the Paper touching <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> as judging it <hi>In some respect to be much like the Bull given forth by Pope</hi> Leo <hi>the Tenth, against</hi> Martin Luther, <hi>Anno</hi> 1520. <hi>But yet in one main Point greatly differs; for</hi> (sayest thou) <hi>in the Bull there are Forty two Articles of Doctrine condemned, and the Bull ordered to be read in every place, that the matters for which he was prosecuted as an Heretick might be known. But
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:102665:35"/>
in the aforesaid Paper, subscribed by</hi> Charles Marshall, <hi>&amp;c. There is no mention of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Doctrine, or Vitiousness of Life, for which they are persecuted by their Brethren,</hi> p. 22. [Thus far thou.]</p>
            <p>Whence three things are to be observed, 1<hi>st,</hi> That the said Paper is compared to the Pope's Bull, as much like it in some respect: 2<hi>dly,</hi> That its deem'd worse than the Pope's Bull, in not mentioning any particular Doctrine or Vitious Life against <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> 3<hi>dly,</hi> That they who subscribed the said Paper, were persecutors of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Whereof thou knowest <hi>William Penn</hi> was one: How foully hast thou asperst and represented <hi>C. M.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> &amp;c. in these things? And how do these Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons against him, and thy rendring him a Persecutor of his Brethren, agree with his being <hi>Dear W. P. This Noble man,</hi> &amp;c? as thy Brother <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and consequently thy self, have rendred him, being in thy Book, pag. 73.74.</p>
            <p>As for their not mentioning any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Doctrine or Vitious Life, that others might know the matters alledged against them; what, wouldst infer that therefore the Pope's Bull against <hi>M. Luther</hi> was more reasonable or just? That's a mistake, for thou confessest a Judgment to be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that <hi>jealous, rending and separate Spirit</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:102665:36"/>
from which thou hast not cleared them (but rendred them the more Guilty, if thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est their Representatives, as impowered by them to write in their Vindication, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy own reflection on us.) And was that no Reason then to give others notice and warning against such a Spirit? Is <hi>Schism</hi> no Sin, or not reproveable? But how Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just is thy Comparison? I ask thee, if thou darest say, that Pope <hi>Leo</hi> (that <hi>Atheist</hi>) was in the same Sense, Religion, Gravity and tender Exercise toward <hi>M. Luther,</hi> that in thy own Narrative thou hast rendred these Friends in, that were concern'd in dealing with <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> at <hi>Drawell</hi>? And I ask thee further, If ever thou readst any such Acknowledgment, Submission or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation made by <hi>Martin Luther</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the said <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> with thy own assistance, made as satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Brethren, and the Church of God in general? Though afterward thou comparedst it to a Rattle to please Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And hath a <hi>Christian</hi> Society no Power to reprove and judge a dividing, self-separating Spirit, (in whomsoever it be) that makes Rents and Schisms, as well as Heretical Doctrine, and Vitious or Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous living? <hi>Mark them that cause Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Offences, and avoid them,</hi> &amp;c. If thou grantest the Principle, and such
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:102665:36"/>
power in a <hi>Christian</hi> Society or Church, what will thy attempts to Unchristian and Unchurch us avail, unless thou canst prove us guilty of Vitious Lives and Heretical Doctrine? Which if thou canst not, then hast thou and thy party assumed a Power to judge of Spirits, wherein you fairly give away your Cause, and overthrow much of your own opposition to the Churches Power and Determination in such cases? And your Judgment to Unchristian us or our Spirits, being but your Imposition, we shall as little value; and the day will yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discover whose Spirits are Unchristian, and whose Spirits are Christian. And 'tis not thy boasting either of the Numerousness or Scores (of thy party) p. 23. that will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide the Controversie; nor wouldst thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of such a Plea on our parts, but doubtless esteem it no <hi>Christian</hi> Proof or Argument, but an Imposition, and begging the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion: But seeing thou layest so much stress on thy Numbers and Scores, I must tell thee, that if they amounted to as many as the third part of the Stars (which yet they are far short of) that followed thee, or owned thy Work of opposition &amp; strife, they would be but wandring Stars, and have lost their Habitations and Glory, and are darkned, whom the Dragon's Tayl has drawn and cast down to the Earth. But blessed be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:102665:37"/>
the Lord our God, the greater part of the Stars, among us his People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have kept their Station and Splendor in the Firmament of his Power, and in living Union, Concord and Love, wherein they live above that Spirit of Enmity and Discord which thou and thy party are in, and which the Lord will yet farther disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and deliver those who are at unawares betrayed thereby, yet have some secret Breathings unto him, and that they may come into clearness of Judgment, so as on the Restoration and increase of the number of the Faithful and Upright: And by the spreading of the Gospel day, thy Numbers shall decrease; and many will come to see thee more and more in thy dark and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous attempts, and how insuccesful and disappointed thou wilt be therein. And those that come to be recovered, and many Thousands that shall be gathered to the Lord and us his People, shall be found bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more worthy, than thy self, and those that go out and separate from us.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. <hi>W. R.</hi> is pleased to make a Charge, and draw severe and seditious Inferences upon our <hi>Advertisement,</hi> and conclusion of our <hi>Introduction,</hi> especially against the Pen-man, for vindicating <hi>the People called Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> in their Church-Order and Discipline,

But that, 1. <hi>We could not write in the Name of such as encouraged the publication of his Treatise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, The Christian-Quaker, in five parts, who yet are a part of the People called Quakers.</hi> (saith he) 2. <hi>Nor in the Names of such as are disaffected with laying Marriages before Womens Meetings; And these are numerous, and called Quakers</hi> (quoth he) To the <hi>first</hi>; Answer, No: How should we write in their Names, who encouraged the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of his said Treatise against us (if any such were, for they keep very obscure, as not willing to be known in such encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.) It is a Book of Envy, Strife and Discord, and they no <hi>Peaceable Quakers</hi> who encouraged it. 'Twas <hi>the Peaceable People called Quakers</hi> that were concerned in our Vindication: And therefore <hi>W. R.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:102665:38"/>
saith true, as't happens; <hi>The Pen-man could not write in the Name of such as encouraged the Publication of his Book.</hi> Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, they were not of that Peaceable sort which he vindicated, nor <hi>W. R</hi>'s Book a work of Peace, or in the least tending thereto, but a great Abuse and Scandal to, and against the very peaceable People called <hi>Quakers. Secondly</hi>; Nor are they who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our Godly Women's Meetings, and laying Marriages before them, so peaceable and clear in their minds (in that point) as we could wish they were, and they should be better informed, and hear Instruction: However, they also are concluded by <hi>W.R.</hi>'s words, not to be of that <hi>Peaceable</hi> People called <hi>Quakers</hi> intended in our Vindication, in that he saith, <hi>The Pen-man cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to write in their Names</hi>; when 'tis most evident he did write in the Name of <hi>The Peaceable Christian People called Quakers.</hi> Though <hi>W. R.</hi> as one in some wise Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, leaves out the word [<hi>Peaceable</hi>] that he might with the greater colour draw his Charge and severe Inferences upon the Pen-man, &amp;c. But such kind of slighty mean shifts will stand him in no stead, when we strictly look into his Fallacious dealing.</p>
            <p>And granting him that we cannot repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent (nor be understood to write in the Name of) such <hi>Quakers</hi> (so called) as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102665:38"/>
the publication of his persecuting Books and Pamphlets against us, nor of such as either oppose our Womens Meetings, or laying Marriages before them, or are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected there-with, nor in the Names of <hi>the several Scores</hi> he tells of, <hi>who gave Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in Writing against</hi> Charles Marshall <hi>and Sixty five more.</hi> (The greatest part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being known to be Faithful men of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and service in the Lord's work) Nor in the Names of such as he saith <hi>appear Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral in the present Controversie, and yet own the same Principles which he and his party do.</hi> Where is then their Neutrallity? is it in having <hi>no concern of Conscience outwarly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on either party,</hi> as <hi>W. R.</hi> saith? Then they are only Neutrals in appearance, but secretly of his party and Principles, some whereof are very perverse and unpeaceable, as well as unsound. Now I say, we grant that we of the Second day's Meeting did not represent such kind of <hi>Quakers</hi> as those of <hi>W. R.</hi> his party; nor could they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power us in our writing for, and represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>peaceable People called Quakers,</hi> or that peaceable sort of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are for Unity, Love, Concord and Peace in the Church of Christ among us, nor was it our intention to represent, personate or vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate such pretended <hi>Quakers,</hi> as are in a Spirit of discord and strife, causing and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:102665:39"/>
making Divisions, Rents and Schismes in the Church (first disturbing and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, then reproaching the Society they sometime owned) but only those of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mind and Spirit; and therefore <hi>his not knowing that we can represent any under that Name, more than our own Second day's Meeting,</hi> is a false insinuation; for there are many Thousands of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> yea, of the most sincere and peaceable minded, besides our said Meeting, whose real sense and judgment (in the matters treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in our Book, against <hi>W. R</hi>'s great Book) we have represented, and who real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do and will own the same. Where now hath <hi>W. R.</hi> shown <hi>the Pen-man guilty of great Impudence,</hi> in writing in behalf of the peaceable People called <hi>Quakers</hi>? The word <hi>Peaceable</hi> in our <hi>Advertisement,</hi> left out by him, doth really distinguish it, with respect only to <hi>the peaceable sort,</hi> which are they that live in Love and Unity, who may properly be termed <hi>The</hi> PEOPLE <hi>called Quakers,</hi> as united in one Society, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one People, and not dividing separate Spirits, who are gone out from us. And though in our <hi>Introduction,</hi> we say the terms <hi>We</hi> and <hi>Vs</hi> are used, <hi>sometimes in the Name of the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>when vindicated from his Scandals.</hi> I say so still. And this intends no other than the <hi>Peaceable People,</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:102665:39"/>
(as before explain'd in our <hi>Advertisement</hi>) and not any such pretended <hi>Quakers,</hi> as <hi>W. R.</hi> his party and Abettors, who are unpeaceable and turbulent to the Society and People among whom they sometime walked. And therefore his roaring and clamouring out <hi>great Impudence, Pride, and height of such towring lofty spirited Persons as the Pen-man,</hi> &amp;c. are but empty Clamours and Abuses, as is also his Jealousie, <hi>That the Pen-man counts himself one of the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentatives of Christ's inward Government,</hi> who alone is Lord over the Conscience. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Pen-man never so accounted of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, nor ever assumed to himself any such Government or Lordship over the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as is peculiar to Christ alone; but only accounts himself a Servant of Christ, and a Subject under his <hi>spiritual</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And therefore <hi>W. R</hi>'s still proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his roaring and bitter Exclamation against him, as <hi>That he would represent in Print, as if the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>triction</hi> (a Lye still) <hi>were Persons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering such an imperious Map of Pride and Drollery, as the Pen-man shews himself to write in their Names.</hi> The matter is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered before; but yet I may further add, as the Envy and Malice of this Adversary appears swelling high, so his confidently repeated Falshoods and Abuses are nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous;
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:102665:40"/>
for we would neither so represent in Print, nor yet did the Pen-man so much as pretend to be <hi>impowered to write by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, or without restriction</hi>; and yet both in Charity and Christian duty, might vindicate all them as the <hi>peaceable</hi> People ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are really <hi>peaceable</hi> in their Spirits and Conversations: And though there be some called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who are unpeaceable in both such as <hi>W.R.</hi> and his party; yet that cannot unpeople the other, who are truly peaceable, but rather unpeople themselves, who are unpeaceable, from being of that People: Such our vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of a peaceable People from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable, proves none of us Impudent, nor any <hi>imperious Map of Pride and Drollery, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Falshood, &amp;c.</hi> as most unjustly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by an imperious proud Adversary. For hath it not been frequent with us, to vindicate the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>? in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending all those that might properly be counted a People in Peace and Unity, and that from the general Aspersions and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, both of open and secret Enemies: And in this Controversie we vindicate them as that peaceable People, who are sincere and faithful to God, lovers of Peace, Unity and good Order, and whom <hi>W. R.</hi> and his party, in their dividing and perverse gain-sayings, are not able to unpeople, nor justly to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102665:40"/>
themselves that People. As for him and those of his party, who promote his malicious, persecuting, defaming Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We cannot look upon them worthy to bear so much as the Name <hi>Quakers,</hi> much<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less to be deemed that People under the Title of <hi>Christian-Quakers,</hi> whilst in their Unchristian spirit of strife and discord: And they will yet more manifest themselves to be further remote from that peaceable People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> if they Repent not; and the peaceable and faithful, who love unity and peace in our Lord Jesus Christ, shall remain a people, and live when all such spirits as lust to envy and contention, shall be confounded, scattered, wither, be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back and come to naught in their evil Designs and wicked Attempts; the Breath of the Lord shall scatter them; <hi>for no Weapon formed against his Heritage shall prosper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! our Adversary is still in a great fude and fret for our writing in behalf, or in the name of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> (reiterating his Falshood again) <hi>without Restriction,</hi> p. 24, 25. he should have said, <hi>Peaceable People called Quakers.</hi> But he goes on at an outragious rate on this subject, confessing, <hi>He wants words to represent the Action in as ugly a dress as it deserves.</hi> And therefore when he hath as falsly asperst the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102665:41"/>
Pen-man, and set him out in as <hi>Vgly a Dress</hi> as he can (so that the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>William Rogers</hi> have done their worst hitherto) he supposeth a Comparison in the case against him, but very unjustly in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppose a company of men, never chosen ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, should meet at</hi> Westminster, <hi>and call themselves the</hi> Representatives of the People of England, <hi>and accordingly in the Name of the People of</hi> England <hi>proceed to act as such: Wouldst thou not abhor and detest the Action? And how canst thou think that we can do less than detest thy insolent Spirit, by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to write in the Name of the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>without Restriction, when they gave neither thee nor any of thy Brethren such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority? Had the fear of God been before thine Eyes, thou couldst not have attempted to have done so Wickedly,</hi> p. 25.</p>
            <p>Here it is probable he thinks, he hath given the <hi>Pen-man</hi> a deadly Blow; but when the <hi>Devil</hi> and <hi>William Rogers</hi> have done their worst, it comes to little Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to manifest his Envy and Folly. He only shews his Teeth, but cannot bite nor fasten; for there is no just paralel in the case; there is no such kind of Treason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proceeding justly chargeable upon the <hi>Pen-man,</hi> as is inferred in the Comparison: The Pen-man did not call himself the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative,</hi> nor write in the Name of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102665:41"/>
People (or of all those) called <hi>Quakers,</hi> without Restriction, as he falsly saith, nor pretend an Election or Authority from them so to do; the matter is distinguished and answered before, and yet the Pen-man might lawfully represent the Innocency of all true peaceable <hi>Quakers,</hi> both as to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Practice, when abused and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated, either as <hi>Vnchristian</hi> or <hi>Popish Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, &amp;c. without Conviction</hi> (like as this Adversary hath frequently misrepresented them) And this may be done charitably, freely and voluntarily in their Name and Vindication, and in true Unity, from a right knowledge of their Innocency, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Sense and Principles; And hath not this been the Practice of many faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ among us, ever since we were a People, to write both in the name &amp; vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the People of <hi>God</hi> called <hi>Quakers,</hi> or of the <hi>Innocent People</hi> called <hi>Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. as the Lord hath laid a necessity upon them, and yet not to include those who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful or scandalous to Truth, or any who are turned into Envy and Strife, though they go under that Name? Nor yet have they sought or needed to seek Commission from the whole People, to write in their behalf, being required of the Lord to write. And did not many of the best reformed Protestants and Martyrs write in the name
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102665:42"/>
and behalf of the Protestant Church and Religion, as the Book of Martyrs and other Histories, and their own Writings shew; of which numerous Instances might be given. And did not the the Apostles of Christ often write in the <hi>Plural,</hi> both in the name and behalf of themselves and the rest of true Believers and Fellow-members, under the terms, <hi>We,</hi> and <hi>Vs,</hi> and <hi>Our,</hi> &amp;c. especially in that of 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. <hi>They went out from</hi> Us, <hi>but they were not of</hi> Us; <hi>for if they had been of</hi> Us, <hi>they would no doubt have continued with</hi> Us; see chap. 3.14. and 4.6. Here <hi>John</hi> wrote in the Name of his Brethren and Fellow-members, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished themselves from those that went out from them, as we have our selves, as a peaceable People, from you that are gone out from us, into a <hi>Spirit of Enmity, Discord</hi> and <hi>Self-separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. But (<hi>W. R.</hi>) since thou countest it such a <hi>horrid Crime,</hi> such <hi>great Impudence, Pride, ugly Action, Insolence, &amp;c.</hi> to write in the name or on the behalf of People or Persons, or in their Vindication, without being impowered, authorized and chosen by the same Persons or People. Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve well upon thy own principle and way of arguing, what a Reckoning I have with thee: Let us seriously enquire of thee,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:102665:42"/>
Have all those Persons in whose behalf and Name thou hast written in the <hi>Plural</hi> (under the Terms <hi>We, Vs, &amp;c</hi>) given thee Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or chosen thee to write in their Name and behalf? Did <hi>John Story, John Wilkinson,</hi> and now the person in <hi>Cambridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> (whom thou and <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> contend for, against the Record about his Marriage) all give thee Authority (or chuse thee) to write on their behalf, and to expose their Names in Print, as thou hast done in thy state of the Controversie on their behalf? Did they give thee Authority to write in their names and behalf, as those <hi>Other Friends in Truth</hi> thou tellest of and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentest? Either they did, or they did not; if they did, then they may be entituled to, and are justly chargeable with thy work, how perverse and abusive soever it be; If they did not chuse nor authorize thee to write in their behalf and name, then thy own Judgment returns upon thy own head, as <hi>one guilty of great Impudence, Pride, towr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lofty Spirit, notorious Falshood, ugly Dress, &amp;c.</hi> to write in the name and vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Persons, and to represent them who never gave thee Power, nor chose thee to thy work. Didst not thou pretend to write <hi>on behalf of thy self, and other Friends in Truth concerned,</hi> as in the Title-page of thy great Book? and now to use the words
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:102665:43"/>
               <hi>Vs, We</hi> or <hi>Our,</hi> with respect to such as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the giving forth thereof, as in thy Advertisement to thy seventh part? When now divers noted Persons, who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared of thy party, refuse to stand by thy Books; and we know none of them that dare say, they gave thee any such Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or chose thee to be their Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to write in their name and behalf, as thou hast done (against many faithful Friends, whom the Lord is with and will stand by, against thy crooked Spirit and Opposition) but rather, those thy <hi>Friends in Truth</hi> pretended (on enquiry, if they own and will stand by thy Books) as it has been often asked them, particularly at <hi>Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire-house,</hi> in 1681. have answered, <hi>That</hi> William Rogers <hi>must answer for himself, if he hath done more than he can answer, or wronged any: They will not stand by him; 'Tis his own Act, he must look to it, &amp;c.</hi> Thus upon a pinch they leave him in the lurch to shift for himself; they'l not stand by him openly however; they own him not for their Representative, though he hath represented them, and written as in their Name, Person and Vindication; as also represented them as Encouragers of the giving forth of his great Book, falsly stiled, <hi>The Christian-Quaker, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to deal more closely and positively
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:102665:43"/>
with thee in this matter, how camest thou to expose <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> Name in Print, and to represent him as a Person of thy Principle and Judgment, by a confused, unsound whimsical Paper, which thou hast printed in thy great Book, with <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>'s Name put to it, and represented it as his Testimony, and even in thy Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page sayst, it was <hi>given forth in the year</hi> 1661. <hi>by Edw. Burroughs,</hi> and since the same is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed over and over by thy busie inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Agent <hi>Thomas Crisp,</hi> as <hi>E. B</hi>'s <hi>Vision</hi>; but I am perswaded thou and he have grosly abused and mis-represented that Servant of the Lord <hi>E. B.</hi> by rendring him the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of such Absurdities as are contained in that same Paper about the <hi>Shepherd</hi> and his <hi>Dogs, &amp;c.</hi> particularly in that passage of the
<q>Shepherd's gathering the Sheep with the many Goats, that did push, trouble and hurt the Sheep with their Horns, and putting them into the Fold; and that he made fast the door, and would not separate them until he had the other Sheep also, that did not come with the Flock.</q>
See what Doctrine this is, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Christ, the good Shepherd, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring him so severe to his Sheep, as to gather, shut up and keep so many Goats, so long among them in his Fold, to trouble, bruise and hurt his poor Sheep with their Horns.
And also, that <hi>Warning</hi> and <hi>Precept</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:102665:44"/>
given in the said Paper <hi>to Friends,</hi> 
               <q>for all to forbear judging any man any more, upon any pretence whatsoever:</q>
Can any that knew <hi>E. B.</hi> and the soundness of judgment &amp; understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he was attain'd to in the year 1661. believe that he was the Author of such Doctrine to all Friends, as to <hi>judge no man under any pretence whatsoever?</hi> A man well known severely to judge deceitful Workers and rebellious Ones, as (yea, he testified plainly against <hi>John Perrot</hi>'s spirit of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion) is fully evinced in his Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. And I dare presume <hi>E.B.</hi> never gave thee authority, nor chose thee or <hi>Tho. Crisp</hi> to represent him in print (so many years after his decease) as the Author of the said Paper or <hi>warning to all friends, To judge no man under any pretence whatsoever:</hi> And yet thou art severely judging and reproaching others that are not of thy party as <hi>Apostates, Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, &amp;c.</hi> contrary to such an express <hi>precept</hi> &amp; <hi>doctrine</hi> espoused by thee, as <hi>E.B</hi>'s Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Besides the express contradiction to thy self in thus representing <hi>E. B.</hi> in print, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his leave, authority or consent, what great abuse hast thou done to him, his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Name and Testimony, in exposing him in Print, as Author of that which doth not so much as look like him or his Testimony, or any Vision of his, but in the said Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines both contrary to his Judgment and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:102665:44"/>
Practice? I say, what a horrid Abuse hast thou done to the Name and Memory of the dead in Christ, and that by promoting a forged Subscription, if thou canst not give sufficient demonstration and proof, that <hi>Edw. Burroughs</hi> was the Author of the same Paper aforesaid, which thou hast ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in his name in Print? If thou sayst, <hi>it was delivered to thee with</hi> Edw. Burrough<hi>'s name to it:</hi> I say, that's no proof of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his; for both I and divers others have seen a Copy of the same only with <hi>J. Perrots</hi> name to it; and this more probably true, that he was the Author, for divers reasons, than thy rendring <hi>E. B.</hi> the Author.</p>
            <p>Again, thou hast also exposed that honest and innocent Person <hi>Isaac Pennington</hi> in Print, to serve thy own turn and thy parties, as a Confirmation of thy work, and that after his decease also, for which I dare presume he gave thee no authority, nor chose thee so to represent him in Print, or to pick out of the middle, diminish or curtalize his Writings or Testimony, by leaving out the most material and explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory precedent and subsequent Passages thereof, to the great injury and abuse of his Intention; for which his Son <hi>John Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi> was stirred up to vindicate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased Father, and to detect thy abuse and Prevarication. And am satisfied, that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:102665:45"/>
neither <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> nor <hi>John Crook</hi> gave thee Authority to quote or cite them, or either of them in opposition to <hi>G. F.</hi> as thou hast <hi>John Crook</hi> especially, in thy <hi>Epistle,</hi> pag. 3. nor to tell the World in Print, <hi>That his Testimony is agreeable to thy sence:</hi> I do not believe <hi>J. C.</hi> will in the least own thee in thy work of Opposition, and strife against many faithful Servants of Christ.</p>
            <p>Also, thou and <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented <hi>William Penn</hi> in Print, on some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages pickt out of his <hi>Address to Protestants,</hi> as in thy 66 and 73 pages, which he never gave you power to do, much less to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent him (as if he were one in Judgment with you against his Brethren) nor did he give thee or <hi>F. Bugg</hi> leave to discant upon and turn his words to serve your own turns, nor to apply them against such his Friends in the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> or else-where, who are for Womens Meetings, and laying Marriages twice before the Mens and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meetings; it is not to be supposed, that he intended [<hi>Fly Rome at Home</hi>] as proper Admonition to them, as thy Brother <hi>F. Bugg</hi> applies them, as in the Authority and genuine sence of <hi>Dear W. P.</hi> p. 78. calling <hi>William Penn, Dear Friend,</hi> p. 65. <hi>This Noble Man, &amp;c.</hi> p. 73. Which is to render <hi>W. P.</hi> exactly one of your own
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:102665:45"/>
party; and all this without his authority leave or consent.</p>
            <p>But how comes he now to be <hi>Dear William Penn, Dear Friend,</hi> and <hi>This Noble man?</hi> Hast not thou numbred him among the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> as thou esteemest <hi>Charles Marshall</hi> and <hi>Sixty Five</hi> more (as thy phrase is) who signed the Paper thou art so much offended at? p. 22, 27. Was not <hi>William Penn</hi> one of those sixty six Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers? And dost not thou on this very occasion retort his words [<hi>Let us fly</hi> Rome <hi>at Home?</hi>] What! must he therefore be a Persecutor of his Brethren, and yet a <hi>Dear Friend, Dear William Penn, This Noble man, &amp;c.</hi> in thy Book? What Self-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and manifest Flattery art thou and thy Brother <hi>Bugg</hi> (like Parasites) guilty of? Pray lift up your Eyes and see your selves, if not judicially given over to blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and hardness of heart.</p>
            <p>Take another Instance or two of thy Self-contradictory dealing; Didst not thou expose a Certificate or Testimony (as thou esteemedst it) of <hi>Nathaniel Crips</hi> in Print against <hi>G. F.</hi> without any Authority from <hi>Nathaniel</hi> for so doing? I am sure he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest as much to me and <hi>John Bouldron</hi> the 6th Moneth, 1679. against thy publishing it in Manuscript, as that thou didst it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>Now may not I rationally take leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect and argue, <hi>ad hominem,</hi> upon thee, and according to thy own Terms thus, <hi>Oh! thou Imperious Map of Pride, towring lofty and Lordly Spirit, insolent and conceited, proud Vsurper!</hi> how durst thou either write in the name or behalf of so many, whom thou countest Friends in Truth, and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous too? or expose the names of so many deceased Servants of Christ in thy Quarrel, as if they were all on thy side and party, when thy gave thee no power, nor deputed thee so to do? And thou must answer for thy misrepresenting them, and abusing their Names, Memories and Testimonies, when the chieftains of thy own party dare not stand by thy work, nor own thee for their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:102665:46"/>
Representative, but leave thee to stand by it thy self, as thy own. What an unjust and false Representative hast thou shewn thy self, by thy own rule and manner of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon others? though I am apt to think that some few have privately encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thee in thy travail, who now are afraid publickly to stand by thy deform'd, inform unshapely and monstrous Birth, begotten and brought forth by the old Accuser of the Brethren; though some are not ashamed to promote and expose it to Sale, but it will turn to their own shame, and be their burden at length.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5 Again, to prove thy false charge of <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Innovation</hi> against us (p. 26.) thou insistest on a Record in the Quarterly Meeting Book at <hi>Haden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely</hi> about <note n="*" place="margin">I tenderly forbear exposing the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's name at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, believing that 'twas not by his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or consent that <hi>W.R. &amp; F B.</hi> have made him such a subject of printed controversie; as also hoping that he has more <hi>charity</hi> &amp; <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness</hi> in him than to allow of their malicious Books.</note> a Marriage, shewing Friends dislike of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union there-with.

And further sayst, G. W. <hi>smoothed up the</hi> Barbadoes <hi>Meeters with this Expression, We know you aim at the best things,</hi> p. 82.

and yet be mistaken in some cases? What Absurdity then have I committed, in telling them (whom I believed had a good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though otherwise mistaken) they aim'd at the best things.

            <p>Whereas our charitable, tender and friendly Treatment of them in <hi>Barbadoes</hi> rather shews, that we were not willing to reject, exclude or unfriend Persons for one or two Mistakes, than to seek Lordship over them or theirs, who otherwise were so well meaning, as that we had cause to believe, that God would rectifie their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and set them to rights in all their Undertakings.

            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. IT is true, and I am still of the same mind, that having the great ends of true Religion and Christian Society in our Eye, viz. <hi>An unspotted Life, Love and good Works, &amp;c.</hi> as the very intent of our care and proceedings in the Church of Christ, we can the more easily concur and accord as to Circumstances and outward Methods, and in the Wisdom of God so condescend one to another, and accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date matters as not to divide about them, &amp;c. And I do not find that our Opposer produceth any <hi>seeming Contradiction</hi> to this Citation out of our Book, as he endeavours upon our following words, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>We would be understood that those things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended among us as necessary for <hi>good Order and Holiness of Conversation</hi> are not recommended doubtfully, or upon meer Supposition, nor as matters of indifferency to be practised or rejected, but in faith &amp; full assurance, as answering Gods Witness and Truth in the Consciences; and that such will meet with a tender Reception, and not Opposition in all tender and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right hearts.</q>
Where's now the seeming Contradiction in this to the precedent Passage? See what observation our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:102665:53"/>
makes upon them. He observes, <hi>That the Penman seems thereby to look three ways at once,</hi> p. 36. [though his sight and observation has greatly fail'd him herein] as first, In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending things necessary for good Order and Holiness of Conversation, <hi>NOT</hi> as matters of Indifferency. To this <hi>W. R.</hi> thus saith, viz. <hi>Wherein I take the truest sense of his mind to be (and that the first citation importing his readiness to condescend) was to cover himself and others from the guilt of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy and Innovation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is mistaken in his observation here; there was no such intent nor necessity for the <hi>Pen-man</hi> to cover himself or others from that guilt, for to commend things necessary for good Order and Holiness of Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>not as Indifferent,</hi> but <hi>Essential</hi> to such Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and a Condescention in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, and accomodating matters, so as not to divide, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may very well stand together, especially where there's unity of spirit and affection; for if there be true love and unity in the greater matters, essential to good Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 'tis more easie for such as are tender and upright-hearted to find out accomodation and concurrence in lesser circumstances. So that still 'tis to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, they must settle in an union and concurrence at last; otherwise, how should they joyntly do business or service for the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:102665:53"/>
Truth or each other? There's no concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence nor joynt-service where there's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion and contradiction.</p>
            <p>But <hi>W. R.</hi> proceeds in his observation against the Pen-men, <hi>viz.</hi> 2dly, <hi>By his readiness to condescend to his Brethren (which doubtless in that place he intends such as are upright hearted, and mean well for 'tis not fit to condescend to others) and therein the indifferency before excluded is implyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He's mistaken again in's observation; for there may be a tender and Christian condescention of the upright hearted among themselves, in two respects:</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In the stronger bearing with, and helping the weak, bearing the burden of the weak, and not laying more upon the weak than what they are able to bear.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> In the wisdom of God finding out such accomodation, in some lesser matters &amp; circumstances not so essential and indispensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; so that there may be a general concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ease and peace of spirit in such lesser circumstances, implying or including that indifferency before which is excluded the greater, more weighty and necessary things relating to good Order, holiness of Life, &amp;c. For there may be such an <hi>indifferency</hi> in some circumstances, wherein we may condescend to weak Brethren so far as the spirit of Christ will admit; they being such as may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:102665:54"/>
not alter the property from being good and lawful, nor disturbing to our <hi>Christian-society.</hi> Yet there are other material things and circumstances relating our Christian society, good order and holy living, that cannot be made Indifferent. And we plead not at all for empty Ceremonies in Church order or discipline, but such as have a real service and good end in them; nor are we for a Church whose ornaments are superstitious, but for a Church which is gravely and purely adorned with Righteousness, the fruits and services of pure Religion.</p>
            <p>I confess <hi>W. R.</hi> has writ one remarkable Truth, i. e. <hi>That 'tis not fit to condescend to others,</hi> viz. <hi>That are not upright hearted, that do not mean well:</hi> Very true. And we have cause to keep to that Doctrine, in reference to such as are turbulent and contentious Troublers of and scandalous to our society and profession.</p>
            <p>See his third Observation on the same subject before, as shallow as the rest, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, <hi>By the Pen-man's last cited Lines, 'tis plain, that in his sence things recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for good Order will have a reception with all upright Hearts: Which compared with his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to condescend,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(as before) shews, as if his condescention was intended to Brethren that were not upright hearted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here his sight fails him, and he's greatly
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:102665:54"/>
mistaken again, <hi>perverting</hi> the <hi>Pen-mans</hi> sense; for though I affirm, that those things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended among us by <hi>Divine</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">As our words are, <hi>Accuser,</hi> p. 136.</note> 
               <hi>Authority and Evidence</hi> (either as duty to God or Man, or as necessary for good Order and Holiness of Conversation) will have reception with all upright Hearts. Yet it follows not, that the condescention was intended to Brethren that were <hi>Not</hi> upright hearted, or false. For <hi>first,</hi> Here's not a limitation of time when all things necessary (as before) will have reception with all upright hearts: So that there is a time and cause for condescention to them of low degree, in regard of their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (not insincerity.) <hi>Secondly,</hi> Many upright ones do not presently or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly see every thing that is recommended in the wisdom of God to be practised, but must have time to weigh and consider mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before the Lord first, in order to receive a clear understanding and judgment from him, before they act therein. So that in the mean time there must be a tender condescention, patience and forbearance on all hands towards such, not to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or judge their want of present clearness (and their present fear to act because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) an act of Refusal or Rebellion on their parts: No, no, far be it from us; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:102665:55"/>
that such upright hearted ones, even when but in a poor low and weak state, will not oppose, refuse or gain-say any thing they at present see not that's either in it self good and honest, or necessary for good order and society, their uprightness, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness, honesty and fear towards God, preserves them from contention and blind opposition in such cases, whilst given up tenderly to wait till God reveal that unto them (whether immediately or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally) which for a time they have not clearness in: And be sure, he will not be awanting in his divine counsel and openings to such.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. To his charging the Pen-man with <hi>a groundness Complaint of Printing against</hi> G. F. <hi>without first proceeding judicially, or hearing of matters face to face,</hi> p. 39.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Groundless Complaint</hi>] is an untruth; there was manifest ground for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint on <hi>W. R</hi>'s own confession and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, <hi>viz.</hi> his enveighing <hi>against judging any man without hearing him: Judging the merit of the cause without hearing the same: Judging and Censuring a Person unheard in the defence of himself, as being a grand Mark of Apostacy,</hi> as in his Preface to his <hi>Christian-Quaker.</hi> That <hi>W. R.</hi> has so (<hi>ipso facto</hi>) judged and condemned G. F. and others in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:102665:55"/>
divers things unheard in their own defence, we have produced divers sufficient and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered Instances in our Treatise entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The Accuser of our Brethren cast down</hi>; and particularly his false construction on <hi>G.

F. <hi>lies to obstruct Friends from bargaining with such whom he condemns, as having no right to bargain, buy or sell, until they answer by Condemnation; or else, that his meaning was, that</hi> G. F. <hi>would not have Friends discourse with such, nor yet to agree about any orderly Conference, in order to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation or Hearing of Differences,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>concluding it must be one of these two meanings, because a third he could not think of,</hi> as the matter is fully treated on in our said Treatise, <hi>Accuser,</hi> p. 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, &amp;c. in which <hi>W. R</hi>'s judgment, and both his supposed Meanings are proved untrue. But still, to aggravate the matter against <hi>G.

This still the more confirms the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint against him, <hi>viz.</hi> his Printing against

               <hi>G.

And his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>That such a Meeting will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended to,</hi> will not excuse the fact, that is, his judging and censuring a Person unheard in his own defence, &amp;c. as a <hi>grand Mark of Apostacy.</hi> He might have had patience, and rather waited an opportunity for meeting with <hi>G.

            <p n="3">§. 3. Now wherein doth the Pen-man's <hi>false Suggestion and Vnchristian-like Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> consist, to prove him <hi>an Impious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicator, or down-right Forger,</hi> as <hi>W.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I shall at present cite only a few Instances thereof in his own words,</hi> (quoth he) <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>p. 73. His main work is still to invalidate the Authority and Sentence of the true Church. <hi>Pag.</hi> 87. Which answers and confutes <hi>W. R.</hi> in opposing outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:102665:56"/>
Methods and Forms relating to Church Government. <hi>Pag.</hi> 88. His prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Objection against outward Orders, Prescriptions, Sentences, Decrees, Form of Church Government, Discipline, <hi>&amp;c. P.</hi> 91. His gain-saying and general Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions against us in relation to Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order amongst us the People called <hi>Quakers. P.</hi> 261. Which answers his general opposition to outward Order, Form and Discipline.</q>
[Thus hath <hi>W. R.</hi> cited our words by pieces.]</p>
            <p>Now if it be made appear, that these things are justly laid to <hi>W. R</hi>'s charge from his own words and sence thereof, I hope he'l see cause to be ashamed of his clamour of <hi>false Suggestion, impious Prevaricator,</hi> &amp;c. In order to which I thus directly proceed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That his work has been to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the authority and sentence of the true Church: On <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 6. he saith, <hi>Wherein there's not the least tittle to countenance this sentence, That the positive Sentence or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of the Church in matters of Conscience, may be obligatory on Believers,</hi> as in the third part of his <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> p. 64. And his contest against those, <hi>who</hi> (he saith) <hi>have approved a Plea for such a Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as claims a power of deciding matters relating to Conscience and outward things, on occasion of Differences about worldly Estate;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102665:57"/>
and that others ought to obey such Decisions, which</hi> says he) <hi>in its natural consequence hath (as we take it) no less tendency than to claim Power over our Properties as well as Consciences,</hi> as in the first part of his <hi>Christian-Quaker.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>Note</hi>; A sad, but fallacious consequence, detected in our Treatise, <hi>Accuser,</hi> from pag. 53, to p. 76.]</p>
            <p>Is it not plain, that <hi>W. R.</hi> has here endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to invalidate the authority and sentence of the true Church (by us pleaded) if neither obligatory on Believers in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Conscience, nor in outward things? Or if the Church may not be allowed a Power of making decisions in matters of difference, either relating to Conscience or outward Estate, according to <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. of what validity is the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, sentence or power of the Church with <hi>W. R</hi>? What's more plain against him than his own words before recited?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That he has opposed and object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against outward <hi>Orders, Forms, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, Prescriptions, Sentences, Decrees,</hi> his <hi>Gain-saying</hi> and <hi>general Objections</hi> and <hi>Opposition</hi> to outward Order, Form and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline relating to Church Government, &amp;c. see how he argues the case against <hi>outward Orders, Prescriptions, Sentences, Decrees, &amp;c.</hi> under the new Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> because the Apostle's labour was to draw the outward
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102665:57"/>
               <hi>Jew</hi> off from the observation of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Ordinances, to the Word and Law in the heart; and because the new Covenant was not to be like unto the old; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeals <hi>To every Ingenious and Impartial Reader, whether it can consist with the tenor of the new Covenant for</hi> ANY <hi>to attempt the establishment or giving forth of outward Orders, Prescriptions, Sentences or Decrees, to be a Bond upon the Consciences of those who have believed in the Everlasting Light, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally those of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>stock,</hi> his <hi>Chr. Qua.</hi> part 1. p. 73. How now <hi>William?</hi> Is not here general Opposition, &amp;c. detected and answered in our said Treatise, <hi>Accuser, &amp;c?</hi> p. 88, 89.</p>
            <p>Another Instance is where <hi>W. R.</hi> saith, viz. <hi>We have no ground either from the Word of the Lord, the appearance of Christ, or from the Scriptures of Truth, since Christ's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the flesh, to expect that any should be invested with Power from on high to establish such things relating to the Conscience (i. e.</hi> outward Orders, Prescriptions, Sentences, Decrees, as before) <hi>much less that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light under the new Covenant should be led by the eternal Spirit and Word in the heart unto such Conformity</hi>; his <hi>Chr. Quaker,</hi> part 1. pag. 75.</p>
            <p>What sayst thou yet <hi>William</hi> to these plain Instances out of thy own great Book?
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:102665:58"/>
Surely hadst thou but taken a more strict and serious notice of them, as plainly cited in our Treatise, thou wouldst not have charged any of us with <hi>false Suggestion or Forgery, in representing as if thou hadst wrote against outward Orders, Forms, Discipline.</hi> This is no Forgery nor Prevarication <hi>(William)</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peruse thy great Book a little better, with our Observations upon it in our said Treatise: Consider in calmness, if thou mayst not be ashamed thus to evade and deny thy own words? and of thy clamour, and saying, <hi>That not a word is cited, nor yet can be, out of any thing thou hast writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that may carry such an import,</hi> viz. <hi>as if thou hadst wrote against outward Orders, Forms, Discipline,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in a general way,</hi> p. 41. Thou writest <hi>That</hi> in one Book which thou denyest the plain import of (as well as the matter) in another, saying and unsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Be ashamed therefore, and also of thy roaring and belching out such Slanders and Falshood also, as <hi>The impious prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Pen-man—doth not quote any sentence of mine confuted, &amp;c.</hi> p. 42. What hast thou done less than wrote against <hi>outward Orders, Forms, Discipline,</hi> &amp;c? What means thy saying before, That <hi>we have</hi> NO GROUND <hi>either from the Word of God, Christ or Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to expect that</hi> ANY <hi>should be invested with Power from on high to establish such things</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:102665:58"/>
(as before?) Is not here general Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both to such things and to such a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity?</p>
            <p>Please to review another instance or two of thy Opposition, as before, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Where in the Title-page of the 3d part of thy <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> where to <hi>the inward Government of Christ</hi> thou opposest <hi>visible persons being invested with power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Prescriptions, Orders, Edicts or Decrees in an outward Form of Government visible, &amp;c.</hi> See now how general thy opposition is, and detected in our Treatise, <hi>Accuser,</hi> p. 117, 118, 119, to p. 137.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> The comparison before-cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Pope, who is a visible man, in accounting himself invested with Power to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute outward Laws, Edicts and Decrees,</hi> on the one part, <hi>and the Pen-man and some of his Brethren on the other part; herein,</hi> thou sayst, <hi>thou placest not much difference between them, &amp;c.</hi> p. 18. of thy 7th part. Who can here reasonably understand thee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than that thou opposest the Doctrine or Principle it self, as well as the Pope, <hi>viz. That any visible man is invested with Power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Edicts and Decrees under Christ's Government,</hi> lest thou shouldst resemble the Pope. For we may rationally take it for granted in those
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:102665:59"/>
things, doctrines or principles wherein thou comparest the Pope &amp; any of us, thou wouldst be lookt upon as of a contrary mind and judgment, that thou mightst not be thought like the Pope in any thing whereof thou condemnest others, as either like him, or as not much differing from him, otherwise thy comparisons or similitudes do condemn thy self as well as others, whom thou smitest at. And so, if thou countest it Popery or resembling the Pope, to say, That <hi>a visible man or men are invested with power from Christ to execute</hi> (or put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice) <hi>any outward Laws, Edicts or Decrees under Christ's Government,</hi> then we must take thee as saying (and as we have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood thee) <hi>That no visible man or men are so invested with Power from Christ to execute out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Laws, &amp;c.</hi> Which still shews thy opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and objections before rehearsed, and clears thy opponent from the foul Imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Impious Prevaricator, down right Forger, Impious Prevaricating Pen-man, &amp;c.</hi> and thy self a notorious Slanderer therein, as well as shews thy inadvertency and overly shuffling, and foully slubbering over matters under debate and controversie, and with what blunt and dull tools and weapons thou art toiling and fighting.</p>
            <p>Howbeit, we may hear <hi>W. R.</hi> a little further, in his attempts to clear himself, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:102665:59"/>
prove his charge of <hi>false Suggestion, Impious Prevaricator, &amp;c.</hi> he alledges chiefly two things, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st, <hi>That he owns the Government of Christ in his Church, knowing that 'tis his right to govern his Church</hi>; which <hi>W. R.</hi> also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth, <hi>The Pen-man signifies he understands by Church-Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe by the way; this is general, and not an Answer sufficient to clear him; 'twill not do his business. Against whom did he alledge this, when we never questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Christ's Government in his Church? But the Pen-man and his Friends (<hi>viz.</hi> the peaceable People call'd <hi>Quakers</hi>) own Christs Government, both in the inward and in the outward parts of it, both as he governs and rules immediately by his Spirit, and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally by his faithful Servants invested with power and wisdom from him, as before explained; which I find not that <hi>W. R.</hi> hath owned with any consistency or clearness, but has appeared very inconsistent, opposit and frequently contradictory both to us and to himself in the matter, saying and unsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (first in one Book, then in another) as is fully evinced in our Treatise, entituled, <hi>The Accuser, &amp;c.</hi> (as from p. 83, to p. 91. and from p. 204, to p. 227.) and also in this.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> He alledges, that he has testified, <hi>That the Apostles labours were to establish the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102665:60"/>
Churches in the Faith and in the Power, leaving them so established, to be in the practice of</hi> THAT FORM <hi>which the Power either had or should lead them into. Moreover,</hi> (saith W. R.) <hi>My proceedings in the Marriage of two Daughters within three years last past, and frequent concern amongst Friends in taking care that no proceedings in Marriages may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in any such private Methods as may be scandalous to Truth, shews my practice and principle to be otherwise—And indeed I can in Truth say, That I never had a thought entred in my Breast, that</hi> OUTWARD ORDER, <hi>Methods, Forms and Discipline were not to be exercised, and proceeded in</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Who must so exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise and proceed in them if no visible man or men be invested with Power from Christ to execute them, or put them in practice?</note> 
               <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Government of Christ, according as the Spirit of the Lord should direct and guide,</hi> p. 42. [Thus far <hi>W. R</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe</hi>; He has here given a very fair and ample concession to Truth in words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1st, <hi>To the Apostles labours for the Churches establishment in the Faith and in the Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2dly, <hi>To the practice of that Form which the Power should lead them into.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3dly, <hi>To his care in the Marriage of his two Daughters, and others, that</hi> NO <hi>Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in Marriages may be permitted in any
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:102665:60"/>
such private Methods as may be scandalous to Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4thly, <hi>To outward Order, Methods, Forms and Discipline, that they are to be exercised and proceeded in under Christ's Government, according as his spirit directs and guides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are they so? A fair confession! Had he alwayes kept to this method and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and so been consistent with himself, the Controversie had been in a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass. But though he seems seriously to say, <hi>That he never had a thought entred his breast, that outward Order, Methods, Form and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline were not to be exercised and proceeded in under the Government of Christ,</hi> I query, (on his contradiction) how they should be exercised and proceeded in under Christs Government in his Church, if so be it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not consist with the tenor of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for any to give forth outward Orders, Sentences, Decrees, &amp;c? Or if Christ doth invest none with Power from on high to establish such things relating to Conscience (as outward Order, Methods, Forms, Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, &amp;c?) Or if no visible Persons be invested with power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Prescriptions, Order, &amp;c? How then are outward Order, Methods, Forms and Discipline to be exercised and proceeded in under Christ's Government? And who are to exercise and proceed in
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102665:61"/>
them, if not visible Persons? May not they declare and practise outwardly what they have received from Christ inwardly? How then shall the Law go forth of <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Word from <hi>Jerusalem?</hi> But if he grants that some persons are made instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental under Christs Government, to give forth good outward Methods, Forms, Order, Discipline, &amp;c. but not to be a bond on the Consciences of others who have believed in the everlasting Light: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears contradictory again: (<hi>William,</hi> was thy proceedings in the Marriage of two Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thy care that Truth might not be scandalized, no bond upon thine or their Consciences?) How are outward Methods, Forms, Order and Discipline then to be practised and proceeded in under Christ's Government? Must they be so practised, exercised and proceeded in by Believers, without Conscience, or without Obligation, or being binding upon their Consciences? Strange Doctrine, loose and confused, and not consistent with any Religious tender Conscience towards God or Christ, which requires all to be done in his name, and to his glory.</p>
            <p>But after all our Opposers variations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistencies and whirlings, he is fled to this Refuge, or rather Subterfuge, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>his writing shews dislike to Man's Pretence to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:102665:61"/>
establish outward Orders, relating to matters of Conscience, as the Order of the Gospel, or to take upon him the giving forth of any outward Rules,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> &amp;c. <hi>relating to</hi> Faith <hi>and</hi> Discipline <hi>in the Church, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that they should become a Bond upon others to submit thereto, further than from a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation unto the Conscience, a service may be seen therein, according to the measure of Light given,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 41.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observe,</hi> 1<hi>st,</hi> This censures only MAN's PRETENCE to establish outward Orders relating to Conscience, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, <hi>Man's taking upon him to give forth any outward Rules in Faith or Discipline in the Church, with intent they should become a Bond upon others,</hi> to submit further than (from a Recommendation to the Conscience) a <hi>service MAY</hi> be seen therein, according to the measure of Light given, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Whereupon 'tis to be noted, <hi>first,</hi> That this does not oppose the Spirit of Christ, making use of man or men, as instrumental to establish or give forth outward Orders, Rules, &amp;c. relating to Conscience, Faith or Discipline in the Church, to be submitted unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Nor such outward Orders, Rules, &amp;c. as a service may be seen in, according to the measure of the true Light given. But only a dislike to <hi>MAN's PRETENCE</hi> &amp; <hi>TAKING
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:102665:62"/>
VPON HIM</hi> therein. Which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand is intended, as <hi>without the true Spirits Guidance.</hi> Which appears still to be an Abatement and Extinuation of his more general reiterated Opposition and Noise against <hi>ANY</hi> giving forth outward Orders, Prescriptions, &amp;c. or being invested with Power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> under Christs inward Government, because the new Covenant and its Law is inward. For now he only opposeth <hi>Man's Pretence and Taking upon him</hi> in these cases; and who must be Judge that he is but a Pretendor, and an Actor in his own will, if the Rules, Directions or Laws he declares or gives out be in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Honest, Lawful and Just, yea Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and Needful, not of Man, nor by the Will of Man? Were not this to judge of Spirits without outward evidence or proof against them? But if our Opposer would place the Controversie against some Rules, Orders, &amp;c. among us, as being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves either unjust, unlawful or dishonest, and could make sufficient proof thereof, that would both greatly narrow and soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the Controversie: For that can be no good nor true Spirit that gives forth bad or unjust Laws, otherwise we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to give credit to him in his bitterly smiting with words of hatred against any
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:102665:62"/>
Men or Persons among us, whilst speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ministring or acting things just, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or honest, and needful, as bound in Conscience to declare and advise others to practise, (and which he must grant them Liberty both to speak and act, or else hee'l miserably interfer with his pretended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience) Seeing whatsoever things are honest, just and of good report, are to be thought on and practised.</p>
            <p>That <hi>W. R</hi>'s great Book aforesaid (as it is against <hi>R. B</hi>'s Book for Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) is against Church-Government, so far as it relates to an outward Form of Church-Government, outward Order, Rules, Methods, &amp;c. And this is no <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication,</hi> as now he renders it, as is evident from divers passages before recited,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 42.</note> and by himself frequently contradicted.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Also, 'tis a manifest falshood, where <hi>W.

If no visible Persons be invested with Power from Christ to execute outward Laws, Orders, &amp;c. in an outward Form of Church-Government; Or if it be <hi>Popery,</hi> or like the Pope, or inconsistent with the New Covenant so to do, (as he has insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) what and where are those <hi>Helps</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> which God in his Wisdom hath afforded in his Churches, in subjection to Christ? Are no visible Persons instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental therein by the Power of Christ? Or are they Helps and Governments, or helpers in Government without visible Persons? Were Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, Elders, Overseers, &amp;c. in the <hi>Christian</hi> Churches no visible Persons, or not so indued with Power from Christ to be helpers in the Government? See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 28.</p>
            <p>I confess I know not how to reconcile our Opposer to himself in these matters, no more than I can find Reason or Proof for his black Charges of <hi>Impious Prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Pen-man; Oh Impious Prevaricator! perverse and hard Heart; qualified like a proud Prelate; The Pen-man's Iniquity; angry Was<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Pen,</hi> &amp;c. [Thus he.] I must needs say, he's far more loud in his Censures than in's Proofs.</p>
            <p>If our Opposer did impartially consider and compare <hi>William Penn</hi>'s <hi>Address to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:102665:63"/>
quoted by him, he would see there's no <hi>Lash to the Pen-man</hi> (as he falsly affirms) seeing <hi>W. P.</hi> grants, <hi>that the one Shepherd may have many Servants,</hi> p. 44. And on 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1, 2. He further saith, <hi>Here is the utmost Imposition the Apostle makes use of; He requires not men to receive him without Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> &amp;c. p. 44. No more do we, whom Christ hath called forth in his Service and Ministry, in this his day, who by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of Truth, commend our selves to every mans Conscience in the sight of God, having renounced the hidden things of Dishonesty, &amp;c. Here's no cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain for want of Evidence, or of Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Evidence, in plainly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering or shewing the hidden things of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honesty. Truth in its manifestation, both in the Ministry and in the Hearers Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is Evidence, both against what's Dishonest, and for what's Honest: God would not have Men blind in their Duty, their own Negligence and Prejudice is cause of blindness. Nor hath this Person convicted us of pleading for or setting up <hi>Imposition without Evidence in the Conscience,</hi> or of <hi>Imposing a blind Obedience,</hi> or putting any Persons thereupon; No, my very Soul is against that. And though <hi>W. P.</hi> also has writ against Imposition without Conviction; the Pen-man seems to have no
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102665:64"/>
other sence, nor doth it follow that he is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against Church Discipline, outward Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or Form of Church-Government (but for these) in the Church of Christ and <hi>Christian</hi> Societies; he being Principl'd for the true Church, having Power from Christ to give Judgment, spiritual Censures and Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against all dark Spirits that sow Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and make Division, and against all ungodly, loose, disorderly and scandalous walking and walkers under profession of Truth. I'le adventure to quote <hi>William Penn</hi>'s <hi>Address to Protestants,</hi> to shew his Principle and Sence in these matters: In page 214. he saith,
<q>No Scripture-Church-Discipline is hereby oppugned or weakned: Let not the Sentence end in Violence upon the Conscience uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced. Let whoso will expound or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, so it be according to true Church-Discipline, which can be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on them only, who have willingly joyn'd themselves in that Covenant of Union, &amp;c. P. 215. Let us observe what sort of Church-Government the Apostle recommends; <hi>Avoid foolish Questions and Contentions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A man that is an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick after the first and second Admonition, reject,</hi> &amp;c. And on <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15. He did not say, You shall be Fined, Pillaged, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and flung into Prison, if
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102665:64"/>
ye be not of our mind. P. 216. on 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22, 23, 24, 25. Here is both Faith and Government, Religion and Duty, all that becomes us towards God, our Brethren, our Neighbours, yea, our Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers and Enemies.</q>
And <hi>W. P.</hi> in his <hi>Brief Examination and State of Liberty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> he doth more particularly explain and clear the Point, to Friends, first in his Epistle, saying, <hi>Christ's Liberty is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained through his Cross; they that would be his Free-men must be his Bonds-men, and wear his blessed Yoke: His Liberty is from Sin, not to Sin; to do his will, not our own.</hi> And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he speaks farther to it in the said <hi>Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Observe; Here <hi>W. P.</hi> pleads not for a Liberty of Conscience, in opposition <hi>to true Church-Government, Discipline or Order,</hi> but to those outward Penalties, Persecutions and Punishments, corporal and pecuniary, mentioned and opposed by him and the rest of us, which is no Liberty to make Division or Discord in the Church of Christ or Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Believers,</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. To the Question, Whether the Church of Christ hath Power in any cases, that are matters of Conscience, to give a positive Sentence and Decision, which may be obligatory upon Believers? To this
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:102665:65"/>
               <hi>R. B.</hi> answers affirmatively, SHE HATH, <hi>Anarch.</hi> p. 48. And,</p>
            <p>Whereas <hi>R. B.</hi> pleaded for the Church of Christ having Power in SOME CASES of Conscience to give a positive Sentence or Decision, which may be obligatory upon Believers. (To this <hi>W. R.</hi> saith) <hi>Which clearly shews to us</hi> R. B<hi>'s meaning to be, That in some cases the Consciences of Believers ought to be bound by the positive Sentences of others.</hi> (To which he adds) <hi>Without leaving any Liberty for a Believer to refuse to submit on the account of not seeing it his duty to submit. This meaning and Government</hi> (saith <hi>W. R.) over Believers, we take to be contrary to the Principle of Truth and Liberty we have in Christ Jesus, &amp;c.</hi> p. 44.</p>
            <p>Herein he appears both unfair in his ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and mistaken in his construction: For 1<hi>st,</hi> The [<hi>some cases</hi>] intended, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a positive Judgment or Sentence from some Members or Believers is binding upon others) are such Cases,
<q>Wherein only the <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth give the Judgment through some or other in the Church of Christ. The only proper Judge of Controversies in the Church, is the Spirit of God, and the power of deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding solely lies in it <bibl>(saith <hi>R. B.) Anarch.</hi> pag. 66.</bibl>
               </q>
As also,
<q>That God hath ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in communicating his Will under
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102665:65"/>
his Gospel, employed such whom he made use of in gathering his Church, and in feeding &amp; watching over them, though not excluding others.</q>
Thus <hi>R. B</hi>'s <hi>Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the Ranters,</hi> p. 67, 68. Observe here, that he placeth the Judgment or Sentence (as binding, and to be submitted unto by others) professing the same Faith) on the <hi>Truth, the Spirit of God, the Will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> And therefore the Judgment is not placed upon any Imposition of Government over Believers, contrary to the Principle of Truth or Liberty that's in Christ Jesus; for the Judgment of Truth, or of the holy Spirit, which unites in one Mind and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot be contrary to that Principle, nor without evidence in the <hi>Conscience</hi> for conviction to oblige, and the Conscience thus obliged is not without true sight, sence or knowledge of duty therein, because 'tis <hi>Conscience obliged,</hi> not a blind affection. So 'tis not to impose a <hi>blind Submission,</hi> though some's want of perswasion may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably proceed from their being hardened (through Rebellion) as <hi>R. B.</hi> intimates, <hi>Anarch.</hi> p. 67. And their contradiction in that case will not excuse them from being guilty of disobeying God, because it is from his Spirit the sentence proceeds; and 'tis their duty both to see, receive &amp; submit to what's justly <hi>required.</hi> The intent of the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102665:66"/>
Spirit of God in giving forth Judgment or Sentences through his Servants (to end Controversie, &amp;c.) doth not bespeak or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any design of such Imposition, as to enforce any upon <hi>a blind Submission or Obedience,</hi> in such a hardened Condition; for the Spirit of Christ strives with them to open their Eyes, and enlighten their Understandings, that they may see and know in their own Consciences first, their Duty, and then submit in what is according to the will of God, being the judgment of his Spirit, which makes its way with its own evidence to the Consciences and Hearts of Persons, if not wholly harden'd through Rebellion against God's Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <hi>For the Testimony of the Lord is sure, making Wise the Simple. The Commandment of the Lord is pure,</hi> ENLIGHTNING <hi>the Eyes,</hi> Psal. 19.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Then what <hi>power</hi> or <hi>freedom</hi> can any Minister or Servant of Christ have, to leave any liberty for a <hi>believer</hi> to refuse submission to the judgment of the Spirit of Christ in his <hi>servants</hi> or <hi>believers</hi> where <hi>Christ</hi> leaves none? or to grant that he may not see it his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to submit, and thereupon to refuse when the <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> (who knows the Creatures capacity) gives the Judgment, and requires Submission? There's no just ground nor pretence for such Indulgence, which tends to Rebellion and Ranterism, but rather for
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:102665:66"/>
the Servants of Christ to be faithful and stedfast in their Testimony and Judgment, which they know is both in it self Just, and proceeding from his Spirit. Whether it be by others received or rejected: <hi>He that hath an Ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the Churches</hi>; which doth many times speak through Instruments as formerly.</p>
            <p>And further, 'tis neither a false sence, nor wicked construction, to say, That our Opposer <hi>being for a Liberty for Believers to refuse to submit on account of not seeing it their duty: Therefore, that Believers</hi> (who are members of Christ's Church) <hi>may refuse submission to their Brethren in things that are in themselves Just and Reasonable, according to the Law of Truth in the Conscience, on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of not seeing it their duty, &amp;c.</hi> I do sincerely profess, I do not find a more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural construction that our Opposers own Words (being without distinction) will bear, all material and precedent Causes and Circumstances of this very point in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie considered.</p>
            <p>For <hi>first</hi>; The Submission pleaded for by <hi>R. B.</hi> among Believers, and in the Church, was to the Judgment and positive Sentence proceeding from the Spirit of God or Christ in his Church and Servants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly</hi>; Our Adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

When no other Submission is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, nor any other intended by us, than to such Judgment or Sentence as originally proceeds from the Spirit of Truth, which is agreeable to the will and mind of God. Now, doth not our Adversary's opposition tend to divide Believers and the Church of Christ, as well as from a true sight and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their Duty, in cases wherein the Spirit of Christ gives the Judgment (which must needs be just and reasonable.) For to the Question, Whether the Church of Christ hath Power in ANY CASES of Conscience, to give positive sentence, which may be obligatory upon Believers? <hi>R.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:102665:67"/>
and supposition) and this [<hi>in ANY CASES of Conscience</hi>] without distinction. (The terms of the Question and Opposition before cited being general:) Which sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Blindness and Discord in Believers I cannot grant him against any true or sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Believers, who are faithful to Christ in their measures of Grace received; such will neither want a sight of those Dutyes, or things the Spirit of Christ teacheth and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them; nor submission one to another therein, but in humbleness of mind submit themselves one to another in the fear of God,<note place="margin">

This Humility and Submission was among the Primitive Christians, and was very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable among them; and none but the Proud oppose it. And farther, the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Judgment and Determination pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Spirit of Christ in the midst of his Church, is <hi>Binding</hi> in Heaven and Earth; and he that will not hear the Church (where Christ is in the midst) is to be accounted as an <hi>Heathen</hi> Man.

            <p>But seeing our Opposer at length (to acquit himself) gives us this Concession, pag. 45. viz. <hi>I do say, a Believer in Christ ought to submit to any reasonable just Judgment (answering the Truth in the Conscience) when it relates to him, let it spring from whom it will,</hi> I shall say the less in this point. But (<hi>William</hi>) hast thou been always of this mind? If thou hast, thou art very inconsistent in thy writing, and greatly wrongest thy self by Self-contradictions; and then what signifies all thy opposing <hi>R. B.</hi> for pleading a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciencious Submission in Believers to the positive judgment or sentence, which (as he saith) proceeds from the Spirit of God in some or other of their Brethren in the Church of Christ? What amounts all thy work of Opposition and Gain-saying unto? Now a <hi>Believer in Christ ought to submit to any Reasonable just judgment, let it spring from
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:102665:68"/>
whom it will.</hi> And sure, all judgment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Spirit of God (in any of his Servants) is just and reasonable; for whatsoever is unjust, is not of God, but to be rejected: The Controversie is not there.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. Again <hi>(William)</hi> upon our words, <hi>viz.</hi> [God preserve his people from this Libertine Spirit] thou falsly notest, That <hi>(by the Pen-man's discourse) a Believer's refual to submit to the Church, on account of not seeing it his Duty to submit, is the fruit of a Libertine Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. p. 45.</p>
            <p>[<hi>A Believer's refusal to submit to the Church</hi>] is a begging the Question, and fallacy; for I do not own that any true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever will <hi>REFVSE</hi> to submit to the Church of Christ in any thing that Christ, commands, or is in it self his just duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God or his Neighbour [<hi>on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of not seeing it his duty</hi>] is again a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the Question. If it be his Duty and required of him by the Spirit of God in his servants, the same spirit (if he minds it) quickly makes an immediate discovery of it to (and impression on) his Conscience, it being his duty both to see and submit to what Truth and Justice require of him; so as the sincere and tender-hearted, though but weak in the Faith for a time, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:102665:69"/>
on the one hand from Rebellion, and from <hi>Refusing</hi> that submission which the Lord requires, and on the other hand from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into a blind Obedience. For put case there be a little space of time, that one weak in the faith sees not presently every thing that may be required by the Lord in his People, as duty, he does not therefore <hi>REFVSE Submission,</hi> but waits patiently on the Lord, to clear up his way, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal his duty therein; and though whilst thus waiting for satisfaction and clearness, he's neither <hi>refusing</hi> nor <hi>opposing</hi> that which he has not a clearness of judgment in. Want of sight, or clearness in such cases of Conscience, is no just ground for <hi>Refusal, Rejection</hi> or <hi>Opposition,</hi> no more than for any to act in a blind Obedience or ignorant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, without satisfaction in Faith or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. Let but <hi>blind Opposition</hi> and <hi>Refusal</hi> as well as <hi>blind Obedience</hi> be laid aside, and we shall have quietness; for though neither be good, yet <hi>blind Opposition</hi> is the worst of the two. For there's yet a <hi>Medium</hi> between <hi>Refusal</hi> and <hi>Active Submission,</hi> viz. <hi>A WAITING passively and patiently until God reveal his will in this or that particular thing required by him as duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, thou dost both scornfully and fallaciously proceed against the Pen-man in these words, viz. <hi>'Tis plain to me, that he
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102665:69"/>
(reputing himself a Church-Governour) is thirsting after such a sort of Subjects that may be willing to follow his Track, though they know not whether it be right or wrong,</hi> p 45.</p>
            <p>I presume thou meanest my self, as that Pen-man that so affects being a Governour, or so reputeth, as thou hast before twitted the Pen-man with <hi>having forgotten his low and mean Estate</hi> (telling him <hi>how the very conceit of being a Governour in an outward Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is very apt to puff up Persons of some sort of Qualifications,</hi> pag. 25.) If thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest me herein, thou hast taken wrong measures, and hast given me Scurrillous and Abusive Characters; and then thou art grosly mistaken in thy judgment, <hi>That I thirst after such ignorant Subjects,</hi> as thou importest. The Lord hath raised me up to open peoples Eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to Light; and God, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge, who knows my heart, and whom I serve with my spirit in the Gospel of his Son, he knows 'tis my delight in Humility, to serve him therein, and to see People turned from Darkness to the true Light, and from their Ignorance and Error to the knowledge of the Truth in the spirit and power of it in themselves, that they may walk in the Path of Life, and be saved; and no otherwise to follow me, than as they may see me walk therein. So knowing my
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102665:70"/>
Integrity and Humility in the sight and presence of God, who hath thorowly searched and tryed me, that I affect neither Popularity nor Greatness, I do the less value thy Reproaches, and all the bitter Inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives that thou canst bring forth against me. My innocent Life reigns over thy hatred, and shall out-live thy envy and scorn.</p>
            <p>And as thou hast laid a false foundation against the Pen-man, as judging him a <hi>Person thirsting after such sort of ignorant Subjects,</hi> as before related; so thy Superstructure raised by supposition is impertinent, trifling and fallacious. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> Where have any of us (whom thou smitest at) either from a Meeting yearly, or else-where, in giving forth (as thou callest them) certain <hi>Sentences, Decrees</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> (directed to the rest of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) therewith signified to them, <hi>'Tis your Duty to submit, whether you see it your Duty or no?</hi> p. 45. I am sure, this is forreign to my (and my Brethrens) Language and Intention. If it intends an active Obedience before men see their real duty, which none can acceptably perform, nor is it my Principle to urge them upon practice until their Eyes be opened to see their duty therein, yet peoples present Ignorance of their Duty (when proposed or told them in the spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ) is no
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:102665:70"/>
warrant for them to <hi>oppose, refuse, resist</hi> or <hi>reject</hi> it, but rather tenderly and quietly to weigh &amp; consider of it before the Lord, and wait in his Light till he reveal it, resolve the doubts and remove the scruples.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Moreover, that which hath a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to Confusion, Rebellion and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terism, was thy undervaluing the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church of Christ in such a <hi>Judgment or Decision</hi> given thereby as proceeds from the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">

tend to Confusion, Rebellion or Ranterism; but thy plea for the leaving a liberty <hi>for Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to refuse to submit to the judgment and decision of the Church of Christ,</hi> and for the same insisting on <hi>their not seeing it their Duty to submit,</hi> when the judgment of the Church of Christ, pleaded for on our parts, is no other than what proceeds from his Spirit, or Christ himself as being present in his Church. This thy Libertine plea tends to divide the Church of Christ, and to leave Believers, (who are Members thereof) in a liberty both of denying submission, and in an ignorance or blindness concerning what the spirit of Christ in his Church may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of them, which I cannot grant thee that any sincere Believer is either so to be left in such a liberty of <hi>REFVSAL,</hi> nor yet remains in such Ignorance; for he that will not hear the Church (where Christ is in the midst) is to be accounted as an <hi>Heathen man.</hi> Therefore thy Plea tending to divide and make Believers Heathen, is contrary to our Principle and Testimony received from the beginning, which is, <hi>That Life an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers Life: The Spirit of Truth receives its own in men; every living true Member in some degree feels what proceeds from its Life in other Members,</hi> though all Christ's Members are not come to the same measure and degree of growth, strength and understanding, yet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:102665:71"/>
there's so much inward sence and nearness in his Life and Faith, as preserves them from Confusion, Rebellion and Opposition to one another, or to any thing the Spirit of Christ saith unto the Churches by any of them.</p>
            <p>Thy putting and supposing Cases against us that are not, thy arguing from Generals to Particulars, from Principles to Persons, from a Plea for the Church of Christ (and its obliging Judgment proceeding from his Spirit) to reflect upon particular Persons (as the Pen-man and his Brethren, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George</hi> and <hi>Stephen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 45.</note> &amp;c. p 45.) are empty, trifling and impertinent, and as vain and silly is the <hi>Laughter</hi> and <hi>Scorn</hi> which thereupon thou supposest, and wouldst stir up against the Pen-man, and his Brethren, all grounded upon a false bottom, namely, thy uncharitable and false sence and censure against the Pen-man, <hi>viz. That he is thirsting after such a sort of Subjects that may be willing to follow his Track, though they know not whether it be right or wrong:</hi> Which is so utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly false (if thou intendest me) that such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire never entred into my Heart; my Soul abominates such a Principle as to lead People on in such blindness. Again, I do not make the reason of my Discourse depend on a <hi>meer supposition,</hi> nor yet on a bear <hi>affirmation,</hi> that I and my Brethren are the <hi>Church,</hi> &amp; thou and thine not; we are now on the defensive part,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102665:72"/>
and thou art not able to unchurch us; we may give testimony of our Faith, and to our sence of the presence of Christ with us and among us, &amp; of our continuance in Love &amp; Unity in him, and against thine and others Apostacy, and thou not able to confute us. The reason of our <hi>Discourse</hi> (in the present <hi>Controversie</hi>) depends not on Persons, but on undeniable Principles and Practices, agreeable both to divine Testimony, Revelation &amp; undeniable Evidence amongst men. And wherein any of us have been moved of the Lord in his holy zeal to give positive Judgment, either concerning Spirits, Persons or Practices, that appear not yet so evident to some as to us, the day will make further discovery and declare it, and the Lord will appear witness and evidence in the case. And thou shalt then find, that thy Scorn, and the Laughter and Scorn thou hast supposed (and sought to stir up) against us, will be turn'd into sorrow on thy part; and thou mayst be ashamed of thy scorn and laughter, and of comparing <hi>our Treatment with the Papistical Parties towards the Protestants,</hi> and telling of <hi>following the Pen-mans Papistical Track,</hi> p. 46. All grounded on thy false sence before-cited, though to me all thy Scorn, Laughter, false Comparisons and <hi>Rattles</hi> (thou knowest what I mean) are all but like the Crackling of Thorns under a Pot. It's observable,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102665:72"/>
that in thy Epistle to the <hi>Reader,</hi> &amp;c. thou art for <hi>taking up a Lamentation for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy of your Brethren,</hi> as thy pretence is: Now thou art for <hi>Scorn</hi> and <hi>Laughter</hi> against them thou so censurest; yea, to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians Laughter and Scorn</hi> thou art exposing <hi>R. R.</hi> and for those Instances he gives for <hi>Deconesses</hi> in the Gospel-times, p. 33. though this be a Truth, which many <hi>Protestant</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have confirmed, besides <hi>Paul</hi>'s own commendation of their Sister <hi>Phebe,</hi> whom he called, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Thus thy hypocritical Lamenting, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and thy Scorning do much resemble thy confused Work.</p>
            <p>And what such things are they thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuatest against the Pen-man and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?

What things are those? We expect no mercy nor favour
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102665:73"/>
from thee; thou hast rendred us as obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I think, as of thy self thou canst.

Is not such deceitful, injurious and contradictory Dealing rather contrary to common Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Civility amongst men?</p>
            <p>Thy Prayer, conclusive of thy second Chapter, pag. 46. is mixt with as much Falshood and Envy (as the other stuff is with Scorn) in these words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Lord preserve us all from following the Pen-man's uncharitable Papistical Track, lest thereby we should not only merit the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, but justly be accused by men of understanding, of so much Delusion, Weakness or
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102665:73"/>
Wickedness, as (considering our antient professed Principles, and Practices) might render us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the favour of a true Protestant, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision to the Heathen, and a scorn to Fools themselves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure this Prayer appears not without Wrath and doubting; 'tis not offered in Charity, nor with Holy Hands; 'tis more like a <hi>Cain</hi>'s Sacrifice; 'tis to slay the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and Protestant Reputation of him (and those) thou writest against, to render him not only one that has merited the Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, but one in a Papistical Track, unworthy the favour of a true <hi>Protestant,</hi> and so obnoxious to the outward Penal Laws, seeing (by thy Words) <hi>If you should follow his Track<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you should SO merit, be SO justly accused and rendred,</hi> as thy Prayer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates. Herein thou dost not only assume the place of a Judge over us (contrary to thy own Principle, especially that in the Paper which thou hast exposed as <hi>E. B</hi>'s to <hi>Judge no man under any Pretence whatsoever</hi>) But also thou hast set the Heathen to judge and deride such among us as (in thy account) go from their antient Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and such also to be a scorn to Fools. But must the Heathen and Fools be such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Judges in Church-Affairs, as over Apostates, &amp;c?

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:102665:74"/>
pleading the authority of the Church of Christ, as having power in some cases of Conscience to give <hi>positive Sentence or Decision obligatory upon Believers</hi>? Or why hast plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Liberty for a Believer's refusing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereunto, on account of not seeing it his duty to submit?

            <argument>
               <p>§. <hi>1. W. R</hi>'s Trifling against the Pen-man about his own Concessions to Truth. His abuse of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such kinds of Declarations, frequently publisht among them as are unsound (and of a <hi>Popish</hi> tendence) about shutting out the Wisdom of all kinds, without distinction, and his now mincing the matter reflecting about proving Negatives, and his shufling and shifting, on his not mentioning Time, Place or Persons. §. <hi>2.</hi> About his mis-expressing himself, how it might be excusable. <hi>W. R.</hi> can never come off clearly by those Instances he gave in his Postscript, to prove his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Print, Righteous. But his Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy still remains upon him, in that his chief Instance of the printed Epistle of two Sheets, by <hi>Anne Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Mary Elson,</hi> not Writ nor Printed till long after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Print; His Fallacy therein made more and more notorious §. <hi>3.</hi> About the <hi>Tree of Knowledge: W.

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102665:75"/>
apparent in this point. §. <hi>4.</hi> Of his straining <hi>G. F</hi>'s Words (about setting up outward things) besides his Intention; His gross and reproachful Construction; His dark smiting and suggestion against Preachers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> to render them exalted and imperious Imposers, <hi>WITHOUT GIVING A REASON WHY,</hi> &amp;c. §. <hi>5.</hi> His Story of Jealousies being entred Thousands against our travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Brethren, and what Jealousies incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and unreasonable. §. <hi>6.</hi> About the Tree of Knowledge again, Whether <hi>W. R.</hi> esteem it good for Food or not: He still shifts and writes manifest untruth, in denying his own Words, to shew either opposition or assent to such Doctrine (<hi>i. e.</hi> that 'tis good for Food.) His fallacious Evasion and Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency return'd more home and closely upon him. §. <hi>7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Concerning Tythes. <hi>W.R</hi>'s late Objection and loose Answer farther exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and the tendency thereof (and of what he now further saith) for the Payment of TYTHES FREELY to the National Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, and now <hi>to any use whatsoever,</hi> without regard to humane Institution or claim of divine Right. His Apostacy and evading our antient Testimony in this point; and his fallacious Insinuations and Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made obvious. §. <hi>8. W. R.</hi> cannot
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:102665:75"/>
clear himself of his Erronious Doctrine of <hi>Circumcision being a Christian Liberty, or in a Christian Liberty, &amp;c.</hi> which was a legal Bondage and Yoke, observed for a time in submission to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law, and not to <hi>Christ</hi>'s Doctrine, wherein was a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> forbearance, not <hi>Christian</hi> Liberty in the Practice. <hi>W. R</hi>'s scorn and falshood about the LAITY, to render us <hi>Popish,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. TO thy occasion taken on the title <hi>Disaffection</hi> in the Contents of our Treatise [viz. <hi>That if the Writer's words may be taken, to shew the meaning of his mind, then he is disaffected with thy very Concession to Truth,</hi> &amp;c.] pag. 46. cap. 3. This is meer trifling and idle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Those Concessions of thine to the Truth are so excepted, by being distinctly noted both in the Contents and Book, as being <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions to the Truth (in Confutation to thy self and much of thy Book)</hi> which being thus plainly exprest by the Writer, thou canst not justly construe his Words, as shewing his meaning to be <hi>that he is disaffected with such Concession to Truth.</hi> This is an abuse to be sure.</p>
            <p>Because that in our observation on the 5th <hi>Disaffection,</hi> we utterly denyed and judged as a falshood and abuse to the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:102665:76"/>
People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> thy saying, That <hi>these kinds of Declarations frequently published amongst the aforesaid People,</hi> viz. <hi>Let us exclude the Reasoning, the Wisdom and the Iealousie, and let us have an Eye to the Brethren; yea, to shut out the Wisdom and Reason of All kinds, without Distinction,</hi> [according as thou relatest in thy <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> part 1. Pref. p. 6. and p. 18, &amp; 27.]</p>
            <p>On our denying and judging this as a Falshood, and horrid Abuse and Scandalous, thou art pleased to reflect upon the Pen-man as very ignorant, <hi>void of sound Argument, and Obnoxious to the censure of ingenious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> as being <hi>in his own sence capable to prove any sort of Negatives whatsoever,</hi> p. 47.</p>
            <p>That's a falshood <hi>William,</hi> the Pen-man hath no such sence: But by the way observe how unfairly thou art shifting here instead of proving thy Charge, <hi>That these kinds of Declarations are frequently publisht amongst the aforesaid People called Quakers.</hi> Now in thy last citation, where thou sayest, viz. <hi>I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate as if this Doctrine had been publisht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, &amp;c.</hi> p. 47. Here thou mincest the matter, and leavest out the Words <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,</hi> and <hi>the said People,</hi> which do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Fact more notorious and general, and the more rational for us to deny it, and to judge it as thy gross abuse against the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102665:76"/>
               <hi>said People,</hi> which is not to prove any sort of Negatives whatsoever; We first give our Negative to thy Charge in the terms of it, then our Judgment: It concern'd thee to make it good then, and not to put us off with Flams and Jeers; and now tell us, <hi>Thou didst not mention either Time, Place or Person</hi>: At that rate it may be a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to prove Negatives against thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.—Though thy charge be never so false, so long as thou canst prevaricate, and also vary the matter from a popular and publication, to a particular Person, Time and Place, (and neither tell us who, when or where) —as <hi>FROM these kind of Declarations frequently publisht among the People called</hi> Quakers. <hi>TO this Doctrine had been publisht amongst us:</hi> Yet <hi>I did not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either Time, Place or Person,</hi> p. 47. Like as to say, You must take all the matter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Credit: You must pin your Faith upon my Sleeve: If you deny and judge what I say as an abuse, I have a cunning way to shift it, instead of making proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I can tell you, I did not mention, Time, Place or Person: 'Tis void of sound Argument for you to go about to prove any sort of Negatives, &amp;c. But <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> this kind of shifting, and then retort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and scorning, will not gain thee Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit nor Reputation, in thy mean and feeble
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:102665:77"/>
attempts to prove the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> frequently under such a kind of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry as is in it self <hi>Popish,</hi> and tending to Introduce <hi>Popery</hi> it self (according to thy own Inference) that is, <hi>Ignorance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of Wisdom, Bondage instead of Freedom in Christ, Ignorance as the Mother of Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c.</hi> Answered in our Treatise, <hi>ACCVSER,</hi> &amp;c. p. 6, 7, 8, 9. And not only so, but that some blind Zealots are Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled <hi>to have an Eye to the Brethren instead of the Light in himself</hi>; as in thy Postscript to thy <hi>Christian-Quaker.</hi> But we can as well and truly deny that such Declarations (as afore) are frequently published among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and judge it a horrid abuse and reflection on the said People, as we can deny that Jesuits fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Preach among them, which is also an Abuse of some, and which thy Charge resembles. And 'tis no absurdity to prove Negatives in some cases, either in Popular or Personal actions, if Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Eye and Ear witness may be of any Credit. As for Instance:</p>
            <p>The <hi>Question</hi> was put to a Meeting here in <hi>London</hi> (the greatest part being antient grave Friends) Where ever they heard such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine preacht among the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> as, <hi>To exclude or shut out Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102665:77"/>
&amp; Reason of all kinds, without Distinction, and to have an Eye to the Brethren, instead of the Light in themselves?</hi> And they never heard such Preaching, nor any such Doctrine preached among the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> at all, either in City or Country, much less <hi>frequently.</hi> And their (with many others) negative Testimony, may be of credit in this case, else how should we answer those that falsly accuse us with <hi>Jesuits</hi> frequently preaching among us, but by our negative Testimony from our certain knowledge of those that do preach among us, that they are no such? Put case any of our peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Meetings should by our Persecutors be charg'd with committing a <hi>Riot</hi> at such a time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and place; We deny the Charge and declare it to be utterly false, and produce evidence and proof sufficient and credible, (in contradiction to it) that our Meeting at such a time and place was in a peaceable posture, and nothing of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or hurt done, offered or threatned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we prove a Negative, that our Meeting was <hi>no Riot,</hi> by proving the Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative, that it was <hi>Peaceable.</hi> And what's frequently preached among us in our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Meetings is as publick as they. And set case a Person be falsly accused for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102665:78"/>
               <hi>Burglary</hi> at such a time and place, and he produces sufficient Evidence, that he lodged at an Inn twenty or thirty or forty Miles off at that very same time when the fact was done. Here he proves a Negative, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he did not commit the fact.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. To thy saying, viz. <hi>If in his sence I mis-express my self, then my meaning shall not be taken to excuse the defect,</hi> p. 47. That's not true; for wouldst thou be so low in thy Mind, and so ingenious as either to confess such mis-expressing or defect, where we meet it, and clogg thee with it in thy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and not be tenacious therein, it would the more excuse thee, and shorten the Debate.</p>
            <p>I do not at all find, that thou canst come clearly off, as either a just or righteous man in thy Allegations and Instances in thy <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi> for thy proceeding to print and publish thy great Book, by thy principal instance of the printed Epistle of two Sheets by <hi>Anne Whitehead</hi> and <hi>Mary Elson,</hi> which thine (when nigh printed) did occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for that could not be the occasion of thine, when 'twas not in being till thine was almost finished in the Press. Thou producest no Plea to clear thy self, but what's presupposed, anticipated and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid in our said Treatise, pag. 26, 27.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:102665:78"/>
However, by thee impertinently slighted as <hi>Impertinent.</hi> That the said Epistle was thy principal Instance for thy so proceeding, is no <hi>false Assertion,</hi> as thou wouldst make it, is evident from thy own account, on which 'tis grounded: The matter is fully evinced in our said Treatise, under the tenth <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection,</hi> from page 19, to pag. 37.</p>
            <p>Thy alledging, <hi>Thou only assertedst</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation <hi>of the said Epistle, to shew that they were the first Publishers in Print, but not the first Printers.</hi> Of what? That there are Divisions, &amp;c? This will not clear thee, nor evince thy Righteousness in proceeding to print and publish thy Book, on thy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the said Epistle of two Sheets, which on this occasion was chiefly thy concern to evidence and mention, and that in pursuance of thy own Justification, to prove thy Righteousness in proceeding to Print, which the other Instances given by thee (about the publication of Divisions by Declaration by Manuscript) do not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer nor seem to parallel, but that chief one of <hi>Printing.</hi> And what? the said printed Epistle of two Sheets, though the greatest part of thy great Book was printed before that was writ? To thy now confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, <hi>That they</hi> (i. e. <hi>Mary Elson</hi> and <hi>Anne Whitehead, &amp;c.) were the first Publishers in Print, but not the first Printers.</hi> Then their
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102665:79"/>
Publication could be no just plea nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for thy proceeding to Print, as thou didst. Thy not being the first Publisher, but they, does neither excuse thy intention as Righteous, nor thy act of first Printing: 'Twas the bulkiness of thy Book that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented its first Publication, and the small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of theirs (though not writ till after a great part of thine was printed) that did expedite its publication.</p>
            <p>Thy saying, <hi>Thou only assertedst Promulga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said Epistle,</hi> is an evasion: 'Twas in pursuance of thy pretence of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in thy proceeding to Print, as well as to promulgate or publish thy Book of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that thou gavest that instance of the said Epistle being printed. And as a supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thy <hi>Postscript,</hi> to what thou hadst writ in thy <hi>Preface</hi> and <hi>Introduction</hi> (which thou judgedst <hi>might give sufficient satisfaction to every Impartial Reader) but lest the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of any should be so great, as not from thence to perceive the Righteousness of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Print,</hi> they might by these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in thy <hi>Postscript,</hi> which therefore relate to the same proceeding that the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> and <hi>Introduction</hi> do: See, the case is plain, 'tis no evading it. Therefore thou appearest not ingenious in thy Allegation, viz. <hi>He represents not the state of the case aright; for my own words were these,</hi> viz.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:102665:79"/>
               <hi>My Present proceeding to Print (the word</hi> [Present] <hi>they leave out) which could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to any thing more than the</hi> Postscript, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the very</hi> Postscript <hi>informs the Reader, that</hi> All <hi>the Treatise, excepting the</hi> Postscript, Index <hi>and</hi> Errata, <hi>was then printed,</hi> p. 49.</p>
            <p>This will not render thee either a sincere or just man in thy proceeding (<hi>William</hi>) we do not leave out the word <hi>Present</hi> in the citation of thy words; for 'tis incerted in our citation of thy own words, relating both to thy <hi>Preface, Introduction</hi> and <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script,</hi> all alledged for thy present procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Print, and to evince the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness thereof; And thou knowest in thy own Conscience, that either thy Word [<hi>PRESENT</hi>] must relate to more than thy Postscript, or else thou wast very Impertinent and defective. If when in a Postscript, by additional and supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Plea or Reasons to all that precedes in thy <hi>Preface,</hi> thou art going about to make out the Righteousness (pretended) of thy present proceeding to Print and publish Divisions; we must thereby under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it <hi>not to relate to any thing more than thy Postscript.</hi> Then we must take thy meaning to be, as if thou must have more plain and convincing Reasons for thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Print thy Postscript of but four Sheets, than for all the rest of thy Book of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102665:80"/>
near four score Sheets: And yet the plea in thy Postscript appears to supply what thou hast said in thy Preface, in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy publishing in Print thy Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Relation, or great Book of Divisions. I cannot perceive that thou hast herein writ either Ingeniously, Conscientiously or Consistently. And thou mightest have seen how thou wast aforehand obviated, which might have prevented thy present impertinent Excuses and vain Allegations, if thou hadst but taken serious notice of the following recited passage in our Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And further, If to evade the charge of Fallacy and Injustice, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and False cover laid on <hi>W. R.</hi> in this matter,<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <q>1<hi>st,</hi> We say, <hi>His present proceeding to Print</hi> cannot in reason be confined to his Postscript, wherein the Words are, nor answer the <hi>SOME</hi> of the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> he tells of, that have judged him wicked, as for intending to Print against Friends, <hi>Post.</hi> p. 25. (whom he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to answer in that case) nor vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him as to his Historical Relation, (mentioned in the same page) which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:102665:80"/>
includes his Book, which therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be confined to, nor included in his Postscript.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <q>2<hi>dly,</hi> The Reasons he gives in his Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, to prove himself Righteous in his proceeding to Print, cannot relate only to that his Postscript, but to his whole Book, because they are added for a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement to his Preface to the Reader, and his Introduction to the first and fourth parts of his Treatise; which Preface and Introduction concern his whole Book or Historical Relation (as he calls it.) And which Preface and Introduction he thinks may give sufficient satisfaction to every impartial &amp; unprejudiced Reader: <hi>But lest the Ignorance or Blindness of any should be so great, as not from thence to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Righteousness of his present proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Print,</hi> &amp;c. he gives his additional Reasons and Instances in his Postscript; the chief whereof is that relating to the two printed Sheets, which came to his Hands the 8th of <hi>November,</hi> 1680. as aforesaid, wherein the supplemental Reason given, was more clearly to evince the pretended Justness of his proceeding to Print, than he had done before in his said Preface or Introduction, as that it was even to prevent such great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Partiality as would hinder any
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:102665:81"/>
from perceiving his Righteousness in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to Print. [which therefore must needs relate to more than his Postscript.]</q>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>William,</hi> I find no Contradiction, as thou accusest, between our signifying, That the two Sheets aforesaid was <hi>the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Instance</hi> for thy proceeding to print and publish thy Book, (that is, to prove thy Righteousness pretended therein, as 'twas made appear from thy own Words) AND signifying that thou declaredst a far higher necessity, i. e. <hi>a great concern of Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. That the Epistle of two Sheets, afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, was thy principal Instance, Reason or Allegation, to prove the Righteousness (pretended) of thy proceeding, is no down-right falshood (as thou falsly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derest it) but true; for 'twas <hi>CHIEFLY thy concern</hi> to give that Instance of the said Epistle after other Instances of less con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and less to the purpose of <hi>Printing,</hi> &amp;c. And that thou also placedst a higher necessity on thy proceeding, than the said two Sheets, is also true: The first was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as a principal instance or cause, to evince the Righteousness of thy proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to print an <hi>Historical Relation,</hi> &amp;c. The second was thy own Assertion for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of thy proceeding, pretending it for the clearing of thy Conscience, &amp;c. Such <hi>necessity</hi> (pretended) of proceeding
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:102665:81"/>
was higher than thy said Instance or Reason for it, as between an Immediate necessity of doing a thing, and an outward Reason or Instance for doing it. Where's now the Contradiction? If there be any, it must be thy own, in placing such occasion on the said two Sheets, as to be <hi>so chiefly</hi> concern'd at them, and yet a more immediate necessity of Conscience, &amp;c. before that. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of this point considered, in reference to thy being so <hi>chiefly</hi> concerned, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance the said Epistle of two Sheets, thy Charge that <hi>a down-right Vntruth is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject occasioning his Words,</hi> p. 49. (which thou callest <hi>Drollery</hi>) falleth to the Ground as a down-right Falshood. That which thou callest <hi>Drollery</hi> (in conclusion of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection we made of thy unrighteous and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Vindication of thy proceeding to Print, &amp;c.) I am perswaded it hit thee, and touched thee, as in a way of answering a Fool (that is, such a one as is highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and wise in his own Eyes) accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Folly. And how natural and suitable that passage (thou callest <hi>Drollery</hi>) is to the subject and occasion given on thy part, unto which it relates, I leave to the impartial and ingenious Reader to consider and judge, upon perusal of the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerning that point, as 'tis handled in our said Treatise, entituled, <hi>The Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:102665:82"/>
of our Brethren cast down,</hi> under the 10<hi>th Disaffection</hi>; from p. 19. to p. 37.</p>
            <p>Unto all which (<hi>William</hi>) thou hast but given an Impertinent <hi>Fling,</hi> and the slie <hi>GO-BY</hi> to the substance, even the most part thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Whereas upon thy Confusion and Contradiction to many Friends about the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> that God forbad Man to eat of: The Question was put concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy self, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> What kind of Preacher would he make, if he should tell People, <hi>The Tree of Knowledge is good for Food; the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food?</hi> This Question thou takest to be <hi>grounded on a down-right Falshood</hi>; for sayest thou, <hi>I never asserted that the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was good for Food, and that it was not good for Food; neither have I written any thing to shew my own sence either way,</hi> p. 50.</p>
            <p>No! That's strange; and a gross and manifest Untruth and Shuffle, I am sure: And I may ask thee, if thou hast not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed thy own Conscience in these Words? How darest thou now utter in Print, that thou hast not written any thing to shew thy own sence either way, <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether the Tree of Knowledge be good for Food, or not good for Food? Hast thou not (in the first place) written to shew thy own
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102665:82"/>
sence, <hi>That it is good for Food,</hi> by thy plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposing the contrary Doctrine, as preached by divers among us: (<hi>viz.</hi> That the Tree of Knowledge was not good for Food.) Hast not thou plainly <hi>objected</hi> against this Doctrine? Instancing, <hi>That a Father may command his Child not to eat an Apple; his Rebellious eating no Argument to prove the Apple in it self not good for Food: And we know not on what Foot of Truth any one can assert that the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food.</hi> And to prove the Tree of Knowledge in it self good for Food, thou also didst cite <hi>John</hi> 17. <hi>This is Life Eternal to know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> Thence infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>so that Knowledge is the way to Life.</hi> But did God forbid the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and of his Son, to Man in Innocency, when he forbad him to eat of the Tree of Knowledge? Didst thou not here plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough shew thy sence, <hi>That the Tree of Knowledge was good for Food?</hi> And doth not this imply that the Serpent was more kind to Man in moving to eat of it, than his Maker was in forbidding him? There's no need of thy adding [<hi>as in it self</hi>] for the Tree <hi>is it self.</hi> With what Conscience then durst thou adventure not only to say, <hi>Thou never assertedst that the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was good for Food,</hi> but also, that <hi>thou
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:102665:83"/>
hast not written any thing, to shew thy own sence either way.</hi> Oh, wonderful! I somewhat admire at such a manifest gross Untruth, that thou shouldst undertake in several Pages, with several Objections, to oppose a Doctrine, as thou didst that of <hi>the Tree of Knowledge not being good for Food</hi>: And now to flam us off, with telling us, That <hi>thou hast not written any thing to shew thy own sence either way?</hi> Hast thou not here play'd Legerdemain, to write so plainly in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to another's Position, and yet tell us, <hi>Neither hast thou written any thing to shew thy own sence either way?</hi> For shame leave off such Impertinent Scribling, and spend thy time better in the Creation. But yet what reason for the Question, viz. <hi>What kind of Preacher wouldst thou make, if thou shouldst tell People, the Tree of Knowledge is good for Food, the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food?</hi> For the first, thou hast shewn thy sence plainly, however thou wouldst now smother it: The latter appears deducible from thy finding out a <hi>Salvo,</hi> or Plea, for some that may declare, <hi>That the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food; for thou wouldst not be understood to reflect on all that have used that Expression, because thou que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionest not but many have so express'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves — to shew that if we should feed upon, or admire any excellent Qualification or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102665:83"/>
and not have the Eye of our mind Chiefly unto the Giver, we might then come to a loss</hi>; See the Second Part of thy <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-Quaker,</hi> p. 28, 29. Thus hast thou excused the Doctrine before opposed by thee, viz. <hi>That the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. As for <hi>G. F</hi>'s Epistle against the envious Spirits, and Persecutors of those who could not observe their outward Things, Traditions, &amp;c. thou dost much insist on these Words, viz. <hi>They that do so,</hi> viz. <hi>set up outward things, gather People to themselves, not unto God, &amp;c.</hi> If these be truly cited, <hi>G F.</hi> best knows his own Intention, and in point of Justice ought rather to have been enquired of, as to have been his own Interpreter, than to have been brought forth in Print under the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise of a prejudicial Interpretation and straining his Words, and turning his sence besides whatever was intended in them, or by him. And what hast thou got by the said Citation, thou hast so much insisted on? If thou strainest the Litteral sense thus, <hi>That no outward things are to be set up, nor outward Order practised in the Church of Christ.</hi> Thou wilt therein farther inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with thy self, having already granted outward Form and Order, &amp;c. to be in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:102665:84"/>
the Church of Christ, yea, even the case of Marriage; as what care thou tookest about the marrying thy two Daughters, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But <hi>G. F</hi>'s intention and sence in the words of his said Epistle, is by another hand fully spoken to, and therefore I forbear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging on them. However thy construction, That <hi>out of</hi> G. F<hi>'s Mouth he and his Brethren may justly be compared to</hi> Cain <hi>for persecuting their Brethren, for no other cause than for not submitting to outward things,</hi> &amp;c. p. 50.</p>
            <p>This Construction I look upon to be very gross and reproachful, and that it proceeded from a persecuting spirit, that is, a false and unjust Judge.</p>
            <p>And as false and malicious (<hi>William</hi>) is thy dark smiting, in telling <hi>of such sort of Preachers, (i. e.</hi> among the People called <hi>Quakers) whose Pride and Insolency might prompt them at this day to say,—Though you are our Witnesses, that we have often declared that our Commission from God was to turn People from the Power of Satan to God, that so they might all come to be ordered and governed by the appearance of the Power in themselves; yet we did</hi> NOT <hi>mean, but that when we had gathered any into the Truth, we should be those who ought to have the</hi> RULE <hi>over them, and that such should observe our Traditions, or follow us,</hi> Without giving a Reason why;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102665:84"/>
               <hi>and though they might in Truth be submitting themselves one to another in the Lord (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Apostles Counsel) yet all of them must submit to us, and reverence, honour and obey us, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 50, 51. Thus far thou (<hi>William.</hi>)</p>
            <p>But that any Preachers among the said People called <hi>Quakers</hi> have so said or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after this exalted, imperious and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent manner, I must take leave to deny, till I have better proof from thee, than thy quoting thy self, or thy saying (that in the 48 &amp; 49 pages of the 3d part of thy Treatise entituled, <hi>The Christian-Quaker) 'Tis so written,</hi> which is thy own Book, making thy self thy own Authority proof for thy self; and then thy saying, <hi>'Tis as naturally deduced from</hi> R. B<hi>'s discourse in his Book of Government</hi>; and then quotest thy self again for Proof, bidding us <hi>see pages</hi> 41 to 49. in thy said 3<hi>d Part.</hi> But still, we deny thy Credit in the case, thou art no sufficient Proof for thy self against us; 'tis a meer begging of the Question. The Pride and Insolency thou wouldst now fix upon <hi>R.B.</hi> he utterly denyes, as also, <hi>That those whom we have gathered to the Truth, should observe our Traditions,</hi> Without <hi>giving a Reason why.</hi> He also denys, that this is either naturally deduced or justly deducible from any dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of his in his said Book. And I must
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102665:85"/>
tell thee <hi>(William)</hi> this looks like one of <hi>Tho. Hicks</hi>'s Abuses and gross Forgeries in his <hi>Dialogues</hi>; seeing it has always been our Principle to give convincing Reason, where scruples or doubts are, first to remove them, and clear Peoples understandings (so far as the Lord enables us) before they proceed to act in any Religious Performances; and we being the Servants of our Lord Jesus Christ, we utterly abhor and detest setting up our selves <hi>as Lords over God's Heritage</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or seeking to have the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> over them or their Faith; and we may each of us conclude, and say with his Servant Gideon, <hi>I will not Rule over you, the Lord shall Rule over you,</hi> Judges 8.22, 23. 'Tis not Man, but the Lord we must exalt.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Thou <hi>(W. R.)</hi> still proceedest falsly and perversly in saying, viz. <hi>That Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies have entred the breasts of thousands, that though these our travelling Brethren exalted the Spirit of God in man, as the only sufficient Rule for man, and declared, that the Scriptures were not a sufficient Rule to man; yet instead of leaving us to the Rule which they have declared to be sufficient, they strain that which they have declared not sufficient, to make it (as much as in them lies) a Rule for them to rule over their Brethren,</hi> p. 51.</p>
            <p>To all which I say, 1<hi>st,</hi> We have no
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102665:85"/>
cause to believe thy story, that such Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies have entred thousands. 2<hi>dly,</hi> All travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Brethren, approved among us, exalt the Spirit of God in man as much as ever. 3<hi>dly,</hi> Such do not make the holy Scriptures (however truly own'd in their place) any such Rule as for them to rule over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, such being called to feed the flock, and not be as Lords over Gods Heritage, nor as seeking <hi>Dominion</hi> over their Brethrens Faith, but to walk in the Humility of Jesus Christ, as Ensamples to the flock. Thy thoughts therefore to the contrary concerning those who gave forth our Treatise, entituled, <hi>The Accuser, &amp;c.</hi> are utterly wrong; and thy quoting thy self in thy said <hi>third Part,</hi> is as feeble and impertinent as before in thy Forgery against <hi>R. B. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. About the Tree of Knowledge again, thou <hi>(W. R.)</hi> again proceedest thus, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 51. <hi>The</hi> Pen-man <hi>thus saith, By all this opposition to the Doctrine, That the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food,</hi> William Rogers <hi>seems to account it good for Food. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing said by me, or cited as my words by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shews either opposition or assent to such Doctrine,</hi> p. 51.</p>
            <p>That's a manifest untruth again, and before detected: Many of thy own words cited in our said Treatise, do plainly shew
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:102665:86"/>
thy assent to such Doctrine, and that thou accountedst the Tree of Knowledge <hi>good for Food,</hi> especially in thy opposing the contrary Doctrine. Review the Passage in thy own <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> part 2. p. 27, 28, 29. with our Answer, <hi>Accuser, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114. and pag. 222, 223, 224. <hi>If nothing said by thee, or cited as thy words, shew either opposition or assent to the said Doctrine; and that thou hast not written any thing to shew thy sence either way,</hi> as thou hast declared, how hast thou pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued thy charge of <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Innovation?</hi> Didst thou not bring in that Doctrine <hi>(That the Tree of Knowledge was not good for Food)</hi> among other things to prove thy charge of <hi>Apostacy</hi> and <hi>Innovation</hi> against us, and this as to Doctrine opposed by thee? But now wilt not own either opposition or assent in any thing said or written by thee, to shew thy own sence either way. Oh <hi>William!</hi> where's thy Conscience, in writing not only thus insignificantly, but thus evasively and prevaricatingly? And how hast thou by such Impertinency distinguished or proved thy self and party <hi>The Christian-Quaker,</hi> and those against whom thou writest <hi>The Apostate and Innovator,</hi> either in Doctrine or Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, when thou hast attempted it in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? Thy attempts and opposition signifie nothing; thou hast not written any
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:102665:86"/>
thing to shew thy sence either way. Then thou hast produced nothing to prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>To thy saying, viz. <hi>If we had learned from the Scriptures, that the Serpent had said, 'Twas good for food, yet it would not have shewn me erronious in my Assertion, unless the words</hi> [as in it self] <hi>had been added, which are not,</hi> pag. 51.</p>
            <p>Thy Assertion! What Assertion hast thou made in the case, when thou hast not written any thing to shew thy sence either way, either of opposition or assent to such Doctrine, if therein we may believe thee? But how inconsistent with thy self art thou, as between shewing no sence, and thy As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion in the same case? And what if the word [<hi>as in it self</hi>] are not added, for <hi>the Tree of Knowledge being good for Food, as in it self,</hi> as thou hast plainly enough implyed? What would that have added to the <hi>verity</hi> of thy Assertion, or to the weight of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whilst the Controversie relates to <hi>the Tree of Knowledge,</hi> whether or no it be good for food, it relates to <hi>it self,</hi> and not to another; for that Tree is <hi>it self.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, thou mayst intend, [<hi>as in it self</hi>] to be <hi>in its own Nature,</hi> without respect to the Command.</p>
            <p>The matter in Question is not Whether the Tree of Knowledge be <hi>good in it self,</hi>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:102665:87"/>
but whether it be good for such an end and purpose, as for <hi>Food, i. e.</hi> for the Soul of man, either before the Fall, or in the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Both God's Prohibition and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience teach the contrary, <hi>viz. That 'tis not good for Food</hi>; though otherwise, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (rightly so called) be good as <hi>in its own Nature.</hi> But the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> is a mixt Knowledge, not Food for an innocent Soul; 'tis the pure unmixt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the good only which springs from divine Life that is its Food. The words [<hi>Tree of Knowledge</hi>] are an allusion, and is Mysteriously to be understood only in the Light of Christ.</p>
            <p>To thy saying, <hi>'Tis hard to know with what sort of Spirit the Pen-man, most immediately concerned in the</hi> Accuser, &amp;c. <hi>is at unity with; For 'tis evident he doth not give the Devil his due, neither doth he give God or good Men their due,</hi> pag. 52.</p>
            <p>Is it hard to know? How camest thou then so severely to censure and judge him and his Spirit, as <hi>Impious, Wicked,</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>But in humility and fear of the Lord, he is at Unity (and daily converseth) with the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is a Spirit of true Understanding and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby he clearly discerns, and hath Power to judge thy dark, confused Spirit of Enmity, and its unfruitful Works
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102665:87"/>
of Darkness and Division against Christ and his true followers.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. Concerning <hi>Tythes,</hi> thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest to except against the Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them,<note place="margin">P. 52.</note> 
               <hi>That they are (as at this day paid under pretence of being Due, JVRE DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINO)—Antichristian,</hi> and also against the <hi>Humane Institution and constraint</hi> to pay them. [And thus far we do not oppose thee, nor have shewn disaffection.] But thou hast found out another and more easie way to pay them: Thus, viz. <hi>Yet if any Person will FREELY of himself give a Tenth part of his Estate, or of the Increase thereof TO ANY VSE WHATSOEVER; having no regard to any Humane Institution or Claim by vertue of any pretended Divine Law, it can no more be called Antichristian then,</hi> &amp;c. p. 52.</p>
            <p>No! not as given to <hi>any use whatsoever?</hi> That's large and loose, and as strange! Suppose some do freely pay Tythes to maintain an Antichristian Ministry, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regard to the plea of <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or humane Institution or Constraint, but vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily and freely, which needs no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint nor coertion: Were not this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian? And did not the <hi>Christian-Quaker</hi> bear Testimony from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning against the Antichristian Ministry and Tythes paid to maintain them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102665:88"/>
by some paid freely or not; the labour was to bring People from them to Christ, the great Shepherd, and end of the first Priesthood, Tythes and the Law that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them.</p>
            <p>Art not thou now evading and shifting from our first Testimony, that was absolute against the payment of Tythes in these Gospel dayes? And doth not these thy evasive Apostatizing shifts tend to draw others into Looseness and Apostacy, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the Cross, and cast off the Yoke of our Lord Jesus Christ?</p>
            <p>Again, thou givest a recital of thy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Objection or Question of thy own framing, in the case of Tythes; but now craftily leavest out thy Objection, which concern'd Tythes, as given to the <hi>National Ministry,</hi> thus, viz. <hi>But what if it please the Supream Power to bestow on the National Ministry Tythes? How prove you from Scripture, that those who freely pay it, do ill? or that 'tis not lawful for them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from such?</hi> These are thy own Words, (<hi>William</hi>) to which thou madest the following Answer, mentioned in our 40<hi>th Disaffection,</hi> and recited in these words, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We are so far from condemning those who freely pay them,</hi> (i. e. Tythes) <hi>and not as by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102665:88"/>
Constraint, that we look upon it to be the Duty of all,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page 52.</note> 
               <hi>professing Christianity, to contribute towards the outward Maintenance of such whom they usually hear, and account to be the true Ministers of Christ, though not obliged thereto by Law, in case they have need,</hi> p. 52.</p>
            <p>We remain still Disaffected with thy Doctrine it this point, (<hi>William</hi>) so far as it relates to the paying of Tythes: Thy granting an uncondemned Liberty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for them who can freely pay them to those they account the true Ministers of Christ (though they be the National Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry) I am sure is contrary to the antient Testimony of the true <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> and all faithful travelling Brethren in the Gospel and Work of Christ, <hi>To contribute towards the outward Maintenance,</hi> &amp;c. is not the matter under debate. But the Question immediately relating to the Payment of Tythes, as 'tis included in thy own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in the case, which thou hast craftily forborn to recite, and only recitest the Words of thy Answer; both being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, do more clearly evince thy Unchristian Liberty and Apostacy, in justifying Mens freely paying Tythes to those they count Ministers of Christ, &amp;c. yea, though it be to the National Ministry, by thy Objection and Answer before. Thy
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:102665:89"/>
varying the Terms from [<hi>FREELY PAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING them</hi>] i. e. <hi>Tythes, TO</hi> a <hi>CONTRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BVTING</hi> towards their outward Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, appears but a Prevaricating shift, and evading the terms of thy own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Question: Review the Point in thy own 2d Part, <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> in granting a Liberty of freely paying Tythes to the National Ministry, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation (as before.) Thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. Story</hi>'s Testimony, viz. <hi>As to Tythes, we can in truth say, 'twas never so much as in our Hearts to strengthen any in the Payment thereof, nor yet to weaken the Faith of any, having a Testimony in our Hearts that Tythes, as at this day paid, are Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian.</hi> Mark, [<hi>as at this day paid</hi>] is to the National Ministry; by some freely, and by others by constraint. As also thou shewest thy fallacious Insinuation and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varication, from the terms under debate, in concluding, <hi>That the Pen-man would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude such sort of Charity to any ministring Professor of Christianity, besides such as he may account of his own Brotherhood, whereby their outward Man might receive Sustenance; else if they accounted it not Christian-like, to give on a Charitable score, TYTHES, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Compulsion; yet he might have shewn his assent that their Conscientious Hearers might (without Condemnation) have administred in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102665:89"/>
another Method,</hi> p. 53. How falsly hast thou insinuated against the Pen-man, and daubed with the Professors, as if now thou wouldst ingratiate thy self, to come into favour with the Professors, who are against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and as if thou wouldst please them, by telling <hi>of giving on a Charitable score, Tythes.</hi> But <hi>William,</hi> I am sorry thou shouldst thus wrong thy own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (by such false Insinuations) for therein thou knowest the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and our Observation was not about (nor for) excluding such sort of Charity, as that of freely relieving or contributing towards the Sustenance of the outward Man of any of them, in case of need; for that Humanity allows, much more Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity: But the matter in question, was singly about the <hi>freely paying of Tythes,</hi> and that <hi>to the National Ministry,</hi> (as thy Words were) against which our 40<hi>th Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection</hi> was directed. And thy insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting expressions about <hi>giving on a Charitable score Tythes,</hi> will not excuse thee, nor clear thee in this matter; as also on this occasion thou fallaciously insinuatest in thy Prayer, viz. <hi>The Lord preserve me and all true</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians <hi>from that Censorious Spirit, as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that there are no other Sheep than of the Pen-man's Fold,</hi> p. 53.</p>
            <p>Whom dost thou herein accuse? We
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:102665:90"/>
deny any such Censorious Spirit, with thy terms [<hi>Pen-man's Fold</hi>] for 'tis Christ's Fold we own. Thou art an uncharitable censorious Spirit. We know there are other Sheep, as Christ declared, which he will fetch home into his Fold: But thou appearest none of Christ's Sheep, either in his Fold, or out of his Fold, whilst in such an Envious, Wolfish and Scornful Spirit.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. Whereas to our 44<hi>th Disaffection,</hi> about <hi>Circumcision</hi> being a <hi>Christian-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,</hi> according to thy own Words; thou sayest, viz. <hi>Suppose I had in any part of my Writings laid down, that the practice of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision, by one that was a</hi> Jew, <hi>and a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in Christ, was in that day a Christian-Liberty: I only Query, (not intending to quarrel with my Adversary about a Mode of Speech, when our Meanings are the same) How can this be termed an Erronious manner of expression?—Why might not the Practice of such a</hi> Christian, <hi>be without offence term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christian-Liberty?</hi> p. 54.</p>
            <p>I Answer; Because <hi>Circumcision</hi> in the Flesh, was not only a Type under the Law, but by <hi>Christians</hi> counted a Yoke of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, not to be born by the Disciples under the Gospel, being also among other Types abolisht by Christ in his Sufferings and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:102665:90"/>
Death: Though some weak Believers, as those of the <hi>Jews</hi> did for a time practise it; yet they did it in obedience to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Old Covenant; and not in obedience to Christ and his Apostles in the New Covenant: And there was a Christian-forbearance and patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, in suffering Circumcision for a time to those of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when the Vail was not wholly done away, nor they come clearly to see to the end of those things that were abolished by Christ. (and yet no liberty nor way was given for them to draw others into it.) Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, not that <hi>Circumcision</hi> it self was <hi>Christian-Liberty, or practised in a Christian-Liberty in that day,</hi> but with respect to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>'s Law; but the forbearance towards them was Christian and tender. I am not willing to make much ado about this thy Mode of Speech; though I look on't to be an unsound and unscriptural Mode. To thy saying, <hi>Thou dost not say, that Circumcision practised as aforesaid, is a Christian-Liberty; 'tis the Pen-man's consequence, &amp;c.</hi> What hast thou said less? Thou hast told us of <hi>these Differing Exercises IN A CHRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STIAN-LIBERTY</hi>; When speaking of <hi>practising Circumcision, keeping a day, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining from eating Flesh</hi> amongst the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Believers; <hi>That Christian-Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102665:91"/>
&amp;c.</hi> See thy own Recitation, p. 53. 7<hi>th Part.</hi> Circumcision then was one of those differing Exercises, which thou pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest <hi>in a Christian Liberty,</hi> and which in thy next page thou termest <hi>Christian-Liberty,</hi> as before: And thou sayest, <hi>If the mode of Speech be not pertinent to express the matter in hand—'Tis our own approved Language.</hi> I think thou mistakest here, <hi>(William)</hi> and the passage thou citest out of <hi>R. B</hi>'s Book of Government, p. 63, 64. proves it not from these Words cited, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <q>There is a certain Liberty and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance also, &amp;c. whereof we have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Primitive Church</q>—<hi>viz.</hi>
In suffering Circumcision to the <hi>Jews.</hi> [Did he here term Circumcision Christian-Liberty? No sure, 'twas only permitted or suffered to them, as was the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain Dayes, and abstaining from Meats, which were not holden univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally; but when laid upon others, then preacht down and reproved by the Apostle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>Is there not a plain difference between <hi>a certain Liberty in suffering Circumcision to the</hi> Jews, and <hi>terming it Christian-Liberty?</hi> Is this the very same Language <hi>approved by the Second day's Meeting</hi> (as thou sayest?) p. 55. Sure thou art much out here, (<hi>William</hi>) to our saying,
<q>That this man,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102665:91"/>
who is thus discomposed in his Work, should not have medled so much with Points of Divinity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>This passage</hi> W. R. <hi>hath Printed divers times over in his Book against him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
                  </note> which he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears so little skilful in: He dreams so much of Liberty that he is greatly bewildred in the management of it.</q>
Thou answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, <hi>'Tis Language more like the proudest of Prelates, adorned with a pair of Lawn Sleeves, than an humble Quaker,</hi> p. 53. To this add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also in p. 55. <hi>Will not the impartial Reader hence be apt to suppose, that the Pen-man's design is to ingross discourses of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to himself and his Brethren, that so the Laity may believe nothing but what proceeds from their Mouthes and Pens:</hi>
               <note place="margin">p. 55.</note> 
               <hi>If they shall complain, that this renders them guilty of gross</hi> Popery; <hi>my counsel is, Let them for the future cease giving occasion,</hi> p. 55.</p>
            <p>This Question contains both scorn and falshood, suggested against us, to render us guilty of <hi>Popery,</hi> as before is discovered: We have no such design of engrosement, nor <hi>Popish</hi> distinction among us, as between <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity</hi>; the Spirit of Christ, and true knowledge of Divinity, are not limitted nor engrossed in the will of man, to Persons; neither doth our reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a discomposed Person for medling in
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:102665:92"/>
things beyond his skill, prove us Guilty in these cases.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>William,</hi> thou proceedest abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively and falsly in these Words, viz. <hi>For 'tis well known, that</hi> G. Fox <hi>his party have been so Contentious, as that nothing would content them but the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing new Practices,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 55.</note> 
               <hi>under the Notion of Gospel-Discipline, in a Spirit of Strife and Contention, concluding all to be dark that saw not with their Eyes,</hi> p. 55.</p>
            <p>I shall say little to these Reproachful Censures. But the Lord rebuke this false, malicious, censorious, judging, exalted, conceited Spirit: And he will manifestly rebuke it, I doubt not.</p>

I find not his sence or meaning in them va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried or altered at all, so far as I can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand or gather.</p>
            <p>Now (<hi>W. R.</hi>) in pursuance of thy charge before, thou engagest in these words, viz. <hi>I shall now proceed to cite only three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in one Leaf of their Catalogue, next to the Title,</hi> viz. <hi>One of their Forgery, another of their cript Citations, and a third of their cript and non-sensical Representations of my sound words, &amp;c.</hi> p. 56.</p>
            <p>Observe by the way, That seeing the Instances are so few, as only Three (and though he calls them <hi>only a taste, &amp;c.</hi> p. 58) the Reader may presuppose them to be (in his thoughts) knocking ones, or the most
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:102665:93"/>
likely for his purpose, and the most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for his turn that he could find or pick out, and such palpable Forgery, &amp;c. as nothing to be said for it. But see if it prove so; see if he knocks us in the Head or down with it: Now observe his great and chief Instance, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They thus represent me to say in the</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-Quaker, <hi>Part</hi> 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 4. <hi>That they are persecuting Opposers who oppose</hi> John Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>and</hi> John Story: <hi>My own words are, Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the Lord shall be pleased to change the hearts of the persecuting Opposers of</hi> John Wilkinson <hi>and</hi> John Story. <hi>This Forgery—to me appears to render me a Persecutor; for, saith he, would</hi> William Rogers <hi>be counted a Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor for his opposing others more vehemently? I abhor Persecution, and in this Controversie do act the part of a Defendant against (and in discovery of) a Company of PERSECVTORS,</hi> p. 56.</p>
            <p>Now let the Ingenious Reader observe, what great difference is there in thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting him? what variation of his sence? as between his saying, <hi>The persecuting Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers of</hi> J. S. <hi>and</hi> J. W. and saying, That <hi>they are persecuting Opposers who oppose them?</hi> I must confess, I am not so critical as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a variation of his sence, or much of his words, in this small Transposition, though he now makes his exception, <hi>That
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102665:94"/>
there may be Opposition to each other, from difference in Religion, yet not attended with Persecution.</hi> He should have told us, that exception was included in his discourse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this point, <hi>viz. That only some of the Opposers of</hi> J. W. <hi>and</hi> J. S. <hi>were persecuting Opposers, but not all of them: Some of their Opposers are not Persecutors:</hi> But we must commonly be troubled with his colateral Meanings to supply his precedent Defects. But then, what <hi>Company of Persecutors</hi> are those he now tells of, against whom he acts the part of a Defendant? Are they not all he has written against in this Controversie, both named and unnamed? And are not these the Opposers of <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S?</hi> Are they not those whom he calls <hi>G. F. and his Party, G. F. and his Brethren</hi>? And has he not counted them <hi>Persecutors,</hi> yea, <hi>a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Persecutors?</hi> Who then are opposers of <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> that are not of party with <hi>G. F.</hi> (in <hi>W. R</hi>'s account) and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently no Persecutors? For <hi>W. R.</hi> saith, <hi>G. F. and his Brethren (out of</hi> G. F<hi>'s mouth) may be justy compared to</hi> Cain <hi>for persecuting their Brethren,</hi> p. 50. And as plainly <hi>W. R.</hi> shews his meaning, and the intent of his words (before cited) where in page 22. in his comparison between the Paper signed by <hi>Charles Marshall,</hi> &amp;c. and Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth his Bull against <hi>Martin Luther (Anno</hi>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:102665:94"/>
1520.) <hi>W. R.</hi> saith, <hi>But in the aforesaid Paper there is no mention of any particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Viciousness of Life, for which they (i. e.</hi> J.S. and J.W.) <hi>are persecuted by their Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now wherein (I pray) is his meaning or sence of his words (about <hi>persecuting Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers</hi>) altered, or the intent of his Mind <hi>clouded,</hi> (as he complains) in what we have represented? W. R<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> represents himself <hi>in this Controversie as one acting the part of a Defendant, only against a Company of Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.</hi> But I am sure he greatly acts the part of an Offendor and bitter Persecutor, with his bitter words of hatred, to scandalize many innocent Friends, approved Servants and Ministers of Christ among the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> with <hi>Popery,</hi> tending great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to render that People obnoxious. Whilst he is complaining of Persecution, he's act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the part of a most bitter Persecuting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former and Incendiary. Apostate <hi>Judas</hi>'s are the worst of Informers.</p>
            <p>As for his Complaint of <hi>cript Citation and nonsensical Representation of words</hi>; I must say, and that according to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, his words are so largely cited, as that the drift and scope of his Intention and Sence may be understood, though some of his long Parenthesis and super-abundant Expressions are left out. I would not desire
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:102665:95"/>
to be more largely cited by himself, or any Adversary whatsoever, than he is in his words. And for my own part, I sometime think that I am apt to cite my Adversary's words too largely, but it is, that both his sence may the more plainly appear, and what occasion he gives, either for a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or inference naturally to be deduced. And I find not the Passage non-sensically represented, which he recites, pag. 57. But in that he calls the <hi>cript Citation</hi> (in the 6th line of the same page, I find his recital wrong, viz. <hi>words</hi> for <hi>fruits</hi>) But how can it be cript, when the page is quoted, where 'tis to be found at large?</p>
            <p>Upon the serious perusal of our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary's reiterated black Charges of <hi>Palpable Forgery and Prevarications,</hi> pag. 57, 58. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his attempts to prove them. I do solemnly profess in the sight of God, I do not find my self conscious, nor justly chargeable therein; for I really am for giving the Devil his due, and not to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge nor mischarge him in any case (how bad soever he be in himself) much less to overcharge my fellow-Creatures, how much prejudiced soever any of them be against me. Yet though I know my own Innocence, both as to Intention and Principle, I impose not my bare sence and credit upon the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders judgment, but leave him therein free,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:102665:95"/>
to the light of Truth in himself, to take impartial and just measures in what he reads in this Controversie, relating either to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons or Principles; and let the Light of Truth in all judge, for to that I appeal.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. To what <hi>W. R.</hi> saith of the <hi>Pen-man's</hi> Method, <hi>If it should become of Credit, 'twere then easie to undertake a Proof of any sort of Negative, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 58.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Mistake; for when I see a Person fearing God abused, scandalized, defamed and mis-represented, contrary to his known Principle and Practice (as I am really sensible and satisfied in my judgment, thou <hi>W. R.</hi> hast frequently dealt by <hi>G. F.</hi> and others) I may give my positive Testimony and Judgment against such abusive and malicious Treatment, and yet not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a Proof of any sort of Negative; and then it concerns thee <hi>W. R.</hi> to make Proof of thy Charges and Accusations, when they are either denyed, or a negative Testimony given against them; otherwise not to think thy self secure by quarrelling with Negative Testimonies, which in many cases are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and of credit, and not Unchristian, nor Immoral, as thou seemest to render them. Neither needed the <hi>Pen-man</hi> therein to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>G. F.</hi> to be <hi>God or Christ that never erred,</hi> as thou falsly (by way of supposition)
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102665:96"/>
arguest, pag. 59. to render us odious. For if the Pen-man did but believe (as he doth) <hi>G. F.</hi> to be <hi>a Servant of Christ,</hi> or <hi>a real Christian,</hi> or <hi>a man fearing God,</hi> he might reasonably shew an utter dislike of thy scornful Abuses, Reproaches and Scandals cast upon him, to render him as odious and obnoxious as thou canst readily do in thy Books.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. Then as concerning the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, collected in our Treatise aforesaid, from pag. 204, to p. 227. thou citest only the first Instance, and givest us thy bare Affirmation, <hi>That the rest are as groundless,</hi> pag. 59.</p>
            <p>The first Instance mentioned by thee is, BETWEEN thy telling of <hi>so great a concern of Conscience on many to encourage the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thy Book, lest it should be reputed, That the Doctrine and Life of</hi> Christianity <hi>were wholly extinct among the aforesaid People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND <hi>John Wilkinson</hi>'s writing, That <hi>of late dayes the Concord we once had seems much to be broken, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>the cause God hath manifested to me, That it is</hi> NOT IN PRINCIPLES OF TRUTH, NOR IN CHRIST's DOCTRINE, <hi>nor in any Practice which Truth, in the Members of the heavenly Body leadeth into; but about Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—through the blind zeal of the weak,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:102665:96"/>
               <hi>Observe</hi>; Hath not the one plainly here placed the <hi>Apostacy</hi> (charged) to be from <hi>the Doctrine and Life of Christianity</hi>; And the other <hi>not in Principles of Truth, nor in Christ's Doctrine? W. R.</hi> as the great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serter thereof, on behalf of himself and his party, and those whom he writes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst to be <hi>Apostates and Innovators</hi>; and not only so, but hath he not (in divers things) contradicted them both in matter of Doctrine and Practice in his Books?</p>
            <p>Hath not the other (<hi>i. e.</hi> J. W.) placed the cause of the breach of the Concord, and of the Jarr, as <hi>not being in Principles of Truth, nor in Christ's Doctrine, nor in any Practice which Truth leads into?</hi> What's more plain than Affirmative in the one, and Negative in the other, on the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? Is not here a manifest contradiction <hi>between</hi> presupposing such occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, as if <hi>the Doctrine and Life of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity were wholly extinct</hi>; And, <hi>The breach NOT in Principles of Truth, nor in Christ's Doctrine, &amp;c.</hi> The second contradiction does also make it more plain, <hi>BETWEEN</hi> W. R. his placing the dis-union <hi>in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Doctrines and Practices, and</hi> his pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it in <hi>Ceremonies, the Shell, not in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Truth, nor in Christ's Doctrine</hi>; See <hi>Accuser,</hi> p. 206, 207. As also Between the words [wholly extinct among the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102665:97"/>
               <hi>AFORESAID PEOPLE</hi>] and [<hi>Through the blind Zeal of THE WEAK;</hi>] for <hi>the weak</hi> among them, includes not <hi>the said People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>W. R.</hi> to save himself from a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to <hi>J. W.</hi> in this case, pleads the different dates of their Words, viz. that J. W's <hi>were written in the Year</hi> 1676. <hi>and</hi> W. R's <hi>in the Year</hi> 1680.—and that <hi>when Differences in the Church begin, they usually ascend higher and higher, and fresh and new occasions, are often administred,</hi> p. 60.</p>
            <p>Here he seems hard put to it, yet this will not save him, nor excuse him; for he knows that the same Practices and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, for which he has rendred many of the said People <hi>Apostate,</hi> were in being among them before the Year 1676. as with respect to <hi>Womens Meetings, Marriages, Tythes, Tree of Knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. As for <hi>Priest and Professor reputing or supposing the Doctrine and Life of Christianity extinct or suffering Shipwrack among the said People,</hi> p. 60. <hi>W. R</hi>'s rendring many, or the greatest part of them <hi>Apostate,</hi> was not the way to prevent such Thoughts or Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition in them, who were of the same mind against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> long before he writ, as being <hi>no Christians,</hi> according as he has rendred many of them: Nor will the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some in the publick Meeting at
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:102665:97"/>
               <hi>Bristol</hi> (whether of his own party, or any others) prove a just occasion of such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute against <hi>the said People</hi> called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as his words suppose, without exception.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. Of the Catalogue of his Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, <hi>W. R.</hi> again gives us his own <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,</hi> That <hi>not one Instance mentioned therein, as contradiction, will bear that term</hi>; and then cryes out of <hi>fallacious Prevarica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Insinuations, &amp;c.</hi> p. 61. But would not <hi>W. R.</hi> have exclaim'd against this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Writing in another (if against himself) as <hi>Imposition, begging the Question, undertaking to prove any sort of Negatives, and not to be credited?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now <hi>William,</hi> as for any of us <hi>chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenging a Meeting with thee,</hi> and thy prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering it <hi>in the City of Bristol</hi>; and thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>an incitement to a Friendly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> p 61.</p>
            <p>Thy Friendship being turn'd into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and thy Love into apparent Hatred against us (thy antient Friends) we have no ground to expect any Friendly discourse from thee; thou hast been sufficiently tryed in that way: And 'tis not thy endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to flourish, vaunt and boast it off that will either regain thy Repute among God's People, or restore that Friendship thou hast extinguisht on thy part, by thy ungodly
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:102665:98"/>
hard Speeches and Writings, words of Hatred, Scorn and Pride, which thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearest puft up withal.</p>
            <p>One passage I may not omit, touching <hi>W. R</hi>'s contradictions, p. 62. in these Words, viz. <hi>'Tis well worthy the Readers observation, that though the Pen-man adds in the Title these Words,</hi> viz. <hi>[with Questions, Notes and Remarks thereon] yet none of the Notes or Remarks do inform the Reader what is right or what is wrong, in the pretended matter of contradiction (more than in pag.</hi> 228. <hi>in these words, A plain Concession to Truth. Now he speaks like some Ambassadour of Christ) For the aforesaid omission I do not commend either the Honesty or Justice of the Pen-man to me, or his care over the Flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To all which I Answer; 1<hi>st,</hi> This charge contains a notorious falshood: 2<hi>dly,</hi> A self-contradiction and judgment against himself. For <hi>First,</hi> our sence of <hi>what is right and what is wrong</hi> in his Contradictions, were not only declared in our Treatise in many things, before the Contradictions were ranked together, but also the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, Notes and Remarks upon them, do inform the Reader what is right, and what is most agreeing to our sence as right, and what not. What we oppose, commonly is first set down in the first Column, and the better part in the second, for confuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102665:98"/>
of himself, as the nature of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, &amp;c. do evince plain enough to the Intelligent: As for instance, where <hi>W. R.</hi> is set against <hi>W. R.</hi> in his Contradictions; as BETWEEN his saying, <hi>This Doctrine frequently publisht among us [That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy shall never enter the generality more] doth give us just occasion to be Jealous,</hi> &amp;c. Part 1. p. 14. <hi>AND,</hi> his saying, <hi>I would NOT be understood to say, That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy shall never enter the generality again,</hi> Part 3. p. 74. Our Question on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction is, <hi>Q.</hi> Then why does he so often quarrel with the Doctrine frequently published, as he saith, viz. <hi>That the Apostacy shall never enter the generality more?</hi> Which plainly shews, we own his assent to this Doctrine to be right, and not his Jealous opposition to it.</p>
            <p>Again, to his Contradiction, in say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>WE REASONABLY conclude, that the Words of Christ and the Apostle</hi> (in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1, 2, 4.) <hi>ON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY hinted at Personal Offences or Differences, touching worldly matters,</hi> Part 1. p. 47. And confessing (on <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17.) that <hi>EVERY CASE, wherein one Brother may trespass against another, may in RIGHT REASON be comprehended in it,</hi> Part 3. p. 36. Our Question on this contradiction is, <hi>Q.</hi> Whether <hi>EVERY CASE</hi> be to be
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102665:99"/>
limited only to <hi>WORLDLY MATTERS,</hi> and not extend to any Cases of a Spiritual nature? Which implyeth our accepting his assent to the latter, viz. <hi>Every such case,</hi> &amp;c. and not his limiting it only to worldly Matters.</p>
            <p>Again, his placing <hi>CIRCVMCISION as exercised in a CHRISTIAN-LIBERTY</hi>; (and calling it <hi>that Christian-Liberty</hi>) saying, <hi>This did not at that time condemn that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Liberty, in such as made Conscience of Circumcision,</hi> (which were some believing <hi>Jews</hi>) Part 3. p. 82. and Part 5. p. 74, 75. AND his contrary confession, <hi>That the Labour of the Apostles of Christ in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive dayes, was to DRAW the outward</hi> Jew <hi>FROM OFF the observation of these Ordinances, which were really establisht by the appointment of God himself,</hi> Part 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 73.</p>
            <p>Our Question on this Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, <hi>Q.</hi> How can it be good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to account <hi>Circumcision a CHRISTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN-LIBERTY,</hi> and an Exercise not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnable in Believers, when the labour of the Apostles were <hi>to draw</hi> the outward <hi>Jew from off</hi> the observation of these Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances?</p>
            <p>This plainly evinceth, that we do not own his Doctrine to be right, that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was a Christian-Liberty; though there was for some time a Christian-forbearance
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:102665:99"/>
towards them that observ'd it, in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Moses</hi>'s Law in the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>Again, BETWEEN <hi>W. R</hi>'s opposing that Doctrine, <hi>That the Tree of Knowledge was not good for Food, as not knowing on what Foot of Truth any one can SO assert.</hi> And his saying, <hi>I would not be under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ood to reflect on ALL, that have used that Expression, viz. The Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food,</hi> Part 2. p. 27, 29. Our Question on this contradiction, is, <hi>Q.</hi> 1. If he counts the Doctrine erronious, or not of the Truth, to say, that the Tree of Knowledge is not good for Food; does not this reflect on all that have used that Expression? And 2<hi>dly,</hi> In commendation of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as good for Food, as in it self, he instanced <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is Life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent</hi>; adding that <hi>'Tis evident that Knowledge is the Way to Life,</hi> Part 2. p. 28. Hereupon we put the Question; <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Did God forbid the Knowledge of himself? the Knowledge which is Life eternal? that Knowledge which is the Way to Life, to man in the state of Innocency in the beginning? Let this be considered. And, <hi>Q</hi> 4. Can it be good Doctrine to say, That the Serpent perswaded <hi>Eve</hi> to that Knowledge which
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:102665:100"/>
is the way to Life, or to the Knowledge of the true God and Jesus Christ, which is Life eternal? Could THAT be the Knowledge that God forbad Man eat of? Were not this very absurd, to render the Serpent more kind to Man than his Maker was?</p>
            <p>Is it not here apparent, that we have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Reader, that 'tis <hi>not right</hi> to esteem the Tree of Knowledge good for Food? As also on his contradiction in pleading one while <hi>For</hi> them who <hi>Freely pay Tythes without constraint</hi> (i. e. <hi>to the National Ministry.</hi>) Another while for J. W. and J. S. <hi>Their Testimony against Tythes, as being (as at this day paid) Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> Part 2. p. 43. and Part 4. p. 39. On which we observe and question, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Liberty <hi>W. R.</hi> has here granted for the free payment of Tythes, be not an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, tending to beget into a Loose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Apostacy from our antient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Testimony against Tythes? And whether it be not contradictory to <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> their Testimony cited by himself? <hi>Accuser,</hi> &amp;c. p. 224, 225.</p>
            <p>What's more plain, than that his Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Freedom granted for the payment of Tythes, is wrong and inconsistent with our antient Christian Testimony?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That <hi>W. R</hi>'s Charge before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:102665:100"/>
contains Self-contradiction and Judgment against himself (though in it self untrue against the Pen-man) is evident in his judging, that <hi>his Notes and Remarks do not inform the Reader what is right, or what is wrong, in the matter of Contradiction</hi> charg'd against him; and <hi>for which Omission he does not commend either the Honesty or Justice of the Pen-man, &amp;c. or his care over the Flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now though the Injustice and Falshood of this Charge is already fully detected, observe how obviously <hi>W. R.</hi> hath hereby brought Judgment upon himself, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, to his being told, That he seems to account it good for Food. To this he answers, viz. <hi>Nothing said by me, or cited as my Words by themselves, shews either opposition or assent to such Doctrine,</hi> p. 51. <hi>Neither have I written any thing to shew my own sence either way</hi> (viz. <hi>whether the Tree of Knowledge was or was not good for Food.</hi>) p. 50. This is all one, as for <hi>W. R.</hi> to tell us, That he doth not inform the Reader what is Right or what is Wrong, in this matter of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie; that is, Whether it be Right or Wrong to say, the Tree of Knowledge is good for Food?</p>
            <p>If nothing writ or said by him, doth shew his own sence either way, he would
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:102665:101"/>
be angry if I should <hi>make a Similitude Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him</hi> and the Jesuits, in his reserve in this point; When they contend against the Opinions of others, but reserve and hide their own: And if then it be both Disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Injustice, not to inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what's right, or what's wrong, in things contrary as before intimated) then where's <hi>W. R</hi>'s Honesty or Justice in this matter? How evidently is he here self-condemned and judged? How manifold and numerous are his Contradictions! Now, <hi>William,</hi> consider what Labyrinths of Confusion thou runnest into.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. And <hi>William,</hi> I cannot well but take notice of thy <hi>Postscript,</hi> of somewhat above a Page, what a slighty Answer and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful PUT-OFF it is. To the Book given forth by four of our Friends of the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> entituled, <hi>An Exalted Diotrephes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended,</hi> against thy <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> &amp;c. in five parts. Instead of a solid An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, or sober Vindication of thy self, from their Charge against thee, as being of an abusive lavish Tongue, of a rude, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and imperious Behaviour in Men's Meetings, and speaking prophanely of the Power of God: To these things thou sayst, viz. <hi>All which I return as Dirt, unworthily cast on me—Such their Calumniations are
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102665:101"/>
meerly because of my zealous opposing them and others, &amp;c.</hi> And then further sayest, <hi>There are few men so weak as (on serious consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) to believe GENERAL CALVMNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ATIONS against a man once well esteemed by the Calumniators: Let this be minded, and their Answer duely weighed, and then 'twill appear that nothing of weight in the said Book is written against me,</hi> p. 79. [Thus far thou.]</p>
            <p>Oh miserable Evasion, Fallacy and Falshood! with what Conscience couldst thou thus write, <hi>(William)</hi> as if their said Book and Answer consisted but of <hi>General Calumniations</hi> against thee, (What reason is there to credit thy general denyal?) which I am sure is a shameful and notorious Untruth. Take one instance out of many more, wherein they charge thee with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular matter of Fact, and that is about the Paper of Condemnation, or Submission, which was exhibited and owned by <hi>J.S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> at the Meeting at <hi>Drawell</hi> in <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> Anno 1676. when afterward they were minded to extenuate (or take off) the weight of it, not owning it according to the common acceptation of <hi>A Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. as the said Friends of <hi>Bristol</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: Hereupon they do particularly charge thee <hi>(William)</hi> about the same Paper, in these Words, viz. And <hi>William Rogers,</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:102665:102"/>
(who confessed <hi>he drew it</hi> for <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi>) reported, <hi>There was nothing in it, and that the most Innocent man amongst us might own it, and never hurt himself, and that it was not better than a RATTLE to please Children</hi>; See their said Book, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>An Exalted Diotrephes Repre.</hi> p. 13. And not only in this, but in divers other particular matters they also charge thee home in their Book; and also signifie, that they do not think it necessary at present, to particularize thy prophane speaking concerning the Power of God, no more than they have already done concerning thy horrible unsincere dealing with the Brethren at <hi>Drawell,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exalt. Diotreph.</hi> p. 17.</p>
            <p>Now (<hi>William</hi>) didst not thou render thy self horribly unsincere, in declaring the <hi>said Paper,</hi> (which thy self drew up) <hi>no better than a Rattle to please Children</hi>? af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou knewst that <hi>J. S.</hi> &amp; <hi>J. W.</hi> had ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it <hi>as satisfaction to their Brethren, and the Church of God in general</hi> (as their own and thy Words are in it.) Didst thou think to please those Brethren, and the Church of God in general, with a Rattle for Children? Oh, <hi>William</hi>! was not this particular matter of Fact, and that very gross and absurd? How didst thou resemble the <hi>Ranters</hi> therein, and bewray great and
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:102665:102"/>
horrid Deceit to have entred thee? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Charity think that the Devil had got so much hold of thee at that instant, when thou drewst up that said Paper at <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> as to intend it only as a Rattle to please Children; for thy own Narrative bespeaks better, and more serious things of Friends and Brethren, in their proceedings there towards <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>J. W.</hi> Surely then thou wast in a better and more serious and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere mind at that time: But I rather think the Devil prevailed with thee afterward, after thou hadst eaten the Sop among the Disciples, and in the time of thy (and parties) discontented and murmuring Consultations, Satan entred thee, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise that deceitful and Ranter-like cover and evasion of the said Paper, being but <hi>As a Rattle to please Children</hi>; Though at first tendred as Satisfaction to the Church of God in general.</p>
            <p>Thus thy Fallacy, (in particular matter of fact) is detected, also in slighting and huffing off the said Friends Book, but as <hi>General Calumniations, and therefore nothing of weight in it</hi>; when there's such particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar matter of notorious Fact charg'd upon thee in it, as thou canst not get over, nor acquit thy self of.</p>
            <p>And what men are so weak (on serious consideration) as to believe thy general
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:102665:103"/>
Calumniations against either Persons, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Society, once well esteemed, by thee a Calumniator? Or to esteem thee and thy Abettors <hi>The Christian-Quaker,</hi> and all whom thou calumniatest to be <hi>Apostates</hi> and <hi>Innovators,</hi> according to thy Judgment? How wilt thou clear thy self from a meer begging the Question in both? which is never likely to be granted to thee as the case stands, according to thy own terms, and supposition cast upon us for our owning our selves to be <hi>the Church of Christ,</hi> p. 45, 61. thou having been once in society with us, and didst well esteem of us, but now not only gone out from us, but turn'd bitter Enemy against us, whilst no probation made on thy part, either of our <hi>violating</hi> or <hi>disserting</hi> our first Principles of our Christian Union and Society, which thy Brother <hi>F. Bugg</hi> hath most sillily, yet maliciously attempted to prove against <hi>William Penn, Stephen Crisp, John Burnyeat, Alexander Parker, Thomas Salthouse</hi> and <hi>My Self,</hi> from a Paper signed by us from a yearly Meeting, <hi>Anno</hi> 1675. wherein the sence and tender advice of the said Meeting is propounded in several matters of moment, <hi>all which,</hi> (in conclusion) <hi>are recommended to the Evidence of Gods holy Witness in the Hearts of his People.</hi> Where's now the <hi>Imposition, Antichristian Apostacy</hi> or <hi>Violence</hi> done to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:102665:103"/>
our first Principles of Union, charged on us by <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> from this very Paper aforesaid, in his Book, <hi>De Christiana Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate? W. R.</hi> dost thou allow of the said Paper thus recommended as a sufficient proof of the Subscribers Apostacy and Imposition? I am sure thou hast exprest the contrary. Now W. R. and F. B. clear your selves from <hi>begging the Question,</hi> if you can, by plain Evidence of your own <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity</hi> and our <hi>Apostacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>William,</hi> thou farther calumniatest and abusest our said <hi>Bristol</hi> Friends in thy Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, saying, R. V. <hi>is known to be as busie to go in the Second day's Meetings Errands, as an hired Apparitour is to go in the Errands of a Bishops Court.</hi> And that R. S. <hi>and</hi> C. H. <hi>thou takest to be fitly qualified, to say</hi> ANY THING, <hi>right or wrong to defame thee; accusing one of them with a Lying Spirit entred him,</hi> p. 79, 80</p>
            <p>These Persons of <hi>Bristol,</hi> whom thou calumniatest are well known, both to their Neighbours and others, who I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded will not give credit to thee therein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thy scornful Invectives against them will go but a little way with those who know the honesty and good Repute of the Persons whom thou here writest against, and their deep suffering, with many more for Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards <hi>God,</hi> which it appears thou hast
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102665:104"/>
little regard to, or sence of, who whilst they are suffering under strait Confinement and Duress in a Nacious Goal in the City of <hi>Bristol,</hi> for their tender Consciences (as they were when this thy Book (7<hi>th part</hi>) came forth, and as many yet are) thou art secure in a Corner, studdying and scribling against them, to calumniate and defame them in Print, as men of no Conscience towards God, <hi>fitly qualified to say any thing, right or wrong, a Lying Spirit entred, &amp;c.</hi> Such is thy Treatment to the Prisoners of Jesus Christ, to add Affliction to their Bonds, and to make void their Testimony and Suffering for his Names sake. And not only thus, but thou art cruelly mocking, flouting and deriding at them, telling a story against one of these suffering Friends of <hi>Bristol,</hi> which thou sayst, <hi>occasioned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision and Laughter</hi>; and that <hi>by a Lying Spirit entred them</hi> (thou sayst) <hi>they may become a derision, both to Professor and Prophane, and a scorn to Fools themselves,</hi> p. 80. No doubt thy scornful and malicious Work against them (though otherwise under Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and Suffering) and against many others fearing God, is to make them as ridiculous, and as much the Subjects of scorn and derision as thou canst; but 'twill all return upon thy own head, thou wilt reap the fruit of thy own doings. Thy pretended
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102665:104"/>
               <hi>Love, Christian Charity, Lamentation for thy Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> (in thy hypocritical Epistle directed to the flock of God) go but a little way it seems; but that and other Instances of thy <hi>Insincerity</hi> and <hi>Dissimulations</hi> are numerous.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. And with what Sincerity or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, couldst thou not only pretend an inclination toward an accommodation of the Controversie, but also propose to our second day's Meeting for thee <hi>To read thy Answer, (viz.</hi> thy 7th part, when in Print) <hi>amongst us, and after so done to leave it with us,</hi> and to pretend, <hi>thy end was, that if the Meeting should that day propose any expedient, answering the Witness of God in thy Conscience, to stop the Publication thereof, thou shouldst then answer the same by forbearing a further Publication thereof,</hi> as in thy Letter, <hi>dated, London, the</hi> 17<hi>th of the</hi> 2<hi>d Moneth,</hi> 1682? pag. 80.</p>
            <p>I do still question, with what sincerity or conscience thou couldst make such Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and pretend such an end in it to that our Meeting, when thou hadst already prejudged the same Meeting in Print, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Apostate Innovators, &amp;c?</hi> What capacity could such be in to answer the Witness of God in thy Conscience, if apostatiz'd from it in themselves? And what ground couldst
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:102665:105"/>
thou have to expect such a change in them from <hi>Apostacy,</hi> as that <hi>Now</hi> (when thou proposedst the reading thy Book) <hi>they might be in a capacity to reach thy Conscience,</hi> as thou sayst? p. 82. Besides, can any in reason suppose thee real or sincere in thy Proposition for an expedient to stop the Publication of thy Book of about twelve Sheets, when already Printed? Was not the design of thy Proposition rather for a pretence to excuse thy self, and for a flourish over us, as thou hast made an empty one, and what hast thou got by it?</p>
            <p>And was it not manifest, that thou wast still at least jealous of our said Meeting, as being <hi>Apostate,</hi> in thy not being free then to answer our three Questions, which were very proper, to try the reality of thy own Proposition, and thy end pretended thereof, in order to our hearing thy said Book read. The <hi>Questions</hi> were these, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Question 1. <hi>Whether thou art sensible thou hast done evil or hurt to Truth in the Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy great Book, entituled,</hi> The Christian-Quaker distinguished, <hi>&amp;c</hi>?</p>
            <p>Quest. 2. <hi>Whether thou hast any better thoughts of our Second day's Meeting now, than thou hadst when thou wrotest that Book, as not now to esteem the said Meeting Apostate, &amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:102665:105"/>Quest. 3. <hi>Whether thou lookest upon the said Meeting now in a capacity to answer the Witness of God in thy Conscience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which thou only gave us this return, viz. <hi>I am not free to answer at present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Reason for the Questions was, That we might not spend our time in vain, or to no effect, in hearing thy Book read, which we should do, if we should undertake it, and have no assurance of thy having any better thoughts then of our said Meeting, than to deem it <hi>Apostate?</hi> Or if thou didst not then look upon it as capable to answer the Witness of God in thy Conscience? To which thou not being then free to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, we might very well then not be free to hear thy Book read among us, nor be so imposed upon, as to spend our time upon such uncertainty, having no probability of thy performing thy own Proposition, with respect to the end proposed, whilst not prov'd sincere or Christian on thy parts Therefore thy Reflection upon our said Meeting, and supposing us <hi>like a Company of lazy or guilty Priests,</hi> for our refusal to suffer the reading of thy said Book amongst us, is both very unjust and scornful, and bespeaks thy Lording Imposing Spirit, thus infamously to upbraid us for not implicitly giving up to spend our precious time to answer thy prejudicate will and humour
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:102665:106"/>
upon thy reserved dark uncertainty. And also as a farther aggravation of thy Injustice and Prejudice, <hi>thy taking our said Meeting's Treatment of thee on this occasion, to be an Evidence of our affection to sit on the Seat of Vnrighteous Judgment.</hi> This also is thy unrighteous Conclusion and false Judgment upon our affection, and is no ways naturally deducible from our forementioned Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thee.</p>
            <p>I have omitted many other Instances of thy abuse of Truth and Friends, leaving the righteous God to reckon with thee for all thy injurious dealing and hard speeches, as thou seemest to refer the <hi>Pen man</hi> to such a Reckoning, pag. 46, 63. The Lord awaken thee out of this hardened gain-say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing state, and deliver them that are betray'd by the Enemy, and preserve his Heritage in love and peace over this scornful, exalted, conceited, crooked, quarrelsom apostate Spirit. <hi>The Lamb shall have the Victory.</hi>

               <p>UPon the perusal of thy two Letters lately sent me, the one directed to <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> in <hi>Ely</hi> Goal, and the other to my self, and <hi>the rest of the second day Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> (as thy terms are.) And since thou art become such an open contending Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, I thought my self the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Conscience to take some notice, and give thee my sence of thy proceeding and treatment in the Controversies thou hast so confidently undertaken, and become an officious Advocate in, that yet thou mayest be cautioned to stop thy pernicious Current, and destructive Race thou art running, and seriously bethink thy self, and Repent, before thy final Destruction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which I clearly perceive thy extraordinary <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:102665:108"/>
Pride, Scorn</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> &amp;c. do tend to bring upon thee. By the way, I observe thy Allegations against <hi>Samuel Cater,</hi> about the <hi>old Difference</hi> between thee and him so long depending, touching the <hi>FINE</hi> laid upon thee for him, <hi>as a Preacher,</hi> for which thou confessest, <hi>That thy Cousin</hi> George Smith, <hi>as his Wifes Agent, made thee Restitution</hi>; and yet I perceive thou art uneasie under <hi>that Restitution</hi> (as thou callest it) thou seemest concerned <hi>that several Friends now bring up that old concern,</hi> since thou published thy Book. But how did <hi>George Smith</hi> make thee Restitution? Did not he proffer thee half the Fine to stop thy Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulency? but thou by Craft got beyond him for the whole, &amp;c. wherein he and many more are greatly dissatisfied; and which, if the Friends in those parts give a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Narrative of the whole transaction, and of thy Selfish Craft, Over-reaching and Fraudulency in that case, and be as free in their Publication, as thou hast been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst many faithful Servants of Christ, in thy confused scurrilous piece of <hi>Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prate, Malice</hi> and <hi>Scorn,</hi> I am perswaded it will greatly redound to thy Dis-repute and Infamy in the Eyes of all sorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Persons, and lower thy Topsail to thy great abasement, shame and confusion of Face. Thou makest thy own terms for the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:102665:108"/>
                  <hi>repayment</hi> of the whole 15 <hi>l.</hi> that <hi>thy Cousin George Smith</hi> (thou sayest) <hi>by</hi> S Cater<hi>'s Wifes order, paid thee in Satisfaction for the Fine, thou suffered from him</hi> (as thou pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendest) <hi>And now I have the Money</hi> (sayest thou.) But I never yet understood that <hi>Samuel Cater's</hi> Wife did order him to pay the whole 15 <hi>l.</hi> neither would he have done it, but that thou madest him believe, <hi>It was not for love of Money thou wouldst have the whole tendred, &amp;c. for thy Word's sake</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thou confessest he <hi>first proffered thee</hi> 5 l. <hi>and when THAT would not do, he proffered thee</hi> 7 l. 10 s.</p>
               <p>Thus far it seems was his proffer to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cefie the business on <hi>thy part:</hi> The other part, to make it up 15 <hi>l.</hi> he did deposit, in expectation thou wouldst return it him, so he understood by thy smooth and crafty Pretensions, <hi>That THY END WAS NOT FOR MONEY,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he, <hi>poor, well-meaning man</hi> was insnared, and <hi>S. Cater</hi> become the sufferer. But upon what account got'st thou the whole 15 <hi>l</hi> from him, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Penalty of the Conventicle Act doth not exceed 10 <hi>l.</hi> upon a Hearer, for the Poverty of the Preacher, or in default of his payment? And yet hast thou the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to assert, <hi>That if the Justice please, he may lay the</hi> 20 l. <hi>upon any single Person present, of the Hearers.</hi> But by what Law may he
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:102665:109"/>
do so; if the Pena<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

<q>Vpon the Goods and Chattels of any such PERSONS, who shall be present at the same Conventicle, in case the Preacher be a Stranger, and his Name and Habitation not known, or is fled, and cannot be found, or in the judgment of the Justice, shall be thought unable to pay the same.</q>
Note, that 'tis upon any such PERSONS, in the Plural, not upon any one Person the Fine is so to be levied; 'tis to be proportioned, so as that <hi>no one Person shall be lyable to pay above</hi> 10 l. <hi>for any one Meeting, in regard of the Poverty of any other Person or Persons,</hi> as the express Words of the Act are.

I cannot but take notice of thy saying, <hi>Thou toldst him thou wouldst have the whole tendred, which done, thou shouldst make it appear that thy End was NOT ONLY for Money.</hi> And how rarely hast thou mended the matter now? Thou madest him believe 'twas not for love of Money; but now to mince and smooth it over, thy end was not <hi>ONLY</hi> for Money: It seems thy end was then in a great part for <hi>Money</hi>; but thou shouldst have told him <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> aforehand how far thy end was for <hi>Money,</hi> and how far 'twas not for <hi>Money,</hi> that so he might not have been defrauded out of the whole 15 <hi>l.</hi> and thereby poor <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> his <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> sufferers in their Estate, meerly for quietness sake, from thy complaints and clamours; if thy end was not <hi>ONLY,</hi> but <hi>PARTLY</hi> for Money, thou mightst have been content with half of the 15 <hi>l.</hi> which <hi>G.

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:102665:110"/>
And as a person conscious to thy self, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted and uneasie for a pretence, thou now makest this Proposition (namely) S. Cater<hi>'s signing a Paper like this which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, of thy own forming; and then thou wilt return the whole</hi> 15 l. Thy Paper is this, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position implyes a Contradiction; for if <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> subscribe the Instrument, he ought not to have his Money by the tenure of it, because he told not his Name.

                     <p>Another contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from the ground of his Law or Canon, <hi>viz.</hi> the equality in suffering For by his Rule a poor Minister must suffer 20 <hi>l</hi> when a rich Hearer, whom he ministers to, but 5 <hi>s.</hi> And he on the apparent sight of the Informer must tell his Name, when the other, but when he is asked it.

                  </note> Memorandum, <hi>That I</hi> S.

ought to make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to such who suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for them through their concealing their Names and Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and that such as refuse to perform his or their part in either of these two Propositions, ought from thenceforth to be reputed blame-worthy, and noted as such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Witness my hand, the day above-written, per me.</hi>

But thy <hi>Canon</hi> or <hi>Prescription</hi> is illegal, lame and defective; yea, it exceeds the severity and extent of the Conventicle Act, which no where compels all Friends in the Ministry, where thy are strangers, to tell their Names and Habitations upon their apparent sight of Informers coming into a Meeting and taking Friends Names in writing or otherwise; nor are any of the Meeters compelled by Law to tell their Names to Informers.</p>
               <p>Thus Arbitrary, Illegal and Foolish too art thou in thy Canon and Constitution; thou wouldst enforce upon Friends of the Ministry, where they are strangers, who sometimes may be silent in a Meeting, and sometimes ministring when Informers come in to take Names, by thy Canon the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in silence must tell their Names and Habitations to Informers, and those that are ministring must stop to tell the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers their Names and Habitations. This illegal Imposition of thine I further except against, in that it tends to gratifie the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers,

to tell their Names to Informers, which the Law requires not: I know none that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to tell their Names to the civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate. We know the Preachers generally are most struck at, and most liable to suffer, and the Penalties are most severe upon them, as 20 <hi>l.</hi> for a first, and 40 <hi>l.</hi> for a second Offence (so called) and if Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they are <hi>not wholly free from Sufferings</hi> (as thou sayest.) But all Preachers more lyable in the first place to suffer Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. than others, being most envyed and aimed at by the <hi>Persecutors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> We cannot in point of Christianity, Truth or good Conscience, deem the Preacher <hi>an Offender,</hi> if we own his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, <hi>So</hi> as to lay an Obligation upon him not only to tell his Name to <hi>Informers,</hi> but to be the greatest Sufferer. Truth's interest and cause is but one in Minister and Hearer, and Christian love leads us therein to sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathize and suffer one with another in Spirit; yea, and outwardly too, if there be necessity, and not to make preaching the Gospel an offence, any more than meeting or hearing it Preacht, seeing the Labour, and Pains, and greatest Hazard common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the Preachers, the advantage thereof is the Hearers. And if we have true Unity with the Gospel Preachers, we shall not complain against them, because of the
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:102665:112"/>
Fines, nor think our selves to be bound under thy Prescription or Canon, who art both in <hi>Dis-union</hi> with them, and <hi>Enmity</hi> against them, much less to follow thy Craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty method, to pay our selves out of their Estates, when fined for them, or for their not telling their Names to Informers on sight, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> If thou makest the Preachers such Offendors, as that for want of telling their Names to Informers, they must be Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to the full, or wholly for the Fines laid upon Hearers on their account, and thereupon thy Eye is so severe upon them, as if they were the <hi>greatest Offendors.</hi> This is but the same Spirit that's in the Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Informers, that's not in unity with, but in Enmity against the Gospel-Ministers. This would not lay down its Life for the Brethren, that will not suffer 5 <hi>l.</hi> or 10 <hi>l.</hi> for them: And then I presume there's no danger of thy suffering much on that account, who couldst so craftily repay thy self the whole 15 <hi>l.</hi> from <hi>Samuel Cater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this very Action, and thy malicious Book, thou appearest a Person more ready to turn Informer against the true Ministers and Servants of Christ, than to lose 10 <hi>l.</hi> on any of their account, by thy offensive Characters and <hi>Popish</hi> Comparisons thou hast put upon them, particularly upon <hi>George
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102665:113"/>
Fox, William Penn, George Whitehead, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Crisp, Alexander Parker, Thomas Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house</hi> and <hi>John Burnyeat,</hi> whom thou hast represented in Print as Apostates, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian, Innovators, Imposers, Popish, &amp;c. for their Christian advice in divers particulars, cited by thee in thy printed Book, <hi>De Christiana Libertate,</hi> with thy scandalous defaming Observations upon them severally, from page 32. to page 57. to prove thy Unjust charge <hi>of doing Violence to our first Principles of Vnion,</hi> which they and we all utterly deny.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> And the more like an Informer hast thou appeared, in ambitiously dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating thy Book to a Great Man, i. e. <hi>Henry North,</hi> Knight, and in shewing that thou designed it for the Magistrates, in pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to have laid before them <hi>a clear Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration for Liberty of Conscience</hi>; thy Book being in two Parts, as is confest in the Title, and both Bound up and made to go in one: So that if the Magistrates see the first Part for Liberty of Conscience, (which is not thy own) they are liable to see thy second Part, wherein (as an Enemy to Christian-Liberty) thou art bitterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing and clamouring against many faithful Servants and Ministers of our Lord Jesus Christ (who are well approved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People called <hi>Quakers</hi>) for their
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:102665:113"/>
signifying and giving their Christian Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Sence, in things needful to be practised in the Church, whereby thou art opposing the Liberty of their Consciences, which they have in Christ Jesus; and art endeavouring to expose them as obnoxious and offensive to the Magistrate and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Government, rendering them <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical</hi> and <hi>Popish,</hi> like <hi>the Pope's Councils,</hi> &amp;c. Thus false Informer-like, thou hast broke all Bonds of Christian Friendship, Society and Church-Order, and hast acted the part of a treacherous, persecuting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, in the very nature, purport and series of thy Book.</p>
               <p>And I doubt not, but thy Infamous work will become odious to all Serious, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Impartial Dissenting <hi>Protestants,</hi> the more it comes to Light, and to be strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scand, and that thou wilt appear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only as a turbulent, but perfidious, treacherous Person, and malicious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former against thy own Society, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not to be trusted by any other Societies or People, on any Religious and sociable account.</p>
               <p>Thou hast also in thy Letter scurrilously abused and misrepresented <hi>S. Cater, J. Parks,</hi> and my self, and also the Womens Meeting, as <hi>That</hi> Samuel Cater <hi>had</hi> 10 <hi>l. presently sent him out of the Treasury from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102665:114"/>
London</hi>: And that <hi>The Women's Meeting ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered so much Money for</hi> James Parks, <hi>upon his pretence of being Robbed.</hi> Both which I have made enquiry into, and find them false in Fact; <hi>Samuel Cater</hi> belyed, the Women's Meeting belyed, and <hi>James Parks</hi> belyed, in the state of these Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations. Be ashamed therefore of such Abuses, or produce Proof both of Fact and Circumstance, as stated by thee. Be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed also of thy saying, <hi>James Parks acted the part of an</hi> Oliverian <hi>Preacher, or</hi> G. W. <hi>once at</hi> Snare-Hill, <hi>or like some SVCH PENSIONERS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Didst thou ever tell me of any thing thou hadst against me at <hi>Snare-Hill</hi>? I am not Conscious to my self, but am sure thou dost shamefully belye me and <hi>J. P.</hi> in calling us <hi>Pensioners.</hi> What Pension, Wages, or yearly Stipend dost thou charge me or us withal? What an unconscionable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famer art thou? Dost thou know what <hi>Pensioner</hi> means? This is somewhat like thy espousing and printing the Report of <hi>Nicholas Lucas</hi>'s saying, <hi>That I went up and down to Cheat the Country.</hi> And thy affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That truly my Behaviour hath manifested the truth thereof,</hi> page 150. of thy Book.</p>
               <p>Thus in thy Letter before, sent after me in Manuscript, without the least occasion given thee by me, that I know of; since
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:102665:114"/>
which to amend the matter of thy Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous defaming abuse of me, before ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thou addest this Parenthesis, viz. [<hi>I reckon he meant not of Money, but the People of their Liberty they have right to</hi>] Which is also a Slander and base come-off, and thousands of God's People are able to testifie against these thy defaming and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Lyes. I never was accounted a <hi>Cheat</hi> and <hi>Pensioner</hi> before. As also in thy calling <hi>Thomas Rudyard</hi> LYING LAWYER, for saying, <hi>Thou paidst thy Money Voluntarily before Distress was made on thy Goods:</hi> This I shewed <hi>Thomas Rudyard,</hi> and he counts it a foul abuse, slander and defamation upon his Person and Employment, to call him <hi>Lying Lawyer,</hi> supposing thou placest his Lying upon the word <hi>Voluntarily.</hi> If thou didst pay or deposit thy Fine on thy Appeal, and so prevented Distress (as he understood thou then didst at that time) he accounted it <hi>Voluntary,</hi> in respect of the Law, because the Act of Parliament in that case doth not compel thee to pay thy Fine upon entring thy Appeal; for that the Appeal may be entred within one weeks time <hi>after the Fine is paid,</hi> OR <hi>Distress made</hi>; so that 'tis in the Appealants choice whether to pay the Fine or suffer Distress first; for the Particle <hi>OR</hi> is disjunctive between both.

                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:102665:115"/>
Art not thou herein manifest to be the <hi>LYING DEFAMER,</hi> that hast so little regard to the Reputation or Credit of others? Where's thy Conscience, or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as thou wouldst be done by?</p>
               <p>Thy Envy and Defamation stops not here, but thou hast falsly accused us (of the Second days Meeting) with <hi>loving to have the Pre-eminence:</hi> He that searches and knows our Hearts, sees and will judge thy false Judgment and Abuse in this and many other things; as also in thy false and abusive Insinuation in telling of the <hi>Sums, Gratuities and large Pensions, privately extended to such</hi> (speaking of <hi>James Parks) and others of his Fraternity: And which far exceed THAT of the Bason and Platter, we usually, and with too much confidence</hi> (sayst thou) <hi>bespatter the Professors withal, seeing we do the same thing for which we condemn them only a little privater.</hi> [Thus far thy false and abusive Accusation against such as <hi>James Parks</hi> and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.]</p>
               <p>Oh horrid Impudence and Falshood! be ashamed hereof: Thou heapest up Slanders and Defamations against the Innocent, for which God will rebuke thee. 'Tis not unknown how many of us spend our Strength, Labour and Substance in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord and his People in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, wherein I for one have not had the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102665:115"/>
least share, though now by thee rendred a <hi>Cheat</hi> and a <hi>Pensioner.</hi> Oh! blush and be ashamed of such abominable Lyes and scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Detractions.</p>
               <p>To conclude thy Letter, on thy falshood against the Womens Meeting <hi>gathering Money, &amp;c.</hi> thou scornfully inferrest, that therein they have forfeited their Charter, mentioned in thy Book, p. 37. and deserves a COERANTO to be brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I cannot but take notice what a liberty thou takest to scoff, mock and jeer against our Religious Christian Womens Meeting, and how abusive and silly thou art therein, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou hast often scornfully twitted me with the words <hi>LEARNED FRIEND,</hi> in thy Book and Letters, as if it were such a great Crime to ascribe that to any Friend, whilst yet thou art ambitious to shew thy self a learned Person. Here to shew thy Learning in the Latin Tongue, thou tellest us of a <hi>COERANTO,</hi> which is no good <hi>Latine</hi> to be sure, and thou mayst be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned in what Language thou hadst the Expression. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Q. added,</hi> If it be not Dog-Latin?</note> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose thou hast lately heard Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses of <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> about the City-Charter, upon which from thy own imaginary conceit thou writest us <hi>COERANTO</hi> in a large <hi>Italick</hi> Character, that it may appear how learned and skilled
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:102665:116"/>
thou art in <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Law</hi>; and likewise we must have a <hi>Latine</hi> Title to thy Book, second Part, i. e. <hi>De Christianâ Libertate</hi>: But where thou learnedst this Title, and what stress or Emphasis canst thou place upon its being in <hi>Latine</hi> more than if it had been in <hi>English,</hi> i. e. <hi>Concerning Christian-Liberty?</hi> For <hi>Liberty of Conscience asserted,</hi> is not the <hi>English</hi> of thy <hi>Latine</hi> Title, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from it in the Terms, as well as in the Nature of it: And thy prosecution for <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience,</hi> as asserted by thee, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears a Liberty not only in opposition to Persecution, but also to our <hi>Godly Care, Advice, Counsel</hi> and <hi>Admonition,</hi> relating to good Order and Church-Government amongst us, and testified unto in our Paper opposed by thee in thy Book (from page 41, to page 51.) And if this must be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of thy Christian-Liberty, thou mightst better have entituled thy Book, <hi>Pro Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertate Carnali</hi>; for it seems the Liberty pleaded for by thee, admits not of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Censures, Reproofs, Advice or Judgment, according to Christ's Law ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, as appears by thy scurrilous op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position &amp; infamous Characters thou givest to our said Paper, partly cited in thy Book, and most Unchristianly and Unjustly made thy great Proof of our <hi>Doing Violence to our first Principles of Vnion, and consequently
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102665:116"/>
turned Antichristian</hi>; and such thou render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>William Penn, George Whitehead, Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Parker, Stephen Crisp, Thomas Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, John Burnyeat,</hi> whose Names thou hast exposed in Print, as the Persons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly charged by thee. But we have not yet concluded thy Learning in <hi>Coeranto,</hi> but must view a little more of it in thy Book, on the passage thou hast borrowed on trust from <hi>William Rogers</hi> his Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he confesseth, for which we have only his own Authority in these Words, (viz.) <hi>Which for the sake of some, I thus Translate,</hi> (7th Part, <hi>Christian Quaker,</hi> p. 62.) 'Tis in thy 125, 126, 127, 128 pages, out of Bishop <hi>Hooper</hi>; the first Words, <hi>Scitis quod res sancta, et vera quo magis examinatur.</hi> Thou accepts his Translation hereof in these words, <hi>KNOW YE, that by how much the more,</hi> &amp;c. Here <hi>Scitis,</hi> the very first Word, which is, <hi>Ye know,</hi> in the <hi>Indicative,</hi> is falsly translated <hi>know ye,</hi> as <hi>Scite</hi> in the <hi>Imperative</hi>; whereas by <hi>Scitis</hi> in this place was intended <hi>Indication, Demonstration,</hi> or <hi>Proof,</hi> and not imperatively <hi>Teaching</hi>; and likewise <hi>Nam quod variis modis tentatur; ac probatur, modo pium ac sanctum FVERIT, Jacturam ab hostibus nullam sentit,</hi> is thus translated (viz.) <hi>For that which is tryed and proved after various manners, if IT HATH BEEN,</hi> &amp;c. instead of <hi>IT SHALL BE</hi>;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:102665:117"/>
for <hi>FVERIT</hi> is exact future (as they term it.) Many things of the Types and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows under the Law, as <hi>Tythes</hi> and <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>have been holy,</hi> but shall not be again, <hi>afficitis</hi> is made <hi>afflict</hi> instead of <hi>affect,</hi> and also <hi>Legem &amp; Evangelium Dei,</hi> are translated <hi>The Word of God,</hi> instead of <hi>The Law and Gospel of God</hi>; then at last <hi>Judicio,</hi> is, <hi>to the Judgment,</hi> when it should be more properly <hi>by the Judgment</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the most material Mistake is in the very first word <hi>Scitis,</hi> falsly translated, as to the Mood.</p>
               <p>But these Instances are only to shew thee what a ridiculous Novice and Ludibrie thou hast rendred thy self, both in Writing and Print, even to School-Boys: I saw lately a School-Boy of Eleaven Years old Laugh at thy Absurdity, as a Person wise in thy own Conceit. Yet whilst thou wouldst make a show and flourish of Learning, thou hast here taken a false Translation upon an implicit Faith and blind Credulity: Thou that art such a fierce opposer of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith and blind Obedience, and hast so often scoft at me for the Words, <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friend,</hi> in reference to <hi>R.

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102665:118"/>
to the <hi>Noble Bereans,</hi> thou concernest the Magistrates, as having in the Book prefix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (i. e. thy <hi>first Part</hi>) laid before them many weighty Arguments for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. So that to the Magistrates thou hast given thy Information against the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as having <hi>mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Impositions</hi> among them; which we ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deny; and thy Scornful Malicious Book proves it not. Thus thou art turned <hi>Informer</hi> to the Magistrates against an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent suffering People, whom thou hast so long walked amongst: How darest thou appear in their Meetings, and thus act the part of a <hi>treacherous, malicious Informer</hi> against them, even to the Magistrates? Oh! Blush and be ashamed of this thy hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Thou having entituled thy self to to the matters contain'd in a Treatise, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Liberty of Conscience asserted and vindicated,</hi> by thy high Commendations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of it to <hi>H.

               </p>
               <p>Now observe what this Author's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is concerning the Light in men, whereupon he chiefly placeth his Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:102665:118"/>
for <hi>Liberty of Conscience.</hi> In page 4. he saith, viz. <hi>Their Natural Light, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them from their first Creation, dictating to them what they ought to do, and what not, and enabling them to pass a Judgment upon themselves of their due behaviour towards God,</hi> &amp;c. With some other passages of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the said Treatise.</p>
               <p>Here (<hi>Francis</hi>) thou hast presented <hi>H.

N.</hi> and the Magistrates about the <hi>Principle, the Light</hi> in men, contrary to the <hi>Quakers</hi> Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, born from the beginning concerning the Light in men, which is according to the holy Apostle's Testimony, <hi>John</hi> 1.4, 9. that <hi>In the Word, or Son of God, was Life; and that Life was the Light of men</hi>; And that this is not a <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>created Light,</hi> but a <hi>Supernatural</hi> and <hi>Divine Light</hi> of the Christ Jesus, the Son of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> And now (<hi>Francis</hi>) having thus misrepresented our Principle to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and so mis-informed them about the Light in men.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:102665:119"/>
Persons, chiefly concerned, owned and approved among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> whom thou scornfully callest <hi>G.

And what hast thou to charge all these with, that thou hast printed a Book and informed the Magistracy against them?

                  <note place="margin">Thy Charge collected.</note> and <hi>THAT in the Primitive times</hi> (as in the Title of thy second part.) It is also, <hi>That there is Violence done to our first Principles of Vnion</hi>; Consequently <hi>Tyranny introduced, and our Society turned Antichristian,</hi> p. 32, 33.

Now <hi>Francis,</hi> I must plainly tell thee, this <hi>Inconsistency and Violence</hi> charged by thee against us, we utterly deny, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances thou givest do not at all prove it,
<q>As first, <hi>G.F's</hi> Paper for Women's Meeting distinct, that they might be in the practice of pure Religion, to visit the Fatherless and the Widows, and to see that all be

kept from the spots of the World, &amp;c.</q>
[As 'tis cited at large by thee, <hi>p.</hi> 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.]</p>
               <p>Now (<hi>Francis</hi>) where's the Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency charged? Can there be an Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency where there's no Contradiction, nor the least opposition? Thy judging such Women's Meetings as are for the Practice or Promotion of pure Religion, in the practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal parts of it, inconsistent with the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian-Discipline, Order and Government in the Primitive times, doth bespeak not only that thou dost not well understand what <hi>Inconsistent</hi> means, but also that thou hast undertaken a Charge thou art never able to make good. And thy charge of <hi>Violence</hi> done to our first Principles of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is worse than <hi>Inconsistent.</hi> And thy scornfully telling of the <hi>Women's Charter and New Order,</hi> is no Proof (man) of thy Charge: Where's the <hi>Inconsistency</hi> and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> that's charged, done by the faithful Womens Meetings among us, or by any of us, by encouraging them to meet for those Religious and Charitable ends and services mentioned? How hast thou acted the part of an ignorant conceited Scoffer, instead of proving thy Charge before cited? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the very self-same Paper writ by <hi>G.

received, owned and approved at a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting at <hi>Kendal</hi> in <hi>Westmorland,</hi> in the Year 1671. And another written in approbation thereof, and subscribed by some of thy own party, as <hi>John Wilkinson, Richard Stephanson, Henry Garnet,</hi> and Twenty one more Friends, for encouraging of the Women's assembling, and Religious Charitable Services before proposed, both which are cited at large in our Book, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>The Accuser of our Brethren,</hi> from pag. 98, to p. 102. Thus contradictory art thou to some of thy own Brethren, in thy condemning the same Paper as an Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Inconsistency and Violence to our first Principles, which they so plainly approved of.</p>
               <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> Again, in pursuance of thy unrighteous Charge before cited, thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citest four passages out of a Paper of ours, dated, <hi>London,</hi> the 27th of the 3d Moneth, 1675. which was given as our Judgment and Advice in certain things needful, for good Order among us (as we believed) The first Passage thou hast cited, is that for Marriages to be at least twice propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Meetings, that are to take care therein, &amp;c. before they are accomplished, &amp;c. Now where's the Inconsistency here, with the Discipline in the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, or the Violence done to our
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102665:120"/>
first Principles of Union? Instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy charge by this instance, we have in thy Observation a piece of Scorn and Mockery, viz. <hi>This notable, if not universal Council: Their new stamped Government,</hi> p. 42. Oh! be ashamed of such Scorn and Folly! Is this thy proof of thy charge? Is it a violation to our first Principles of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, to have Marriages proposed at least twice to the Meetings concerned? (both Mens and Womens, where both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished) However, to be twice proposed to such Meetings as are established, and to take care therein, to understand that the Persons be clear, and Friends satisfied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marriage be accomplished? And this has been these many Years practised among us; and I know no true Union bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereby, nor any violation done to our first Principles thereof: Be ashamed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thy fruitless attempts, in giving such an high charge against us, when thou canst make no proof it.</p>
               <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> Concerning our Testimony on behalf of Mens and Womens Meetings in the Church of Christ; as for their Rise and Establishment, being in the counsel of God, and for the encouraging Faithful and Grave Women therein, and to admonish them that discountenance or weaken their Hands in the Work and Service of the Lord, &amp;c.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102665:121"/>
Thou callest this <hi>A Decree, a decretal Order; This New fashioned Edict,</hi> p. 45, 46. And sayst, <hi>It has no relation to Scripture-Authority, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or President; no relation to the Example of the Holy men of God recorded in Scripture, nor any command of God or Jesus Christ.</hi> Why no Relation to them? How provest thou that? what because we have not every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular circumstance of Persons and things ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest? Whence it follows not that this has no relation to Scripture or President, &amp;c. Holy Women and Sisters in the Faith, Elder Widdows that were honourable, and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses, did many Religious and Charitable Services in the Primitive Christian Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: What then might they not meet and confer together for one anothers help and encouragement in those Services they had, and were frequently imployed in? Can it either be a violence to their Principles of Union for such to meet together? or have their Assemblies no relation to Scripture? What contrariety thereto have they? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we alwayes accounted our Religious Meetings, to serve one another in Love, consistent with our Union and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples thereof. And so for Godly Women to meet for those Religious and Charitable ends and Services, for which their Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies are intended, must needs be consistent with the same Principles of Love and
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:102665:121"/>
Union, and tend to the Increase thereof, and not to the Violation thereof, as thou hast falsly charged. Upon our Admonition,
<q>Not to discountenance or weaken their Hands in the Work and Service of the Lord.</q>
Thou maketh this observation, viz. <hi>See what a strict and severe admonition is uttered forth, even as if it had come from the Pope's Council of Jesuits and crafty Fryars,</hi> [Scoffing and Smiting still at the Womens Meetings] p. 46, 47.</p>
               <p>How now <hi>(Francis)</hi> is this thy treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and comparison of us? Hadst thou no better than the Pope's Council of Jesuits and crafty Fryars to compare us unto, in our Testimony and Admonition? Oh! be ashamed of such foul, sordid, and scornful, and false treatment, who instead of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thy Charge of <hi>Inconsistence</hi> and <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> as before, now abuseth us, mocks and scoffs, and scandallizeth us, like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited proud Fool.</p>
               <p n="6">6<hi>thly,</hi> Be ashamed also of thy scornfully upbraiding us with <hi>our Womens Meetings, as an Idol of our own erecting</hi>; and asking, <hi>Why should it not publickly be brought to Light, and made as manifest as the</hi> Lord Cromwell <hi>made the</hi> Papists <hi>great Idol, to wit, the Rood of Grace (which had goggling Eyes, and would smile when a good Gift was offorded to it) when he caused it to be brought to</hi> Paul's <hi>Cross, where
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:102665:122"/>
the People tore it all to pieces, in King</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> 8<hi>ht's time,</hi> p. 47.</p>
               <p>Oh, thou ungodly Wretch and malicious Informer! is this a fit Comparison and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to present the Magistrates with, against our Christian, Religious, Charitable and Sober <hi>Womens Meetings?</hi> And dost thou under such an abominable and odious Comparison thus expose them to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, for their Meetings, to be torn to pieces? Thou vile Wretch, blush and be ashamed of such malicious, scornful and defaming Impertinences, thus instead of proving thy before-cited Charge, to act the malicious, reviling and false accusing Informer against God's People; then scornfully concludest thy Observation with these words, viz. <hi>This notable, not Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but Anti-scriptural Edict,</hi> p. 48. Which is a false Conclusion, without Premises, and a shameful begging the Question, wherein thou art an Imposer; for not one sentence or word in all that said Paper of our sence and Advice hast thou proved ANTI-SCRIPTVRAL, or <hi>directly contrary to Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as thy terms are, p<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 79. Thou shouldst then have shewn us what Scripture forbids either faithful Womens Assembling, or those Religious and Charitable ends and services proposed, which their Meetings are
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:102665:122"/>
intended for? I dare challenge thee in this to prove thy charge of Anti-scriptural.</p>
               <p n="7">7<hi>thly,</hi> I do affirm, thou art so far from making good thy Charge, that for all thy Attempts, I have still occasion to return the same charge upon thee that we did upon <hi>William Rogers,</hi> which for a pretence thou citest, but dost not answer it, p. 39. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What new and unchristian Doctrines and Practices are we fallen into? We find no proof nor discovery thereof in all thy Book.</q>
I do profess seriously (however thou scoffingly callest me <hi>a notable serious George</hi>)
<q>I see no cause nor reason thou shewest for the great <hi>noise</hi> &amp; <hi>rumble</hi> thou makest about <hi>outward Laws, Prescriptions, Orders, Edicts</hi> or <hi>Decrees, outward form of Government, Apostacy, Innovation, Impositions, Lording over Faith, over Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. (To which I may add thy terms, <hi>Womens Charter, Grant, Confirmation, New Order, Decretal Order, New fashion'd Edict, Popes Council, Papists great Idol, Canonical Rules, New spiritual Lords, Decrees, Canons, Edicts of Men, Tyrannical proceedings,</hi> &amp;c.) whilst thou shewest to us no unjust, no unlawful nor uncomely Order or Proceedings amongst us, as a People, nor yet givest us any Catalogue or Instance of those <hi>Impositions, Innovations, New Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Practices</hi> brought in and received amongst us, which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102665:123"/>
are <hi>INCONSISTENT</hi> with our first Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to the Light and Grace of God within, and teaching thereof, or thereby condemned as Evil, or wholly unnecessary in themselves (as our words are.)</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8<hi>thly,</hi> This thou dost not answer, but <hi>Marvellest that</hi> G.

And therefore</hi> sayst, <hi>thou wilt bring forth Proof and President; first the Confirmation of the Foundation of the Womens Meetings, namely,</hi> G. F<hi>'s Order by a general Council held at London,</hi> 1675.</p>
               <p>To all which I must tell thee, thou dost not follow the terms of the Challenge, but ramblest impertinently, telling us of <hi>New Orders, such things, the Confirmation of the Foundation of the Womens Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. but provest not those things (nor one thing) practised among us as a People; or that <hi>first Confirmation,</hi> as thou falsly callest it, to be <hi>Inconsistent</hi> with (or contrary to) our first Testimony to the Light and Grace of God within, and teachings thereof. 'Tis not thy making a noise with <hi>New Orders, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> &amp;c. shall serve thy turn in this point; but I challenge thee to prove that the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up and encouraging our faithful
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102665:123"/>
Womens Meetings are contrary to the Light and Grace of God within and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thereof. This is matter thou hast un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to bring proof and president for.

               <p n="9">9<hi>thly,</hi> Moreover, what we propounded in our Paper aforesaid, (which thou callest <hi>The Confirmation by a general Council held at</hi> London, Anno 1675. and which thou hast instanced for proof of thy Charge of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistency</hi> and <hi>Violence,</hi> and consequently as <hi>Antichristian</hi>) was tenderly concluded in these terms, viz.
<q>All which we recommend to the Evidence of Gods holy Witness in the Hearts of his People. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Query added.</hi> I do serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ask <hi>William Rogers,</hi> if this Paper of ours, thus Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, be sufficient <hi>proof</hi> of Imposition, and being tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an?

                     </note>
                  </q>
 Why didst thou not take notice of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, to have prevented thy false charge of <hi>Imposition,</hi> wherein thou hast contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted thy Brother <hi>William Rogers</hi>; for he hath divers times assented to and own'd the giving advice and counsel by way of Recommendation, distinguishing that from Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, as his own Books and Words are evidence. But thou cryst out, <hi>Impositions,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102665:124"/>
Inconsistency, Violence to our first Principles of Vnion,</hi> on that very same Paper which is concluded by way of Recommendation to the Evidence of Gods holy Witness in the Hearts of his People. And to this and other Papers of Advice, Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thou hast opposed <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> and so made void Spiritual Censures, contrary to the very Author thou hast printed, owned and espoused, as being <hi>of the same Judgment with thee,</hi> where he saith, pag. 138. part 1.
<q>'Tis very fit, that wheresoever you will sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Errors to be sprung up, all the means Christ hath appointed for that end should be used to suppress them, and reclaim Men from them: Let their Mouthes be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with sound Doctrine and <hi>Spiritual Censures.</hi> The only Question is about the use of the Temporal Power in such things.— Principles and Opinions in the Mind were never extinguished by the punishing the Body.</q>
Here his Liberty of Conscience pleaded, is not from spiritual Censures, as thou hast per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted it, but from corporal Punishments.</p>
               <p n="10">10<hi>thly,</hi> Whereas in our Book, <hi>Accuser, &amp;c.</hi> pag. 127. we signified, that having these things in our Eye, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>The great ends of true Religion and Christian Society, a godly Care over one another, provoking one another to Love and good Works, we can the more easily concur

and accord, as to Circumstances and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Methods; and in the Wisdom of God so to <hi>condescend</hi> one to another, and <hi>accommodate</hi> matters, as not to divide about them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Against this thou exceptest, in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> p. 96. <hi>I marvel that the Author of the</hi> Accuser, &amp;c. <hi>which is said to be</hi> G. Whitehead, <hi>should have the Confidence thus to appear in Print, when his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells him the contrary, instancing</hi> R. Smith <hi>of</hi> Colne, <hi>as not admitted to have his Wife, because he would not go into the Womens Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting: The grand Opposer was</hi> G. W.—<hi>It may evidently appear how far</hi> G.

               <p>And to aggravate the matter against <hi>G. W.</hi> in page 129. thou sayst, <hi>That the pretence of the Author of the</hi> Accuser, <hi>to</hi> Condescention <hi>and</hi> Accommodation <hi>is fallacious and false, and a meer piece of feigned Hypocrisie to amuse the Reader and delude the World.</hi> And likewise in pag. 150. thou art smiting at <hi>G. W.</hi> on the same account.</p>
               <p>Here thou hast brought my name upon the Stage in Print, but hast most grosly belyed me and abused me, as to my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:102665:125"/>
in saying <hi>it tells me the contrary.</hi> Be ashamed of this thy presumptious bespat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and abusing me in Print; for my Conscience tells me, I was real in what I proposed in <hi>Condescention</hi> and <hi>Accommodating</hi> matters, and that I was no deceiver therein, as thou proudly slanderest me. The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention</hi> and <hi>Accommodation</hi> was to those that had the great ends of true Religion, Christian care and love one to another in their Eye; it was to the upright and tender hearted, and not to the exalted, hard and wilful. And I gave my Christian and tender Advice to the Person who then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed his Intention, in order to convince him of the reasonableness of what I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and he shewed no reason against it, but remained stiff and pertinacious, which I cannot impute to a real tender Conscience; the woman was tender and flexible, and of a better Spirit. Therefore be ashamed of abusing and belying me in Print, as for <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Print contrary to my Conscience,</hi> as thou hast shamefully belyed me, and so falsly informed the Magistrates against me, as about <hi>Condescention</hi> and <hi>Accommodation</hi> (and divers other things) about which I must farther tell thee, The condescention of primitive Christians was to them of low de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, the strong in bearing with the weak, bearing one anothers burthens, and so fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102665:125"/>
the Law of Christ. The Persons unto whom the <hi>Condescention</hi> was, were in a measure of the same <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love</hi>; it was not to false Brethren (such as thou art) or to false Apostles, deceitful Workers, who caused Divisions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> false Brethren that watched with an evil Eye, to such the true Apostle gave not place by subjection, no, not for an hour: What Apostolical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention was then given to them? There was an Apostolical authority and sharpness, against such evil Agents of Strife and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision (such as thy self) that they should be marked, as well as a condescention to weak (yet upright-hearted) Brethren.</p>

(as the <hi>Papists</hi> would have them.) For as to Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses, and their Services in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches, there is great concurrence of History, and antient and modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as well <hi>Protestants,</hi> (if not more) as <hi>Papists.</hi> And therefore thy placing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>some Popish Author,</hi> does greatly manifest not only Ignorance, but rather Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Pride and Contempt against faithful Women's service in the Church of Christ: And I can assure thee, that I had not these precedent (and other) Citations from <hi>R.

               <p>Thus far thou in thy insolent Reviling and Abuse, boasting of thy pretended Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment against me: But I have met with no lawful nor due Impeachment from thee in any Gospel judicial way. Thou writest thus against me to the Friends of our Second day's Meeting in <hi>London,</hi> but they cannot own nor receive any such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and proof-less Impeachment against me upon thy bare Accusation, nor that thou hast any Jurisdiction to impeach me, as by thy unjustly comparing me to <hi>a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishop, or Popish Prelate,</hi> and rendring me <hi>an Enemy to Christian-Liberty, an usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per over the Conscience</hi>: But this is but like thy accusing me <hi>as a Cheat, at having gone
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:102665:129"/>
up and down to cheat the Country,</hi> after thou hadst flatter'd and fawn'd in another Letter, and intreated my <hi>assistance for the ending of the Controversie, as one that could do much in the matter</hi>; but now revilest me all to nought, boasting how ready thou stands <hi>Publickly to assert, maintain and vindicate.</hi> And what? But that <hi>G.

How <hi>like</hi> an exalted, malicious, prating <hi>Diotrephes?</hi> how like a Pope? how like the Accuser of the Brethren hast thou acted? Thou accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, scornest and railest, but provest no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of matter charged: And can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably think thou hast thy Proofs in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against me out of <hi>Huntingtonshire,</hi> of these black and infamous Characters thou hast cast upon me? Thy own bare Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are no Proofs to be sure. The Lord rebuke this thy envious dark Spirit: And he will rebuke it.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>Francis</hi>) art not thou thy self against Christian-Liberty of Conscience? and an usurper over the Womens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences (so far as thou canst) in thy perverse

Be ashamed of thy assuming such Power of Excommunication to thy self over thy Elders, Antient Friends and Brethren, who are approved Servants of Christ. How like a Popish Prelate, yea, like the Pope himself hast thou proudly, maliciously &amp; imperiously acted against me and others of the faithful Servants &amp; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ Jesus?

               <head>Postscript since added. Wherein <hi>F. B</hi>'s fallacy about the Record in the Quarterly Meeting Book in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> his abuse of the Servants of Christ, his Contradiction about <hi>William Penn,</hi> his Scorn, Malice and Ranting Doctrine, are detected and reprehended.</head>
               <p>WHen I was lately in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> I made enquiry about the account which thou <hi>F. Bugg</hi> givest in thy Observations, pag. 52. <hi>viz.</hi> concerning a <hi>Minister</hi> (thou knowest who thou mentionedst) <hi>being recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the Vnity, for not taking his Wife according to the Order of Friends</hi> (i. e.) <hi>not publishing his Intentions before the Womens Meetings, as hereafter</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Yet I find it not <hi>So</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in thy Book at all.</note> 
                  <hi>will be further manifest</hi> (sayst thou) <hi>but not one recorded that ever thou remembrest for any breach of Gods Commandments,</hi> pag. 53. For which acount thou <hi>referest any man to search the Records of your Quarterly Meeting Book in</hi> Hadenham <hi>in the Isle of</hi> Ely, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:102665:132"/>But upon my enquiry I find, that Friends do positively give a contrary account, and do plainly affirm, that there were no Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Meeting <hi>Then</hi> at that time in being in those parts (or within that Monethly Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) in <hi>Cambridgshire,</hi> where the said Person lives, who proposed his Intentions of Marriage but once before the Men; And if so, thy account must be notoriously false, and thou mayst be horridly ashamed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulge it, as also of thy frequently saying, <hi>He was recorded out of the Vnity</hi>; whenas Friends only recorded, That <hi>they have no Vnion with him in his so doing,</hi> as thou hast cited it, pag. 63. which is only relative to that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Act (<hi>viz.</hi>) of his refusing to come twice to the Meeting, and not in such general Terms to exclude the Person <hi>Out of the Vnity</hi> in all respects: Therefore thou appearest fallacious in thy account.</p>
               <p>As concerning the Paper of our sence and advice, dated, <hi>London, the</hi> 27<hi>th of the</hi> 3<hi>d Moneth,</hi> 1675. (consisting of divers particular weighty matters) which thou makest thy principal Instance of our <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy and Violence upon our first Principles of Vnion,</hi> and about which thou hast so much scofft and derided at us; I must tell thee that I know not one Person who subscribed tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Paper, but have cause to stand by it, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

will stand by it, though unjustly and defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly smote at, derided and contemned by thee. And why didst not publish all our said Paper? Thou sayst, <hi>Thou hast taken enough to shew our Innovations and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest Apostacies,</hi> pag. 50. as if all that Paper were matter of such Proof; which is a most slanderous Insinuation; for thou hast not proved one of these Instances of our said Paper either a <hi>Violation to our first Principles of Vnion, Antiscriptural,</hi> or <hi>Inconsistent with the Church-Discipline, Order and Government in the Primitive Times</hi> among true Christians, as thou pretendest, nor in the least tending to <hi>Apostacy</hi> or <hi>Antichristianism.</hi> Thou hast taken upon thee to stigmatize, brand and defame both our Testimony and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers, particularly <hi>William Penn,</hi> thou hast compared and rank't among such <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Societies, Violators, Innovators, Apostates, Pope's Council, Arbitrary Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, &amp;c.</hi> Thou art very loud in thy Charge, but mute in Proof, and wanting in Argument. And how dost thou herein agree with thy self, where in pag. 133. thou callest <hi>William Penn, This Noble Man,</hi> and in pag. 135. <hi>Dear W. P.</hi> and in pag. 144. thou prayst for <hi>William Penn</hi> in these words, <hi>(viz.) I pray God keep thee steddy, and with a continual Dependency upon the Divine Revelation, &amp;c.</hi> when thou
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102665:133"/>
hast represented the same Person <hi>W. P. Antichristian, Apostate, Innovator, &amp;c.</hi> as if thou shouldst pray thus for him, (viz.) <hi>Thou Antichristian Apostate, I pray God keep thee steddy.</hi> Such Absurdity doth thy Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction produce, who thus one while calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatest and revilest, and another while flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest and prayest for the same Person; one while judging and condemning the said Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son as <hi>Antichristian, Imposer, Innovator,</hi> &amp;c. another while counting him <hi>Noble Man, A Dear Man,</hi> &amp;c. Thou exclaimest against <hi>Religious Societies, Excommunicating, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning a Person as out of the Vnity,</hi> when it was but that <hi>They have no Vnity with him in his</hi> SO <hi>doing, (i e.</hi> in his irregular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding out of Unity and Order with them, in proposing his Intention of Marriage but <hi>Once</hi> to the Meeting, and that in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans absence) whilst thou thy self art (like an exalted <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> yea, like a <hi>Pope</hi> with thy printed Bull) <hi>Excommunicating, Condemning, Deriding</hi> and <hi>Contemning</hi> the <hi>Servants of Christ</hi> by Name in Print, as <hi>William Penn, George Whitehead, Stephen Crisp, Alex.

               <p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:102665:133"/>Thus inconsistent art thou, conceited proud Scorner and false pretender to <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience,</hi> who hast given more black Characters, and made a worse (to speak <hi>ad hominem</hi>) Record even in Print against these and divers other faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Christ, than only for a Meeting to Record in Manuscript their having <hi>No Vnion with a particular Person in his Irregular Proceeding</hi> in this or that particular act; for thou hast recorded these before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Servants of Christ by name as <hi>Antichristian, Imposers, Innovators,</hi> &amp;c. and compared them to the <hi>Popes Council</hi> in Print, and that in thy Book intended for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, as by thy Epistle appears, <hi>pag.</hi> 3. Thus inconsistent and contradictory to thy self art thou in thy pretended Plea for <hi>Liberty of Conscience,</hi> whilst thou art Defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Condemning and Excommunicating many of the Servants of Christ among us, for the exercise and testimony of their tender Consciences in their Christian Advice and Admonition, which is all one as to seek to stop their Mouthes from preaching, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting others, &amp;c. And this is not all thy Inconsistency and Confusion, the fruit of thy Malice and Treachery; but thou hast presented such a one as <hi>Henry North,</hi> Knight, and the Magistrates with such abominable Lyes and Abuses, as if (like a malicious
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:102665:134"/>
Informer and Incendiary) the Devil and thou designed not only the perpetual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> but an Aggravation of their Sufferings and Persecutions; against whom the chief ground of thy Book also is a <hi>gross Slander</hi> and <hi>great Lye,</hi> (viz.) <hi>That their way of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling, and Antichristian way of proceeding to bring to and force an Vniformity,</hi> Epis. p. 4. And thus raging against our Friends in these terms, (viz.) <hi>These Tyrannical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings have been used by our New Spiritual Lords,</hi> Epis. p. 6. with much more Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Slander and Scorn cast upon us in thy Book, for which the hand of the Lord will be upon thee: Thy Envy and Wickedness is judged of the Lord; take heed how thou persistest in it, lest he make thee an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>In thy sixth Chapter thou art, according to thy wonted course of Malice and Scorn, inveighing against <hi>our Womens Meetings,</hi> falsly charging them <hi>with usurped Authority, unlimited Power and Rule, placed in their Meetings by</hi> G. F. <hi>and others</hi>; which is a gross abuse and slander. Also thou art in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighing against <hi>presenting Intentions of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage before them by both the Persons,</hi> p. 118, 119. And this is not all the Fruit of thy perverse opposition, but in the same Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, p. 123. after divers Citations, thou
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102665:134"/>
bringest a comparison or instance of <hi>eating Flesh or Fish, as being indifferent and free</hi>; and then addest, that <hi>These with</hi> ALL <hi>other outward Works be Things Indifferent, and may be used, and also left.</hi> I must tell thee (<hi>Francis</hi>) that this Position makes void all Christian-Discipline, good Order &amp; Church-Government, leaving all loose and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: And we are sure thou hast here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted corrupt Doctrine, tending to practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ranterism it self; for here thou makest no exception; thy assertion is general, not only of eating of Flesh and Fish, but of ALL other outward works, <hi>that they be things Indifferent, that may be used, and also left:</hi> See now if this be not sordid Rante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism; this loose, gain-saying Spirit leads into both, to thy own contradiction, where thou pretendest for <hi>Church-Discipline, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government,</hi> as in thy Title page thou seemest to grant were <hi>in the Primitive times,</hi> (i. e. among the Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as we understand.) But what Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, Order or Government in the Church canst thou Conscientiously plead, and be consistent with thy Position (viz.) <hi>That all outward Works be things Indifferent,</hi> &amp;c? How contrary to the Apostles Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine also is this? for all good Works, which God hath ordained we should walk in; these are not indifferent to be used, and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102665:135"/>
also left; outward works of Righteousness, Justice, Goodness, Charity, &amp;c. command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, are not Indifferent to be used and also left: Solemn contracts and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Marriage are not Indifferent: Persons may not break solemn Contracts, due and orderly Proceedings: Men may not leave their Wives when they please, as an indifferent thing.

            <p n="1">§. 1. WHereas <hi>Thomas Crisp</hi> hath of late time struck in with <hi>William Rogers</hi> and his party, as a busie Agent in Division, and as hot and violent in his abusive Language and Reflection, as the most of them, for want of better Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Reason, he is also gotten into the same kind of stile and strain with <hi>W.

B.</hi> against <hi>promoting Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Orders, Customs, Forms, Prescriptions,</hi> &amp;c. as in several of his late Pamphlets, called <hi>Testimonies.</hi> I find also that these Opposers have recourse to one anothers Writings, and quote each other, and thereby show their own Authorities for themselves in the Controversie, for want of better Proof, as <hi>W. R.</hi> cites <hi>F. B.</hi> in his
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102665:137"/>
seventh Part, from page 64, to page 75. and <hi>F. B.</hi> quotes <hi>W. R.</hi> and <hi>Tho. Crisp</hi>'s <hi>Babels Builders,</hi> in his 112 page of his said Book, <hi>De Christ.

Crisp</hi>'s third Edition, which he calls <hi>George Bishop</hi>'s Testimony, against a Paper of Orders, which is the very same Paper that <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> (some Years ago, cited against us, in his Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, stiled, <hi>Antichrist's Transformations,</hi> and which the said <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> did so publish in Print against <hi>G.

seasonable advice, which we see no cause to Repent of; and therefore <hi>G. B</hi>'s Paper cited by the said <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> and <hi>Thomas Crisp,</hi> in opposition to that of ours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a mistaken Judgment and is, Uncharitable against us, as well as Erronious in divers parts of it <note n="†" place="margin">As in his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing <hi>Pastors, Teachers, Elders,</hi> &amp;c. in our day, and the <hi>Spirit</hi> to them, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring us at <hi>inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Orders, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our selves in the place of the HEIR,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And he was Answer'd in his Life time by several of the Servants of Christ w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102665:138"/>
of all concerned, my labour having been and still is, for Love and Unity among God's People; and I take it not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly from <hi>T. C.</hi> but as his Injustice and an Abuse so often to bring forth that piece of a Letter in Print against me, which was before published and printed more fully by some malicious Adversaries, in their Pamphlet, stiled, <hi>Tyranny and Hypocrisie,</hi> printed in the year 1673. In answer to which, I desire T. C. and the rest of the party concerned would now accept and consider <hi>B. F</hi>'s own late Testimony, seeing the Lord in mercy has reduced him to a better understanding and judgment, than he was in when he writ the said Letter.</p>

                        <p>WHereas I understand that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry persons, to me unknown, have divers times formerly, and now again lately published in Print certain extracts of a Letter written by me, as I take it about sixteen years ago to <hi>G.

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102665:138"/>
hitherto been done of this nature, has been altogether without my order, consent or privity; for my soul hates that <hi>Spirit</hi> of <hi>Prejudice, Enmity</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> by which some men (though perhaps, poor men! not knowing by what spirit influenc'd, what spirit they gratifie, and what spirit they grieve and wound in this their work) so acted, led and driven. As for so many of them that are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under a mistake, I do from my heart pity them, and am touched with the sence of their Condition, as having laboured under the same snares. Wherefore my earnest desire for them is, That they may be made sensible of that which they seem so earnestly to contend for; yea, even for them that are so tinctur'd and leaven'd with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, that they do wittingly and with some degree of Malice, foment <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> I cannot but desire, if it be the will of God, that they may through Judgment come to know Repentance, and through Repentance receive Mercy and Remission in and by the
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:102665:139"/>
Blood of Jesus Christ, to whom all such do doe despight.</p>
                        <p>And as for those Papers so long since given forth by me, not discerning what spirit did then influence me (for so it is, that the actions of men are many times influenced both by good and evil Spirits, though they perceive it not, how much soever the Notion of Spirits, ridiculed by the <hi>Atheistick Philosophasters</hi> and <hi>wild Wits</hi> of this age) I did many years since recall them, and make it my request, that any that had them in their custody might make no further ill use of them; and to have found the contrary since, has been no small grief to me, especially to see so often repeated these personal Reflections by me used against <hi>G.F.</hi> and <hi>G.W.</hi> whom I truly honour in the Lord for their works and labours of Love.</p>
                        <p>However, I would not have any malicious Persons from hence take occasion to think, much less to say or represent, that I have hereby revoked, or do in the least intend to inervate any of the words in that or any other

                        </p>
                        <p>For I do firmly believe, <hi>That there is no Principle maintained amongst Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind that stands upon f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

                        <p>For as the Principle of <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> is in it self most reasonable and christian, so is this latter of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>All Iudging</hi> upon any account most unreasonable, blind and foolish.</p>

            <p>Now <hi>Tho. Crisp</hi> and the rest concerned, see by these Lines how far <hi>B. F.</hi> hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished the point in Controversie, and cleared himself upon a better understanding concerning the said Letter, and against the perverse use thou hast made of it in Print to reproach me withal.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. And since thou hast causlesly aspersed me with it, and so far censoriously exposed me in Print, as thou hast done, when I sought no occasion against thee, nor designed Controversie with thee; and seeing thou art grown so hardy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident as to make thy self such a publick Agent and Advocate for W. R. and his Party in the Controversie, I have not yet done with thee, but am concerned further to take notice of a few Passages in thy
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102665:140"/>
Pamphlets, which I look upon as very corrupt and perverse, and contrary to our antient and constant Testimony, born among us on behalf of Christ.</p>
            <p>The first is in thy Pamphlet, stil'd, <hi>Several Testimonies,</hi> 3<hi>d Edition,</hi> which is also printed in others of thy Pamphlets, in these words, <hi>viz.</hi> pag. 26.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I fear you take more care for the strict Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of your own Orders and Traditions than the Truth in the Heart; for if any use not your Language, or observe not to do just as others, in</hi> Tythes <hi>or other</hi> CIVIL RIGHTS, <hi>which the Laws of our Land require, and ought to be observed, (unless God by his Spirit in the Heart doth forbid, or any do really for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake refuse) But if one cannot do so, must he therefore judge his Brother? That may be required of one that may not be required of another; for Growth or Measure may differ,</hi> Rom. 14.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AND</hi> J. Crook <hi>saith,</hi>
               <q>We read of— <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> two men performing the same Action, attended with the same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet the one accepted, and the other rejected. In like manner may two Persons be found in contrary <hi>Actions, Postures, Gestures,</hi> and yet both accepted of God; for if I should lay a Bond upon my self <hi>therein,</hi> I transgress the liberty of the spirit, either as to <hi>time,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102665:141"/>
constancy</hi> or <hi>place</hi>; or if another should lay a Bond upon me, or put a Yoke about the Neck of the Disciples, this is no more justifiable than the former.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To the first part, being thy words, I must tell thee, thy Proposition is unsound and inconsistent with our antient Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as well as Contradictory in its self: <hi>Vnsound</hi> in that it bespeaks thou art not principl'd against the Payment of Tythes in this Gospel day, and hast not retain'd a true or certain Judgment against them in thy esteeming and accounting of them amongst <hi>Civil Right,</hi> but <hi>Rites</hi> in thy other Pamphlet, <hi>which ought to be observed</hi>; and implying, that a Brother is not to be judg'd for observing (or paying) them. I am sure this is contrary to the Testimony born and received among us from the beginning. And to thy granting, that God by his Spirit in the Heart may forbid them, or that for Conscience sake some refuse them; as if the Spirit of the Lord did allow one Brother to pay Tythes as a civil Right, and forbid another; or that from a different Growth or Measure of Grace, one Brother may be required to refuse the Payment of Tythes, and another Brother not so requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and therefore not to be judged for the Payment of them, being both under the same Profession and Dispensation: Is not
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:102665:141"/>
this Inconsistent &amp; Babylonish, yea, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to apparent Ranterism, to render the Spirit and different Measures thereof so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and opposite in its requirings, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so eminent &amp; weighty as that of <hi>Tythes</hi>? wherein our manifest Testimony hath been so positive, and the Sufferings of many so deep and heavy for not paying Tythes, and whereof the very first breaking forth of the Light and dawning of the Gospel Day did convince many Thousands, when their Eyes were first opened to see the Corruption of that Ministry which is upheld by Tythes and forced Maintenance; therefore <hi>T. C.</hi> thou art gone from the Light that first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced thee, in thus confusedly arguing for Tythes; and thy Proposition is loose and fallacious, and there's no such contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the different Measures of Grace and Spirit received from God, as thou absurdly implyest. If ever thou knew'st or wast sensible either that Tythes were ended by <hi>Christ,</hi> or that the <hi>Ministry</hi> upheld by them is none of Christ's Ministry, thou couldst never suppose that any measure or degree of his Grace or Spirit would allow or lead any (who have been really convinced of the Evil thereof) in the payment of them, if thou wert not gone from the true sence and measure thereof in thy self; for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent measures or degrees of Grace do not
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102665:142"/>
alter the Property of it; and whatever it once manifests to be sin, and forbids as such, it always forbids, and allows none in the practice thereof; and whoever are truly convinced by the Grace of God, and have their Minds turned to it, if they keep in it, and walk in its way and teaching, they are principled by it, and are a Law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves therein, against those things, ways and works which are corrupt or sinful, and cannot place a slight Indifferency where the Truth hath made a real Difference; for what communion hath <hi>Light</hi> with <hi>Darkness,</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> with <hi>Belial,</hi> or <hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Sincerity</hi> with <hi>Hypocrisie,</hi> or <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Watchfulness</hi> with <hi>Ranterism</hi> and <hi>Looseness?</hi>— Consider how and from whence thou art fallen, and Repent.</p>
            <p>To thy subsequent Allegation of <hi>John Crook</hi>'s saying, I must tell thee, that I look upon thee to have dealt <hi>unjustly, disingeniously</hi> and <hi>injuriously</hi> by him, and very impertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged his words in this case, for thy unwarrantable, confused &amp; loose Proposition for the Observation of Tythes, as a <hi>civil Right</hi> or <hi>Rite.</hi> I doubt not but he is better principled, even from the time of his first receiving the Truth, than to grant or allow any such liberty to any Christian Brother for the observation (or payment) of Tythes, as thy words import; and that thy Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102665:142"/>
of his words in this case, is contrary to his very Intention. I dare presume and appeal to his Conscience to give Judgment against thee in this case, whether the different or contrary actions, postures or ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, relating to time, constancy or place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> mentioned by him, were intended with respect to <hi>Tythes,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">For <hi>J. Crook</hi> hath given publick Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny against the Payment of Tythes in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel day, witness his Treatise, i. e. <hi>Tythes no Property, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> the Payment or Non-payment of them.

<pb n="276" facs="tcp:102665:143"/>
cannot say in relation to the <hi>Payment of Tythes</hi> in this Gospel day, no more than in Sacrifice and burnt Offerings, since Christ hath put an end thereto. Those things offered by <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel</hi> as <hi>the fruit of the Ground</hi> and <hi>firstlings of the Flock,</hi> were things in themselves lawful, and allowed in their day and time, and were also according to the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> being Types under the old covenant. But this can be no pertinent Instance, as alledged by thee (<hi>Thomas</hi>) in the case of Tythes, to observe (or pay) them in this Gospel day, and as now in Controversie; since both Tythes and Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were ended by Christ in his Death; nor is there any parrallel in the case, unless thou couldst prove that the Spirit of Christ doth move Believers in this Gospel day, both to the Payment of Tythes and the Non-payment (or refusal) of them, which I dare say, thou canst not prove. 'Tis not to be supposed that what <hi>Christ</hi> has abolish'd in the old Covenant he will enjoyn or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the new; the Spirit of Christ is not contradictory to it self, nor are Gods sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Commands contrary one to another, especially under one and the same dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation and state.</p>

<q>These foregoing Testimonies are not transcribed at large, but abridged for brevities sake, but the SENSE AND SVBSTANCE OF THE WHOLE included.</q>
But <hi>Thomas,</hi> I must tell thee, this is a down-right Untruth; the Sense and Substance of the Whole of that very Paper of <hi>J. W.</hi> and <hi>J. S.</hi> is not included in thy citation, although thou hast confessed their Testimony to be <hi>weighty Truths,</hi> and hast cited more passages than that concerning <hi>Womens Meetings</hi>; for thou hast left out these Words of their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, (viz.)
<q>As to Tythes, we can in truth say, 'twas never so much as in our Hearts to strengthen any in the Payment thereof, nor yet to weaken the Faith of any, having a Testimony in our Hearts that <hi>Tythes,</hi> as at this day paid, are AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICHRISTIAN.</q>
(Thus far they.)</p>
            <p>How now <hi>Thomas</hi>? Why didst thou leave these Words out of thy Citation? Was here nothing of the sense nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102665:144"/>
of their Testimony? or wast thou not conscious to thy self, that their Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here against the payment of Tythes, and thy Proposition aforesaid for the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Tythes, as a <hi>civil Right</hi> or <hi>Rite,</hi> &amp;c. were inconsistent and contradictory? their words are positive against them, as <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> but thine are partly for them, and but doubtfully against them, that is [<hi>If the Spirit of the Lord in the Heart forbid the payment of them</hi>] or if the different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Grace require one Brother not to pay them, and allow (or be silent at) another Brother's paying them. Thus <hi>Thomas</hi> thou appearest in Confusion a BABEL-BUILDER.</p>
            <p>And what is our Language thou reflects upon? Is it the plain Language of <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a single Person? And what are those <hi>Orders</hi> thou complainest of, and those <hi>Customs, Forms and Prescriptions?</hi> Hast not thou appeared like thy Brother <hi>John Penny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> in thy empty and fruitless opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? only he is a little more plain in his furious Roaring Letter to <hi>G.

We direct People to the Light and Power of Christ within, to guide them both in the Life and Form of Godliness, Form of sound Words, and to obey from the Heart the Form of Doctrine received from Christ, and therefore we impose no blind Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, nor dark Formality upon any, but desire that all may come to be living Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in Spirit, Life, Power and Holiness of Conversation, that their Conversations may be as becometh the Gospel of Christ; but you Backsliders are of disobedient and loose Spirits, else you would not rage, roar and foam out your own Shame as you do against the Servants of Christ, or that Form and Order which we are sure he has brought us into, and wherein we are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientiously concerned to follow our Lord Jesus Christ in Humility; and herein we can distinguish between <hi>formal Christians</hi> and <hi>living Christians,</hi> and would have none
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:102665:145"/>
to enter into either extream of Formality without Life and Power, or under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Life and Power to deny or oppose all Form and Order; for there may be a formal pretended Christian without Life and Power, but no real living Christian in Power without true Form; And this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction we had from the beginning, and therefore alwayes believed that the true Power would not lead into any false or wrong Form, nor into any Disorder or Confusion, knowing that our God is the God of Order, and not of Confusion; he is the God of Love, Peace and Union, and not of discord or strife.</p>

Thou canst advise and instruct others to <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Gentleness,</hi> and pretendest to shew <hi>the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of bearing with, and not judging one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about such things, wherein they differ in Opinion or Practice in some things,</hi> viz. <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and circumstantial matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; for that thou sayest, <hi>We may belong to one Shepherd, although not all in one Fold</hi>; and confessest, <hi>That Love is part of the Seal in the Forehead of the Lamb's followers; and so also Hatred, Strife,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the mark of the Beast,</hi> as in thy <hi>Introduction</hi> to thy third Edition: As also page 13. thou givest Friends this warning, <hi>To forbear judging any man any more, upon any pretence whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> as in the Paper thou hast cited, and falsly callest <hi>E.

us on some <hi>Pretence</hi>; thou appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in Hatred and Strife in the most of thy controvertial Pamphlets. May we belong to one Shepherd, although not all in the Fold as yet? Why then art thou and <hi>W. R.</hi> and <hi>F. Bugg,</hi> and <hi>John Pennyman,</hi> so severe in Judging, Censuring, Reviling and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching many among us, whom we know to be the Servants of Christ? And thou telling of <hi>G. F</hi>'s <hi>Cheats,</hi> rendring thy Wife as one cheated and deceived by our Friends: Oh sordid and base Confusion, and Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish stuff! Seriously recollect thy self, and give over thy false and fruitless At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, Impertinencies, and confused Scribling; for the Day is dawned and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken forth, that has made a discovery of the miserable Apostacy and Darkness, which you contentious &amp; quarrelsom Opposers are fallen into. Oh! come down, come down, and seek Repentance, and be humbled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mighty Hand of God: May the Lord in Mercy give thee an Heart thereto, my Soul charitably wisheth it for thee, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. In thy Fourth Part, page 19. thou art endeavouring to extenuate the offence on thy part on thy Principle, that <hi>one may marry by the Priest, and pay Tythes, and yet be a Christian</hi>; Thou shouldst have added, [<hi>One of the darker sort of Christians.</hi>] But
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:102665:151"/>
to excuse the matter on thy part, <hi>Thy Wife was not then one called a</hi> Quaker, <note n="*" place="margin">But it seems <hi>T.C.</hi> was one then so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and if she was instrumental to induce him to Marry by a Priest, contrary to his Perswasion or Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, she had also cause to Repent it, and may yet see more <hi>cause</hi> to <hi>Rue it,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his <hi>Apostacy.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>And thou couldst not satisfie her, so that thou CONDE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SCENDED to take thy Wife in the presence of a Priest, and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that thou didst it not on any account of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but to answer the LAW</hi>; and sayest, <hi>who</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Priest) very Christian-like condescended to thee, so as not to say or do, or require thee to do or say any thing thou shouldst be dissatisfied with,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And you did before him declare you took each other,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>nor was there half the Ceremony or Formality that is now practised according to</hi> G. F<hi>'s Form,</hi> &amp;c. Oh <hi>Thomas!</hi> These slight Covers, and Linsey-Woolsey Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will not hide thy Disobedience, nor excuse thee from acting contrary to thy Conviction and Conscience. It appears thou wast marryed by a Priest [but to mince it, 'twas <hi>in the presence of a Priest</hi>] though not in all Formalities; and this was thy CONDESCENTION: Was it so? Then thou wast come to a higher sight and state than to be marryed by a Priest. May it not be said further, how could it be consistent
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:102665:152"/>
with thy Principle and Profession as a <hi>real Christian-Quaker</hi> or <hi>Conscientious Dissenter,</hi> to be so Marryed? Mince it as much as thou canst, 'twill not hold together. But <hi>thou didst it not on any account of Religion, &amp;c.</hi> No! how couldst thou exclude that weighty concern of Marriage out of Religion? How Irreligious wast thou then in it? Is there not as much need to keep unspotted of the Word in the great concern of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, as in any other concern in this Life? How couldst thou then lay Religion aside in this weighty concern? Is it not manifest Ranterism for a person to make so slight of Religion, as at his will and pleasure to lay it aside, and that under pretence of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending in matters of greatest Moment here wherein all truly enlightned and clear sighted Christians have most need to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously exemplary, and faithful in their Testimony, according to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences?</p>
            <p>But to thy Question; <hi>May not one Marry by the Priest, or pay Tythes, and yet be a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian?</hi> For thy Principle, <hi>That he may,</hi> (in thy 5th part, p. 14.) thou givest us this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, viz. <hi>I find</hi> George Keith <hi>very Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian like say,</hi>
               <q>I do not doubt but the Lord had, and I believe he now hath many that are precious to him, and that belong to the <hi>Catholick-Church,</hi> even as I believe the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:102665:152"/>
Lord hath many such among <hi>Episcopalians, Papists, &amp;c.</hi> Also, I do acknowledge the Lord hath among the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> some who belong to the true Church.</q>
               <hi>Surely then</hi> (sayst thou) <hi>these must be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and did and do Marry by or with a Priest, and pay Tythes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now (<hi>Thomas</hi>) this Instance, and thy Inference upon it, are the most cunningly alledged of any thing I find in thy writings, and yet they will not do, they will not serve thy turn; for granting some among all these to whom the Lord hath regard, and who in some sence may belong to his Church, it is with respect to their Sincerity towards God, and their fear of him, Conscientious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness springing from his own Seed in them; and not with respect to their Formalities, cloud of humane Traditions and Inventions, which thy are led into by their Priests, as <hi>Marrying by Priests, paying Tythes, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore, however the Lord in Mercy hath a regard to them for the sake of the good in them, yet they are but <hi>dim-sighted,</hi> and of the <hi>darker sort of Christians,</hi> who see not beyond those humane Impositions and Traditions, as paying Tythes and Marrying by a Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for thee to excuse thy self therein, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessest a higher state and degree of Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (no doubt) as no less than <hi>that of a
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102665:153"/>
Christian-Quaker,</hi> thou mightst as well argue, that there are some of the better and more sincere sort of <hi>Papists</hi> that bow to Images, and use many Superstitions, which their Priests have misled them into, and to whom God shews Mercy in saving their Souls at length; therefore thou or any <hi>Christian-Quaker</hi> may bow to Images, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve Popish Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus, There are many of the <hi>sincerer</hi> sort of <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> People that have their Children <hi>sprinkled</hi> by a Priest, and signed with the <hi>Sign</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> that hear <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> conform, and do all Conscientiously, and are sincere to God in their Way; so that in Charity we may conclude, that their Souls find Mercy with God at length. And what follows? Therefore <hi>Thomas Crisp</hi> as a <hi>Christian-Quaker,</hi> and all other Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Dissenters, both <hi>Anabaptists</hi> and others, may carry their Children to be <hi>Sprinkled</hi> by a Priest, have them signed with the <hi>Sign of the Cross,</hi> hear <hi>Common-Prayer, conform, &amp;c.</hi> and yet be good Christians, precious to God, while thus inconsistent with their own Consciences, dissenting Principles and Profession. Thus incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistently thou mightst as well argue for the <hi>Christian-Quakers</hi> paying Tythes and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying by a Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I must deny the consequence: Thou (as a <hi>Quaker</hi>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:102665:153"/>
doubtless) hast known better things, and that as to the knowledge of Truth and degree of divine Illumination. There is no just Comparison between a <hi>real Christian Quaker</hi> and the best sort of <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians.</hi> Therefore thy pleading in thy 5th part of <hi>Babels,</hi> p. 19, 20. for <hi>charity and forbearance to be allowed them who think it as much their duty to pay Tythes, as we do think it a sin (and to those who do Marry by a Priest, and pay Tythes, being of different Perswasion from us.)</hi> Granting such there are, who see no further, and are to be pitied; 'tis no argument for any that are of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Perswasion to take liberty to <hi>pay Tythes</hi> and <hi>Marry by a Priest</hi>; for their sin is greater than the other.</p>
            <p>Oh Friend! thy Disobedience, Declen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Apostacy from those Discoveries the true Light has made, will not be excus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by all thy slight Allegations in the sight of the All-seeing and Heart-searching God.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. But—T. C<hi>'s Judgment about Tythes accords with what is in the third part of the</hi> Christian-Quaker, &amp;c. <hi>by</hi> W. R. <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anly and largely treated on</hi> (quoth he) <hi>in his fourth part, p.</hi> 19. And what is W. R<hi>'s</hi> Judgment or Doctrine in that case? Is it not <hi>for freely paying Tythes to the National Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi>
               <pb n="298" facs="tcp:102665:154"/>
i. e. <hi>not as by Constraint; yea, if any Person will freely of himself give a tenth part of his Estate or Encrease thereof to ANY VSE WHATSOEVER, having no regard to any humane Institution, or claim by any pretended divine Law,</hi> &amp;c. as his words are, 7th part, p. 52. Compare his Objection and Answer in that case, in his 2d part, <hi>Christian-Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> p. 43. and the Apology he makes for it in his 7th part, p. 52, 53. together with our fore-going Replyes, then it will appear how loose and apostatized thy Judgment is from the ancient Principle and Christian Testimony of the truly <hi>Christian-Quakers,</hi> whose Principle never allowed <hi>paying Tythes freely,</hi> (or otherwise) <hi>to the National Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, or to any use whatsoever.</hi> Therefore how little excusable is your Declension, Apostacy, and loose Doctrine in that case, who have seen and known better things from a farther degree of Illumination, than either the best sort of <hi>Papists</hi> or <hi>Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> have as yet received? Wherefore you, in sinning against Knowledge, are more condemnable in those things, than they in their Ignorance, blind Zeal, or Dim-sightedness. So that 'tis high time for thee to bethink thy self better, and Repent.</p>

               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:102665:154"/>§. 8. I could say much to thy Reply thou hast given to <hi>Stephen Crisp,</hi> in thy <hi>Babels,</hi> 4th part, to evince how <hi>disingenuous, falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> and <hi>abusive</hi> it is; but I find little ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity upon me therein, considering what little weight it is of, and how that <hi>Stephen Crisp,</hi> the Person immediately concerned, did not look upon himself so deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, as to think it worth the while to spend much time about, or take much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of: Only I must tell thee, thou hast abused both him, and those of us who gave our Testimony, and plainly showed our dislike against the Paper and Subscription from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> which was not <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>ONLY a dislike of the Wording it,</hi> (as thou falsly sayest) but of both mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and subscription: And therefore thy saying, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>First</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>There is no denial or disowning the Principle of giving up all</hi> (i. e. <hi>Spiritual and Temporal) to</hi> G. F<hi>'s Mens and Womens Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi> (as thou scornfully accusest us, p. 2, 3.) This is a gross Untruth and foul Perversion, and our Consciences bear us witness to the contrary, that we do dislike and disown any such Principle and Doctrine: Thou hast mis-stated the case against us herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As also thy Objection is false, <hi>That we were more afraid of the Publication, than ashamed of the Matter,</hi> p. 6.9. Seeing
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:102665:155"/>
we so plainly manifested our Dislike of the matter, in our Letter to those of <hi>Barbadoes</hi> concerned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As also a scornful and two-fold Slander it is, <hi>That we endeavour to compel all to worship our Image</hi> (as thy false term is) <hi>of</hi> G. F<hi>'s Orders,</hi> p. 7. We deny both by terms and matter herein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And likewise a gross Slander and Abuse it is, <hi>That</hi> G.

            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Also these are notorious Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods; <hi>That we will drive them that will not follow us, contrary, or before the Spirit of the Lord lead them into our Ceremonies, else they must be Sons of Perdition, and all black Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters we can find to vilifie them,</hi> pag. 10. These are foul and false Accusations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Again, <hi>That thou hast to thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding endeavoured the Advance and Honour of that Truth we profess,</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Light in the Conscience</hi>) p. 11. This is an untruth; thy Vilifying and Abusing (and Railery against) the Servants of Christ; who truly own and profess the Light for their guide, proves the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, That we are zealous for Forms,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:102665:155"/>
more than the Power,</hi> p. 11. Is also a false Accusation and Slander.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly, That</hi> Stephen Crisp <hi>is an Engine of Satan,</hi> p. 12. And <hi>A Forger,</hi> p. 2. And <hi>A bold-faced Lyar,</hi> p. 4. appear slanderous Abuses and foul Detractions, also expresly contrary to thy own warning thou hast given forth in <hi>E. B</hi>'s Name, for <hi>All Friends to forbear Judging any man upon any pretence whatsoever.</hi> However, <hi>Stephen Crisp</hi> is known to be a man Conscientious towards God, a man more Righteous than thy self, and I suppose better qualified, both as a Man, and a Christian, than ever thou wast; and thy envious Detractions cannot lessen his Reputation, where he is well known. For the rest of thy Abuses, Perversions, foul Detractions, Railery, and bitter an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Stuff, (in thy Pamphlets) which are not here recited, I leave thee to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge of all to reckon with and judge thee, as I doubt not but in due time he will.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9.

his Words speak any thing at all touching Tythes</hi>: And that his Paper, which is only in Manuscript, (near twenty Years since, writ on another occasion) <hi>Cannot with any ingenuity be referred to the Payment, or Non-payment of Tythes</hi>: And that by a Book writ by him, and Printed 1659. against Tythes, together with his own clearness from the payment thereof, it is evident <hi>He cannot reasonably be supposed to favour the Payment of them.</hi> Thus far <hi>J. Crook</hi> hath ingenuously and plainly intimated and given his judgment, which (compared with my Exception before) doth confirm it against <hi>T.

                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:102665:160"/>The Conclusion, by way of Solemn Appeal and Supplication to God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">§. 1. COncerning <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi>'s four Pamphlets, slanderously char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging us with <hi>Antichristian Doctrines, and an Antichristian Government, or a visible Church-Government that's altogether Antichristian,</hi> as in his <hi>One Blow,</hi> pag. 9. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Some may ask me, Why I take notice of such confused, muddled, blind, dark and mad Stuff, as his appears to be? To which I Answer:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Because neither the Truth, nor us, as a Religious People and Christian Society, may lie under any Dis-repute, Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish or Derision thereof, in the Eyes of those that know not, nor rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Christian Doctrine, Discipline, Church-Government, and wholsom Order among us, seeing the said <hi>J. B.</hi> has been for many Years conversant among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and born the Name of a <hi>Quaker</hi> (he saith) this twenty Years, and more: Though he IS NO <hi>QVAKER,</hi> but turn'd an open Enemy to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because the said <hi>Jeffery Bullock,</hi> in a great measure, runs parallel with, and resembles <hi>William Rogers</hi> and his party, in his opposition and gain-saying of that Order and Church-Government that is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:102665:160"/>
among us, falsly accusing us with <hi>Men's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, Imitations, Traditions, laying aside the Spirits Government,</hi> &amp;c. as in his <hi>ONE BLOW,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because four Persons of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Rogers</hi>'s Party <note n="*" place="margin">Their Names I forbear exposing at present to this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous Birth they have adopted from <hi>Jeffery Bullock.</hi> But if they shall again suffer or encourage the reading of any such Unchristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, disingenuous and malicious Books (or Pamphlets) as <hi>W. R's</hi> 7th part, by any of their Party in Friends publick Meeting, (as I understand, was once done at <hi>Chippinham,</hi> which was a turbulent, irreverent, and mad Action) then they will more manifestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to have their Names exposed, both in relation to that, and to <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> and <hi>his Books,</hi> &amp;c.</note> of <hi>Chippinham</hi> in <hi>Wilts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire</hi> have given their approbation in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the said <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> of his Books, particularly that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>One Blow more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Antichrist's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi>; and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that <hi>several Friends have good Vnity therewith</hi>; Which I do not believe: And not only so, but this in opposition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to others, whom they abusively revile in these Words (viz.) <hi>But here are also a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of called Friends, which are very much for</hi> Foxonians <hi>Orders, which may be called mens Inventions, that do make it their work to Defame and Calumniate all them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> do not conform thereunto. Some of
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:102665:161"/>
which thou, and most of which we are in our Hearts perswaded are Servants of the living God, amongst which thou hast a share of being villified to be a bad man; although to us its no manner of Invitation for us to give Credit thereunto, &amp;c</hi> — Barnadiston <hi>and another hath been here, their envious Darts fly very swiftly and secretly—If thou pleasest to send half a Dozen of thy Books,</hi> &amp;c. With other Aggravations in the said <hi>Chippinham</hi> Letter, shewing not only their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and owning of <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> and his Books, but also their bitterness of Spirit in villifying and reproaching others; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I understand they have been a little ashamed of their approbation of his Books, yet not that they have repented of the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness of their Spirits, nor condemned those villifying Reproaches and bitter Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions in their said Letter, as <hi>Foxonians Orders,</hi> Barnadiston <hi>and another; their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Darts fly very swiftly,</hi> &amp;c. What scorn, bitterness, and rancor do such Expressions bespeak? Christ never taught them to give such Names to Friends as <hi>Foxonians,</hi> nor would they take it well to be so dealt by, nay, they would think much if they should but be called <hi>Johannites,</hi> and their reviling <hi>Giles Barnardiston,</hi> who was a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able innocent man, and of good Report, doth bespeak a great Prejudice and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:102665:161"/>
to have entred their Spirits, which they should plainly have condemned; their Letter is all perverse, but I do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any sincere or tender Retractation, or real Condemnation thereof given out by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Notice is here taken of <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi>'s Pamphlets, to manifest the great Absurdity that opposit dividing Spirit leads into, and to warn others against it. And why these Persons should so hastily approve of <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi>'s Books, or say, that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Friends have good Unity therewith, I know no reason, being in several things so Corrupt, Erronious and Atheistical, as they are, except it be with respect to the Oppositions therein contained against the <hi>Church-Government, Order</hi> and <hi>Methods</hi> among us, in opposing whereof, <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> was these men's Elder Brother. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, take a view of some Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in his said Pamphlet, viz. <hi>One Blow more,</hi> in his own Words.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi> saith, <hi>And you my Brethren also ought to have Preached up God's invisible appearance by his Spirit in our dayes, to be the end of mens Inventions, Imitations and false Doctrines: But instead thereof, you have preached up false Doctrines, and also set
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102665:162"/>
up your own Inventions among the</hi> Quakers <hi>so called,</hi> p. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi>; His charge of <hi>false Doctrines, and mens Inventions,</hi> we utterly deny as slanderous: God's invisible and spiritual Appearance, and the Testimony thereof still lives among us in as high esteem as ever, against false Doctrines and mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions. But herein <hi>J. B.</hi> resembles the rest of the Opposers, in the work of the <hi>false Accuser</hi> of our Brethren.</p>
            <p>Jeffery Bullock. <hi>My Brethren, I fear you are not past the Doctrine of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>nor yet of the Priests and Professors of</hi> England [a false Fear] <hi>There is as great necessity of Preaching up</hi> Salvation <hi>to us</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>by God's invisible Appearance, who is a Spirit, and also his Spirit to be the end of all mens Inventions, Imitations, Traditions,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 6. [True, but misapplied] <hi>Therefore I would have</hi> G. Fox, <hi>and the eleven Elders, who are preaching up false Doctrines, and also setting up their Inventions among the People called</hi> Quakers, <hi>as Rules,</hi> &amp;c. p. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer</hi>; Herein he is a false Accuser still like the rest, and he's far louder in his Charges than in's Proof. False Doctrines and Inventions of men, both of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and elsewhere, we utterly deny.</p>
            <p>J. B. <hi>My Brethren your visible Church-Government
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102665:162"/>
is altogether Antichristian, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that every Member of the Church in God is to be both ruled and governed by the measure of Gods Spirit in them; and it is none of</hi> George Fox<hi>'s, nor yet the eleven Elders that is to be a Rule for the</hi> Quakers <hi>to walk by,</hi> p. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> His charge of <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Inventions</hi> we utterly deny, and testifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst as Antichristian; and he, and the rest of his backsliding Spirit, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of him and his Books, are never able to make his Charge good. However, here its plain that he opposes <hi>visible Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> because of the inward Rule by the measure of God's Spirit, wherein he argues Erroniously, and contrary to the Apostles Doctrine and Primitive Christians Practice: Both the inward Rule, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Order, and due Methods among them, all springing from God's Spirit within, were not to draw them from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on that Spirit, but to shew forth Obedience in Practice and Example to the holy Spirit and pure Religion, and therein to help one another, for which purpose the Holy Ghost made Overseers and Elders, <hi>The Elders that rule well are worthy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that ruleth with Diligence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I left thee in</hi> Creet <hi>to set in order those things that are lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. But there were such Apostates then as despised <hi>Dominion,</hi> and spoke Evil
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102665:163"/>
of <hi>Dignities,</hi> even of those Instruments and Ministers, Helps and Governments, whom the Lord ordained and raised up and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in his Church; and such are these Opposers now in the same Spirit of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position and Contempt.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. J. B. <hi>And she (i. e. the Church) hath no need of your visible Government, because she is the Bride, the Lambs Wife; and she hath no need of the Light of the Moon to shine in her, because the Lord is the Light, and the Lambs Spirit is the Light of the Church that is in him: But your visible Churches make use of the Light of the Moon,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">That's a Whimsie; where proves he that? Or that the Light of the Moon is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian?</note> 
               <hi>that is, your Mens Meetings, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so your Womens Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and the Orders which are set up by them, they are to be Rules for your visible Churches to walk by: For the Women have power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Affairs of your visible Church, as well as your Men; and this Practice of yours is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Antichristian, and so also is your Church-Government, because it is the Invisible man Christ, who orders all things in his Church by his own Spirit.—Those who are Members of the Church in God among you, in time will abhor your Government, because it is Antichristian; For you Elders do look upon
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102665:163"/>
your selves to be Judges, and that you have Power to determine things in matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> &amp;c. p. 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Christ's Government in his Church is both Invisible and Visible, he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns by himself and by his Ministers: all are not come to a ripe Age in him, there are many Children and weak Ones, who have need of helps in Government: Our faithful Mens Meetings and Womens Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings were set up by the Power of Christ Jesus, and in his Light he governs and rules among them by his own Spirit: And faithful, grave and sober Women have power to be Teachers of good things, and to teach the younger Women. Christian-Church-Order and Spiritual Rule were exercised among the Primitive Christians, both Men and Women, who were Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of New <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the free Woman; the Inhabitants of this City are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Order, or Ministers therein. And therefore this Opposers <hi>Blow</hi> and Charge of [<hi>altogether Antichristian</hi>] against our Mens and Womens Meetings, is both Silly, Proofless, Slanderous, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Antichristian, against Christ's Work (and appointment) in Male and Female; and as the Church-Government among us is Christ's Government, both revealed, set up, and ordained by him; none that are
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:102665:164"/>
and continue <hi>true Members</hi> of his Church, will ever abhor that Government, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, slight or despise that promised Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Judgment that he hath given to the Saints to determine matters of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, but only Apostates, false Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and deceitful Workers, and loose Spirits; these will be smiting and accusing the Brethren, despising Dominion, and speaking evil of Dignities; yea, speaking perverse things to draw Disciples after them, crying against outward Rule and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Forms and Order in the Church, whilst they are seeking Mastery, Dominion, Rule and Government to themselves. As for our <hi>visible Church</hi> and <hi>visible Church-Government</hi> (or Order) so much opposed by this Adversary, he talks blindly and ignorantly; for though the Church be Invisible, as to the Spirits of Men, who are Members of it, and Christ's immediate Rule and Government in the Heart be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, yet there is a Visibility both of the true Christian Congregation, and good Order and Rule therein, proceeding from the Spirit of Christ within.</p>
            <p>The People of God and their good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations and Order in Christ, are not all shut up in an Invisibility, being as Epistles to be read and seen of all; and they as a City set upon a Hill, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="319" facs="tcp:102665:164"/>J. B. <hi>You do prefer your selves, and the Church in the first place before God, who is Light— And have set up themselves and their Church as Head, instead of God and Christ,</hi> p. 12. <hi>Their setting up themselves and their Government, and are laying aside the Spirit's Government and Authority,</hi> p. 13. <hi>Those Elders who call themselves</hi> Ministers, <hi>look upon themselves and their Image to be equal in Power and Glory, both with the Father and the Son,</hi> Testimony against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> p. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> These are notoriously false and slanderous; We prefer the living God, and his Son Christ Jesus before all, and do not lay aside the Spirit's Government or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but in humility reverence, and desire ever to live under the same, knowing Self abased, and Images defaced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the Light of Christ Jesus.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. J. B. <hi>If any of those called Teachers intend to speak a few words commonly called Prayer, then the Women and the Men that are set in the Meeting, shall rise up, and the Men will uncover their Heads.—Their Teachers have judged those</hi> Quakers <hi>not to be real Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Church or Body, that have not done it (i. e.</hi> uncovered their Heads) <hi>And herein the</hi> Quakers <hi>in general have given more Homage, Reverence and Respect to the Words or Prayers of another, wherein there was no Life

at all, than they have done to the Word of Life it self in their own Particulars: And this is Anti-christ's work,</hi> p. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> His conclusion is false and slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous herein. We Reverence the Word of Life in our living Prayers, and not Lifeless Words; And why doth he thus judge any Reverent Posture among us in Prayer, as that of Peoples Rising up, and Mens Unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering their Heads in our holy Duty of publick Prayer? This is like <hi>John Perrot's</hi> prejudiced Party. And how foully Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to himself is he in thus unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably judging us for our Reverent Posture or serious Behaviour, which is matter of Conscience to us, when yet he'l not allow any Members or Elders among us to judge or determine matters relating to Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? And cautions us in Christ's words, <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged,</hi> p. 12. Oh, blind harden'd Man! how darest thou thus judge over our Consciences, or falsly accuse us with <hi>leading People from the Power, to worship and reverence the Form more than the Power?</hi> And then most falsly to add, <hi>That this is the work of Antichrist among the</hi> Quakers, p. 17. Here thou hast <hi>slandered,</hi> and shamefully <hi>belyed</hi> the People of God called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and hast shewn thy self not worthy of so much as the Name of a <hi>Quaker.</hi> Thou hast long been a Reproach unto them.</p>

Postscript to his <hi>Antichrist's Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations within,</hi> (viz.) <hi>If any amongst you pretend to be moved by the Spirit to go to Prayer, then both Men and Women, they either stand up or else kneel down, and the Men all pull off their Hats, which own your Form of Prayer; and herein you do both Worship, Reverence and Adore the Form outwardly, and the Words more than you do the Word of Life in your own Particulars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> An erronious Conclusion, and no natural Consequence, either of our stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, kneeling or putting off our Hats in Prayer; for all these may be and are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently and conscientiously performed with Respect (and in a holy Reverence) to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, whom we breathe and pray unto by his own Spirit. Besides, both Kneeling and being Uncovered have been practised among God's People and true Christians in Prayer to him; so that these Postures are not condemnable in themselves. How blind and ignorant therefore is this Gain-sayer in his Opposition? Read <hi>Psal.</hi> 95.6. <hi>O come, let us Worship and Bow down<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us Kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 21.5. <hi>And we Kneeled down on the Shore and prayed</hi>; see also 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4.</p>

            <p>J.

That's because the Enemy is arisen to such a great hight in thee, that thou dost not own the arising of the Seed of God in thee: What Fruit canst thou bring forth to God, if thou dost deny the arising of his Seed in thee? 'Tis evident thy Heart is bad Ground, sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ground and thorny Ground, in which the good Seed hath not taken Root, so as to spring up, and bring forth Fruit unto Perfection; for in the good Ground or honest Heart it takes Root downward, and brings forth Fruit upward. And they that take heed unto the Light of Christ in them, where it shines but as in a dark place, they come to see the Day dawn, and the Day-Star arise in their Hearts: And is not Christ Jesus the bright and Morning Star?

            <p n="8">§. 8. J. B. In his <hi>gross Errors detected, or many of the Doctrines of the leading</hi> Quakers <hi>disowned,</hi> as <hi>coming from an Antichristian Spirit,</hi> p. 1. he saith, <hi>John Webb</hi>'s <hi>Doctrine was, That God's appearance in the Sons and Daughters of men, is to beget and bring forth that innocent Birth and Babe immortal, &amp;c. This Doctrine doth signifie that God's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is to his Son Christ Jesus, and for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting and bringing of him forth in the Sons and Daughters of men; the which Doctrine I do deny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, God's appearance in the Sons and Daughters of men, is not to bring forth a <hi>nocent</hi> Birth, nor a Babe that's <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:102665:170"/>
but an <hi>innocent</hi> Birth, and a Babe <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.</hi> Except a man be Born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: And whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his <hi>Seed</hi> remaineth in him.</p>
            <p>Secondly; This innocent Birth, which God by his Spirit brings forth in the Sons and Daughters of men, who truly believe, relates to them and their souls, as begotten and born of the immortal seed, by the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving word: so that this <hi>Birth</hi> is not Christ Jesus; for he is that incorruptible Seed and Word of Life, which begets, forms and brings forth the Soul of man into his own Nature and Image, and so he renews his own Image in man, that believes in his Power; and so Christ may be said to be formed in us, as in a mysterious and elegant way of speaking: the property and effect being put for the cause; for <hi>Christ</hi> in himself hath all Power in Heaven and Earth given to him, and it hath pleased the Father that all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should dwell in him.</p>
            <p>J. B. <hi>That God's appearance is in and by his Son Christ Jesus to us, and that all are to hear the Son in them, by whom the Father speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them, and that the Son in us is our way to the Father; The which Doctrine I do deny.</hi> His gross Error, p. 1.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Here thou hast denyed sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which is according to Christs own
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102665:170"/>
Doctrine, i. e. <hi>He that seeth me, seeth the Father also:</hi> who <hi>hath shined in our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of his Glory in the face of Christ Jesus: And my Sheep hear my Voice, saith Christ</hi>: And <hi>God hath spoken to us by his Son.</hi> Thy denying God's appearing, and speaking by his Son, and his Son to be our way to the Father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Herein thou hast not only denyed Christ's own Testimony, but the blessed advantage we have by him as MEDIATOR.</p>
            <p>J. B. <hi>Another of their Doctrines is, That the</hi> Quakers <hi>ought so to wait upon God, as that they may feel the Life in them to flow from Vessel to Vessel, whenas they are met together to wait upon God. This was</hi> Charles Marshalls <hi>Wife's Doctrine,</hi> p. 2 ibid.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This is neither false Doctrine nor gross Error, as thou imaginest, but sound Doctrine; <hi>Hannah Marshall</hi> knew better than thy self herein; for they that truly wait upon God, both receive an encrease of Life from him who is the Fountain, and feel Life to flow from Vessel to Vessel; <hi>He that believes as the Scripture saith, out of his Belly shall flow Rivers of living Waters; This spake he of the Spirit, which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve should receive. And the true Believers all drink into One Spirit.</hi> And there is among such a spiritual and effectual Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith and Virtue, in the living
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:102665:171"/>
Communion of the holy Spirit; all which thy dark Imaginations have deprived thee of.</p>
            <p>J. B. <hi>These Doctrines of the</hi> Quakers <hi>are false Doctrines and Antichristian, because that God's Appearance is not by his Son Christ Jesus to us,</hi> p. 3.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou art guilty of Antichristian Doctrine, and Anti-scriptural also, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying God's Appearance to be by his Son Christ Jesus, <hi>The Mediator</hi>; for what God is to us for our Salvation, and what good we receive from him for our Souls, and what we are unto him in our Obedience (as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him) 'tis all <hi>IN</hi> and <hi>Through</hi> our Lord Jesus Christ the <hi>Mediator.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>J. B. <hi>That God, who is a Spirit, should be held in Bondage and Captivity by his Creation, or by the Power of Darkness, is contrary to Right Reason—So that it must needs follow by plain Argument, that not only the Creature, but the Power of Darkness too hath had Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over God—contrary to sound Doctrine, and is Blasphemy,</hi> pag. 5, 6. GROSS ERRORS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This thou hast often unjustly and slanderously repeated upon the <hi>Quakers</hi>; and herein I testifie against thy Abuse, and dare Challenge thee to prove out of any of our Writings, that 'tis the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, <hi>That either God is held in Bondage or Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102665:171"/>
by his Creation, or that the Power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath Dominion over him.</hi> We utterly deny the Assertion and Expressions as Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous; but do say, the holy Spirit is <hi>grieved,</hi> and the Seed of God <hi>burdened</hi> by the Iniquities of the World, which suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in Condescention on Christ's part, and not for want of Power or Dominion over the Devil or Wicked men; for he bruiseth his Head, hath Power to subdue, condemn and punish them, and his own Arm to bring Salvation to him.</p>
            <p>J. B. <hi>Another of their Doctrines, That all are to come to the Son of God, Christ Jesus, whom they say is in them, and that he is the only Way to the Father; which Doctrine I do deny, because it is God who both was and is a Spirit, which hath first appeared in and to the Sons and Daughters of men, after sin, &amp;c.— Therefore every one is to be first turned to God in their own particulars, and NOT to the Son of God,</hi> p 8. Gross Errors.</p>

The Father and the Son are not divided in the work of Regeneration. <hi>I and my Father are one,</hi> saith Christ: <hi>No man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> But 'tis no marvel that thou hast denyed Christ (<hi>the Mediator</hi>) to

               <hi>Answ.</hi> An erronious Inference still, and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102665:174"/>
most blindly reiterated; for if we must be saved by that Life that was in the Son of God, how darest thou deny Salvation to the souls of Mankind by him that so suffered and dyed? seeing we are reconciled by his Death; who dyed and rose again, and Death has no more dominion over him? And hast not thou confessed that we are reconciled by his Death, so we shall be saved by his Life?</p>
            <p>Well, by whose Life? by the Life of the very same Christ of God, who (as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the flesh) was put to Death. And was his Death then no ways conducing to our Salvation? How are we then recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by it? Is Reconciliation no degree of Salvation?

            <p>This is no proof that his Son Jesus Christ was <hi>No Saviour</hi>; for God saves by his Son; God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself; God works by the <hi>Mediator</hi>; and Jesus Christ, who is the <hi>Saviour</hi> and the <hi>Redeemer</hi> is both truly <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man Inseparable.</hi>

to his Soul.</hi> Oh! Antichristian and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptural Doctrine! For though he was put to death only as to his Body, his Soul dyed not with it; for he said, <hi>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit, Luke</hi> 23.46. see <hi>Acts</hi> 7.59. And to the penitent Thief, <hi>To Day shalt thou be with me in Paradise,</hi> Luke 23.43.

And although it be said, <hi>He hath poured out his Soul unto Death:</hi> This concerned the travail of soul, and sorrows of death, which he was under the sence of, when he said, <hi>My Soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death,</hi> Matth. 26.38. whilst yet his <hi>soul</hi> was living and immortal in its own being, praying and making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession unto the Father: For <hi>pouring out the Soul or Heart,</hi> sometimes (in Scripture) imports an earnest supplication to God, and travail in Prayer; <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.4. <hi>I pour out my Soul in me.</hi> And <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.8. <hi>Pour out your Heart before him, God is a Refuge for us.</hi> The <hi>soul</hi> of <hi>Messiah</hi> was poured out in Prayer and Supplication to the Father, whilst in great sorrow and deep suffering for Mankind, even when he bore the Sin of

No, no; the very Souls of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and impenitent workers of Iniquity, shall live in Torment, where the Worm dyeth not, and the Fire is never quenched; Christ's instance of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> doth really intimate the two different states hereafter; see <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22, 23. &amp;c.

            <p>J.

            </p>
            <p>And thy <hi>Denying</hi> to come to a <hi>Sense, and to wait in a Sense in thy self,</hi> and opposing preaching from a sight and sence; as in thy <hi>Antichrists Transformations,</hi> p. 2, 25.</p>
            <p>Thy dark and erronious Doctrine and Preaching in these things the <hi>True Christian Quakers</hi> utterly deny, with many other dark erronious Positions, Whimsies, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and blind Oppositions, Fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods and Abuses, foolish and unlearned Questions in thy Pamphlets here omitted; as also thy Hypocritical Preaching in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <hi>For the good of Souls, For the quickning of Souls, For the raising up of Souls, For the converting of Souls, That Peoples Souls may
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102665:181"/>
partake of the divine Nature, and be lifted up into the Kingdom of God, &amp;c.</hi> Which though this be the best sort of thy Preaching, and in the best words thou hast, yet while thou <hi>denyest</hi> the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludest, <hi>They all dye with the earthly Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> and <hi>so a total end of all:</hi> This thy gross and Atheistical Error is enough to evince thy abominable <hi>Hypocrisie</hi> and <hi>Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giousness</hi> in the best sort of thy Preaching. And therefore give over thy preaching in our Friends Meetings, hold thy Tongue, lay thy hand upon thy Mouth, keep at home, and seriously bethink thy self, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber from whence thou art fallen, and then condemn, retract and call in thy Erroneous and Antichristian Pamphlets. Remember I have herein given thee the safest Counsel, in Love and Friendship to thee, and to thy Immortal Soul, which shall remember me when thou art awakened under the hand of thy Righteous Judge, who is the Judge of all, to whom I can sincerely appeal, and commit my Christian and faithful Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours concerning these <hi>Controversies</hi> and <hi>Differences</hi> with thee and the rest concerned in this Treatise, you being all concerned in one Spirit of <hi>Opposition, Prejudice, Strife</hi> and <hi>Enmity,</hi> though thou hast exceeded the rest in thy Doctrinal part, in presumptuously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting such an Antichristian Confutation
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102665:182"/>
of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrines. And with my solemn Appeal and Supplication I do Conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>OH! Thou Heart-searching God and righteous Iudge of all, unto thee I make my Appeal and Supplication, against this</hi> Jealous, Dividing, Rending Spirit <hi>that hath appeared in Strife and open Contention against thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and faithful Witnesses, and against that good order and society that thou hast been pleased to gatber us into. Thou knowest the integrity of my soul before thee, and that I have waited for thy Counsel how to act and behave my self in these matters, and that I have not sought to exalt my self, nor any Popularity, Party or Interest to my self, but only thy Glory and the good of Souls. Thou knowest, that in the first place my soul hath sought for Peace in the way of Peace, and for a quiet Composure of Differences,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102665:182"/>
occasioned by some</hi> Self-willed <hi>and</hi> Luke-warm Professors of thy Truth, <hi>whilst there was any hope or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability thereof, before the opposite Party became open Adversaries. And O Lord thou knowest I am not alone in this concern, many others of thy faithful servants have traveled in the same</hi> Christian Spirit <hi>with me, for peace and quietness, and for a quiet end of</hi> Differences <hi>in</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> Righteousness: <hi>But thine and our Adversaries have rewarded us evil for good, and to me hatred for my love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O Lord, behold how true love and tenderness is rejected by thy Adversaries, and how thy holy spirit is offended! Behold and judge the bitterness of their spirits; Their</hi> Rancor <hi>and</hi> Fury, <hi>their</hi> Words of Hatred, Reviling <hi>and</hi> Slander <hi>against thy faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Witnesses; Their</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard <hi>to the</hi> Honour <hi>and</hi> Reputation <hi>of thy</hi> Truth, <hi>thy</hi> Name <hi>and</hi> People;
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:102665:183"/>
               <hi>Their working against the</hi> Glory <hi>and</hi> Honour <hi>of thy</hi> excellent Name <hi>among us; Their</hi> crucifying thy Son afresh to themselves, and putting him to open shame and reproach in the Eyes of thy open Enemies and Persecutors of thy People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh! Lord, Lord, look down, behold and judge for these things, show thy Power in putting an end as openly to these</hi> Controversies, <hi>as they are openly forced out into the World by</hi> Apostates <hi>and</hi> Adversaries <hi>of thy</hi> Truth <hi>and</hi> People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thou knowest, O Lord, that though thou hast endued me with a</hi> Christian Spirit, <hi>and with</hi> Faith, Patience <hi>and</hi> Rejoycing <hi>under all my</hi> Sufferings <hi>and</hi> Tribulations <hi>for thy Name sake, and enabled me patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to undergo the open</hi> Revilings <hi>and</hi> Infamies <hi>cast upon me, both by open, profest (and secret) Enemies; in all which I daily praise thy Name for thy Goodness. Yet thou hast also endued me with the</hi> Spirit of
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:102665:183"/>
Righteous Judgment, Understanding <hi>and</hi> Zeal <hi>for the Glory of thy holy</hi> Name <hi>and</hi> Truth, <hi>and hast raised me up in defence of thy Gospel, to vindicate thy Truth and innocent People, who are Lovers of Peace and Union in thy Son Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And now, O Lord, I humbly pray thee, preserve thy Lambs and tender Babes, and open the Eyes and unvail the Understandings of all whom the Enemy has deceived and prejudiced, who are mistaken in their Iudgments, and not guilty of willful Opposition and Hatred; That they that have not sinned out their day nor become judicially har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, may yet find a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Mercy, in returning to thee with Humility, true Contrition and Brokenness of Heart, that thou maiest heal their Backslidings, and love them freely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>O my God! in these my Labours and Endeavours, as I have eyed

thee and thy Counsel, and thou hast been with me, for which I praise thy Name.

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>FIrst, Note, That where in pag. 158. of this Treatise, mention is made <hi>That</hi> G. F<hi>'s intention and sence is by another hand spoken to.</hi> That and much more is yet reserved in Manuscript against <hi>W. R</hi>'s abusive Books.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That whereas in pag. 205. it is said, <hi>It being now above six Weeks since the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was left at</hi> Ely, <hi>&amp;c. and yet no Answer.</hi>— It is now above three Moneths since, and yet no Answer received from <hi>F. B.</hi> being now (at the Printing hereof) towards the latter end of the 11th Moneth, 1682.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That this Treatise has been long in the Printer's hands, and not hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Press, because of these Additions in the three last Chapters, to <hi>Francis Bugg, Thomas Crisp, John Pennyman</hi> and <hi>Jeffery Bullock</hi>; for the Answer to <hi>William Rogers</hi>'s 7<hi>th part of his Christian-Quaker,</hi> was writ in a short time after it was out.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="tcp:102665:185"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is some question whether two or three of the Names in pag. 250. be right, i. e. <hi>Averset, Snazdale</hi> and <hi>Tysoeth,</hi> by reason of their Names being badly writ in the Certificate sent up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Note, That where in the Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script, after the Letter to <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> pag. 253, 4. and in his Book also, p. 52. he gives account of a Minister thus, viz. <hi>That in the Quarterly-Meeting Book at</hi> Hadenham, <hi>they shall find a Record, wherein he is recorded out of the Vnity, for not taking his Wife accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Order of Friends,</hi> i. e. <hi>not publishing his Intention before the Womens Meetings.</hi> Which Account is excepted against upon Friends positively giving a contrary one to me.</p>
            <p>Let it be farther remarked, that <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s pretended Proof appears not from Evidence of the Fact, but is his consequence drawn from the Records. But first, his Consequence appears not only fallacious, but false in Fact, in his restraining the Order of Friends only to the Womens Meetings, which is not consequent to the Record of the Quarterly Meeting, dated, the first of the 10th Moneth, 1675. and cited by <hi>F. B.</hi> (p. 61.) for Proof; for the extent of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:102665:185"/>
that Record is, <hi>For the consent of Friends at two Mens Meetings and two Womens Meetings, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Neither can his Account be true, if there was not then a Womans Meeting established in that part of the County, but that the complaint of the Monethly Meeting was, <hi>That the Person concerned did not publish his Intention above once to the Mens Meeting, and refused to bring the Woman to any Meeting at all, before the time of their Marriage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi>
Since the said Exception was writ, I have met with a Certificate under the Hands of several Persons of Credit, <hi>i. e. Phillip Taylor, William Brasier, John Prime,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Baker,</hi> who do confirm the matter excepted against <hi>Francis Fugg</hi>'s said Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; whereby they declare it to be his false Insinuation, <q>and a manifest misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting of Friends in those parts, and a malicious Falshood. For they affirm, That there was <hi>no Womens Meetings</hi> established in that part of the County where it fell in course for the said Person to publish his Intention of Marriage; and that because he refused to bring the Woman to any Meeting at all (to manifest her consent and intention of Marriage with him) And his proposing it but once to the Mens Meeting,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:102665:186"/>
and that in her absence, before he took her to Wife.</q>
This they looked on as an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Proceedure and Innovation, and no safe President or Example. For which cause, together with his refusal to give the Monethly Meeting satisfaction for the Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity (as desired) on complaint thereof to the Quarterly Meeting, a Record was made, according to their Consciences and Care, <hi>That they had not Vnity with him in this his</hi> SO <hi>doing</hi> (as 'tis cited by <hi>Fr. Bugg</hi> himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let it be noted, That <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> is guilty of notorious Falshood and malicious Slander, where he pretends to discover <hi>That hypocritical and two-faced Practice of pleading to the Magistrates for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Conscience, and at the same time using and exercising all Force, Rule and Dominion they are capable to inflict upon their dissenting Brethren, who cannot fall down and cry</hi> Hosanna <hi>to every Likeness, &amp;c.</hi> And the Reason he suggests is, <hi>Lest the Ruling Party should be encouraged to introduce a numberless Number of needless Ceremonies, till at length</hi> Rome <hi>may, if possible, be outdone,</hi> pag. 115, 116. 2d part. Thus like a false informing <hi>Judas</hi> he has belched out his Lying Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:102665:186"/>
tending to incense the Magistrate against us. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>st,</hi> In the first part I take his Charge [<hi>Hypocritical</hi>] to intend our Applications to the Magistrates for Liberty from Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: and then 'tis malicious, false and scandalous, and therein he has acted the part of a base Informer against us, for which God (who knows our sincerity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency in our pleading to the Magistrate on this account) will certainly rebuke his lying malicious Spirit.</p>
            <p>In the second part, I take his Charge [<hi>Of using all Force, Rule and Dominion, &amp;c. upon dissenting Brethren for not falling down to every Likeness</hi>] to intend that Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Discipline and Order, and those Ministers concerned therein which he opposeth among the People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> And then he hath herein most wickedly and falsly informed the Magistrates, 1<hi>st,</hi> To render our Applications for Liberty of Conscience of no credit with them, but Hypocritical: 2<hi>dly,</hi> To render us guilty of that which we are pleading against, <hi>i. e. Exercising Force upon our Brethrens Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and that <hi>for not falling down to every Likeness.</hi> Oh, horrid Abuse and Slander! And what lamentable Blindness and gross
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:102665:187"/>
Absurdity is this Adversary fallen into! like as if he should thus argue, <hi>viz.</hi> You plead to the Magistrate for Liberty of Conscience in the free exercise of Religion, from Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, Corporal and Pecuniary Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on that score. Therefore you are Hypocritical, Two-faced and Inconsistent in your Practice, whilst you exercise a Church Authority, by giving true Spiritual Judgment, Admonition or Censures upon any that dissent or divide from you, or cause Divisions or Offences: Such are the Consequences of his before-cited Charge, considering that he has not proved our Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>VNJVST,</hi> or Advice and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition <hi>ERRONEOVS</hi> or <hi>VNCHRISTIAN</hi> in any of those things opposed by him; or our Paper, which he makes his great Proof against us, and Scornfully calls, <hi>A Grant and Confirmation by a general Council held at</hi> London, Anno 1675. pag. 41. For which he falsly accuseth us of <hi>INNOVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS, IMPOSITIONS, APOSTACIES, NEW-STAMPED GOVERNMENT, ARBITRARY RVLE, &amp;c.</hi> comparing us to the <hi>POPES COVNCIL.</hi> (pag. 42, 46, &amp;c.) And then he might as well say, 'Tis a great infringement of Liberty of Conscience for a Christian Society to Reprove, Judge or Censure disorderly
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:102665:187"/>
Walkers under the same Profession. And by the same absurd way of Arguing and shallow Opposition he may as well assume a Power to stop the Mouthes of all Gospel Ministers for exercising their Consciences in that divine Authority that Christ hath given them, To renounce the hidden things of Dishonesty, and to Exhort, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke, Reprove, Admonish, Command, &amp;c. according to their Commission, both in the primitive Times and our Day.</p>
            <p>Thus we may justly conclude, that a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, defiled, immoral Conscience would have its unchristian Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Some Errors have escaped the Press, in this Treatise, both in Points, Letters and Words, the most material whereof are here noted, which I desire the ingenuous Reader accordingly to Correct; (the sense will shew the rest) wherein I do as I would be done to; for I examine the Errata's, even of my Adversaries Books, as they are noted, before I answer the Matter.</p>
