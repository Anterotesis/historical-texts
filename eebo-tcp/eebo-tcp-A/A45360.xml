            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere are very few Books of what quality ſoever, though it be but an ordinary Pamphlet that paſſes the Preſs, without ſome fair beſpeaking the Reader; wherefore in conformity to the Cuſtome, I am to advertiſe Thee that the Deſign of theſe following Papers is to ſhew the excellency of the frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Goſpel, or that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Method</hi> by which God brings Men to Heaven by his Son <hi>Jeſus
<pb facs="tcp:49779:3"/>
Chriſt;</hi> which very thing to the conſidering and judicious, is a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſufficient of the Divinity of it, there being ſuch abundant evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the choiceſt Attributes of the Deity, his Goodneſs, Wiſdome and Power in the contexture of it. For when I conſider (who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the <hi>Evangelical Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> namely, the Bleſſed Son of God, that Eternal <hi>Logos,</hi> who has expreſſed ſuch an Infinite Wiſdome in the frame of Heaven and Earth, I cannot but think, that what is there ſo largely diffuſed and ſpread abroad, is, as it were, ſumm'd up and contracted into a living Image, and beautiful Repreſentation in the frame of the Goſpel. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Introduction of the Chriſtian Religion, and the regenerating the World by it, being ſet off in the Scriptures by the glorious Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of <hi>Creation,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus</hi> the Bleſſed Author and Finiſher of it,
<pb facs="tcp:49779:3"/>
ſtiling himſelf <hi>the beginning of the Creation of God, i. e.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3.14.</note> of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Diſpenſation, the ſpirit of God does clearly intimate to us, that the Goodneſs, Wiſdome and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Divinity, are more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently and tranſcendently diſplayed in the Recovery of Mankind by the Goſpel, than in their first Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. So that if it be a Piece of our Duty (as certainly it is) to think the moſt honourably and magnificent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the works of God's hands, it were a ſinful debaſing that ſacred Project and Contrivance, which was laid before the Foundation of the World, to let our conceptions of it dwindle into ſome poor and trifling Deſign, and make ſuch a pitiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of it, as ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy that Eternal Wiſdome, the Creatreſs of all things, to intereſs it ſelf withal. For nothing is more ſure, than that the Goſpel is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, as may moſt of all do honour
<pb facs="tcp:49779:4"/>
to God, and promote the welfare and happineſs of Mankind. And upon this Ground and Foundation, I have built the following Diſcourſe, which whoever will take the pains to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe, I deſire him to lay aſide his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and not to charge every thing that he ſhall find diſagreeing with his preſent ſentiments and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, with the opprobrious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious term of Hereſie: For by this means, it comes to paſs, that Religion is made only to ſerve an Intereſt, and wait upon a Faction, and the grand Intereſt of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is indeed hugely diſſerved by ſuch oblique Arts and unwarranta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inſinuations. It ſhews Men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be affected with a mighty Zeal, but it is that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that bitter zeal, which the Apostle tells us, is an effect of that <hi>wiſdome that deſcends not from above,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3.14, 15.</note> but is <hi>earthly, ſenſual, deviliſh.</hi> But I am very incurious of the cenſures
<pb facs="tcp:49779:4"/>
of angry and peeviſh Men, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the ſenſe of having endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to do honour to God, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting in Men right Apprehenſions of his Nature, and according to my mean Ability, promoted the Offices and Duties of a Virtuous life, by ſhewing the neceſſity of them, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our everlaſting Happineſs. And with this Advertiſement, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Reader to the Diſcourſe it ſelf. </p>

            <head>THE SACRED METHOD OF <hi>Saving Humane Souls</hi> BY JESUS CHRIST.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Chriſtian Religion is frequently called by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> a Myſtery, wherein it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he might allude to the Myſterious Rites of the Gentile Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, as the <hi>Eleuſynia,</hi> or ſome ſuch ſecret and myſterious Actions of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> Religion. And in oppoſition to theſe, the Apoſtle declares to the World a higher Myſtery, and teaches us that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49779:6"/>
Chriſtianity in all reſpects exceeds the moſt ſacred and venerable Actions of Paganiſme. For although the Heathen <hi>Myſtagogi</hi> pretended a high and noble deſign, and boaſted the end of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Myſteries to be the leading and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the <hi>Initiati</hi> to the Preſence and Fruition of the worſhipped Deity, or in plainer terms, the everlaſting Bleſſedneſs of Mens Immortal Souls (the ſole privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and prerogative of the Chriſtian Myſtery, the Goſpel of the Son of God) yet they failed infinitely in the way and means of accompliſhing this ſo excellent a purpoſe, the whole procedure being bottom'd upon an uncertain Foundation and doubtful evidence, and no better than an Hiſtrionical Repreſentation brought on by thoſe deluſive Spirits, who affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Divine Honour, whereby inſtead of perfecting and bettering, they really vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated and debauched the minds of Men, and made their moſt recondite and ſacred Rites little better than practices of Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and Uncleanneſs. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Chriſtian Oeconomy is juſtly ſtiled by the Apoſtle a <hi>Myſtery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> whoſe end is not only the higheſt perfection of Humane Souls, but every
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49779:6"/>
where in all its parts breathes the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt holineſs and purity of Body and Soul, as the only way to attain an Immortal Bleſſedneſs and Felicity.</p>
            <p>By this Myſtery then of the Goſpel, we are not to underſtand a dark and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate Riddle, contrived only to amuze and dazle the minds of Men, and which when explicated and unfolded, has no greater likelihood of benefiting the knower, than <hi>Samſon</hi>'s Riddle of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Philiſtines:</hi> but we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by it a ſacred and recondite Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ſaving Humane Souls, that is, of purifying their minds to ſuch degrees and meaſures, as may render them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of an entrance into the higheſt Heavens.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs,</hi> i. e. the Way and Method of ſaving Mankind by the Goſpel, is indeed wonderful and admirable. For the ſacred plot of the Goſpel was not then framed or laid, when it was promulgated and manifeſted to the World, but lay hid in the boſome of an Infinite Underſtanding,<note place="margin">Col. 1.26.</note> 
               <hi>from ages and generations,</hi> and is expreſly called by the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>the myſterious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condite wiſdome of God, which he ordained
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49779:7"/>
before the World,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.7.</note> whoſe projection and contrivance was from the out-goings of Eternity. So that in this Affair of the Goſpel, we are not to look for any thing mean, low and ſhallow, but for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which may be worthy of God, an <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a deſign which may evidently and clearly diſplay the higheſt Perfections of God its Author.</p>
            <p>For the better illuſtration of which, we may conſider, that in the contrivance, conduct and management of the Goſpel, there is a clear and manifeſt demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Infinite Goodneſs, Wiſdome and Power of God.</p>
            <p n="1">I. A manifeſtation of Infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>The Heavens and the Earth, and all the capacities of Immenſe ſpace, declare an Infinite Goodneſs, but the cleareſt and moſt ſenſible demonſtration of it, is in this <hi>Myſtery of the Goſpel,</hi> wherein that boundleſs love which has diſperſed it ſelf through all the orders and degrees of life, ſhines forth with a full and perfect luſtre and glory. Here it is that we behold that Love, which liberally fills and ſuſtains all things, more powerfully exerting its Bleſſed Nature, in cement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49779:7"/>
the Ruines, and rearing up the Foundations of a new World; for as in the firſt Creation, an Eternal and Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical love diffuſed it ſelf in the Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of whatever was made, ſo the ſame Goodneſs moves, as it were, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time in the ſtupendious renovation of lapſed Souls, in the Evangelical My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and Oeconomy.</p>
            <p>Which Truth may yet receive a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence by theſe Gradations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The more perfect any life is, the more it deſires to diffuſe and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it ſelf. <hi>God is love,</hi> ſays St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 4.8.</note> and he is the higheſt and moſt perfect life; now love is the moſt diffuſive and communicative Principle in all the World, and the firmer any being is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in love, the nearer approaches it makes to that moſt excellent life and nature of God, whoſe beneficence and kindneſs the whole Creation taſtes of Self-love, or the love of the Carkaſs, the Bodily life reſtrains and contracts the free Exertions of the Mind,<note place="margin">

to that Univerſal and Intellectual love, which is the great Law of Rational Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by which our Minds are made wide as the World, and carried forth in Benignity and Kindneſs to all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as they more or leſs partake of the Divine Life and Nature. God is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs, and all the Creatures are but the iſſues and emanations of his exuberant Fecundity and Life, and do more intimately depend upon him, than Faculties and Actions upon the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from whence they flow. It was not neceſſity or need, nor any greedy and thirſty deſire of receiving praiſe and glory from them, that was the cauſe of the production of Men and Angels, but only the Fulneſs of God's own Goodneſs, which alone moved him to that chearful Approbation of the Works of his Hands, when he ſaw his own life diffuſed in ſuch variety of Beings. And if we will do honour to God, and ſpeak according to our own faculties, we may add life to this Demonſtration, from the inward ſenſe and experience of every good Man, who never finds a more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy and ſatisfaction of ſpirit, than when he is carried out in deſires, and

aſpirations of Benignity and Kindneſs towards the whole Creation. Nor does he look upon this, as any Argument of Righteouſneſs, that he is at any time, in a more happy ſtate and condition than others, for he could be willing that all the World were as happy as himſelf, did he not ſee ſtrong and evident Reaſons in the wiſe Adminiſtration of Providence, why it ſhould not be ſo. Something of this excellent Temper, we find in thoſe Paſſionate Eruptions of Spirit, record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Scriptures of Holy men, who ſeem to be altogether transformed into love: <hi>Blot me out of thy Book,</hi> (ſays <hi>Moſes:</hi>) and <hi>I could be content to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed from Christ</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul) for my Brethrens ſake:</hi> Nay, I am verily perſwaded, that he who is once through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized into this ſpirit of Univerſal love, would be contented to be eternally ſeparated from the Preſence of God, ſo that he might be without ſin, if by that means the whole Intellectual Creation might be made happy. Now if we can reaſon any thing of God from thoſe Perfections we find in our ſelves, we muſt needs conclude the higheſt and moſt perfect life to be moſt diffuſive

and communicative of it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Goodneſs is ſo much the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, as the Objects are more noble, about which it is converſant. All things feel the effects of Divine Goodneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their different Meaſures and Proportions, and by how much the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional life hath more objective reality than the ſenſitive, by ſo much are the Emanations of Goodneſs of more worth and excellency communicated to the one, than thoſe diffuſed upon the other. As a Man is a more noble Creature than a Brute, ſo is the Goodneſs concerned with him, higher and of greater value, than that exerciſed upon a Beaſt. God is the Father of Spirits, and for that very Reaſon will not be implacable and irreconcileable to his own dear off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, but though he chaſtiſe and ſcourge them for their bold and audacious revolt from his bleſſed Nature, yet will not caſt off for ever, but in his ſoreſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections remembers mercy. Hence is that Prophetical Speech of the end of Chriſt's Death, that it ſhould be for the gathering together the <hi>ſcattered Sons of God:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 11.52.</note> though the Souls of Men had vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily forſaken God, and travelled
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49779:9"/>
into a ſtrange Land, though their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities had ſcattered them into far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant places from their own Home, yet an everlaſting Goodneſs followed them ſtill, and carefully ſought the Reduction of thoſe diſobedient Sons of God, who had divided and ſeparated themſelves from him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By how much the more fatal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate and univerſal the evil is, by ſo much the more glorious is the Goodneſs imployed in the recovery of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from it. Sin and wickedneſs is the miſery, not of a part only, but of the whole Race of Mankind; and this their Degeneracy became ſo fatal, that it brought Darkneſs and Death it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all their better Faculties, and placed them in an utter Incapacity for ever of recovering themſelves by their own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary power and effort, into that ſtate of immortality and life, which ſin had deprived them of. — <hi>Death paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all men,</hi> (ſays St. <hi>Paul) for that</hi> [or foraſmuch as] <hi>all have ſinned.</hi> So that all Mankind, by their fall from God, were under the Reign, Dominion and Power of ſin and death, and out of this thraldome and captivity, no Man could
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49779:10"/>
extricate and deliver himſelf, whereby their condition became very deplorable and deſperate. But Divine Goodneſs, that it might ſhew it ſelf more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly and gloriouſly to the World, has brought on a more chearful ſcene of things under the Goſpel, reſcuing Men from the Power of ſin and death, and delivering them from the Tyranny of the Devil, through the meritorious Death and Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, who by his Glorious Reſurrection hath fully declared himſelf a Powerful Conqueror of all his Enemies, aſſuring Mankind of their re-enjoyment of Immortality, and redeeming them from their Captivity under the Empire of Sin and Death, and tranſlating them into the peaceful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Life and Righteouſneſs. Now as the deſperateneſs of the Diſeaſe mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the skill of the Phyſician, ſo the fatal and univerſal Degeneracy of the Sons of Men, commends the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love of God in their Recovery and Redemption. Greater love than this can no Man ſhow, than to lay down his Life for his Friend, but herein has God commended his love to us, in that while we were Enemies to God and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49779:10"/>
and ſtrangers to his life, Chriſt dyed for us. Such is that Teſtimony and Witneſs, which our Saviour bears to Divine Love and Goodneſs; every word of which is ſtrangely emphatical:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note>

               <hi>his only Son from him.</hi>] The whole Goſpel is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Contrivance of Infinite Love and Goodneſs; a palpable Pledge and Aſſurance of which, was, the ſending of Jeſus Chriſt from Heaven: <hi>He that spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not his own Son,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle; as if he had ſaid, The delivering up of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be an Expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Sacrifice for the ſins of Men, is ſo high a Demonſtration of Infinite Love, that it begets in us a confident Aſſurance and full Perſwaſion, that the ſame good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will not fail of beſtowing upon us, whatever may poſſibly contribute to our everlaſting Happineſs, as far as our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of.</p>
            <p>The ſumme of all is this, that to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodneſs we owe not only the Production, but the continual Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Beings, not only the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from a certain Miſery, and a juſt and deſerved Puniſhment, but the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us into grace and favour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſting us with a Happineſs much bigger than our hopes and expectations, even the Eternal enjoyment of Himſelf in Heaven. And that this ſhould be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49779:11"/>
wrought and effected by Jeſus Chriſt, the only begotten Son of God, who left the Sacred Manſions of Heaven, and veiled his Glory under a clould of Fleſh and Blood, and while he lived upon Earth, endured the contradictions of ſinners, the bitter reproaches of vile and ungodly Men, and at laſt ſuffered an Ignominious and accurſed Death upon the Croſs, What is it but an everlaſting Monument of Divine Goodneſs? ſuch a high Demonſtration of Infinite Love, as may well make us cry out with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and amazement, <hi>Behold what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us!</hi>

of that vain Philoſophy they had addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves to; yet to thoſe who were docible, tractable and obedient, there appeared an Infinite Wiſdome, and an Eternal Underſtanding: they could not look into it, but they beheld (as the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>the myſterious and recondite wiſdome of God,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. In finding out a way, whereby God might demonſtrate, both his juſt

and implacable hatred of ſin, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberant Love and Goodneſs in ſaving Men. Sin is no part of God's Creation, nor any thing of the true Nature of the Soul, but an extraneous and adventitious Being, brought firſt into the World by the Devil, the great Enemy of Mankind. It is the Deſtruction and Ruine of the Workmanſhip of God's own hands, and being ſo infinitely contrary to his Sacred Life and Nature, it is no wonder, if he bear an irreconcileable hatred againſt it, and ſeek by all means, the driving it quite out of the World. But although God, by reaſon of the Infinite Purity and Holineſs of his Nature, could not look with any favourable eye upon ſin, yet his Almighty Love pitied his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,<note place="margin">Iſai. 63.15.</note> and <hi>his bowels yerned over them,</hi> being, as it were, grieved and troubled at the heart, that they ſhould be miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ever.

And this he

hath done, by ſending his own Son into the World, to become an Expiatory Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the ſins of all Mankind. For ſhould God have caſt Men off for ever, and thrown them into Hell, though he had ſtill been Juſt and Righteous in his Actions, and declared but a high diſlike of that, which his Eſſential Holineſs could never patronize or countenance, yet his Goodneſs and Love had not ſo conſpicuouſly and gloriouſly appeared.<note n="*" place="margin">Sine hoc holocauſto po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat Deus tantum condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe peccatum; ſed faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litas veniae laxaret habenas peccatis effrenibus quae eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Chriſti vix cohibent paſſiones, quae vix ſcelera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos animos à voluptatum faece avellunt.

            <p>Behold therefore, and wonder at the Ineffable Goodneſs, and Tranſcendent love of God! Could not Man redeem his Brother, and give unto God a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for him? No ſurely, for that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, that is preſented and offered up to God, muſt be without ſpot and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh; but when the Lord looked down from Heaven, upon the Children of Men, he beheld them all gone aſide, and become filthy, ſo that there was not one that did good, no not one. But if this might not be, yet, could not God have declared his will to us by an Angel, by a Voice from Heaven, or by uniting himſelf to the Angelical Nature? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he might, but none of theſe ways could have been with ſuch endearing circumſtances, with ſuch ſenſible Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of dear Compaſſion and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as enraviſh ingenuous Minds into ſutable Returns and expreſſions of love. Jeſus Chriſt therefore, the Delights of his Father, the Brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image and character of his Perſon, took fleſh and dwelt among us.

The endearing love of Friends could never give any greater evidence of it ſelf, than that they lay down their lives one for another: but ſuch was the tranſcendent love of Jeſus, that he dyed for Rebels, for Apoſtates from that ſacred life of God, to which alone the Soveraign Command and Rule both of Heaven and Earth, does of right belong.

in his Eternal Wiſdome, foreſaw the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed Diſpoſition of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, who, as they had been heretofore thirſty after the blood of the Prophets and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Men, ſo now would never leave, till they had ſatiated their Revenge, in the Blood of his only begotten Son, yet he delivers him up into their hands: for, ſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that <hi>they had taken, and by wicked hands crucified and ſlain [<gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1. Firſt, I ſay, that the Commands of the Goſpel be poſſible: For it were the moſt unreaſonable and Tyrannical thing in the World, to exact that of another, which we know he is in no Poſſibility of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49779:17"/>
performing; and therefore, being a thing ſo abhorrent and repugnant to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon and equity of Mankind, it is at no hand to be attributed to God, whoſe very Nature is the moſt perfect and living Law of Juſtice. Wherefore, the Goſpel being given to be the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of all Mankind, and for no other end, but their everlaſting Benefit and Bleſſedneſs, we cannot but imagine all the duties and commands required of them, to be poſſible to be done; for otherwiſe it would be ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to their advantage, that it would be but an Exprobration of their miſery, and a Tyrannical and Arbitrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſultation over their calamitous condition. Nay, we are aſſured, that the laws of Righteouſneſs required of us by the Goſpel, are not only poſſible, but gracious and eaſie, and that from the mouth of the Bleſſed Author and giver of them; <hi>My yoke</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is eaſie,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.28</note> 
               <hi>and my burden is light:</hi> and the beloved Apoſtle has left it upon Record, that <hi>the commands of God are not grievous,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note> they are not inſupportable burdens, too heavy for the nature of Man to bear, nor are they fetters and ſhackles of Iron,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49779:18"/>
contrived only to enſnare and make the Creation miſerable, but ſuch gracious Precepts and Conſtitutions, as are in themſelves immutably good, and ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely agreeable to the true and proper, that is, the Intellectual Nature of Man, that he can no ſooner underſtand his own happineſs, but he would chuſe them, if they had never been commanded. The Wiſdome of God never intereſſes it ſelf in unprofitable things, which ſurely this muſt have been, if the Obſervance and Practice of the Injunctions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel had been in it ſelf impoſſible. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſuppoſing ſuch intolerable and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable things impoſed upon the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Mankind, it would ſubvert all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rewards and puniſhments. As for Rewards, there could be no ſuch thing, for Rewards are only upon the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Duty, and there can be no duty, where the commands are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: Nor can there be any equitable exaction of Puniſhment, becauſe the Law it ſelf is not feaſible and practicable, and ſo the tranſgreſſion becomes neceſſary and inevitable, and no more in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Men to help, than to hinder their being born into the World. Wherefore,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49779:18"/>
upon the whole matter, unleſs the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel contain only ſuch things as are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, it is certain, no man can be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for them, unleſs we will ſuppoſe God ſuch an Arbitrarious Being, as acts by no other Law, than that of his own Will and Authority, which is all one, as for a Man to think to get himſelf a name of Power and Soveraignty, by going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout all day, and treading upon a few poor Worms. And certainly it is all one to have no notion and apprehenſion of God at all, and to think ſo meanly of him, and ſo much below the excellency and dignity of his Bleſſed Nature and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erfections.</p>
            <p>But here it will be objected, that if the commands of the Goſpel be not only poſſible, but eaſie and gracious, how comes it then, that Men are not preſently made good, and all the World become true Chriſtians?</p>
            <p>To this, I have theſe things to reply. 1. That God forces none to be good, but having made us Rational Creatures, he has endued us with a free Principle. And without this, there would be no ſuch thing as Moral Goodneſs upon Earth; for that which a man is compelled and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49779:19"/>
forced to, by the irreſiſtible Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an exterior Principle, is neither good nor evil in reference to him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was not a true exertion of his will, but an act of ſomething without him. And therefore ſhould God irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtibly bend and incline the wills of Men to the Laws and Practice of Vertue, it would take away the diſtinction of good and evil, and Men would be what they are, by a fatal neceſſity, and not by choice. Moreover, ſhould God forcib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make Men good, it would rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, than recover the Nature of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and make them more imperfect Creatures, than they are already. It is the glory of our faith, that being tryed, it be found unto praiſe and honour; but what praiſe can be due to that, which is performed by the violent conſtraint of an uncontroulable Power?
<q type="marginal_quotes">There would be little reaſon for the Scripture (ſays a worthy Prelate) ſo much to magnify the grace of faith,<note place="margin">Princ. of Nat. Rel. lib. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> as being ſo great a Vertue, and ſo acceptable to God, if every one were neceſſitated to it, whether he would or no.</q>
2. True Religion has a great diſagreement with our preſent ſinful Natures. Chriſtianity
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49779:19"/>
came into the World to curb our extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant deſires, to reſtrain the ſinful and exorbitant affections of the Animal life, and to draw off our minds from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and inchanting Beauties of ſenſe, to the living and Immortal forms of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and truth. And it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if it be accounted troubleſome and uneaſie to a carnal mind, when its whole deſign is to let out the corrupt life and blood of the old man, and to renew men into that faultleſs nature, ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had deſtroyed. Religion is not ſuch a formidable and difficult thing, ſuch an inſuperable task in it ſelf, but becauſe 'tis an affliction to our natural life, to do vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to our luſts and bodily Paſſions, therefore ſenſual and hypocritical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons judge it to be hard, troubleſome and uneaſie. But 3dly, Men generally diſtempered as they are, have no mind to ſet upon Religion in good earneſt. They are for the moſt part in love with ſin, and Vice is become cuſtomary and natural, and becauſe 'tis ſome trouble to root out and extirpate an habitual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, therefore they fairly lay Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by, as a thing too auſtere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant. So that there is not ſo much
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49779:20"/>
difficulty in Religion, as in bringing men to entertain firm purpoſes and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of embracing it, that is, of better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their lives by it. Were but Men ſincere in their endeavours after holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the participation of the nature of God, the pretended roughneſs and aſperity of Religion would quickly wear off, and they would ſee, that <hi>its ways are ways of pleaſantneſs, and all its paths peace.</hi> By which it appears, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the objections of our ſenſual and animal life, that it is poſſible, nay eaſie for us to become ſincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and that the commands of God are ſo far from being Tyrannical and grievous, that they are the moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Intellectual and Rational Natures.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is neceſſary that Man be endued with a ſufficient Power. For though the conditions of ſalvation be in themſelves poſſible, yet if we be not put into a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and endued with power from on high, ſufficient for the performance of them, we are never the better. Though the walking of a Mile be a thing poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and feaſible, yet it is impoſſible for him that has loſt the uſe of his Legs. If
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49779:20"/>
Chriſt, when he cured the Impotent and Lame in the Goſpel, by bidding them, <hi>Riſe up and walk,</hi> had not at the ſame time confirmed and ſtrengthned their feeble Limbs, his command had been utterly ineffectual. So although we, through our own fault, are fallen into a ſtate of ſin and miſery, weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, yet if God intend to better our condition, and to recover us to our former life and health, he muſt confer upon us ſuch a Power, as may make his Deſign effectual. It is confeſſed, that all Mankind have utterly diſabled themſelves for the attainment of everlaſting Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by their own naked and ſolitary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours; but God, out of his free goodneſs and love, making a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with the World, and propounding certain terms and conditions, upon which they may again be made happy, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together repugnant with his Infinite Wiſdome and Juſtice to require of Men the performance of theſe Conditions, without enduing them with a ſufficient ſtrength for that purpoſe. Should God offer life and ſalvation upon the terms of the Goſpel, and yet never endue us with an ability to embrace and accept
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49779:21"/>
of them, it would not be a deſign wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, nor agreeable with thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious profeſſions and Deſires of our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Happineſs.</p>
            <p>For the fuller Illuſtration of this, we muſt know, that God hath always decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his delight in the Felicity, and his averſation of the miſery and deſtruction of his Creatures, and leſt we ſhould queſtion the reality of this his love, he has confirmed it with an Oath: <hi>As I live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezek. 33.11.</note> 
               <hi>ſaith the Lord God, I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> And this fervent deſire of the good and welfare of the World, moved him to enter into a Covenant with them in Chriſt Jeſus. Now, as in all mutual compacts, and ſtipulations between Parties, there are terms and conditions on both ſides, and each Party obliges himſelf to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſomething: So in this great Indenture or Covenant, which God has made with the World, he is graciouſly pleaſed to oblige himſelf to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for us, and we are likewiſe tyed to the obſervation of certain Articles and conditions required on our part. And this notion of the Goſpel ſeems to be intimated by the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.

            <p n="1">1. That it is neceſſary that God ſhould
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49779:22"/>
impower all Men to whom the Goſpel is preached, with a ſufficient ability to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form what is required in it, that he may manifeſt his Intentions of ſaving all the World to be real. The Apoſtle tells us, that <hi>God is the Saviour of all men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.10</note> and how he can be ſo, unleſs he put all Men, ſome way or other into a capacity of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I profeſs my ſelf not able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand: Now what is it to put any one into a capacity of ſalvation, but to place him in that way, and to provide for him all thoſe means which ſhall be neceſſary and effectual for the obtaining that glorious end? Hence the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle informs us, that <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.4</note> as far as lyes in him, and may be conſiſtent with the Nature of Rational Creatures, and that it may appear there is nothing wanting on God's part to make them happy. Wherefore thoſe who deny to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Mankind ſuch a Participation of the aſſiſtance and grace of God, as may place them under a capacity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Heaven, ſeem to me to queſtion the reality and ſincerity of God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Intention of ſaving all the World by Chriſt Jeſus. For if the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49779:23"/>
of God, in ſending Jeſus Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, was, that he <hi>ſhould tast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> death for every man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 2.9. Joh. 3.17.</note> and <hi>that the World through him might be ſaved,</hi> it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe undoubtedly a part of this purpoſe, that they ſhould all be qualified and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered with ſuch ability, the faithful actuating of which ſhould certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that end for which it was deſigned. And that God ſhould intend the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Mankind, and promulgate this his Intention, and alarm the hopes and expectations of all the World, and yet deny them that, without which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved, is utterly irreconcileable with thoſe apprehenſions, which we ought to have of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That all Men might thereby be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God. No Man can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for any more than he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and if there were any number of Men to whom the Goſpel were faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preached, and the means of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made known, and yet were always left deſtitute of a power and ability of believing and acting, according to the preſcriptions of it, they would be ſo far from being left without excuſe, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their mouths ſtopped, that their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49779:23"/>
Apology would be as reaſonable, as if God ſhould expoſtulate with them for not creating the World, or raiſing the Dead. For if they never were ſo much as put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nto a capacity of believing, how can they be juſtly puniſhed as Infidels? But becauſe the righteous Governor of Heaven and Earth, cannot but do that which is juſt and equal, and that all men to whom God has communicated the Goſpel, ſhall be accountable to him for it, therefore we are aſſured that all of them, at ſome time or other, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſuch a meaſure and degree of God's powerful aſſiſtance, as ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to do what he required of them, and ſo as he would accept of. <hi>This is the condemnation,</hi> (ſays our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19.) not that all the World was in a ſtate of Darkneſs, but <hi>that Light,</hi> that is, the Goſpel, <hi>is come amongst them,</hi> and by It they are put into a capacity, not only of diſcovering, but of coming out of their ſins, and <hi>they loved darkneſs rather than light,</hi> that is, preferred the ſatisfaction of their own corrupt luſts, before a ſincere obedience to the will of God. And methinks, the Righteouſneſs of God's Diſpenſation
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49779:24"/>
with Men in this kind is evidently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured, in that Parable of the Vineyard, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5. which is alike applicable to the ſtate of things under the Goſpel, as it was then to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church: the planting it in a fruitful ſoil, the careful manuring and cultivation of it, implying all neceſſary means for the increaſe and growth of Men in grace and vertue, whereby might very well have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſuch Wine, as might chear and exhilarate the heart of God and man, but when, after all this pains, it brought forth nothing but wild Grapes, then God determines upon the juſt deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, and for the Equity and Juſtice of this Procedure, appeals to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men, <hi>What could have been done more that I have not done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But againſt this it is objected, that if all Men under the Goſpel are put into a capacity of ſalvation, whence then comes the different entertainment of it, and Why is it that all Men are not effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally convinced and wrought upon by it?</p>
            <p>For the ſolution of this difficulty, I ſhall return,<note place="margin">lib. <hi>6.</hi> contr. Celſ. p. <hi>315</hi>
               </note> 1. That of <hi>Origen,</hi> that to an effectual perſwaſion there is required
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49779:24"/>
not only that the Perſwader offer ſuch things as are apt to beget belief, but likewiſe a ſutable diſpoſition and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble frame in him that is to be perſwaded. So that the Reaſon why many Men do not entertain and believe the Goſpel, is not that the Goſpel is unfurniſhed of perſwaſory Arguments, or that God is wanting in any thing on his part, but becauſe they reject and refuſe thoſe things which do in others, and might in them (if it were not for their own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy) produce faith and belief. As (ſays the Father) the moſt eloquent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator that ever ſpake may perſwade in vain where he meets with a ſtubborn and refractory diſpoſition. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient therefore that the Goſpel ſuggeſts and offers <gap reason="foreign">

For though a mighty Power engage it ſelf on our behalf, yet if God ſhould be extreme to mark what is done amiſs, if he ſhould take advantage of every frailty and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage, who then could be ſaved? Hence it is that our merciful God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our frame, and remembring the imperfection of Humane Nature, is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to abate and ſtrike off much of our account upon that ſtock, and treats with us not according to the degrees of an Angel, but the meaſures of a Man, not after the higheſt rigor, but <gap reason="foreign">

The Conſcience of Mens own guilt makes them afraid, and like <hi>Adam,</hi> run from the Preſence of God; wherefore to prevent thoſe miſgiving thoughts of the Nature of God, which Mens ſinful hearts poſſeſſed them withall, and for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take away all jealouſies and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious fears out of their Minds, God is pleaſed to publiſh a Declaration of Pardon and Indulgence to all Penitent Perſons, giving them all imaginable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his Propenſity and readineſs to be reconciled, and of his unfeigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and willingneſs to accept of their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:49779:26"/>
Perſons upon their ſerious and hearty deteſtation of their former ſins and evil courſes. And to the end that Men may be perfectly convinced that God is not inexorable and implacable, and that he conſults not his own Glory in any other way than that of the Creatures good and advantage, he vouchſafes out of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſerved favour and grace to accept of our <hi>Sincerity</hi> for the time to come; the knowledge of which is therefore imparted unto Men by the Goſpel to ſettle their Minds and quiet their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, which otherwiſe upon every failure in their Duty would perpetually torment them with the fear of God's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Anger and Diſpleaſure. By ſincerity, I mean ſuch a frame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of ſpirit, whereby our whole Souls are faithfully carried out in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the will of God, ſo far as it is made known to us.<note place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>Theſe things I write unto you</hi> (ſays the beloved Apoſtle) <hi>that ye ſin not,</hi> that is, It is the deſign of the Goſpel perfectly to aboliſh all ſin, and therefore it requires Mens utmoſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and endeavour againſt it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Men may fall into ſin through the improvidence and ſhort-ſightedneſs of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:49779:27"/>
Humane Nature, or through the ſudden incurſion of a Temptation, and the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and importunity of it; yet let them not caſt away their confidence, nor ſink under their load and dye, for <hi>if any man</hi> thus <hi>ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father,</hi> a royal Agent at the right hand of God, who makes interceſſion for us, not as in the days of his fleſh by offering up Prayers with ſtrong crying and tears, but by Virtue of that Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ruling his Church according to his own Pleaſure, diſpenſing his favours and ſaving Men by the mercies and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſions of the Goſpel, which Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive he purchaſed and merited for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his bitter Death and Paſſion. For God does not exact of us a perfect, unſinning Obedience, ſo as never to fail in our duty, or offend in the leaſt tittle or circumſtance, but he requires of us a perfection of ſincerity, the not giving way to any known ſin, or doing that upon deliberation, which a Man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience tells him is a breach and violation of the Law of God, though there be never ſo great Temptations to it. This is that which the Scripture calls by the Names of the <hi>New Man</hi> and the <hi>New
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:49779:27"/>
Creature,</hi> when we love and ſerve God with our whole hearts, and retain ſuch a clear ſenſe of the deformity of ſin, and the lovelineſs of Virtue, as makes us ſtudiouſly proſecute the one, and deteſt and abhor the other. And though this ſincerity of heart may be accompanied with meekneſs and imperfection, yet it is ſuch as God has graciouſly promiſed to accept of, and to waſh away thoſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer frailties and infirmities in the Blood of Chriſt. This ſtate of mind is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Fountain of Peace and Joy, a ſpring of Eternal contentment and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. It ſupports us in all dangers, carries us undauntedly through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and fills our ſouls with an enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing calmneſs and tranquillity. It is certainly the beſt Companion and the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Friend in all the World: for when the Clouds gather and a ſtorm ariſes, and the face of things in this lower Region becomes troubled and confuſed, yet our ſincerity never leaves us, but in the moſt formidable and diſmal appearance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture puts on a chearful countenance, and looks abroad and meets the greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers with a high and generous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being confident of this, that that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:49779:28"/>
everlaſting goodneſs which folds the whole Creation in tender Arms, will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſdain or caſt away a ſincere Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor deſpiſe him who unfeignedly and bewailing his weakneſs proſecutes that which is ſimply and abſolutely the beſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond thing wherein the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Divine Wiſdome appears, lyes in the manner of the manifeſtation of the Goſpel to us. <hi>God was manifeſt in the fleſh,</hi> ſays St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfulneſs of the myſtery of the Goſpel conſiſted in this, that God took upon him our fleſh and blood. God communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his will to us by ſending down his <hi>Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> (Rom. 8.3.) that is, in a body of fleſh and blood. I ſhall not here inſiſt upon thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thoſe various ways and divers manners by which God ſpake to the Fathers of old, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating his will to them ſometimes by Dreams and Viſions, by a Voice from Heaven and the Apparitions of Angels, but conſider that way which God hath choſen of manifeſting himſelf to the World in theſe laſt days by his Son, which as it beſt ſutes with the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49779:28"/>
Diſpenſation, ſo it diſcovers to us that <hi>manifold wiſdome</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10. a Wiſdome that diſplays it ſelf in ſeveral ways and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and yet all tending to one great end and purpoſe, namely the recovery of Men from ſin to a ſtate of Purity and Holineſs. For in this great deſign of inſtructing the World by the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bleſſed Saviour, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the evident Traces and Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of a condeſcending Wiſdome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating things to our Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Capacities. The delivery of the Law on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> was uſher'd in with a terrible and amazing ſolemnity, the Mountain quaking and vomiting out pitchy Clouds of ſmoke and globes of Flame, a fiery Tempeſt or Whirlwind roaring with formidable peals and claps of Thunder, together with the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſound of a Trumpet rending and tearing the Heavens, ſo that <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf exceedingly fear'd and trembled: But the Goſpel being wholly a deſign of Mercy and Love carries with it no ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and affrightments, but is compoſed of the kind invitations of Peace and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49779:29"/>
comfort, the Mount <hi>Sion</hi> wherein the reſplendent glory of the firſt-born is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, ſhining only with the gentle beams of an attractive and pleaſing light, and Jeſus the bleſſed Mediator of this New Covenant with his extended Arms proclames his willingneſs to embrace and receive the World which he has recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God with his own blood. This is that Oeconomy which the Apoſtle calls <hi>the fooliſhneſs of preaching,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21</note> not as if it were ſo in it ſelf, but becauſe 'tis a way of condeſcending wiſdome, wherein God ſtoops down to our apprehenſions, and frames things ſo as we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and receive an infinite bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by them. For Man, partly from the frame and conſtitution of his Nature conſiſting of Body as well as Soul, but much more from his fall and deſcent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this lower life becomes wonderfully affected with groſs Phantaſms and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Repreſentations. Whence it comes to paſs that we do more eaſily and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently conceive of things as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſenſe than as they are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when apprehended by a more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Principle. Wherefore the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wiſdome of God that makes not
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49779:29"/>
its Operations in a way of Abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and immenſity of Power, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Creatures againſt thoſe inbred Principles ſhe hath placed in them, but ſweetly and powerfully directs them in a ſteady way of congruity and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionateneſs to the natures of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work out Man from this low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſtate, the ſad Region of ſin and Death, to a participation of Immortality and more free emanations of Divine life, contrived a way moſt ſutable and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the ſhallow capacities and facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Humane Souls. God would not appear to us in a flame of fire, nor ſpeak by an Angel in a body of pure Air, but in the <hi>Form of a Servant</hi> clothed with our Humane Fleſh, and ſubject to all the harmleſs Paſſions of our Nature, that he might more kindly diſenſlave us from the cruel Tyranny of ſin and Satan. For let us but conſult with our own Reaſons, whether this be not a greater Incitation and more powerful inducement to Men to believe and obey the Declarations of the Divine Will, to exhibit to them ſome extraordinary and remarkable Perſon that ſhould by the fulleſt demonſtrations and ſenſible ſigns prove himſelf to be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49779:30"/>
the Eternal Son of God, and by ſweetly compulſive Motives even to the ſuffering a barbarous and ſhameful Death attract Humane Minds to the Imitation of his Virtues and following his ſteps, than that God ſhould by any of thoſe forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ways manifeſt himſelf in effects of Benignity or Diſpleaſure. The whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> diſcover the ſenſe of Mankind in ſuch a caſe, when being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted with the terrors accompanying the deſcent of God upon the Mount, they ſaid unto <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 20.19.</note> 
               <hi>ſpeak thou with us and we will hear, but let not God speak with us leſt we dye.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Conſidering the world partly from themſelves, and partly from the cunning of Satan, ſo much addicted and given over to the belief of ſenſe, had not Chriſt viſibly appeared and converſed with Men, the Goſpel could never have cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated Humane Underſtandings with ſuch irreſiſtible evidence, or wrought in them ſuch a full perſwaſion of the things it taught, as we ſee it hath done. Should the great Pillars of the Chriſtian Faith, I mean the Apoſtles and Diſciples of the Holy Jeſus have laid its firſt ground-work upon the hearing of ſome
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49779:30"/>
voice, or perſwaded their Auditors (as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> and ſome other Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Law-givers) from the converſe they had with ſome Angel, that their Doctrine was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> delivered to them from Heaven, and had God for its Author, yet how hardly would Men have embraced it upon theſe accounts, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering thoſe imminent and apparent Dangers they were likely to incur upon the profeſſion of it. How ill reſented is that great Doctrine of our Bleſſed Saviour <hi>Self-denyal</hi> and <hi>Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> among vulgar ſpirits, and how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a thing is it to bring off degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Hearts from the Intereſts of the World? and is it likely then that Men ſhould be ſo prodigal of their deareſt Blood, as to ſacrifice it to an uncertain Rumour and Report, which every Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor is able to pretend? But to ſee the meek Lamb of God made in our own likeneſs, having left the ſacred Manſions of Light and Glory, and clothed himſelf with our frail Mortality, to behold him (I ſay) teſtifying by many Miracles and irrefragable Arguments through the whole courſe of his abode on Earth, and at laſt taking it upon his Death,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49779:31"/>
that he was the Son of the ever-living God, and came down from Heaven to make known to Men that God was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the World through him, this muſt needs ſtrike our Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons more forcibly than whatever elſe the wit of Man could poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Goſpel was intended to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and work our Natures into that which is the flower and perfection of the Divine life, that is an univerſal love: to call off our minds from thoſe little Intereſts they are apt to eſpouſe by look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon themſelves as ſo many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Beings divided and ſeparated from the reſt of the World, and created only for themſelves and their Private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and to beget in them an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally extenſive charity by widening their Capacities to the Dimenſions of the whole Creation. By which we are taught not to think it enough that our love aſcend in copious flames to Heaven, unleſs it likewiſe deſcend in due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and degrees upon all Mankind. And indeed it is impoſſible for a Man that is throughly baptized into this ſpirit of Univerſal love, to have any ſelf deſigns
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49779:31"/>
in oppoſition to the general good of the whole World, but he muſt needs be infinitely deſirous and pleaſed to ſee the life and nature of God communicated to all Beings capable of receiving of it. And this love is ſo ſtrong and vigorous that it firmly unites it ſelf to all in whom it finds any true likeneſs and reſemblance of the Divine Image, and ſo far endears them to it ſelf, as to conſtrain us <hi>to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.16.</note> But certainly this Flame could never have burnt ſo bright if it had not been raiſed and quickned by that ſenſible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inimitable affection in the Death of the Holy Jeſus. For what greater incouragement could there be to oblige and unite Mens ſouls to one another, than that their love ſhould firſt be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Heaven by that great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Exemplar of noble Charity, who laid down his life to expiate the crimes of his own and his Fathers Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Of a congruity and complyance with the ſtate and condition of Mankind both in reſpect of
<list>
                  <item>1. Moral</item>
                  <item>2. Natural</item>
               </list>
Evils.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:49779:32"/>Firſt, in reſpect of Moral Evils: The degeneracy and fall of Mankind from God made them Slaves and Vaſſals to ſin and Satan; for the buſie Tempter being not able to work upon them by external force and violence, drew their wills into conſent by craft and ſpecious ſolicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, till at laſt he had ſo far enlarged his Kingdom, as to bring the whole Race of Mankind under his Dominion. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel being deſigned to free Men from that unnatural Bondage, and to reſtore them to their true liberty, it does in all points confront the ways and methods by which their Captivity was compaſſed and effected. It had been a ſmall matter by a high hand, and by an Infinite Power at large, to have deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Devils Kingdom, but herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared an excellent Wiſdome, ſo to lay the Ground and Foundation of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious purpoſe of the ſalvation of the World, that the Politick Prince of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might be taken in his own craftineſs, and loſe this his Empire and Dominion by the ſame methods by which he at firſt obtained it. The Woman being firſt in the Tranſgreſſion, and bringing ſin and Death upon all her Off-ſpring, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49779:32"/>
Wiſdome that draws light out of darkneſs, and Order out of Confuſion, decreed that <hi>the ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> that Chriſt who is the Seed of the Woman, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, by Nature, and his Members, who are ſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> by ſpiritual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graftment into him, ſhould diſpoſſeſs the Devil of that Power, Soveraignty and Principality which he holds over the World by ſin. According to this early Declaration of Men's Recovery, Jeſus Chriſt the true Seed of the Woman comes into the World, and by walking exactly contrary to his Enemy, reſtores to the World what they loſt by the firſt <hi>Adam.</hi> And whereas the Devil mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Kingdom of ſin and Death with all imaginable Tyranny and Inſultation over poor Mortals, our Bleſſed Jeſus was ſo far from requiring Humane Blood to be ſacrificed to him, that out of a deep ſenſe of our Calamity he parted with his own Blood for the life of the World. A more effectual and agreeable courſe could never have been taken than this, that the Captain of our ſalvation ſhould viſibly appear and conquer the Kingdom and Powers of Darkneſs in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49779:33"/>
which the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> ruin'd and deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of Natural Evils: Though it be no diſgrace nor ſhame to be made a Man, yet he that deeply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon Humane life, ſhall find it at the beſt very calamitous and ſtanding in need of much Pity and Compaſſion. We are born into the World helpleſs and weak, and as if we did preſage our own future miſeries, the firſt actions of our life are ſpent in crying and tears: Our very Bodies are a ſad load and burden upon our Spirits, inclining them to many fooliſh luſts and paſſions, ſubject to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Pains, Diſeaſes and Death, inſomuch that many good and holy Men have in paſſionate ſtreins bewailed their ſtay and continuance here on Earth, <hi>Woe is me that I ſojourn in Meſeck, and have my habitation in the Tents of Kedar!</hi> and, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from this body of Death!</hi> Now none can ſo affectionately pity, nor ſo intimately reſent the diſtreſs of another, as he that hath ſmarted and ſuffered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame calamity: Therefore ſays the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.15.</note> 
               <hi>We have not an High-Prieſt that cannot be touched with the feeling of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49779:33"/>
our infirmities,</hi> by reaſon of the great diſtance, diſproportion and ſublimity of his Nature, <hi>but was in all points tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted like as we are, yet without ſin,</hi> that is, manifeſted and declared himſelf to be a true Man, by being ſubject to all the harmleſs affections and infirmities of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane fleſh and blood; foraſmuch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he became our Brother, by taking upon him the ſame Natural condition, he muſt needs be throughly apprehenſive and ſenſible of our ſtate, and ſo the more apt to ſympathize with and commiſerate poor Mortals, and by that powerful ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty to which he is exalted, act for us and ſend down relief from Heaven to us. For though the Infinite Eſſence of God pervade the whole World and all the Creatures live within it, and therefore muſt needs feel and know the inmoſt Energies, Motions and ſtilleſt Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of all Beings; yet it affords not ſuch a ſenſible comfort to Humane minds, as to behold the Son of God taking upon him our Nature, and by that Union and Proximity aſſuring us of his Tenderneſs and Compaſſion towards us. For <hi>he took not on him the nature of Angels,</hi> being unwilling to be ſo far removed from us,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49779:34"/>
               <hi>but took on him the Seed of Abraham.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb 2.16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High-Prieſt—for in that he himſelf hath ſuffered being tempted, he is able to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour them that are tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third thing, which demonſtrates the excellency of Divine Wiſdome in the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, conſiſts in the fitneſs and ſutableneſs of it to the end for which it was deſigned. For things are ſo much the more excellent, by how much the congruity and fitneſs is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the accompliſhing their end and purpoſe. Now the great intent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of God in the Goſpel being (as I have ſaid) the everlaſting bleſſedneſs of Humane Souls, the more congruouſly and fitly diſpoſed it ſhall be found to be for the obtaining this effect, the greater is the glory of the Divine Wiſdome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſing and concerning it ſelf about it. This aptneſs and ſutableneſs is ſeen,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the Goſpel is furniſhed with all thoſe Arguments that are requiſite to approve it ſelf worthy of Belief to all Rational Perſons. To this two things are neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:49779:34"/>1. The atteſtation of God himſelf.</p>

St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſcourſing of the myſtery of Godlineſs tells us that Chriſt and Chriſtianity was <hi>juſtified by the ſpirit,</hi> i. e. owned, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and recommended to the World by the ſpirit of God. And this God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of our bleſſed Saviour to the World, as a Perſon commiſſioned and inveſted with full Authority to declare his will unto Mankind, was done at ſeveral Times and in divers manners.</p>

Another confirmation of Chriſt and his Doctrine was at his Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.5. <hi>A Voice</hi> comes <hi>out of the cloud, which ſaid, This is my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him.</hi> And this St. <hi>Peter</hi> brings as a Demonſtration of the Truth of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.16, 17.</note> 
               <hi>For we have not followed cunningly deviſed Fables, when we made known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the power and coming of our Lord Jeſus Christ, q. d.</hi> We have not impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the Minds and Spirits of Men, as the manner of cheaters and deceivers is, but have delivered to you ſuch things as we have ſeen and heard, being <hi>eye-witneſſes of his Majeſty; For he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God the Father honour and glory, when there came ſuch a Voice to him from the excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed: And this Voice which came from Heaven we heard, when we were with him in the Holy Mount.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. God approved our Lord Jeſus by inabling him to work Miracles, which is ſuch a clear Teſtimony of the Divine
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:49779:36"/>
Miſſion of our Saviour, that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> ought to be convinced by it. To the <hi>Jews</hi> it ought to be Convictive from their own Law, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.22. <hi>When a Prophet speaks in the Name of the Lord, if the thing follow not nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken—</hi> Which Rule was given them to diſcern true Prophets from falſe; for if the Prophet brought to them a New Doctrine, and confirmed it by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural and miraculous Operations, though he commanded them ſomething contrary to the Law, yet if he perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing but the worſhip of the One true God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they ought to obey him, foraſmuch as there could be no greater Evidence of the Divine Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and Approbation, than by inabling ſuch a Man to work Miracles. And though this General Rule might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to all the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prophets, yet did it more particularly reſpect the coming of the Meſſias, there being none more conſpicuous and illuſtrious for all thoſe ſigns by which God would have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that ſpeaks in his Name to be known than Jeſus Chriſt. Nor is it of leſs moment and argument to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:49779:36"/>
for Miracles being ſuch unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable evidences of the Interpoſition of a Divine Power, it follows that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall lead a ſincere and unblameable life, and teach nothing but the worſhip of the true God and the conſcientious practice of Virtue, and for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this his Doctrine ſhall work Miracles, we ought to believe him ſent from God. This was it which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Nicodemus, We know that thou art a Teacher come from God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>for no man can do theſe Miracles that thou doeſt except God be with him.</hi> He ſaw that Jeſus Chriſt profeſſed and commanded only the worſhip of the true God, and that he exhorted only to the practice of real Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thoſe great Miracles which he wrought, exceeding the power of evil ſpirits, were a ſenſible Demonſtration that he was ſent from God.</p>
            <p>It may now not improperly be inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Whether Miracles are always ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to beget belief of the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Doctrine: and how far they are ſo?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I anſwer, that Miracles to ſome Perſons and in ſome Circumſtances
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:49779:37"/>
are proper means to beget aſſent; for that they are not always convictive, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the Incredulity of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whom neither the frequent and ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Miracles of our Saviour, nor of his Apoſtles could perſwade, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this powerful way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, they put the Maſter to death as a Malefactor, and murder his Servants: I ſay therefore that to ſome Perſons and in ſome circumſtances, Miracles are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to beget Faith. 1. They are neceſſary means to them who have been conſtantly uſed and trained up by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Such were the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their Law in a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the Divinity of which was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently afterwards atteſted by Miracles, and upon any great and notable defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the People to Idolatry, God was pleaſed to reduce them by ſending and inabling a Prophet to work Miracles. Now it is very unreaſonable to think that the Goſpel which ſhould introduce and make ſo mighty a change in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical Oeconomy ſhould gain belief of them, unaſſiſted of miraculous evidence and teſtimony, who were already in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a Law which God himſelf had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:49779:37"/>
ſo often owned and ſet his Seal to by Miracles and ſupernatural Operations. Hence it came to paſs that the <hi>Jews</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of Chriſt a ſign, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18. for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he called God his Father, and carried himſelf in the way of a Prophet, they require him to evidence this his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by ſome miraculous Actions, which our bleſſed Saviour both promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and fulfils by raiſing himſelf from the Dead. 2. Miracles do more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully ſtrike the ſenſes, and ſo are more apt to beget belief in them, who are not capable of a rational apprehenſion and dijudication of Truth. Hitherto we may refer Chriſt's upbraiding <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida, If the mighty works which were done in them,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.21</note> 
               <hi>had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes,</hi> that is, they would very probably have done ſo: for they lying under a great and inveterate Ignorance, and being ſo perfectly enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſenſe, were more likely to have been rouzed out of their blockiſhneſs and ſtupidity by miracles which ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly ſtrike the imagination, than by the moſt Rational Diſcourſe to which they had ſo little vital congruity and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:49779:38"/>
And it is very obſervable, that the Apoſtles never wrought a Miracle, but upon an urgent occaſion and great neceſſity, where they found their Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors capable and apprehenſive: When the great Apoſtle of the Gentiles, S. <hi>Paul,</hi> came to <hi>Athens,</hi> a place long famous for all Polite Learning,<note place="margin">Acts 17.</note> he makes an excellent Metaphyſical Diſcourſe, and proves the Unnaturalneſs and Unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Idolatry, by ſuch Principles as were common to, and Univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Intellectual nature of Man. And indeed a Rational conviction ſeems more clear and evident than a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous One, by how much the Innate Idea's and Dictates of the Underſtanding are more ſure and conſtant, than the perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed motions of a Verſatile Imagination. And we find that the <hi>Jews</hi> evaded the force of our Saviour's Miracles, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were done by the power of the Devil, and though <hi>Lazarus</hi> come to them from the Dead, yet they did not believe, but ſought to murder him, and a perverſe ſpirit will find various Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to elude the Aſſent which a Miracle commands from us. But now Humane Reaſon being in all Men one and the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:49779:38"/>
ſame, it is more likely to prevail when advantageouſly propounded, from that antecedent ſutableneſs and Harmony there is between it and all Truth. And without doubt our bleſſed Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeems to intimate, that the Aſſent which is extorted upon the working of Miracles, is much leſs generous and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, than that which is gained from the Underſtanding, by the Native evidence and beauty of Truth: <hi>Except ye ſee ſigns and wonders, ye will not believe;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 4.18.</note> whereas the Facility of the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> is commended, who believed on <hi>Jeſus</hi> upon his own Diſcourſe,<note place="margin">v. 42.</note> though he did no Miracle among them. And beſides all this, Chriſt ſays expreſly, that the very Nature and frame, the Sanctity and Majeſty of the Doctrine he propounded, was alike ſufficient to render the <hi>Jews</hi> inexcuſable, as the unparallel'd Works he performed in their Preſence. <hi>If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had ſin; but now they have no cloak for their ſin.</hi> Again,<note place="margin">Joh 15.22, 24.</note> 
               <hi>If I had not done amongst them the works which none other man did, they had not had ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore to us who have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, the Diſcourſes of our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:49779:39"/>
Bleſſed Saviour, and the Writings of his Apoſtles tranſmitted, if we ſhall yet be incredulous, it is as likely and probable we ſhall ſtill continue ſo, though one come to Us from the Dead. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We have already all things, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to life and godlineſs, perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly delivered in the Holy Scriptures, and this Doctrine at the firſt delivery of it, was ſufficiently confirmed and atteſted by Miracles and Supernatural Actions, the Hiſtory of which is made as credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to us, as any Records of things can be, which we our ſelves were not Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of. Now, if we can believe any Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of former Ages, any Records of Times paſt, we have the ſame Reaſon to believe the Hiſtory of the Goſpel, and he that ſincerely credits that, will be as much confirmed in the Religion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, by thoſe Miracles he finds long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go wrought to evidence its Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as if they were done now at this preſent before his eyes. <hi>Bleſſed are they who have not ſeen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 20.29.</note> 
               <hi>and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To deſire new Miracles for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of Faith, is to queſtion the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God in the Contrivance of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:49779:39"/>
Goſpel. For either the Scriptures are ſufficiently confirmed and atteſted, by the Miracles wrought by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to beget Faith and Credence in any unprejudiced and diſintereſſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or they are not. If they are, it is in vain to require the Reproduction of Miracles in its behalf. If they are not, we then call in queſtion the wiſdome of God, as if he either knew not the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and Conſtitutions of Men, or did not foreſee what was ſufficient to work belief in them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The perpetuating Miracles for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Conviction, would deſtroy and make uſeleſs their Rational Faculties. For the Chriſtian Religion is a manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of the higheſt Reaſon that ever the World had any cognizance of, and all its Parts and Doctrines are every way fitted to Rational Capacities: But now Miracles being only Convictive to ſenſe, if for the confirmation of every Article of Religion, there muſt be the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Teſtimony of a Miracle, all Appeal to our Reaſon and Intellectual Faculties were uſeleſs and ſupervacaneous.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the Dead, was a notable ſuffrage
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:49779:40"/>
and teſtimony of his Divine Miſſion. It is the higheſt inſtance of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence watching over and carefully ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending the Perſon of our Holy Lord and Maſter, which though it permitted Him to fall into the Hands of wicked and cruel Men, who bereaved him of his Innocent Life, yet forſook him not in Death and the Grave, but juſtified and approved the Deſign and Cauſe he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the World by diſmantling thoſe Infernal Priſons, and bringing Him up to life again. And this the Apoſtle takes as an eminent Declaration of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who though according to that mortal and frail ſtate he took upon him in the World, became a Man of the Seed of <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> yet in regard of that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Celeſtial condition, which he obtained by the Reſurrection from the Dead, was manifeſtly declared the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and powerful Son of God. For we cannot think that God would do ſo much for an Impoſtor, or that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power would ſo highly concern it ſelf in raiſing him from the Dead, and thereby owning him in ſo ſingular and eminent a manner, if he had not ſpoken in his Name, and done all things by his Authority and Commiſſion.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:49779:40"/>5. Another Inſtance of the Divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the Doctrine of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, appears in ſending down the Holy Ghoſt after his Aſcenſion into Heaven. This Miſſion of the Holy Spirit, Chriſt promiſed his Diſciples before he left the World, and ſignally performs it upon the Day of <hi>Pentecost.</hi> And this very thing is brought by the Author to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> as an Indubitable Confirmation of the Goſpel: <hi>How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation, which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 2.3, 4.</note> 
               <hi>and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him: God alſo bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> (approving and owning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of his Son Jeſus) <hi>both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will.</hi> God is brought in here as a Witneſs to the Truth of the Goſpel, and his Teſtimony is the Miſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, by whom the Apoſtles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled and furniſhed with divers gifts and miraculous Powers for the conviction of the World, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the beloved Son of God and Saviour of Mankind. And this Redargution of the World was made a part of the Advocateſhip of the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:49779:41"/>
Holy Spirit by our Lord, <hi>When he is come he will reprove the World of ſin,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.8, 9, 10.</note> 
               <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they believe not on me,</hi> that is, he ſhall take upon him the defence of my cauſe, and convince the World of their great ſin in ſlaying me a true Prophet, who came to declare the will of God unto them. <hi>Of righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to my Father, and ye ſee me no more;</hi> that is, he ſhould make it appear that I was juſt and innocent, though condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Malefactor, and that I was own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and approved of God in that he vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly took me up into Heaven. Which plentiful effuſion of the Holy Spirit in ſuch a wonderful manner, whenas he had been withdrawn from the <hi>Jews</hi> as to thoſe extraordinary and Prophetical gifts for the ſpace of four hundred years, was a Teſtimony clear as the Sun that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son of GOD, and therefore that they ought to have believed on Him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly, Chriſt was approved by the Spirit of Prophecy. Their want of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and incredulity of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Oracles, was that for which our Saviour upbraided his two Diſciples,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49779:41"/>
               <hi>O Fools and ſlow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24.25.</note> Whereby we are informed that the Prophets had long ago given, not only a character and deſcription of the Perſon, but of the Doctrine, Death, Burial and Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> and theſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies being ſo directly applicable to <hi>Jeſus</hi> and to none elſe, it was an unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proof that he was the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and that the World ought to believe on him. This Argument St. <hi>Peter</hi> makes uſe of againſt the <hi>Jewes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 10.43.</note> 
               <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs— q.d.</hi> If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not us the Apoſtles of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> yet believe your own Prophets, who unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly point out and refer to this <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom we preach to you. And thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> pleads for the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.22. that he taught <hi>no other things than thoſe which the Prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come.</hi> By all theſe ſeveral ways, it is very apparent that God hath born witneſs to Chriſtianity, and approved and owned the Perſon and Doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is the firſt thing required to the credibility of the Goſpel, namely the Atteſtation of God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49779:42"/>2. The Second is Rational Evidence and Conviction.</p>
            <p>The moſt Noble Faculties of the Soul of Man are the Underſtanding and the Will, and that Religion bear a Rational Evidence and Conviction, it muſt be fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Arguments that muſt convince the Underſtanding, and perſwade the Will to a due Reception and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. Now the proper Object of the Underſtanding is <hi>Truth,</hi> from whence it follows that Chriſtianity muſt be true that it may be believed. For the Truth of Religion, I ſhall refer to thoſe Learned Authors, who have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely handled that Argument, and brought as clear Evidence as the thing it ſelf is capable of: And he that cannot believe without a Mathematical certainty, declares himſelf to be very abſurd and diſingenuous, and may upon the ſame grounds as well expect the ſame Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrative Evidence for the affairs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life, or to prove the Truth of the Chronicles of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> that is, he is ſo ſtrangely unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, as to deſire ſuch proof, as the nature of the things will not bear, though in the mean time he have the higheſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49779:42"/>
and moſt unqueſtionable aſſurance of the Truth of Religion, that the thing it ſelf is capable of, that is, a Moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. For the Mind of Man may be as indubitably aſſured of the Truth of a Moral Propoſition, as of a Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal or Phyſical one, although there be not the ſame way of Probation in all. As for Example, This is a ſelf-evident Truth in Morals, and needs no other light, but that of its own to gain Aſſent;
<q rend="margQuotes">That in thoſe things which we have not ſeen nor experienced our ſelves,<note place="margin">See Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiridion Ethicum.</note> we ought to believe them that ſay they have ſeen and experienced, provided they live up to their profeſſion, and are not moved to it by ſecular reſpect.</q>
Which if it be not aſſented to, we muſt be Scepticks even in ordinary affairs and tranſactions of Humane life, we muſt not believe there is ſuch a Place as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> nor credit any thing but our own Eyes and Ears, and ſay in a larger ſenſe than ever the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> did, that <hi>all men are lyars.</hi> See more of this in Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Wilkins</hi> Principles of Natural Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Now for the Will, that Religion may have a full and compleat entertainment
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:49779:43"/>
in the Soul of Man, there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likewiſe to work upon that Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to make a thing eligible, it muſt have the appearance of <hi>Good,</hi> that is, it muſt have a ſutableneſs, congruity and harmony with the Intellectual Nature of Man, and a tendency to promote the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection thereof; And ſuch is the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion in its whole Frame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture. For let us conſider, who it is that owns, and has intereſſed himſelf, as the Bleſſed Author of the Evangelical Oeconomy, even the Eternal <hi>Logos</hi> and Wiſdome of God, that Almighty Mind which has cloſely contracted, and deeply ſeal'd upon all Intellectual Agents, that large and diffuſive wiſdome, that is ſeen in all the Parts of Heaven and Earth. And to think that Chriſtianity ſhould be in any of its Parts unreaſonable, is to imagine this to be the only Unreaſonable thing, that ever the Divine Wiſdome was the Author of, and this alone of all his numerous Off-ſpring to be unlike the Father. The Goſpel does in the moſt intimate manner derive it ſelf from Chriſt the Eternal Son of God, and is eſpecially owned and ſuperintended by him, as being the repairing that work
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49779:43"/>
which he alone made, and which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone can rectifie: and to imagine that an Infinite Reaſon ſhould propound any thing to us that were unreaſonable, is as fond as to ſay that cold can flow from fire, or darkneſs poſitively ray from the boſome of light. Jeſus Chriſt did not bring a Religion into the World, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex our minds and dazle our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, but for the real good and behoof of the lapſed Creation, to form our minds according to his own Image, and to regenerate our ſpirits into a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nature of Truth and Righteouſneſs, which Deſign were utterly loſt, if there were not in Chriſtianity a perfect ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phony, congruity and agreeableneſs with our Intellectual Natures. Beſides, let any Man but conſider, how the Will is allured and ſolicited to Action, and he ſhall find, that it is then the moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly tempted forth, when ſomething is propounded, which has a Natural ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs and harmony with thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive Principles, of which we are made: but on the contrary, it is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally averſe to, and not at all concerned with that, to which it hath no vital ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy or concord. Which is an evident
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49779:44"/>
ſign that Chriſtianity is not only agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to, but perfective of our Rational Powers. What can be more agreeable to the true Nature of Man than Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? What more ſutable to his high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Diviner Faculties than Truth and Goodneſs? Theſe beautiful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forms ſhone bright in our Souls, before Vice and Sin had covered and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſpread them, and forced our Minds into a Preternatural ſtate. Now Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is deſign'd for the Recovery of Us to our Priſtine Health and Rectitude, and tends to the enlargement of our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Powers, and the Recovery of them from that narrow and contracted ſtate, ſin and evil had brought them to. Vice and Wickedneſs are none of God's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but are Obliquities and Aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from thoſe Rules and Laws he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in us, and therefore as it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible the Soul ſhould have any proper agreement with ſin, becauſe 'tis none of its Nature, ſo ſhe muſt needs, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, ſenſibly embrace and acquieſce in the Principles and Precepts of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, from that Vital Cognation they bear to her own Moral Being. There is no capacious and generous Mind, but
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49779:44"/>
will find it ſelf wonderfully affected and inamour'd with the lovelineſs of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, there being nothing found, but Principles of the higheſt worth and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and whatever elſe may ſpeak true excellency and perfection. The Goſpel is nothing, but God manifeſted in the Fleſh, an eternal Mind clothed with the condeſcenſions of Humane Nature, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the Beauty and Pulchritude of that life, from which we had ſo foully apoſtatiz'd and degenerated, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and re-eſtabliſhing that Happy league, which was once between our Souls and Righteouſneſs. By the tenor of which ſacred Inſtitute, we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to great meaſures and degrees of Holineſs, to Sobriety and Temperance, Chaſtity and Purity, to be ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Rules of Juſtice and Equity, full of good nature and the deſirable fruits of tenderneſs and compaſſion; in a word, we are injoyned no other things in Religion, than what the beſt and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt ſpirits the World ever knew, have always accounted the flower and ſummi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Rational Natures. And do not all conſidering Men, find the greateſt eaſe and ſatisfaction of Mind, in the exerciſe
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49779:45"/>
of theſe things? And whence comes this Heavenly calm and ſerenity of Soul, but only from that gratefulneſs and ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that is between ſuch things and our Intellectual Man? ſo that the more earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly we attend to them, the more fully are we transformed into their lovely I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and likeneſs. True Chriſtianity is ſo far from debaſing, that on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it infinitely exalts them, by ſetting them at a true proportion to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Objects, and raiſing them to ſuch a ſtate, as all wiſe Men have ever acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the higheſt Happineſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Soul of Man.</p>
            <p>I have now ſhown the fitneſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs of the Goſpel, to the end for which it was deſigned, in that it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all thoſe Arguments of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibility, that may beget Aſſent in Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Perſons: but its aptneſs and accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dateneſs to that great purpoſe of Men's ſalvation, may further be demonſtrated in that,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, It is ſo attemper'd to Humane Nature, that Men ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe, and yet no violence done to their Wills. For Men being Moral A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, muſt be dealt withall according
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:49779:45"/>
to their Natural Powers and Faculties, and this makes the Method of ſaving Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Souls by the Goſpel, to be indeed a Work of Wiſdom and Counſel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if God ſhould by his Omnipotency force them to a Belief and Obedience of it, it would not have been ſo much an effect of Wiſdome, as of abſolute and uncontrollable Power. Now herein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the Glory of Divine Wiſdome, in the choice of ſuch means and ways, as ſhall effectually bring to paſs its end and purpoſe, and yet no violence and force offered to that Nature in whoſe behalf it acts. As therefore to aſſert, that there is no neceſſity of the aſſiſtance of the grace and ſpirit of God, in our progreſs in Virtue and Holineſs, but that Men may be good by the ſtrength of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of Nature, is directly repugnant to the frame of Chriſtianity, delineated in the Holy Scriptures, and the ſenſe of the Univerſal Apoſtolick Church of Chriſt; ſo to think that the Operation of God's Spirit upon the Hearts of Men, is by an External Impetus and Force, is no leſs precarious and abſurd, than the other is wicked and abominable. I ſhall therefore wave the firſt of theſe, as not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49779:46"/>
being at all concerned with it, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſuppoſing the contrary; and only diſcourſe ſo far of the concourſe and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy of the Spirit of God upon the minds, will and affections of Men, as is evidently declared in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And here I humbly conceive, that the Sacred Writings do no where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the concurrence, or operation of the Spirit of God upon Men's Souls, to be by an Omnipotent Power at large, ſuch as was ſhown in the Creation of the World, or Reſurrection of the Dead, and which ſuppoſes us ſo altogether paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, as not to be in the leaſt meaſure ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of promoting, or hindring our own good; for this were to deſtroy that noble faculty of Humane Souls their Will, and render all their Actions fatal and neceſſary: Whereas the Chriſtian Religion was intended to heal and ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to joyn and confirm the diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diſordered powers of our Souls, not to take them away, to perfect and compleat, not to extirpate and eradicate their very Nature and Being. No Man acknowledges the actions of Brutes or Engines, or the reſults of our Animal and irrational powers capable of Moral
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49779:46"/>
Goodneſs; becauſe they act fatally and neceſſarily; and ſuch would the actions of Mankind be, if they were produced by an irreſiſtible Power. A power and aſſiſtance then it is certain God has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, and that of his Holy Spirit under the Goſpel, but the manner of his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not abſolute and unconditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, but hypothetical, like the great conciliating and formative Principle of God in Nature, requiring certain terms and previous Diſpoſitions and Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, without which it is as vain to hope for the compleat efformation of Chriſt within us, as to expect the Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body of an Animal, to be formed out of a piece of Braſs or Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For though we do not diſtruſt the Power of God, but believe he is able to raiſe himſelf up Children out of the very ſtones of the Fields, and to change and alter the Natures of things as he pleaſes; yet ſince we find him framing and guiding them, not according to Will and Power alone, but according to the <hi>Counſel of his Will,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1.11.</note> we are likewiſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain'd, that in the conducting Humane Souls to Heaven, God works ſutably to their Natures and Capacities, and in ſuch
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49779:47"/>
an orderly Way and congruous Method, as ſuppoſes the Preſence of an Infinite Wiſdome and Counſel in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. And this not only appears from the conſideration of the frame of Humane Nature, which in its choiceſt part is wholly Intellectual, and therefore not to be forced by an outward violence, but moved and drawn (as the Scriptures ſpeak) <hi>with bands of love, and cords of a man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11.4.</note> that is, by Rational means and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive Arguments, whoſe force and ſtrength muſt lye in their Congenerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſutableneſs with the Ancient Idea's and Inſcriptions of Truth upon our Souls, but is likewiſe manifeſt,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the reſiſtibility of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Spirit of God. And for a demonſtrative and convictive Evidence of this, we need look no further than the preaching of the Son of God, while he converſed with the World and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, who though he were the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential wiſdome of his Father, and his Diſcourſes full of Life and Power, who himſelf was tranſcendently anointed with the Spirit of God, and able and willing to beſtow the ſame, according as the needs and neceſſities of Men required,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49779:47"/>
yet <hi>Jeſus,</hi> the Author and finiſher of the ſalvation of Men, was not always ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but oft-times that precious and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſeed, which he ſow'd, fell upon a Rock, and there were ſome that <hi>rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 7.30.</note> and <hi>Many believed not on him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 12.37.</note> and others <hi>went back, and walked no more with him.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 6.66.</note> Shall we ſay now that the Spirit of God did not accompany thoſe excellent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Jeſus Chriſt? If it did, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy and Operation was not Abſolute and Unconditionate, ſince it was repulſed, and took no effect on many. Or is it not rather plain, that the cauſe lay in the ſtubborneſs and obſtinacy of their own wills, according as Chriſt himſelf tells the <hi>Jews, I would, but ye would not?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23 37</note> A like form of Speech God uſes to their rebellious Anceſtors,<note place="margin">Ezek. 24.13. <hi>vid.</hi> Iſai. 65.12.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thee, and thou waſt not purged,</hi> that is, I have done my part towards it, but thou wouldſt not do thine. Nor can I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, if the work of Men's Converſion depended ſo wholly upon the Power of God, that no precedent Qualifications were neceſſary to invite the Spirit of God to fall to work, why Men's obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate incredulity ſhould debar Chriſt from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49779:48"/>
working Miracles,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.5, 6.</note> as we find it did; or why he ſhould not require a tractable frame of mind, as a precedent Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, for the exertion of his Almighty Power in the cure of ſpiritual, as well as corporal diſeaſes. Nay, the Apoſtles and Diſciples of our Saviour were ſo far from imagining an irreſiſtible Power, accompanying the outward Word, that St. <hi>Stephen</hi> tells the <hi>Jews, they did reſist the Holy Ghost, even as their Fathers did.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 7.51.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. From thoſe Arguments, the Spirit of God makes uſe of, under the Goſpel, wherein Men are treated with according to their Rational Natures, and wrought off from Vice and ſin, to a firm and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent adheſion to Virtue, by kindneſs and love, by hopes and fears, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitableneſs of impendent miſchiefs, and by the ſecurity of future rewards. Which Oeconomy had been altogether ſuperva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneous, if God had engaged his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Power to make Men good. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel we are perſwaded to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Righteouſneſs, by the eaſineſs, pleaſantneſs and ſatisfaction of ſuch a ſtate, to which our minds being once arrived, they feel a full and entire Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49779:48"/>
and ineffable joy; a Pleaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the connaturality and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of thoſe Beautiful Forms, with the inmoſt ſenſe of our own Souls. And becauſe the diſpoſitions of Mankind are various and different, ſome being incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to Action, out of a Principle of Gratitude and innate Nobility; others not eaſily won, but by Advantage and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; others again not without mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a ſevere and uneaſie Diſcipline: therefore God in the Evangelical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, hath interwoven the moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and cogent Arguments, to meet with each of theſe tempers in Men. To the firſt, he propounds the conſideration of the Death and Paſſion of his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son, who being in the form of God, and dwelling in the Immortal Manſions of Light and Glory, yet out of that dear and ineffable love and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, which he always bare to the race of Mankind, was content to baniſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from thoſe Bleſſed Regions, and put on our Servile Scheme, being born into the World a helpleſs Infant, ſubject to perpetual ſorrows and afflictive circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, leading an obſcure and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible life, befriended of few, and at laſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49779:49"/>
dying upon that uneaſie Bed of ſorrows, the Croſs, that ſo his Death might be an Expiatory Sacrifice for the ſins of the World. Which cannot but enraviſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Ingenuous Breaſt, and fill it with the higheſt and moſt faithful love, to ſo kind and compaſſionate a Saviour. But there being almoſt as few of this ſort of Men, as there were of old of thoſe that embraced Virtue for it ſelf, and eſteemed it eligible, though diveſted of all appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Rewards, therefore that Eternal Wiſdome which has intereſſed it ſelf in the Frame and Conduct of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, propounds an advantageous Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſincere and unblameable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Piety and Holineſs, and aſſures them that their labour ſhall not be in vain, but that their ſorrows ſhall find refreſhment, their hardſhips and difficult enterpriſes, eaſe and pleaſure, and their faithful Perſeverance in Righteouſneſs be recompenced with the Happineſs of poſſeſſing glorified and Immortal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in the higheſt Heavens. And if it ſhall happen, the minds of Men to be deaf to all the charms of Gratitude and Advantage, to the Allectives of good Nature and Intereſt, and there be no
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49779:49"/>
way left to awake them out of their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, but by the Voice of Thunder, then Jeſus Chriſt the Soveraign of Men and Angels, is repreſented to Us in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, coming in the Clouds of Heaven, attended with Thouſands of Angels, to take Vengeance on thoſe that have not known God, nor obeyed his Laws and Commands: And by his Powerful Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, the Seeds and Principles of Fire ſhall be excited, and that quick and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Element inſinuate and pervade all the Commiſſures and Parts of the Earth, and a Deluge of Flame, as once of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſhall overſpread the Face of the World. Into which ſulphureous and burning Lake, the Devil and his Angels, and all thoſe who in this life delight in wickedneſs, and caſt the fear of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind their backs, ſhall be plunged to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Ages.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Arguments which are diſperſed up and down, and urged in the Holy Scriptures, as ſo many tyes and bands, to engage us to a faithful and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory proſecution of the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Laws of Righteouſneſs and Truth, and which as well in their own Nature, as in the manner and way of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49779:50"/>
do evidently declare that they are not fatal and neceſſary, but moral Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of propagating and diffuſing the Life and Nature of God, and as all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Rational means of Perſwaſion, may by an obſtinate and perverſe ſpirit be ſlighted and contemned. And certainly the Nature of the thing it ſelf requires it ſhould be ſo; for if the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Mens ſouls, in order to their ſalvation, were nothing but the effects and emanations of a peremptory and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controllable Power, there would be no place left for thoſe large Encomium's of Wiſdome in this great affair, Wiſdome being <hi>Inventrix Mediorum,</hi> and then moſt of all diſcovers its excellency, in fixing and determining upon ſuch ways, as ſhall operate effectually, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruouſly and agreeably to the Nature of Men, Moral Agents requiring Moral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, to allure and invite them to Action. But leſt any Man ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly miſtake me, and think that what I have ſaid, tends to the invalidating and weakning our belief of the Powerful Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God, I do confidently affirm, <hi>That no Man ought, or can attribute his beginning, progreſs
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:49779:50"/>
and continuance in goodneſs, to his own ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary effort or powers, but to the benign and auſpicious influence of the Divine grace and ſpirit.</hi> It is he that forms in us the Life and Nature of God, that makes us Holy, Righteous and Good, enlightning the Eyes of our Minds, that we may ſee the ineſtimable riches of the Goſpel, and convinces us of the Truth of the Great Promiſes of Salvation. It is He that daily by a Vital Energy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and refines the minds of Men from all filthineſs and uncleanneſs, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates their hearts as Holy Temples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. It is he that continually burns up and conſumes our unruly luſts, and breathes upon the Sacred Life of God in our Souls, fanning it into a flame of love, that we dwell in God and God in Us. Through his mighty Power we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from our Spiritual Enemies, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us with a Pillar of a Cloud by Day, and a light of Fire by Night, till he bring us to Heaven the true Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan.</hi> But in all this, the Divine Spirit does not pull and draw us like ſtocks and ſtones, nor offer any irreſiſtible violence to our wills, nor muſt we expect that God ſhould do all the work for us while

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:49779:51"/>Now this Power manifeſted it ſelf, 1. In raiſing our Bleſſed Saviour from the Dead. Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> was <hi>declared the Son of God with power,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>by the Reſurrection from the Dead,</hi> that is, God did own and publickly declare him to be his beloved Son, in that powerful manner of raiſing Him from the Dead. And again, he calls it <hi>the mighty power of God which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the Dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 1.20.</note> For when the <hi>Jews</hi> had crucified our Saviour, the Cauſe of the Goſpel, as to all Humane Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance lay dead and buried with him as a loſt and undone Cauſe, inſomuch that the Diſciples themſelves were brought to this, <hi>We truſted it had been he that ſhould have redeemed Iſrael,</hi> ſo little hopes and expectations had they of a new ſtate of things, when they ſaw their great Maſter dead upon the Croſs. But ſuffering Virtue being ſo illuſtrious an object of the Divine Providence, God who owned and approved our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> all the time of his life, would not now ſuffer his Credit and Reputation to lye at ſtake being dead, and therefore notwithſtanding the malice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the envious diligence of the ſpirits

of Darkneſs, aſſerts and maintains the Truth of his Miſſion, by bringing him up to life again. The impious care and induſtry of his Enemies, made the glory of our Saviour's Innocence ſo much the more clear and conſpicuous: they look upon him as an Impoſtor, and having heard him afore ſpeak of his Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, they endeavour by all means to hinder it, that they might blaſt his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory and bury his Honour with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; therefore they roll a great Stone to the Mouth of the Sepulchre, ſealing it, (probably with the Signet of <hi>Pilate</hi>) and ſetting a Band of Souldiers to watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his Grave. But God that loved his Son <hi>Jeſus</hi> to his Death, and took the care of Him when he was laid in the Grave, diſappointed the hopes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and made their malicious contrivances ſubſervient Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to the Truth of his Reſurrection. A mighty Angel comes down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, at whoſe Preſence and awful Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty the Keepers trembled, and the Earth it ſelf was moved, and rolls away the Stone and ſits upon it, and the ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Power of the Divinity ſhakes the Territories of Night and ſlumber, and

diſmantles the Priſons of the Grave, and reſtores to our Saviour that Life the <hi>Jews</hi> bereaved him of, notwithſtanding all their fraudulent Practices and Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations.

            <p n="2">2. The Power of God in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, has been very notable in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Devils Kingdom. When Mankind began to apoſtatize from God, and fall into Idolatry, he gave them over to the Tyranny and Dominion of the Prince of Darkneſs, as a juſt Puniſhment of their wilful Adheſion to his Counſels and Inſpirations, and for Reaſons reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Depth and Abyſs of Divine Providence, permitted all the World (ſave that he ſelected himſelf a Church out of the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham</hi>) to be abuſed by the Devil, and to lye under that ſervitude and ſlavery, till the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt into the World. But when the Son of Righteouſneſs was riſen, the Nations of the Earth ſoon ſaw and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his light, and the Prediction of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49779:53"/>
our Bleſſed Saviour became verified and fulfilled in the Ruine of the Devils King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, whoſe lapſe and fall was like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from Heaven. For notwithſtanding the mutual Combinations and Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies of the Kings and Potentates of the Earth againſt the Lords anointed, and his Diſciples and Followers, notwithſtanding the furious Rage of Satan, in ſtirring up and raiſing many cruel and bloody Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions againſt the Church, yet the Word of God grew mightily and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far that the whole <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at laſt became Chriſtian, whereby the Devil utterly loſt his hold, his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles being ſilent, and his whole Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip deſtroyed.

That the Devil being impatient of the ſound of the Goſpel, and the Croſs of Chriſt in every part of this old World, ſo that he could in no place be quiet for it, and foreſeeing that he was like at length to loſe all here, bethought himſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him of a Seed, over which he might reign ſecurely, and in a Place, <hi>

Namely as when the World Apoſtatized from the Worſhip of the true God, God called <hi>Abraham</hi> out of <hi>Chaldee</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:49779:54"/>
him to raiſe him a Seed to preſerve a light unto his Name: So the Devil when he ſaw the World Apoſtatizing from him, laid the Foundations of a new Kingdome, by deducting this Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny from the North into <hi>America,</hi> where ſince they have increaſed into an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Multitude. And where did the Devil reign more Abſolutely and without Controll, ſince Mankind fell firſt under his clutches? And here it is to be noted, that the ſtory of the <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican</hi> Kingdome, (which was not found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above 400. Years before ours came thither) relates out of their own Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials and Traditions, that they came to that Place from the North, whence their God <hi>Vitzliliputzli</hi> led them, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an Ark before them: and after divers Years Travel, and many ſtations (like enough after ſome Generations) they came to a Place which the ſign he had given them at their firſt ſetting forth pointed out, where they were to finiſh their Travels, build themſelves a City and their God a Temple; which is the Place where <hi>Mexico</hi> was built.</q>
And though the Devil in thoſe Quarter, and ſuch other Parts of the World ſeem

to Lord it alone over abuſed Mankind without any controll and oppoſition, yet the Son of God to whom the uttermoſt Parts of the Earth are promiſed for an Inheritance, will at length lay a Power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful claim to his own Poſſeſſions, and take out of the hands of his Grand Enemy, by the pure and uncorrupt Propagation of the Goſpel, that Soveraignty which he exerciſes over thoſe Deſolate People. For as Chriſt in the Days of his Fleſh by his Powerful and efficacious Word, commanded the Devils out of their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped Habitations in the Bodies of Men, as a <hi>Praeludium</hi> of that Univerſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt he ſhould hereafter obtain; ſo will he after ſuch Periods of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence fixed and determined by his All-comprehenſive Wiſdome, go forth with his Legions of Light, and recover thoſe wretched Mortals out of the Hands of the ſpirits of Darkneſs, by whom they have been captivated and ſeduced at their Will. Nor is this a bare Airy Notion or Fancy, but a thing to be hoped and prayed for upon very Rational Grounds, it being nothing but the enlargement of the Kingdome of Truth and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Diſſemination of that Holy

            <p>Having thus far brought this Diſcourſe towards an end, and diſplayed the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Wiſdome and Power of God in the Goſpel, the great Inſtrument of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of Mankind, it becomes our duty to receive it with the higheſt and moſt honourable thoughts and apprehenſions; not to let our Conceptions dwindle into ſomething low and mean, and unworthy of the Nature of God, who hath ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately concerned himſelf in it. For
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49779:57"/>
whatever, whether Opinion or Practice, leſſens that eſteem and veneration Men ought to have of the Works of God, is a high Affront and Injury, and an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Derogation from the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine Nature; whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhallow, trifling and contemptible can ever be a ſutable Object of Divine Goodneſs, Wiſdome and Power: much leſs can there be any thing ſuch in the Evangelical Oeconomy, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ſo great a Work and ſo Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal and general a Good, as the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Happineſs of Humane Souls. The very light of Reaſon it ſelf teaches us, that we ought to ſpeak worthily of God, and to have due and right Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of his Nature, the Excellency of which, though it were in a great meaſure ſtamped and ingraved upon the Minds of Men at their firſt Creation, yet is more clearly and ſenſibly diſcovered under the Goſpel, than by any other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation ſince the World began. And as we are to take care that our thoughts and expreſſions be agreeabe and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a Myſtery, ſo are we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned vigorouſly to proſecute that which is the Grand Intent, ſcope and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:49779:57"/>
aim of the Goſpel, that is our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and growth in Virtue and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to perfect our Minds in true Goodneſs, by a ſincere Practice of all the indiſpenſable Laws and Rules of Righteouſneſs. For however Men may pleaſe themſelves in expounding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity in an Opinionative and Notio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal way, in peculiar Phraſes and Terms of Art, as if Religion were a thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and borrowed from the Schools; yet certain it is, that the true Life of God, which our Holy Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Jeſus Chriſt came to diſſeminate and propagate by the Goſpel, is not a bare ſound of Words, but an inward Principle of Life and Power, eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and raiſing the Souls of Men from all childiſh toyes and follies, to a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and generous Apprehenſion of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Virtue, advancing their Rational to a compleat and entire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and ſuperiority over their ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Animal Powers and Faculties, and begetting in them ſuch a lively ſenſe of whatever is abſolutely good and holy, as may at laſt reduce their thoughts, words and actions into an
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49779:58"/>
entire conformity to the Divine Will. And foraſmuch as this Heavenly Life conſiſts in the ſincere Proſecution and Practice of Virtue, and that Morality and Virtue are depreſſed beneath the concerns of Chriſtianity, by thoſe who pretend a more free Exaltation of Grace, as it will not be Impertinent to the preſent Diſcourſe, ſo I am ſure 'tis infinitely neceſſary for every Man to contribute his Pains, in ſtopping and damming up that Flood of Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and Immorality, that has bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in upon the World, by ſhewing the Indiſpenſable Neceſſity of the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Morality, that true Religion and Virtue are at no ſuch Mortal Jarrs, but that whoever is falſe and Hypocritical, to the ſincere and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Practice of it, though he flie to Heaven in his vain Dreams and Imaginations, and talk of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of God, and an Immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and Converſe with Him, yet he has neither ſeen nor known Him, and is ſo far from being a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, that he has very little of the Life of Chriſtianity dwelling in him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49779:58"/>As I deſire not therefore to charge any Man with the Evil Conſequences of his Opinion, but charitably ſuppoſe that he holds faſt to the Foundation, and whatever Tendency his Opinions may have in their Conſecutions, that yet in their Primary Intention, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns not the diſcountenancing of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned Piety; ſo neither would I, nor can by any conſidering Perſon be up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided, with ſetting and exalting Works above the Grace of God, as will appear, when I have a little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated and unfolded thoſe Termes, which have of late raiſed ſuch hideous ſtorms and Tragedies.</p>
            <p>By [Virtue] therefore I mean that Power of the Soul, which ſo rules and governs all the Animal motions and inclinations, that ſhe does every where, and in every thing conſtantly and unmoveably follow that which is beſt. As for the word <hi>[Grace]</hi> all the Notions of it in the Sacred Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (as a Learned Critick obſerves) ſpring from that Primary Notion of it for <hi>Charity or Liberality.</hi>

the Participation of the Divine Nature, being the higheſt Perfection and Accompliſhment of the Soul of Man, and the ultimate end of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity it ſelf, all thoſe Acts which have a Natural Tendency to the furtherance and attainment of ſo high and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a purpoſe are ſtiled <hi>Virtues,</hi> they being nothing but the Powerful Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Soul in the ſubjugation of its Corporeal Paſſions, that it may with eaſe and conſtancy follow that which is ſimply Beſt: and <hi>Graces,</hi> becauſe they are the free, undeſerved and Gratuitous Donations of him, whoſe Almighty and Beneficent Spirit pervades the whole Order and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of Intellectual Agents, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining and purifying the Minds and Spirits of the lapſed Creation, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where attempting the Replanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Beautiful Image, Sin and Vice had obliterated and defaced. Now for the Term [Moral] remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be explained, I conceive it may ſignifie, <hi>Whatever contains in it an Eternal, Immutable and Indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Obligation.</hi> By Eternal, Immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49779:59"/>
and Indiſpenſable, I exclude from it all Temporary Conſtitutions and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Sanctions, though deriving their Authority from GOD Himſelf. I add <hi>Obligation,</hi> to difference Moral Truths from Speculative and Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical; for there may be many Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Mathematical Notions, which may properly be called <hi>Eternal and Immutable Verities,</hi> which yet lay no neceſſary Obligation upon Us. <hi>That what is once moved will continue to move till ſomething hinder it,</hi> is alike an Eternal and Immutable Verity with this, <hi>That every Man is to honour his Parents,</hi> but the One layes a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Obligation upon the Soul, whereas the other does not. Wherefore though the ſubject of all Truths whatever, and ſo of Moral Ones, be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive and Intellectual Part of the Soul, yet the ſole and Adequate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Morality ſeems to be the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Idea's and Reaſons of Good and Evil. And ſo far forth as the Soul exerciſes it ſelf in the Diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Moral Entities, it is called by the Name of Conſcience. So that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49779:60"/>
the miſtake ſeems to ariſe from hence, that Men diſtribute Humane Actions, in reference to Religion, into <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Evangelical,</hi> whereas Moral is not oppoſed to Evangelical, but to The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical or Poſitive. But to give ſome further light to this buſineſs, we may conſider theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the ſincere Practice of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is a part of the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us under the Goſpel, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to our Juſtification. For unleſs the Practice of Moral Virtue be no part of the Divine Will revealed to Us in the Goſpel, it muſt neceſſarily follow, that ſo far as it is made a Condition of the Covenant of the Goſpel, ſo far it is required in order to the Juſtification and Acceptation of our Perſons before God. For though we are ſaid in Scripture to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, yet we are not to underſtand by this, an empty, bare and naked Faith, but ſuch a Faith as is perfected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated by Love, which the Apoſtle Saint <hi>James</hi> expreſſes by Works, that
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49779:60"/>
is, ſuch a Faith as is not meerly No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and inactive, but productive in the Soul of a New and ſincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And what more frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances does the Scripture bring of our Faithful Conformity to the Will of God, than in our Conſtant Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and Practice of Moral Virtue? Inſomuch that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes, that thoſe who neglect the ſincere obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Morality and Virtue, will eaſily be induced to turn Hereticks,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19</note> and deny the Faith, <hi>Holding faith and a good conſcience, which ſome having put away, concerning faith have made ſhipwrack.</hi> So indiſpenſably neceſſary is a Virtuous Converſation to our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the Bleſſed Life and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD, that no Man can be underſtood to be a Partaker of the Divine Nature, who does not live ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly, righteouſly and godly in the World. For what ſign does he give of a Spirit renewed and changed into the Compaſſionate Nature of the Lord Jeſus, who can willingly pain and grieve and afflict his Brother? What <hi>Specimen</hi> does he produce of a
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49779:61"/>
ſincere Conformity to the Eternal Laws of Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, who can knowingly and wittingly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-reach and defraud his Neighbour? Or what Evidence does he offer of a Mind deſirous to be renewed into a ſtate of Angelical Purity and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who makes it his buſineſs and ſeeks for all Occaſions to gratifie his Carnal Appetite in the full enjoyment of all Senſual Pleaſures, that may be had without manifeſt Diſeaſes? Or is it poſſible to conceive the Life and Nature of GOD, that Life of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Holineſs and Purity, Juſtice and Goodneſs, without the Exerciſe of theſe and ſuch like Virtues?</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Maturity and Ripeneſs of Religion, conſiſts in having a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Diſcernment of Good and Evil in a Moral ſenſe. The full knowledge of the Myſteries of Chriſtianity (as the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> tells Us) <hi>belongs to them that are of full age,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 5.14.</note> that is, ſuch as are arrived to the Perfection and Maturity of Religion, and theſe Perſons he deſcribes in the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49779:61"/>
next words, to be ſuch as have a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reliſh and ſenſible Diſcernment of good and evil, <hi>Who by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil.</hi> That there are Natural Differences between good and evil, is as evident and apparent as the Difference between health and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: For as health is nothing but the right and Natural Conſtitution of all the Parts of the Body; and Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Oppreſſion, Diſtortion and Deviation from it: So is it in the Soul of Man. Its true and proper Nature, is that healthful Temper and Conſtitution wherein God at firſt Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated it: But now Sin and Evil is a forcing it into a Preternatural State, the driving it into a Diſeaſe and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and the putting its Powers and Faculties into Jarring and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. And that theſe Differences are nothing but the Vital reliſhes and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of the Soul of Man, in that double Capacity and Reſolution of Rational and Animal, or in the Sacred Dialect of the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49779:62"/>
Fleſh and Spirit, I think is as evident to any Conſidering and Judicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now this Maturity and Ripeneſs of Religion diſcovers it ſelf, 1. In a particular knowledge of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Good and Evil, ſo as to be able to diſtinguiſh what is from the Fleſh and Animal, and what from the Spirit and Rational Life. 2. In a ready Application of this to all the Paſſages of our Lives. For that <hi>Blindneſs of mind</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeaks of,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.18.</note> to which the Gentiles as a juſt Puniſhment of their former careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were given up, does fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Neceſſity of this Diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native Senſe and Diſcerning between Good and Evil. For when once the <hi>Criterion,</hi> or Perceptive Faculty has loſt its Tenderneſs and Senſibility, and the Mind becomes <hi>Reprobate,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:49779:62"/>
with greedineſs:</hi> which ſurely as it is the moſt deplorable condition the Soul of Man can fall into, ſo ought moſt carefully to be avoided by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a particular Diſtinction, and clear knowledge of the Notices, Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and Suggeſtions of the Fleſh and Spirit. And as this inward Senſe is not to be ſtifled, ſo neither to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uſeleſs and idle, but to extend it ſelf and have an Influence upon all our Actions. It muſt be fanned and kept alive by ſincere Devotion, and a conſtant and Habitual Practice of Virtue, by which at length it will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Powerful and Vital Principle, begetting in us a true reliſh of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Holineſs, that we may not only talk and maintain an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and Mechanical Religion conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Words, or the running the ſame Circle of outward Performances and Duties, but may be really rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and formed into a new Nature, and act out of choice, and from the innate Lovelineſs and Beautifulneſs of Virtue. For by bringing our Actions to this Teſt and Rule, and applying
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49779:63"/>
them to the Natural Difference and Diſtinction of Good and Evil, it will keep us from all deliberate Violations of the Laws and Preſcriptions of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. By this, Wickedneſs and Sin will appear in its Natural Dreſs and Genuine Colours, and its Uglineſs and Deformity be rendred ſo manifeſt, that our Wills and Affections will not eaſily be drawn into a Compliance with it, and the various Paſſages of our Lives freed and diſcharged from the leaſt Appearance of Evil.</p>
